500|$|As governor, Johnson {{followed}} a strict small-government approach. According to former New Mexico Republican National Committee member Mickey D. Barnett, [...] "Any time someone approached him about legislation for some purpose, his first response always {{was to ask}} <b>if</b> <b>government</b> {{should be involved in}} that to begin with." [...] He vetoed 200 of 424 bills passed in his first six months in office—a national record of 47% of all legislation—and used the line-item veto on most remaining bills. [...] In office, Johnson fulfilled his campaign promise to reduce the 10% annual growth of the state budget. [...] In his first budget, Johnson proposed a wide range of tax cuts, including a repeal of the prescription drug tax, a $47 million income tax cut, and a 6-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax cut. However, of these, only the gasoline tax cut was passed. During the November 1995 federal government shutdown, he joined 20 other Republican governors who called on the Republican leadership in Congress to stand firm against the Clinton administration in budget negotiations; in the article reporting on the letter and concomitant news conference he was quoted as calling for eliminating the budget deficit through proportional cuts across the budget. Although Johnson worked to reduce overall state spending, in his first term he raised education spending by nearly a third. [...] When drop-out rates and test scores showed little improvement, Johnson changed his tactics and began advocating school vouchers—a key issue in budget battles of his second term as governor.|$|E
40|$|While {{according}} to the so-called “Brussels-Frankfurt consensus” sound fiscal policies and structural reforms support each other, it is often claimed that the EU fiscal framework, by reducing the budgetary room of manoeuvre and the political capital of governments, may deter reforms. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore which factors determine the relation between fiscal discipline and reforms. By means of a simple model we show that, depending on the time horizon of the government, structural reforms may either be complement or substitute with fiscal discipline. <b>If</b> <b>governments</b> are forward-looking, substitution is more likely; <b>if</b> <b>governments</b> are short-sighted, reforms and fiscal discipline may become complement. We provide empirical evidence supporting this argument. In a sample of EU- 15 countries over the past three decades, the introduction of the Maastricht constraints at the beginning of the 1990 s does not seem to have affected the probability of labour market reforms on average, but had a positive and significant impact on countries with governments facing elections in the current or forthcoming year (which are hence assumed to behave myopically). Our results suggest that <b>if</b> <b>governments</b> are short-sighted, then the expectation that relaxing fiscal constraints may help to boost structural reforms may be ill-founded.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{studies the}} optimal long-run {{inflation}} rate (OIR) {{in a small}} New-Keynesian model, where the only policy instrument is a short-term nominal interest rate that may occasionally run against a zero lower bound (ZLB). The model allows for worst-case scenarios of misspecification. The analysis shows first, <b>if</b> the <b>government</b> optimally commits, the OIR is below 1 percent annually, and the policy rate is expected to hit the ZLB as often as 7 percent of the time. Second, <b>if</b> the <b>government</b> re-optimizes each period, the OIR rises markedly to 17 percent, which suggests a discretionary policymaker is willing to tolerate a very large “inflation bias ” of 16 percent to avoid hitting the ZLB. Third, <b>if</b> the <b>government</b> commits only to an inertial Taylor rule, the inflation bias is eliminated at very low cost in terms of welfare for the representative household. The analysis suggest that <b>if</b> <b>governments</b> cannot make credible commitments about future policy decisions, a 2 percent long-run inflation goal may provide inadequate insurance against the ZLB...|$|R
