The research explores the topic from an <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> organisation perspective in an interpretive multi-stage study involving six large multinational <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> businesses. Key findings reported in the paper include six categories of CSFs, and twenty-seven CSFs distributed across the six categories.

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{the present}} thesis was to {{describe}} and evaluate <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> in dementia care {{from the perspectives of}} staff and relatives. More specifically, it was to examine staff members’ satisfaction with work, life satisfaction and sense of coherence before and after increased <b>IT</b> <b>support,</b> to describe staff members’ opinions and perceptions of <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> during the process of implementation, to describe relatives’ opinions of <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> and to compare relatives’ perceptions of their irritations with care and life satisfaction before and after increased <b>IT</b> <b>support.</b> In addition, three questionnaires were further developed and tested among staff working in elderly care, and then used in the staff evaluation. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with baseline assessments and follow-ups and experimental and control groups was used in two studies to investigate the outcomes of <b>IT</b> <b>support.</b> A descriptive design was used to study staff views on <b>IT</b> <b>support,</b> and a correlative design was used in the methodological study. Participants were 33 staff members and 22 relatives in the evaluation, 14 staff members in the descriptive study and 299 staff members in the methodological study. Data collection methods were questionnaires and group interviews. The <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> consisted of passive passage alarms, fall detectors, sensor-activated night-time illumination of the lavatory, movement detectors, email communication, an Internet website and additional computers. Findings and conclusions: Staff job satisfaction and perceived quality of care increased in the experimental group. The relatives were generally positive about the <b>IT</b> <b>support,</b> and the experimental group showed a decrease in practical/logistical irritations. Staff described ‘moving from fear of losing control to perceived increase in control and security’ and ‘constant struggling with insufficient/deficient systems’. Conclusions are that <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> can be a resource in dementia care as perceived by caregivers if <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> is incorporated into the care system...|$|R

40|$|As IT {{services}} {{grow more}} and more complicated, and their management becomes increasingly challenging, <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> organizations assume an essential role to ensure the delivery of Service Level Objectives. What-if scenario analysis represents a very effective tool for the performance optimization of <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> organizations, as <b>it</b> enables an iterative and customized performance optimization process. The problem of accurately modeling <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> organizations requires the development of sophisticated models as well as dedicated parameter inference techniques and tools. This paper presents a multiple-priority queuing model suited for the reenactment of <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> groups developed from the analysis of empirical evidence, {{as well as a}} powerful method to infer the model parameters.

40|$|In IT service management, <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> {{organizations}} are the entities {{in charge of}} restoring normal service operation after a disruption.

However, the complexity of real-life <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> organizations makes <b>it</b> extremely hard to model their organizational structure and their behavior with stochastic processes.

40|$|Incident Management is {{the process}} through which <b>IT</b> <b>support</b> {{organizations}} manage to restore normal service operation after a service disruption.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} how the <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing {{of software}} production process is executed. We present essential ideas and theoretical background for our study through an in-depth literature {{review in the}} areas of subcontracting, outsourcing, international outsourcing, information technology (IT) and international software production. The literature review reveals the limitations of research on <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing of software production process. Three research questions arise in this context. (1) What are the phases of the <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing process and how these phases are executed? (2) What are the major activities in each phase of the international outsourcing process and how these activities are managed? (3) What are the performance measures and expected outcomes of each phase? The study addresses these research questions (1) by conceptualising a framework on <b>IT</b> <b>supported</b> international outsourcing of software production in the light of diffusion of innovation theory and relevant literature in the fields of outsourcing, software production and IT and (2) by conducting an empirical investigation.
