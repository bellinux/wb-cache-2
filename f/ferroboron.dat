40|$|Abstract: The {{feasibility}} of employing the indigenously developed <b>Ferroboron</b> alloy as an alternate neutron shield material {{in combination with}} 9 Cr-based ferritic steel clad in future Indian Fast Breeder Reactors (FBR), has been investigated from a metallurgical perspective. In this regard, extensive studies have been undertaken to estimate quantitatively the nature of interaction between <b>Ferroboron</b> and P 91 -ferritic steel at high temperatures. It is found that in the temperature range 550 to 600 o C, 9 Cr-based ferritic steel is fully compatible with <b>Ferroboron.</b> However, at higher temperatures, Feroboron interacts with ferritic steel; but the maximum estimated loss of clad thickness is restricted to about 250 m for 60 years of service...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe high {{temperature}} phase stability and metallurgical compatibility of Ferro boron alloy which contain about 15 wt. % boron and some impurity elements like C(0. 3),Si (0. 29), P(0. 006) etc, with 304 L SS {{have been evaluated}} using calorimetry and metallography. The X-ray diffraction of <b>ferroboron</b> revealed the presence of major FeB and minor Fe 2 B constituents, besides {{a small amount of}} Fe 3 (B, C). The thermal stability of this <b>ferroboron</b> alloy has been characterised up to melting by high resolution thermal analysis. In addition, the enthalpy increment measurements and hence specific heat estimates have been also made in the temperature range 400 - 1200 oC, using drop calorimetry. The {{high temperature}} metallurgical interaction between <b>ferroboron</b> and 304 L SS clad has been simulated at temperatures 823 – 1073 K (550 - 800 oC) for reaction times up to 5000 h, using diffusion couples...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{investigation}} of the effect of <b>ferroboron</b> and ferrochromium with massive wire based hardfacing alloys. Mixture of Fe–Cr and Fe–B powders was added to massive wire during welding process. Hardface layers were obtained by three different powder mixture and three different powder/massive wire proportions. Hardfacing was applied to two AISI 1020 steel substrates by open arc welding. Hardness test, scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction analysis were made to the samples. Test results showed that increasing <b>ferroboron</b> content and increasing powder mixture amount enhanced the microhardness of the specimens...|$|E

Two factors are found to strongly affect {{the structure and}} phase formation in composite coatings produced by electron beam surfacing, especially when using thermoreactive powders: (i) high reactive diffusion between the composite and substrate components, which causes the coating structure degradation, and (ii) slight deviations from phase concentrations and equilibrium crystallization, which give rise to such nonequilibrium phases in the coating structure under the electron beam as <b>ferroboron,</b> ferrotitanium and binary eutectics...|$|E

40|$|Lebeau and Figueras {{introduced}} {{the use of}} liquid metals as media for the synthesis of compounds. The process consists of promoting the reaction of elements by dissolving them in a metallic liquid. One method, known as the auxiliary metal bath process, or the Menstruum process, {{is used for the}} production of hard metals. Similarly, mixed carbides of WC, TiC and TaC are produced according to the so-called McKenna process. It is also possible to make silicides, nitrides, carbonitrides and some borides by the auxiliary metal bath process. However, little information is available on the production of TiB 2 in auxiliary metal bath, and the present work was undertaken to study its formation in an iron bath. The metallic baths were formed by melting mixtures of <b>ferroboron</b> and ferrotitanium powders. A characterization of the reaction products with respect to the composition of the metallic bath and the temperature of formation is presented. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} and electrochemical properties of graphitic materials precipitated from supersaturated solutions of carbon in pig iron melts were investigated. Doping of the graphite with boron {{was accomplished by}} adding <b>ferroboron</b> to the iron melt. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that all the products were highly crystalline graphites, and that doping with boron generally reduced the d 0 0 2 values, which indicated that boron was incorporated in the hexagonal graphite matrix. Boron incorporation also led to {{a break in the}} local symmetry of the graphitic structure, as evidenced by the evolution of the D-band of the Raman spectra with an increase in the boron content. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of nanocarbon structures {{on the surface of the}} graphites. The first-cycle capacity of the graphites was found to increase as the boron content was increased. However, the capacities of the boron-free and 60 ppm boron-doped materials abruptly increased in the second cycle, while the capacity of the 300 ppm boron-doped graphite remained fairly steady. All the graphites cycled well. The boron-free, 60 ppm boron-doped and the 300 ppm boron-doped graphites, sustained 198, 203 and 180 cycles, respectively, before reaching a charge retention level of 80...|$|E
