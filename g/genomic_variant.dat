50|$|The {{genotyping}} {{is generated}} using next-generation sequencing technologies (including whole-genome sequencing and exome sequencing) and microarray analyses.

These steps allow for the identification of presumed highly penetrant variants and their specific locus. The selected variants are usually resequenced for validation (by targeted Sanger sequencing). Validated genomic variants can then be analyzed for recurrences among affected individuals within the cohort. Pathogenicity of a <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> is statistically based on its significantly abundant presence in the affected compared to the unaffected individuals, not exclusively on the deleteriousness of the variant.

50|$|A {{major focus}} of RENCI’s work in the Biomedical and Health Sciences is {{clinical}} genomics. RENCI works with NC TraCS, the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at UNC-CH, and UNC’s Information Technology Services Research Computing Division {{to develop and implement}} technologies to support next-generation genomic sequencing technologies, such as Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). These technologies include the GMW (Genetic Medical Workflow) Engine, which was funded in part by the NIH and provides end-to-end capture, analysis, validation, and reporting of WGS and WES data. The GMW Engine is designed as open source architecture that coordinates workflows, sub-workflows, samples, data, and people to support all aspects of genomics research and clinical application, from the initial patient visit to the physician-guided reporting of genomic findings. MapSeq (Masively Parallel Sequencing) is an open source plugin-based Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) that provides secure management and execution of the complex downstream computational and analytical steps involved in high-throughput genomic sequencing and other data-intensive applications. MaPSeq and its homegrown sister technology, GATE (Grid Access Triage Engine), are built on top of Apache Karaf and together provide extensible capabilities for downstream analysis of genomic data and other large data sets, including workflow pipeline execution and management, meta-scheduling of workflow jobs, opportunistic use of compute resources, secure data transfer, and web-based client access. CANVAS (CAroliNa Variant Annotation Store) and AnnoBot (Annotation Bot) work together to provide version-controlled annotation and metadata for <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> data in order to support up-to-date clinical interpretation of genomic variants and thereby guide clinical decision making. CANVAS is designed as an open source, relational PostgreSQL relational database that stores <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> data with associated annotation and metadata. AnnoBot consists of Python modules and software driver code configured to provide automated monitoring and retrieval of external data sources for annotation updates. CHAT (Convergent Haplotype Association Tagging) is a software algorithm that allows for the identification of moderately penetrant genomic variants using cross-population genetic structures. CHAT invokes a graph theory-based algorithm to determine the haplotype phase of a population of unrelated individuals by: identifying subsets of individuals that share a region of the genome through descent; and then generating a consensus haplotype for the shared region. The SMW (Secure Medical Workspace) provisions a secure environment for access to sensitive patient data for clinical care or Institutional Review Board-approved clinical research. The open source SMW architecture uses virtualization technology (i.e., VMWare) and Data Leakage Protection (DLP) technology (i.e., WebSense) to create a secure virtual workspace coupled with the ability to prevent (or allow with a challenge and auditing by Information Technology staff) the physical removal of data from a central, secure storage environment.|$|E

Using information on variants, we developed a new method, the CGH array reference-free algorithm (CARA), which can determine reference-unbiased absolute CNVs from any CGH array platform.

In the past 10 years, numerous human <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> have been discovered and catalogued, mostly through the efforts of the International HapMap project and personal genome studies [1]. Information on human <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> may serve as a valuable resource for developing personalized medicine because some of these variants could potentially predispose humans to complex diseases. The 2009 version (version 130) of the dbSNP database included approximately 13. 9 million (13. 9 M) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 4. 5 M small insertions and deletions (indels). However, many issues need to be addressed before personalized medicine becomes a reality.

Twenty-one stool specimens from children with gastroenteritis, with adenovirus particles visible by electron microscopy, and reference strains Ad 40 Dugan and Ad 41 Tak were tested by Ad 40 - and Ad 41 -specific and adenovirus group-reactive immunoassays. All stool specimens tested positive in the group-reactive immunoassay. However, only six specimens, containing isolates of Ad 40 strain Hovi-X, an Ad 40 <b>genomic</b> <b>variant,</b> and Ad 41 strain Tak, reacted with the specific immunoassay, besides the reference strains.

40|$|Background: Genome-wide {{association}} {{studies have}} identified numerous common <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> {{associated with increased}} susceptibility to melanoma, but there is limited knowledge about the utility of adding them to risk prediction models for melanoma. Aim: To evaluate the contribution of common <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> to melanoma risk prediction, among young Australian adults. Methods: The sample included 552 cases with invasive cutaneous melanoma diagnosed between ages 18 – 39 years and 405 controls from an Australian population-based, case-control-family study. MC 1 R genotype was sequenced, and through a genome-wide association study we obtained genotype data for single nucleotide polymorphisms from 18 selected gene regions. Measures of discriminatory accuracy included the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and net reclassification improvement (NRI), calculated based on predicted probabilities of melanoma from unconditional logistic regression models. We used 10 -fold cross-validation and bootstrap methods to assess internal validation. Results: Compared to a demographic model containing age, sex and city of recruitment (AUC 0. 69; 95 % CI 0. 65 – 0. 72), the combined contribution to the AUC of common <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> {{was the same as}} that contributed from traditional self-reported risk factors for melanoma (UV exposure, pigmentation phenotype, nevi, etc) – both AUCs increased to 0. 77 (95 % CI 0. 74 – 0. 80). An inclusive model containing demographic, genetic and nongenetic (traditional) risk factors had an AUC of 0. 81 (95 % CI 0. 78 – 0. 84). Inclusion of <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> in the multivariate model improved the quartile classification of predicted risk (NRI) by a net 17 % (95 % CI 9 – 24) compared to the non-genetic (traditional) model. Conclusions: Our results suggest that common <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> could considerably improve risk prediction models for early-onset melanoma, and may have a role in primary prevention of melanoma. We are commencing pilot studies to translate these findings into potential cancer prevention strategies in general practice and in the community. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Anogenital warts (AGW) are {{the most}} common benign tumors in the {{anogenital}} area. They are etiologically associated with alpha human papillomaviruses (HPV), in more than 90 % of cases with HPV- 6 and HPV- 11. AGW frequently displays a multifocal and multicentric appearance. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the occurrence of multiple AGW in a particular patient is a consequence of infection with single or multiple HPV genomic variants of a given HPV genotype. Methods: Forty-five HPV- 6 isolates from fresh-frozen AGW tissue specimens, obtained from 18 patients with concurrent multiple AGW, were included. The entire HPV- 6 L 1, E 5 a, E 5 b ORFs, and LCR genomic region was sequenced. Results: Fourteen different HPV- 6 L 1 -LCR-E 5 a-E 5 b genomic variants were identified among 18 patients with concurrent multiple AGW. In 17 out of 18 patients, a single identical HPV- 6 L 1 -E 5 a-E 5 b-LCR <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> was identified in all concurrent multiple AGW collected in an individual patient. Co-infection with two different HPV- 6 genomic variants was identified in one patient. Discussion: The presence of an identical HPV <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> in all concurrently present multiple AGW within an individual patient supports the hypothesis that the occurrence of multiple concurrent AGW is a consequence of infection with a single HPV- 6 <b>genomic</b> <b>variant,</b> rather than infection with multiple genomic variants of HPV- 6...|$|E

40|$|Exploring the {{relation}} between genotype and phenotype is essential in understanding the mechanisms underlying human complex diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Studying these type of diseases in human is difficult due to fluctuations in environmental influences and their heterozygous genomes. Therefore we here use inbred rat as an animal model for human complex diseases to study the role of genomic variation in disease phenotypes. Technical advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) make it now possible to produce large-scale datasets of genomes, transcriptomes, chromatin status and many more other applications. In this thesis work is described that assesses the use of NGS-based applications in rat functional genomic research {{as a tool to}} identify and molecularly characterize <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> in complex traits. First (Chapter 2) we collect and catalogue the genomic variation present in 40 widely used rat inbred strains and we use this inventory to characterize the presence and properties of genomic substrain variation. Next (Chapter 3) we use this inventory in an outbred breeding of 1600 + rats to map Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) of 160 phenotypes with high resolution, providing starting points to directly investigate {{the relation}} of candidate <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> with a given phenotype. Since most candidate variants reside outside protein coding regions, we set out to explore (Chapter 4) the effect of these noncoding variants on molecular phenotypes. We found that the <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> can act in a multi-level fashion and over large distance. Besides studying the relation of <b>genomic</b> <b>variants</b> in complex traits, we also molecularly characterize part of a complex trait: cancer; by investigating tumors in a Tp 53 knockout rat model (Chapter 5). Interestingly we found, in contrast with the current p 53 dogma, that the tumors of homozygous Tp 53 -/- rats were genomically stable and we thus conclude that the mere loss of functional p 53 is not sufficient to induce large-scale genomic instability.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the clinical features and outcome of acute lower respiratory infection associated with different adenovirus genotypes in children. Methods Twenty-four cases of acute lower respiratory infection and adenovirus diagnosis reported in a pediatric unit during a two-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Adenovirus was detected by antigen detection and isolation in HEp- 2 cells. Adenovirus DNA from 17 isolates was studied by restriction enzyme analysis with Bam HI and Sma I. Results Subgenus b was found in 82. 3 % of the cases, and subgenus c in 17. 7 %. Within subgenus b, only genotype 7 was detected, with <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> 7 h in 85. 7 % (12 / 14) and <b>genomic</b> <b>variant</b> 7 i in 14. 3 % (2 / 14). Mean age was 8. 8 ±; 6 months, and male to female ratio was 3. 8 : 1. At admission, pneumonia was observed in 71 % of the cases and bronchiolitis in 29 %. Malnutrition occurred in 37 % of the cases; tachypnea in 79 %; chest indrawing in 66 %; wheezing in 58 %; apneas in 16 %; and conjunctivitis in 29 %. Blood cultures for bacteria and antigen detection of other respiratory viruses were negative. During hospitalization, fatality rate was 16. 7 % (4 / 24). Of the patients who died, three had Ad 7 h and one Ad 7 i. Thus, fatality rate for adenovirus type 7 reached 28. 6 % (4 / 14).
