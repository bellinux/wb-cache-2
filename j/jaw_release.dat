50|$|Belongs to the Dead is {{the debut}} album by American indie rock band Tigers <b>Jaw,</b> <b>released</b> on October 3, 2006 through Summersteps Records. The album was {{recorded}} on recording rig in an attic. The album was re-mastered in 2012 and released by Run for Cover Records.|$|R
50|$|Reception {{towards the}} film was {{unfavorable}} by critics and audiences alike due to its similarities to <b>Jaws,</b> <b>released</b> two years prior. Upon release the film received only minor theatrical success, {{but in recent years}} the film has achieved a cult following among fans of the natural horror subgenre.|$|R
5|$|Jaws 2 was {{followed}} by <b>Jaws</b> 3-D and , <b>released</b> in 1983 and 1987, respectively.|$|R
50|$|When <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released</b> on June 20, 1975, {{it opened}} at 464 theaters. The release was {{subsequently}} expanded on July 25 {{to a total}} of 675 theaters, the largest simultaneous distribution of a film in motion picture history at the time. During the first weekend of wide <b>release,</b> <b>Jaws</b> grossed more than $7 million, and was the top grosser for the following five weeks. During its run in theaters, the film became the first to reach more than $100 million in U.S. box office receipts. Jaws eventually grossed more than $470 million worldwide ($ billion in 2010 dollars) and was the highest grossing box office film until Star Wars debuted two years later.|$|R
50|$|The Frisbee and Hula Hoop created fads. Other {{products}} {{tried to}} take advantage of existing national trends. In the 1960s, Wham-O came out with a US$119 do-it-yourself bomb shelter cover. In 1962, they sold a limbo dance kit {{to take advantage of}} that fad, and in 1975 when the movie <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released,</b> they sold plastic shark teeth.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, {{the band}} {{released}} a video {{for the first}} promotional single [...] "Dust It Off". Their second album entitled Both Ways Open <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released</b> {{in some parts of}} Europe on Monday, 7 March 2011, and in France on Wednesday, 9 March 2011. Beginning late October and ending in mid-November, the album was released worldwide.|$|R
5000|$|William Goldman was {{approached}} {{to write the}} script, but chose not to do so, as Ilya Salkind had personally cited certain creative differences with Goldman. Eventually, Ilya would hire Godfather author Mario Puzo. The desperate search for a director then took place. Steven Spielberg expressed high interest and Salkind felt comfortable in hiring him upon being impressed with his work on Duel and The Sugarland Express, though his father was skeptical, feeling that Spielberg was not famous enough and claimed they needed to wait until [...] "that fish movie of his" [...] was <b>released.</b> <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released</b> with unanimous success, though by {{this time it was}} too late as Spielberg opted to do Close Encounters of the Third Kind instead.|$|R
50|$|Despite being panned critically, {{the movie}} {{had some success}} {{attracting}} attention from social media due to its fantastical premise, with websites such as Vulture.com commenting on moments from the film. A supposed sequel, Ghost Shark 2: Urban <b>Jaws,</b> was <b>released</b> on 1 July 2015, but the two movies are unrelated in terms of narrative other than both being films featuring killer sharks.|$|R
50|$|On August 11, 2015, Enemkpali {{got into}} an altercation with quarterback Geno Smith {{in the locker room}} {{regarding}} $600 Smith allegedly owed Enemkpali. Enemkpali punched Smith in his face, fracturing his <b>jaw.</b> The Jets <b>released</b> Enemkpali shortly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|Benante {{is an avid}} fan of the 1975 film Jaws, {{and owns}} a {{sizeable}} collection of the film's merchandise. He was featured in the documentary The Shark Is Still Working, which was included on the <b>Jaws</b> 2012 Blu-ray <b>release.</b>|$|R
500|$|Universal Studios Home Entertainment <b>released</b> <b>Jaws</b> 2 on Blu-ray in 2016. [...] The Blu-ray {{contains}} most of {{the bonus}} materials from the 2001 DVD release, {{with the exception of}} the text based bonus features, the galleries, and the trailers for the three other Jaws films.|$|R
5|$|Film {{producers}} Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown {{read the}} novel before its publication {{and bought the}} film rights, selecting Steven Spielberg to direct the film adaptation. The <b>Jaws</b> film, <b>released</b> in June 1975, omitted many of the novel's minor subplots, focusing more on the shark and the characterizations of the three protagonists. Jaws became the highest-grossing movie in history up to that point, becoming a watershed film in motion picture history {{and the father of}} the summer blockbuster film. Three sequels followed the film.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{above-mentioned}} exceptions was a 1986 {{release of the}} film for the now-obsolete VHD video disc system (not {{to be confused with}} LaserDisc). This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarised 3D effect to work. The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of <b>Jaws</b> 3-D <b>released</b> in February 2008. The Sensio 3D Processor is needed for 3D home viewing.|$|R
5000|$|Appaloosa had 100 {{employees}} as of January 2001, and had produced over 150 video games {{up to that}} point, {{many of which were}} released exclusively in Europe. At that time, Friedman said, [...] "In all the years we have been in business, we have only failed to complete a project because of our own inability once or twice." [...] Appaloosa's final game was <b>Jaws</b> Unleashed, <b>released</b> in 2006, and based on the Jaws series of films. The company ceased operations in 2006. Several of its developers moved on to Mithis Entertainment.|$|R
5|$|<b>Jaws</b> {{was first}} <b>released</b> on DVD in 2000 for the film's 25th anniversary, {{accompanied}} by a massive publicity campaign. It featured a 50-minute documentary on {{the making of the}} film (an edited version of the one featured on the 1995 LaserDisc release), with interviews with Spielberg, Scheider, Dreyfuss, Benchley, and other cast and crew members. Other extras included deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, production photos, and storyboards. The DVD shipped one million copies in just one month. In June 2005, a 30th-anniversary edition was released at the JawsFest festival in Martha's Vineyard. The new DVD had many extras seen in previous home video releases, including the full two-hour Bouzereau documentary, and a previously unavailable interview with Spielberg conducted on the set of Jaws in 1974. On the second JawsFest in August 2012, the Blu-ray Disc of <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released,</b> with over four hours of extras, including The Shark Is Still Working. The Blu-ray release was part of the celebrations of Universal's 100th anniversary, and debuted at fourth place in the charts, with over 362,000 units sold.|$|R
50|$|Charmer is {{the fourth}} {{full-length}} by American indie rock band Tigers <b>Jaw.</b> It was <b>released</b> on June 3, 2014, on Run For Cover Records. Former members Adam McIlwee, Dennis Mishko and Pat Brier {{were included in the}} recording of the album despite no longer being a part of the band.|$|R
50|$|The {{paucity of}} storylines was {{also evident in}} {{that two of the}} seven comic book {{appearances}} by Q Force included sequences where sharks were exploded by hand grenades, in a likely homage to the shark's demise in the <b>Jaws</b> 3-D movie <b>released</b> in 1983, {{around the time of the}} comic book story.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} soundtrack for <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released</b> on LP by MCA in 1975, {{and as a}} CD in 1992, including {{roughly a}} half-hour of music that John Williams redid for the album. In 2000, {{two versions of the}} score were released: one in a re-recording of the entire Jaws score by Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Joel McNeely, and another to coincide with the release of the 25th anniversary DVD by Decca/Universal, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score. In 2005, it was ranked No.6 in AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores, a list which compiles the greatest American film scores.|$|R
50|$|On January 27, 2015, Kevin {{announced}} Devinyl Splits, a six-part split series featuring {{artists such}} as Matthew Caws, Meridith Graves of Perfect Pussy, and Tigers <b>Jaw</b> to be <b>released</b> on Bad Timing Records.Devinyl Splits No. 1: Matthew Caws x Kevin Devine will be released February 24. The remaining five splits will be released every other month in April, June, August, October, December.|$|R
5|$|MCA Home Video first <b>released</b> <b>Jaws</b> on VHS in 1980. For the film's 20th {{anniversary in}} 1995, MCA Universal Home Video issued a new Collector's Edition tape {{featuring}} a making-of retrospective. This release sold 800,000 units in North America. Another, final VHS release, marking the film's 25th anniversary in 2000, {{came with a}} companion tape containing a documentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a trailer.|$|R
50|$|He was {{originally}} cast in The Deer Hunter, the second movie of a three-movie deal with Universal Studios. However, despite being under contract, Scheider dropped out {{two weeks before}} the start of filming. Universal offered him the option of reprising his role as Martin Brody for a Jaws sequel, and would consider his contractual obligations fulfilled if he accepted. Scheider accepted, and <b>Jaws</b> 2 was <b>released</b> in 1978.|$|R
50|$|Jaws Unleashed is a 2006 action {{video game}} {{inspired}} by the 1975 film Jaws. It was developed by Appaloosa Interactive and published by Majesco Entertainment. The game features open world gameplay, with the player being able to roam freely throughout the water, feeding on other animals and even on humans; all the while destroying everything in its path. <b>Jaws</b> Unleashed was <b>released</b> for Microsoft Windows, Xbox and PlayStation 2.|$|R
500|$|Spielberg {{later said}} that without Williams's score the film {{would have been}} only half as successful, and {{according}} to Williams it jumpstarted his career. He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, The Sugarland Express, {{and went on to}} collaborate with the director on almost all of his films. The original soundtrack for <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released</b> by MCA Records on LP in 1975, [...] and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album. In 2000, two versions of the score were released: Decca/Universal reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score, and Varèse Sarabande put out a rerecording of the score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, conducted by Joel McNeely.|$|R
40|$|Osteonecrosis of {{the jaws}} (ONJ) in {{osteoporosis}} patients {{has been defined}} as rare, but the number of reported cases is increasing. We report a case of delayed ONJ diagnosis in a patient, who was being treated with alendronate, developing bone alterations both in maxilla and in mandible. Underestimation of ONJ incidence and missed or delayed ONJ diagnosis in osteoporosis patients might derive from lack of awareness of health providers as well as from an ONJ definition that is too restricted. The more recent definition of medication-related osteonecrosis of the <b>jaws</b> (MRONJ) <b>released</b> in 2014 by the American Association of Oral Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS) accept fistula, besides bone exposure, as a major sign of disease, but it seems to be insufficient since it excludes all cases of ONJ disease without bone exposure. A new MRONJ definition is needed to avoid missing or delayed diagnosis...|$|R

5000|$|The seventh-season episode [...] "Living Legend" [...] {{established}} that Willows was 16 years old (portrayed by Amy Scott) in 1975, {{the year the}} movie <b>Jaws</b> was <b>released,</b> which places her year of birth in either 1958 or 1959. She had occasional contact with her biological father, casino owner Sam Braun, but knew him only as a family friend. Sam Braun nicknamed her [...] "Muggs". She did not learn he had fathered her until she was an adult and compared his DNA sample with her own {{as part of a}} murder investigation in the episode [...] "Inside the Box". Willows herself worked for a time as a dancer/stripper and briefly had a cocaine habit, dropping it before pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Medical Technology from UNLV. Like the other characters on CSI, she has a wide knowledge of odd facts that help in their investigations of crime scenes.|$|R
5000|$|Tigers Jaw is {{the second}} {{full-length}} by American emo band Tigers <b>Jaw.</b> It was <b>released</b> on September 10, 2008, as the band's first album to be released through Prison Jazz. It was then released on vinyl in October 2009 through Photobooth, before a reissue through Run for Cover on August 3, 2010. The songs [...] "Heat", [...] "Meals on Wheels" [...] and [...] "The Sun" [...] are all re-recorded songs from the band's debut album Belongs to the Dead, with [...] "Okay Paddy" [...] having its name changed to [...] "Meals on Wheels".|$|R
60|$|Heaven put a last {{expedient}} into my head, that I {{had once}} heard Mr. Dulany speak of. I braced {{myself for a}} pull that should have broken the stallion's <b>jaw</b> and <b>released</b> his mouth altogether. Incredible as it may seem, he jarred into a trot, and presently came down to a walk, tossing his head like fury, and sweating at every pore. I leaned over and patted him, speaking him fair, and (marvel of marvels!) when we had got to the dogs that guard the entrance of Camden House I had coaxed him around and into the street, and cantered back at easy speed to the church. Without pausing {{to speak to the}} bunch that stood at the throat of the lane, I started toward London, thankfulness and relief swelling within me. I understood the beast, and spoke to him when he danced aside at a wagon with bells or a rattling load of coals, and checked him with a word and a light hand.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of video game {{releases}} based upon the franchise. The first, titled <b>Jaws,</b> was <b>released</b> for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1987. There was a separate computer adaptation of the original Jaws movie called Jaws: The Computer Game, released in 1989 by Screen 7 for the Commodore Amiga and other computers; another unrelated Jaws for the Commodore 64 and other computers was released by Box Office Software the same year. A Jaws level was featured in the 2001 game Universal Studios Theme Parks Adventure by Kemco for the Nintendo Gamecube. Jaws Unleashed, developed by Appaloosa Interactive, was released in 2006 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and PC platforms. An officially licensed iPhone game based on the original film was released by Bytemark Games and Universal Partnerships & Licensing in 2010, while in 2011 Universal licensed a follow -up game (in the form of an App) called Jaws Revenge. This game was made by Fuse Powered Inc. A game titled Jaws: Ultimate Predator was released on the Wii and Nintendo 3DS in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{novelisation}} of The Spy Who Loved Me, Wood specifically {{states that}} Jaws is a mute. However, though Jaws remains mute in Wood's James Bond and Moonraker novelisation, he actually does {{speak at the}} end of the film. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond <b>releases</b> <b>Jaws</b> from the magnet into the water: [...] "Now both hands were tearing at the magnet, and Jaws twisted furiously like a fish on the hook. As Bond watched in fascinated horror, a relentless triangle streaked up behind the stricken giant. A huge gray force launched itself through the wild water, and two rows of white teeth closed around the threshing flesh." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1980, MCA Home Video (then {{known as}} MCA Videocassette Inc.) <b>released</b> <b>Jaws</b> 2 on VHS and Laserdisc, {{following}} its 1980 theatrical re-release. In the 1990s, MCA-Universal Home Video reissued it on both formats. The film received a DVD release on May 22, 2001. Many reviewers praised {{it for the}} quantity of special features, with DVD Authority asserting that it had [...] "more {{than a lot of}} titles labeled as 'special edition' discs". It includes a 45-minute documentary produced by Laurent Bouzereau, who is responsible for many of the documentaries about Universal's films. Actor Keith Gordon reminisces in a short feature, and Szwarc explains the phonetic problem with its original French title, Les Dents de la mer 2, as it sounded like it ended with the expletive merde (mer deux). This was combated by using the suffix Part 2.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that both {{releases}} gathered impressive critical success, the band was dropped from Tooth and Nail Records in 2003 after the second record. Fine China decided to take a short break, but reunited in 2004. At this time Block decided to leave the band. The band recorded its final record, <b>Jaws</b> of Life <b>released</b> on September 6, 2005, as a three-piece with guest appearances by Dooley, with a local label Common Wall Media. The record achieved more critical acclaim, including several TV show inclusions. However, the members felt that this was the time to end and the band informally dissolved following its Best of New Times performance in 2006. Withem went on to form the Foxglove Hunt with Ronnie Martin of Joy Electric, while the remaining members have stayed largely inactive in the music scene.|$|R
50|$|Gert Ledig, {{son of a}} merchant, {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in Vienna. From 1929 he lived in Leipzig. After finishing school, he held down a number of casual jobs from 1936 onwards. After this, he entered an apprenticeship to become an electrician and also studied at a private acting school to become a director. In 1939, he volunteered for the German army (Wehrmacht). As a pioneer, he took part in fighting at the Western Front, advanced to NCO and {{was transferred to the}} Eastern Front in 1941. Due to alleged misconduct he was transferred to a penal battalion. In summer 1942, Ledig was wounded before Leningrad; he suffered, among other injuries, an injury to his <b>jaw.</b> After being <b>released</b> from the army, he trained to become a shipbuilding engineer. In the last year of the war he worked in the naval forces bureaucracy.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} Jaws led to three sequels, {{and the four}} films {{together}} have earned nearly $800 million worldwide in box office gross. The franchise has also seen the release of various soundtrack albums, additional novelizations based on the sequels, trading cards, inspired theme park rides at Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Japan, multiple video games, and a musical that premiered in 2004. Although the first film was popular with critics when it was originally <b>released,</b> <b>Jaws</b> 2 received generally mixed reception, and {{the third and fourth}} films were critically panned. This reception has spread to the merchandise, with video games seen as poor imitations of the original concept. Nevertheless, the original 1975 film has generally been {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films ever, and frequently appears in the top 100 of various American Film Institute rankings.|$|R

60|$|The man {{drew the}} weapon {{from his pocket}} and {{approached}} the two antagonists, but by this time they were moving so rapidly that there was no opportunity for shooting one without the danger of hitting the other. At the same time Bertha Kircher circled about them with the prince's saber, but neither could she find an opening. Again and again the two men fell to the floor, until presently Tarzan found a hold upon the other's throat, against which contingency Metak had been constantly battling, and slowly, as the giant fingers closed, the other's mad eyes protruded from his livid face, his <b>jaws</b> gaped and <b>released</b> their hold upon Tarzan's shoulder, and then in a sudden excess of disgust and rage the ape-man lifted the body of the prince high above his head and with all the strength of his great arms hurled it across the room and through the window where it fell with a sickening thud into the pit of lions beneath.|$|R
