40|$|The ASB {{review of}} the structures, systems, and {{components}} (SSC) {{to be protected from}} internally generated missiles (inside containment) to assure conformance with the requirements of General Design Criterion 4 includes all SSC within the contain-ment and the containment itself. The review includes internally generated missiles associated with component overspeed failures, missiles that could originate from high energy fluid system failures, and missiles due to gravitational effects. The ASB with the requested assistance of the Containment Systems Branch (CSB) and the Reactor Systems Branch (RSB) reviews the functional operations and performance requirements for structures, systems,'and components inside containment and identi-fies which of the operations are necessary for the safe shutdown of the reactor facility {{in the event of an}} accident or other circumstances that might result in an <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> <b>missile,</b> or for the mitigation of the effects of loss-of-coolant or other accidents. Safety-related SSC are reviewed with respect to their capability to perform functions required for attaining and maintaining a safe shut-down condition during such accident conditions. The review of <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> <b>missile</b> protection includes the following: 1. Structures, systems or portion of systems, and components requiring protection from internally generated missiles and the methods of protection provided against such missiles. 2. Credible primary missiles including, valve hardware, retaining bolts, relief valves parts, instrument wells and reactor vessel seal rings (PWR). 3.

40|$|The ASB reviews all structures, systems, and {{components}} (SSC) provided {{to support the}} reactor facility that require protection from internally generated missiles (outside containment) to assure conformance {{with the requirements of}} General Design Criterion 4. The review concerns missiles that could result from in-plant compo-nent overspeed failures and high-pressure system ruptures. The ASB reviews the functional operations and performance requirements for all structures, systems, {{and components}} outside containment and identifies the SSC that are necessary for the safe shutdown of the reactor facility and the SSC whose fail-ure could result in a significant release of radioactivity. All SSC will be re-viewed to assure adequate protection from internally generated missiles if the SSC are necessary to perform functions required for attaining and maintaining-a safe shutdown condition or if the SSC are necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The review of <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> <b>missile</b> protection includes the following: structures, systems or portion of systems, and components that require protection from internally generated missiles are identified; pressurized components and systems are reviewed to determine their potential for generating missiles such as valve bonnets and hardware retaining bolts, relief valve parts, and instrument wells; high speed rotating machinery are reviewed to determine their potential for generating missiles from component overspeed or failure, such as failure of the pump itself (resulting from seizure), pump or component parts, and rotating seg-ments (e. g., impellers and fan blades). If safety-related systems or components are located in areas containing nonsafety-related SSC, then the nonsafety-related SSC are reviewed with respect to interna...|$|E

The quantity of new fuel to be stored varies from plant to plant, depending upon the specific design of the plant and. the individual refueling requirements. The ASB verifies that the storage facility maintains the new fuel in a subcritical array during all credible storage conditions in accordance with General Design Criteria 2, 5, 61, and 62. The ASB reviews the new fuel storage facility design including the fuel assembly storage racks and storage vault {{with respect to the}} following: 1. The quantity of fuel to be stored. 2. The design and arrangement of the storage racks for maintaining a subcritical array during all storage conditions. 3. The degree of subcriticality, and the supporting analysis and associated assumptions. 4. The effects of external loads and forces on the new fuel storage racks and vault (e. g., safe shutdown earthquake, crane uplift forces). 5. The effects of sharing in multi-unit complexes, and failures of other plant equipment close to the new storage facility. 6. ASB also performs the following reviews under the SRP sections indicated.

The directivity of the <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> noise was assumed to be the same statically as that given in the NASA interim prediction method for core engine noise. However, it was assumed that in flight <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> noise is subject to the convective amplification effect of a simple source. The absolute levels of <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> noise were obtained from an empirical fit of some typical engine data.

The population of study comprises the Total Tax Revenue Before TIN (TRBT), Total Tax Revenue After TIN (TRAT), <b>Internally</b> <b>Generated</b> Revenue Before TIN (IGRBT) and <b>Internally</b> <b>Generated</b> Revenue After TIN (IGRAT). A number of statistical tools including tables and Regression were used to analysed the data and tests the hypotheses formulated.

40|$|Background and problem: The {{treatment}} of <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands has for long been under discussion. The different opinions represented by accountants and marketers show {{the gap between}} {{those who believe that}} <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands should be recognized on the balance sheet and those who believe they should not. Purpose: The purpose of the study is to gain further insight within the field of brand assets and draw conclusions that might provide guidance in further development of the legal and norm setting environment. Further, the purpose is to point out aspects on international brand recognition to be able to recognize <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands. The thesis will provide answers to the question why an asset, often a company’s most important asset, is not an asset. Delimitations: This thesis takes on the international discussion on brands as assets and brand recognition. Therefore, the research is not limited geographically and there is no intention to scrutinize any legislation on any local or national level. This limits the discussion to concern and approach to the international norm-setting and legal environment. The research focuses on the perceptions on <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands as assets and on global brand valuation method. Methodology: This research is conducted in a qualitative way, using both an exploratory and a descriptive approach. The gathered material consists mainly of interviews, with further input from articles, journals and publications. Interview persons were chosen mainly for their participation in relevant business articles on the subject. Results and conclusions: The research shows that the general opinion is that <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands should be recognized, as well as acquired brands, but that there are difficulties related to this process. There must be possibility to measure such assets with reasonable certainty. Many argue {{that there should be a}} shift towards a harmonization regarding international brand valuation. This is argued to ease the comparability of <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands. Suggestions for further research: It would be interesting to bring forward further research on what it would mean to companies to include <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> brands on their balance sheet. This could be done by looking deeper into the comment letters on IAS 38, as these letters vary in critique and come from different countries...|$|R

40|$|Funding {{strategy}} {{has often been}} the determinant factor {{in the level of}} success for social entrepreneurships. The strategy could be a preference for <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> revenue, externally generated revenue or a combination of the two. Interestingly, scarcity of resources has always been ‘a clog in the wheel’ of meaningful execution of projects irrespective of the funding model a social entrepreneur chooses. Through a review of existing literatures, this paper weighs the implications of choosing either externally <b>generated</b> revenue or <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> revenue; specifically contextualizing the study to US. More so, it attempts to find out which of the two models would ensure optimum productivity, given that scarcity of resources would hamper the chances of effectively running the two models simultaneously. To arrive at a ‘plausible’ response, principles of resource valuation become vital in determining the costs and benefits associated with each model of funding. Consequently, the findings show that though both <b>internally</b> and externally <b>generated</b> revenue are sine qua non to an effective and efficient production of social values, <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> revenue ensures better optimum production than externally generated revenue...|$|R

40|$|Although environment-driven {{learning}} can explain much of postnatal neural development, substantial organization and functional ability is present even at birth. Recent experimental discoveries of widespread spontaneous neural activity suggest that prenatal development may utilize very similar mechanisms and principles as postnatal learning, driven by <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> sources {{instead of the}} environment. This chapter shows how this idea can explain features of the organization and function of the primary visual cortex (V 1) and higher level face-processing areas. Specifically, we simulate how neural preferences for contour orientation and human faces can develop prenatally from <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> activity and postnatally from natural image stimuli. These simulations are based on HLISSOM, a hierarchical self-organizing model {{of the development of}} topographic neural maps. The results match experimental neuroimaging and psychophysical data from newborn and older animals and humans, and provide concrete predictions about infant behavior and neural activity for future experiments. They also suggest that combining <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> activity with a learning algorithm is an efficient way to develop complex neural machinery. ...|$|R

40|$|Projects are {{important}} to society, and yet they often fail. This is despite the application of widely accepted project management standards, training, and processes. In this context, there is growing awareness that projects are often highly complex and therefore cannot be managed effectively solely by using process-based project management techniques. An alternative approach is now emerging, and that is recognising {{and dealing with the}} dynamic complexity, feedback and uncertainty inherent in most large projects today. When a project does fail, it follows that there has also been a failure in the management of risks to the project. Given this, it is possible to obtain insight into failures in complex projects by investigating how risk is managed. During this research, the management of <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> risks in projects was of particular interest. These are the risks that projects create for themselves by the way they are set up or operate. If it is established that such risks are common, important and not well managed, it could provide valuable insight into why projects fail. Nine complex projects were investigated to identify, document and analyse <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> risks to their success. Using data gathered from workshops and confidential interviews, five hypotheses were tested to understand the role played by <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> risks in projects. A key part of the research method was the use of risk maps, an adapted form of cause-and-effect diagrams, {{as the basis for the}} dialogue necessary to create a shared understanding of each risk. Statistically significant results were obtained to support the conclusion that <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> risks are common in complex projects, have the potential to significantly impact upon project success, and yet are generally poorly managed. It was also concluded that <b>internally</b> <b>generated</b> risks {{are important}} as a class of project risk, with potentially large impacts upon the success or otherwise of complex projects. Given this, further research to better understand how such risks arise and how they can be recognised and managed is appropriate...|$|R
