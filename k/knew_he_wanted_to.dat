25|$|Weston {{was born}} in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a {{photographer}} from an early age, and initially his work {{was typical of the}} soft focus pictorialism that was popular at the time. Within a few years, however, he abandoned that style and went on {{to be one of the}} foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images.|$|E

25|$|Filming for Scream 3 {{began on}} July 6, 1999 {{in and around}} Hollywood, Los Angeles, {{in the areas of}} San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silverlake, with a $40 million budget and wrapped on September 29, 1999. The {{isolated}} home of Campbell's character is situated in Topanga Canyon and Cox's character is introduced in a classroom at UCLA. A scene where Campbell's character is pursued through movie set replicas of locations from Scream was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> revisit the original film in some way, after which they wrote the scene around the set. Due to the constantly changing script used for the film, which would often be usable on the day of filming, the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that, should the script again change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date. In particular, the opening scene had three variants and the three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two-hours of filmed footage. The ending too was refilmed in January 2000, three months after principal photography finished, adding in the character of Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) and having Campbell's character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily. So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey's character, one with him absent, one with his arm in bandages and one with him in a normal condition as they were unsure of what his fate would be.|$|E
500|$|The young Max {{was exposed}} to music early on, {{attending}} Broadway shows weekly {{from the age of}} two and liking the big sound put forth by the pit orchestras. He then liked the rhythms of country and western music. He <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a drummer from the age of five, when he saw Elvis Presley and his drummer, D. J. Fontana, appear on The Milton Berle Show in April 1956. Decades later, Weinberg said, [...] "I think anybody who wanted to develop a life in rock 'n' roll music had a moment. That was my moment," [...] and Fontana became a major influence on him.|$|E
500|$|After leading Charles M. Russell High School in Great Falls, Montana to the 1992 Montana state title, he {{considered}} playing college football as a linebacker at the University of Miami. He {{chose to be}} a quarterback for the Washington State Cougars instead after head coach Mike Price, who had coached longtime New England Patriots starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, called {{him on the phone}} while Leaf was watching the Rose Bowl, and told him [...] "If you come here, we're going there" [...] even though Washington State had not reached the Rose Bowl since 1931. Leaf told Sports Illustrated that he immediately <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> accept a scholarship and play for Price.|$|E

500|$|As {{his acting}} career began to consume his schedule, Radcliffe {{continued}} his education through on-set tutors. He admitted {{he was not}} very good at school, considering it useless and finding the work [...] "really difficult." [...] He achieved A grades in the three AS-level exams that he took in 2006, but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university. Part of his reasoning was that he already <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> act and write, {{and that it would be}} difficult to have a normal college experience. [...] "The paparazzi, they'd love it," [...] he told Details magazine in 2007. [...] "If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Seeley's series Hack/Slash through Image Comics, {{publisher}} Eric Stephenson suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested setting a story {{in a small town}} so he could write about the kind of crimes that happen in a place where people prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt The Walking Dead had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for Revival. They pitched the series as Fargo meets The Walking Dead, using the terms [...] "Rural Noir" [...] and [...] "Farm Noir" [...] to describe the hardboiled detective story set in a small town.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his fight}} with Vargas, Trinidad moved up in weight – {{this time to}} {{participate}} in Don King's middleweight unification tournament featuring IBF champion Bernard Hopkins, WBA champion William Joppy, and WBC champion Keith Holmes. Trinidad was matched with Joppy, whom he defeated by technical knockout in the fifth round of a contest that took place on May 12, 2001. Joppy opened the first round on the offensive, but late in the round Trinidad scored a knockdown {{with a combination of}} punches that came close to throwing Joppy underneath the ropes. Trinidad subsequently scored a knockdown in the fourth round, during this stage of the competition he was using combinations of left hooks and right punches to the head. In the fifth round Trinidad scored another knockdown, Joppy attempted to continue the fight, but while he was using the ropes to help him stand, the referee stopped the fight. When the contest was over, Trinidad explained his strategy by stating: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> impose his will, his weight, and I wouldn't let him do it".|$|E

500|$|Ripken {{was born}} in Havre de Grace, Maryland, the son of Violet [...] "Vi" [...] Ripken (née Roberta) and Cal Ripken Sr. He has German, English, and Irish ancestry. Though the Ripkens called Aberdeen, Maryland, their home, they were often on the move because of Cal Sr.'s {{coaching}} duties with the Baltimore Orioles organization. Cal Sr., in fact, was in Topeka, Kansas {{with one of his}} teams when his son was born. Cal Jr. grew up around baseball and got started in it at a very young age. He was able to receive instruction from players on his father's teams, notably Doug DeCinces. He also got advice from his father, who once remarked to his mother that his questions were better than the ones reporters had. At the age of three, Ripken <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be a ballplayer and, at the age of 10, Ripken [...] "knew the game inside and out."

500|$|For one of {{his side}} projects, Chris Thile <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> form a string quintet {{composed}} of mandolin, violin, banjo, guitar, and bass with childhood friend and fiddler Gabe Witcher, but didn’t know which direction {{he wanted to take}} the band. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Telluride, Colorado, Thile met banjoist Noam Pikelny and later commented that “every note he played was something I wish I’d played”. It was then that Thile realized that he wanted to “put [...] stamp on the traditional bluegrass ensemble”. Thile wanted to get five musicians together for a Nashville jam session in 2005, after he found talented bluegrass musicians that could fill the positions. The bassist Thile was searching for, Greg Garrison, was recommended to Thile by Pikelny, who had performed alongside Garrison in the Cajun jam band Leftover Salmon. The guitar position was filled by Chris Eldridge, from the bluegrass band the Infamous Stringdusters. The five musicians met up in Nashville one day in 2005 and decided that they needed to “do something musical together”. A few nights later, the group met again “just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships”. That night, they came to an agreement and formed a bluegrass band.|$|E

His parents divorced when Chabon was 11, and he grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Columbia, Maryland.

He grew up hearing Yiddish spoken by his mother's parents and siblings.|$|E

[...] His first novel, The Foolish Giant, was {{published}} in 1977.|$|E
