The {{earliest}} Arsacid coins show rulers wearing the soft cap with cheek flaps, known as the bashlyk (Greek: kyrbasia). This may have derived from an Achaemenid-era satrapal headdress and the pointy hats depicted in the Achaemenid reliefs at Behistun and Persepolis. The earliest coins of Mithridates <b>I</b> <b>show</b> him wearing the soft cap, yet coins from {{the latter part of}} his reign show {{him for the first time}} wearing the royal Hellenistic diadem. Mithridates II was the first to be shown wearing the Parthian tiara, embroidered with pearls and jewels, a headdress commonly worn in the late Parthian period and by Sassanid monarchs.|$|E

During his lifetime, Bashō was {{recognized}} for his works in the collaborative haikai no renga form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). Matsuo Bashō's poetry is internationally renowned; and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is justifiably famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where <b>I</b> <b>show</b> who I really am is in linking haikai verses." ...|$|E

[...] Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley's letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony.

2500|$|Skeptic Michael Shermer {{claims that}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of [...] "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to false positives. Stanford University psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "implausible." [...] Rumors of backmasking in popular music have been described as auditory pareidolia. James Walker, president of Christian research group Watchman Fellowship, states that [...] "You could take a Christian hymn, and if you played it backwards long enough at different speeds, you could make that hymn say anything you want to"; Led Zeppelin publicist BP Fallon concurs, saying [...] "Play anything backwards, and you'll find something."

2500|$|But some {{scholars}} {{do not believe}} Āryabhaṭa's sine table {{has anything to do}} with Hipparchus's chord table which does not exist today. Some scholars do not agree with this hypothesis that Hipparchus constructed a chord table. Bo C. Klintberg states [...] "With mathematical reconstructions and philosophical arguments <b>I</b> <b>show</b> that Toomer's 1973 paper never contained any conclusive evidence for his claims that Hipparchus had a 3438'-based chord table, and that the Indians used that table to compute their sine tables. Recalculating Toomer's reconstructions with a 3600' radius [...] i.e. the radius of the chord table in Ptolemy's Almagest, expressed in 'minutes' instead of 'degrees' [...] generates Hipparchan-like ratios similar to those produced by a 3438' radius. It is therefore possible that the radius of Hipparchus's chord table was 3600', and that the Indians independently constructed their 3438'-based sine table." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] "According to {{all that}} <b>I</b> <b>show</b> you, {{the pattern of the}} Tabernacle [...] [...] [...] even so shall you make it," [...] Rav Shimi bar Hiyya deduced that just as the Tabernacle {{required}} the consent of Moses, so additions to the Temple or the City of Jerusalem required the consent of the Sanhedrin (the heir to the authority of Moses). (The phrase, [...] "so shall you make it," [...] is superfluous, because [...] already said, [...] "Let them make Me a sanctuary."
