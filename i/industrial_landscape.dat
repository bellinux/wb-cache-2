5|$|A Roman bath {{house and}} Edwardian folly {{in the village}} of Whitestaunton were {{excavated}} by the archaeological television programme Time Team. There is also evidence of iron workings in the Romano-British period, at Dunkeswell, which radiocarbon dating has placed in the 2nd century. It has been suggested that these and other iron-based technologies gave the hills a fairly <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> during the Romano-British period, providing a source of the name Blackdown Hills. Local iron ores were smelted at Hemyock in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron until the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused urbanisation along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1877, Tyldesley Good Templars Band was the town's first brass band. Tyldesley Band is {{a member}} of the North West Brass Band Association and meets in the chapel on Milk Street. Tyldesley Little Theatre in Lemon Street is home to an amateur {{dramatic}} society, members of the Greater Manchester Drama Federation. The auditorium is a small 150-seat theatre with a traditional proscenium arch stage, stalls and balcony seating. The town's <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> was recorded in the 1960s and 1970s in the paintings and prints of artist Roger Hampson.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Queen Victoria {{commissioned}} {{a painting by}} the artist William Wyld which became A view of Manchester from Kersal Moor (pictured). The painting, which depicts the moor as a beautiful pastoral scene overlooking Castle Irwell racecourse and the <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> of Manchester, {{is now in the}} Royal Collection, where it is listed as Manchester from Higher Broughton. A steel line engraving of the painting by the engraver Edward Goodall was also commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Eraserhead is a 1977 American surrealist body horror film written, produced, and {{directed}} by filmmaker David Lynch. Shot in black-and-white, Eraserhead is Lynch's first feature-length film, coming after several short works. The film was produced {{with the assistance of}} the American Film Institute (AFI) during the director's time studying there. Starring Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Jeanne Bates, Judith Anna Roberts, Laurel Near, and Jack Fisk, it tells the story of Henry Spencer (Nance), who is left to care for his grossly deformed child in a desolate <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape.</b> Throughout the film, Spencer experiences dreams or hallucinations, featuring his child and the Lady in the Radiator.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} role of rural, urban, and <b>industrial</b> <b>landscapes</b> in Charles Dickens’s Hard Times, Benjamin Disraeli’s Sybil, and Elizabeth Gaskell’s North and South and Mary Barton. These four novels focus on the social turbulences {{surrounding}} industrialisation and are all set in an industrial town {{in the north of}} England. In each novel, the descriptions of rural, urban and <b>industrial</b> <b>landscapes</b> support that novel’s view on industrialisation and the subsequent social tensions...|$|R

5|$|Major {{developments}} in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of the}} Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape.</b> Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views as much as his plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E

25|$|Despite the island's {{extremely}} developed <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape,</b> areas {{along the south}} and west shores are left undeveloped to provide habitat for wildlife. Foxes and once-endangered Peregrine falcons, which frequent large outdoor structures such as the EOT gantry cranes at the ore docks, thrive on the island and offshore. At the bottom of the Detroit River is a man-made bed of coal cinders which serves as a rare spawning site for Lake Sturgeon, a threatened species. Less desirable are the sizable and sometimes troublesome populations of gulls, feral cats and rats.|$|E
25|$|Having flowed {{beneath the}} A19 trunk road, the river enters {{the suburbs of}} Sunderland. The riverbanks show further {{evidence}} of past industrialisation, with former collieries, engineering works and dozens of shipyards. In their time, Wearside shipbuilders {{were some of the}} most famous and productive shipyards in the world. The artist L. S. Lowry visited Sunderland repeatedly and painted pictures of the <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> around the river. Three bridges cross the Wear in Sunderland: the Queen Alexandra Bridge to the west, and the Wearmouth rail and road bridges in the city centre.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1983, he {{had begun}} the writing and drawing of a comic strip, The Angriest Dog in the World, which {{featured}} unchanging graphics of a tethered dog that was so angry {{that it could not}} move, alongside cryptic philosophical references. It ran from 1983 until 1992 in the Village Voice, Creative Loafing and other tabloid and alternative publications. It was around this period that Lynch also became interested in photography as an art form, and travelled to northern England to take photos of the degrading <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape,</b> something that he was particularly interested in.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, the WorkChoices {{reforms were}} passed by Federal Parliament. There were many {{elements}} in the reforms, including some which elicited political and social controversy and consternation. In a legal sense, perhaps the two most fundamental changes were (1) the purported elimination of State and Territory workplace relations legislation from the federal <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> and (2) the attempt to rely almost completely on the corporations power directly to prescribe minimum terms and conditions of employment regardless {{of the existence of}} an intrastate industrial dispute. This unprecedented (but not novel) use of the corporations power to enact federal industrial legislation was accompanied by claims that 85% of the Australian workforce would be covered by WorkChoices.|$|E
25|$|While still {{attending}} the GSD, Darden became the chief studio instructor for the Architecture Career Discovery Program in 1982. After graduate school {{he became a}} visiting lecturer at the Catholic University of America in Washington D.C. for the spring semester 1984, teaching a graduate seminar on the American <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape.</b> From September 1984 until 1987 Darden began teaching architectural design as an adjunct assistant professor at Columbia University in New York, New York. Then from January 1987 until 1988 he taught architectural design as a special lecturer at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, New Jersey. In 1989 Darden moved {{back to his home}} state of Colorado to teach. He became a senior instructor at the University of Colorado Denver in the fall of 1990 teaching advanced level architectural design studios and lecture courses. He would continue to teach at the University of Colorado Denver until his death.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{was born}} in South Shields, County Durham, North East England, to Elizabeth Williams and Colonel Francis Percy Scott. Born shortly before the Second World War, he {{was brought up in}} an army family so his father– an officer in the Royal Engineers– was absent for most of his early life. His elder brother, Frank, joined the British Merchant Navy when he was still young and the pair had little contact. During this time the family moved around, living in (among other areas) Cumberland in North West England, Wales and Germany. He had a younger brother, Tony, who also became a film director. After World War II, the Scott family moved back to their native North East, {{eventually}} settling on Greens Beck Road in Hartburn, County Durham, whose <b>industrial</b> <b>landscape</b> would later inspire similar scenes in Blade Runner. His interest in science fiction began by reading the works of H. G. Wells as a child. He studied at Grangefield Grammar School and West Hartlepool College of Art from 1954 to 1958, obtaining a diploma in design.|$|E
