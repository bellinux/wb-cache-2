It was a decision that needed deliberation, as his father was hoping for his son to return to the farm in due time, and the financial situation of the family was not strong. However, Reitz did go to London, and finished <b>his</b> <b>studies</b> successfully. He was called to the bar at Westminster on 11 June 1867.
