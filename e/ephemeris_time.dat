2500|$|The other {{consequence}} of tidal acceleration is the deceleration of {{the rotation of}} Earth. The rotation of Earth is somewhat erratic on all time scales (from hours to centuries) due to various causes. The small tidal effect cannot be observed in a short period, but the cumulative effect on Earth's rotation as measured with a stable clock (<b>ephemeris</b> <b>time,</b> atomic time) of a shortfall of even a few milliseconds every day becomes readily noticeable in a few centuries. Since some event in the remote past, more days and hours have passed (as measured in full rotations of Earth) (Universal Time) than would be measured by stable clocks calibrated to the present, longer length of the day (<b>ephemeris</b> <b>time).</b> This is known as ΔT. Recent values {{can be obtained from}} the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). [...] A table of the actual length of the day in the past few centuries is also available.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this process, the mean solar day, which is {{nominally}} 86,400 seconds long, is actually getting longer when measured in SI seconds with stable atomic clocks. (The SI second, when adopted, was already a little shorter than the current value of the second of mean solar time.) The small difference accumulates over time, which leads to an increasing difference between our clock time (Universal Time) on the one hand, and Atomic Time and <b>Ephemeris</b> <b>Time</b> on the other hand: see ΔT. This led to the introduction of the leap second in 1972 [...] to compensate for differences in the bases for time standardization.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{several years}} of work, Louis Essen from the National Physical Laboratory (Teddington, England) and William Markowitz from the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) {{determined}} {{the relationship between the}} hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium atom and the ephemeris second. [...] Using a common-view measurement method based on the received signals from radio station WWV, they determined the orbital motion of the Moon about the Earth, from which the apparent motion of the Sun could be inferred, in terms of time as measured by an atomic clock. [...] They found that the second of <b>ephemeris</b> <b>time</b> (ET) had the duration of 9,192,631,770 ± 20 cycles of the chosen caesium frequency.

2500|$|The {{other time}} scale has two parts. <b>Ephemeris</b> <b>time</b> (ET) is the {{independent}} variable in the equations of motion of the solar system, in particular, the equations in use from 1960 to 1984 [...] That is, {{the length of the}} second used in the solar system calculations could be adjusted until the length that gives the best agreement with observations is found. With the introduction of atomic clocks in the 1950s, it was found that ET could be better realized as atomic time. This also means that ET is a uniform time scale, as is atomic time. ET was given a new name, Terrestrial Time (TT), and for most purposes ET = TT = International Atomic Time + 32.184 SI seconds. [...] TT is ahead of UT1 by 69.184 seconds (International Earth Rotation Service 2017; [...] ).|$|E

[...] When measured as a function of mean solar time rather than uniform time, the effect appears as a positive acceleration.) In 1749 Richard Dunthorne confirmed Halley's suspicion after re-examining ancient records, and produced the first quantitative estimate for the size of this apparent effect: a centurial rate of +10″ (arcseconds) in lunar longitude, which is a surprisingly accurate result for its time, not differing greatly from values assessed later, e.g. in 1786 by de Lalande, and to compare with values from about 10″ to nearly 13″ being derived about a century later.|$|E

40|$|Many {{physical}} parameters {{that can}} be estimated from space mission tracking data influence both the translational dynamics and proper time rates of observers. These different proper time rates cause a variability of the time transfer observable beyond that caused by their translational (and rotational) dynamics. With the near-future implementation of (interplanetary) transponder laser ranging, these effects will become increasingly important, requiring a re-evaluation of the common data analysis practice of using a priori time ephemerides, which {{is the goal of}} this paper. We develop a framework for the simultaneous estimation of the initial translational state and the initial proper time of an observer, with the goal of facilitating robust tracking data analysis from next-generation space missions carrying highly accurate clocks and tracking equipment. Using our approach, the influence of physical parameters on both translational and time dynamics are considered at the same level in the analysis, and mutual correlations between the signatures of the two are automatically identified. We perform a covariance analysis using our proposed method with simulated laser data from Earth-based stations to both a Mars and Mercury lander. Using four years of tracking data for the Mars lander simulations, we find a difference between our results using the simultaneous space-time dynamics estimation and the classical analysis technique (with an ta priori <b>time</b> <b>ephemeris)</b> of around 0. 1 % in formal errors and correlation coefficients. For a Mercury lander this rises to around 1 % for a 1 -month mission and 10 % for a 4 -year mission. By means of Monte Carlo simulation, we find that using an a priori <b>time</b> <b>ephemeris</b> of representative accuracy will result in estimation errors that are orders of magnitude above the formal error when processing highly accurate laser time transfer data.
