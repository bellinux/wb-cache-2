500|$|On February 13–15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so {{abstract}} it is {{not easily}} described. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Keenan stated [...] "we didn't really have any clue what to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret."

500|$|The Guardian and the Evening Times {{highlighted}} the Star Stories parody as the [...] "pick of the day". Martin Skeggs of The Guardian commented, [...] "There's everything you {{ever wanted to}} know about the world's number one film star, including how he was introduced to Scientology (John Travolta whacked him over the head with a shovel), the time he met Nicole Kidman and asked her if she would mind sitting down to make him look taller". He characterized the parody as, [...] "A toned down version of real life, then." [...] Barry McDonald of the Evening Times described the episode as [...] "equally cruel and sidesplittingly hilarious". He commented, [...] "This is as close to must-watch television as you're likely to get and a testament to the quality of comedy writing on display." [...] In a later review of the program for the Evening Times when it was shown again on re-runs, McDonald wrote, [...] "I don't care if it's been shown several times before, {{this is one of the}} shows which you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> again." [...] Anila Baig of The Sun {{highlighted the}} show as [...] "Best Spoof", and wrote, [...] "pint-sized Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise [...] is subjected to some serious mocking. We follow his film career, his marriages to Nicole Kidman and Katie Holmes (portrayed as a robot) and how everything in his life has been shaped by his belief in Scientology. The show is as crude as ever". Stephen Milton of The Sun described the parody of Cruise's appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show as [...] "the best gag in the whole episode". Aidan Smith of Scotland on Sunday wrote favorably of the show, and noted, [...] "Fearlessly, in view of how paranoid Scientologists are, the latest target was Tom Cruise. I especially liked the scene where the tiny screen giant winched himself, Mission Impossible-style, on to Nicole Kidman while she slugged from a tinnie like a good Sheila." ...|$|E

50|$|The entire bank of Kukdi River {{is turned}} into moon land of huge pot holes. The {{phenomenon}} behind its formation {{goes back to}} more than thousands of years.
