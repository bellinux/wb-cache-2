5|$|Hamilton's Report on a National Bank was a {{projection}} from the <b>first</b> <b>Report</b> on the Public Credit. Although Hamilton had been forming ideas {{of a national}} bank as early as 1779, he gathered ideas in various ways over the past eleven years. These included theories from Adam Smith, extensive studies on the Bank of England, the blunders of the Bank of North America and his experience in establishing the Bank of New York. He also used American records from James Wilson, Pelatiah Webster, Gouverneur Morris, and from his assistant Treasury secretary Tench Coxe.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the <b>first</b> <b>report</b> on {{attempted}} {{isolation of}} the element was unsuccessful, prompting new theoretical studies to investigate how best to investigate bohrium (using its lighter homologs technetium and rhenium for comparison) and removing unwanted contaminating elements such as the trivalent actinides, the group 5 elements, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Manuel Belgrano {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{politicians}} to advocate the development of an important educative system. He did so at the <b>first</b> <b>report</b> he made as head of the Consulate of Commerce, suggesting the creating of schools of agriculture and commerce. A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E

Eventually this resulted in the <b>first</b> <b>report</b> on worldwide economic freedom, Economic Freedom in the World. This annual report has since provided data for numerous peer-reviewed studies and has influenced policy in several nations.|$|E
5|$|On April 5, 1952, {{biochemist}} Durey Peterson and microbiologist Herbert Murray at Upjohn {{published the}} <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of a fermentation {{process for the}} microbial 11α-oxygenation of steroids in a single step (by common molds of the order Mucorales). Their fermentation process could produce 11α-hydroxyprogesterone or 11α-hydroxycortisone from progesterone or Compound S, respectively, which could then by further chemical steps be converted to cortisone or 11β-hydroxycortisone (cortisol).|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of {{discovery}} of element 105 {{came from the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, in 1968. A target of 243Am was bombarded by a beam of 22Ne ions. The scientists at Dubna reported 9.4MeV (with the reported half-life of 0.1–3 seconds) and 9.7MeV (t1/2>0.05s) alpha activities followed by alpha activities {{similar to those of}} either 256103 or 257103. The two activity lines were, based on prior theoretical predictions, assigned to 261105 and 260105, accordingly.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when Arnold Hall, {{director}} of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) asked Morien Morgan to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept.

5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). The {{house and the}} surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, took more than 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem examination of the bodies was made by the State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his <b>first</b> <b>report</b> was delivered on 13 March 1997. No material was found either by the forensic examination of the scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to help establish the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E

5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This was the <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects {{food on the}} basis of profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1842, the {{existing}} route became impassable, and Clifton undertook {{the creation of the}} proposed coastal route. He sent his company's men to clear the path and make a road. The <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of the new road was on 19 October, praising the new route but deriding the almost impassable obstacles presented by the large rivers en route. The Australind–Mandurah route was completed by 2 November, and the speed of the new route allowed almost daily communication. It could be travelled in 32 hours, with a ferry to cross the estuary at Mandurah. The ferry was operated, and later owned, by nearby resident Mrs Lyttleton, as the government was not interested at that time in owning or leasing out the ferry. The government later appropriated the ferry on 2 February 1843, and imposed standardised tolls for passengers and livestock. Ten years later, the ferry service was made available to the public free of charge.|$|E
5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The <b>first</b> <b>report</b> of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the treatment of sewage.|$|E

5|$|In 1832, {{the canal}} company asked the {{engineer}} James Green to advise on further extensions to the system. His <b>first</b> <b>report</b> {{was critical of}} much of the work completed by Pinkerton, and recommended completing the link from the Ashburnham Canal to the new Pembrey harbour. This would require a lock at Ty Mawr, with water supplied by the Dyvatty brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at Cwm Capel in the Dyvatty valley. A second report, supplied three months later, recommended an extension along the Gwendraeth valley, and the construction of three inclined planes to reach a terminus just above Cwmmawr. Water supply for the upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above Cwm y Glo.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 he {{travelled}} the Western Circuit but was recalled by the Lord Chancellor {{to chair}} a committee {{looking at the}} reform of procedure in divorce cases. He continued working as a judge while chairing the daily committee. The committee was appointed on 26 June 1946 and published its <b>first</b> <b>report</b> in July, which reduced the time between decree nisi and decree absolute from 6 months to 6 weeks. The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending {{the establishment of a}} Marriage Welfare Service. The reports were well received by the public and led to Denning being invited in 1949 to become President of the National Marriage Guidance Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a {{third major}} {{competitor}} joined {{the race for}} superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} <b>first</b> <b>report</b> from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
