2500|$|After {{assuming}} {{office in}} 1946, Morrison appointed Adair Watters [...] {{superintendent of the}} New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) {{in an effort to}} eliminate corruption. But tensions developed when Watters moved to suppress gambling, prostitution, and other vice too zealously for Morrison's liking. Watters resigned in February 1949 because of Morrison's political interference with NOPD activities. Throughout most of the 1950s, scandals continued to be revealed concerning the involvement of the NOPD in graft and vice. [...] In 1952, the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans was established as an <b>independent</b> <b>monitor</b> of the NOPD and the Morrison administration's approach to vice. State Police Colonel Francis Grevemberg, later a two-time gubernatorial candidate, led a series of high-profile raids on New Orleans gambling establishments that embarrassed Morrison and the NOPD for its inactivity. Eventually, retired FBI Agent Aaron M. Kohn was sent from Chicago to investigate NOPD involvement in vice. Kohn later recalled:"After about a year, I began to realize something about the system down here. In Chicago, people were generally {{on one side of the}} fence or the other—honest or crooked. But in Louisiana, there just isn't any fence." [...] He soon complained that Morrison was obstructing his efforts. In 1955, Morrison forced the mayor to ask for Schuering's resignation.|$|E
