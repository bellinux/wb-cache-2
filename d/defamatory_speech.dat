For {{the first two}} hundred years of American jurisprudence, the basic substance of defamation law continued to resemble that existing in England {{at the time of}} the Revolution.

He notes {{his belief that}} where [...] "allegedly <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> is of public concern" [...] that the First Amendment requires a plaintiff (be it a public official, public figure, or private individual) prove the statements to be false. He writes to note his adherence to his view that a distinction based {{on whether or not}} the defendant is part of the media is not reconcilable with a First Amendment principle that states that [...] "the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public is not dependent on the identity of the source".|$|E

In 2016, the Maldivian parliament controlled by Yameen's party, PPM, passed the Defamation and Freedom of Speech Act, drawing condemnation from the United Nations and international rights groups. The act criminalises defamation - which had been de-criminalised in 2009 - and imposes hefty fines on individuals accused of <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech,</b> remarks, writings and other actions against [...] "any tenet of Islam". Publications, including websites, found carrying [...] "defamatory" [...] comments could also have their licenses revoked.

Al Jazeera English have made a documentary about President Yameen and investigated his fraud. The name of this documentary is Stealing Paradise, by Al Jazeera. His brother, Maldives former president, Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom is against his acts. Yet Yameen does whatever he desires. He even made a arrest warrant for his nephew, son of Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom, Farish Maumoon. Yameen Abdul Gayoom controls Maldives's Supreme Court and the courts have seem to be the one breaking the law.|$|E
500|$|The {{constitution}} was adopted following a national referendum in 2003, replacing the transitional constitution {{which had been}} in place since 1994. The constitution mandates a multi-party system of government, with politics based on democracy and elections. However, the constitution places conditions on how political parties may operate. Article 54 states that [...] "political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination". The government has also enacted laws criminalising genocide ideology, which can include intimidation, <b>defamatory</b> <b>speeches,</b> genocide denial and mocking of victims. According to Human Rights Watch, these laws effectively make Rwanda a one-party state, as [...] "under the guise of preventing another genocide, the government displays a marked intolerance {{of the most basic}} forms of dissent". Amnesty International is also critical; in its 2014/15 report Amnesty said that laws against inciting insurrection or trouble among the population had been used to imprison people [...] "for the legitimate exercise of their rights to freedom of association or of expression".|$|R
40|$|There is a {{need for}} Singapore bloggers to be aware of legal issues arising from their online diaries, {{particularly}} {{in the light of the}} recent cases involving seditious remarks made online by bloggers that resulted in jail terms and fines; and earlier in the year, a dispute arose over allegedly <b>defamatory</b> <b>speeches</b> made by a blogger about A*STAR’s Chairman, Philip Yeo, which was resolved amicably, but not without an apology. The threats of legal repercussions in the form of civil lawsuits and criminal charges serve as reminders of the potential legal problems that can arise from blogging, and indeed from any online activity, such as chat rooms, that involves the expression of opinions and views. Most bloggers treat their blogs as merely an online version of their personal diaries or journals. However, they often forget that the private-public distinction between keeping a written diary and one that is open to public viewing, can give rise to civil and criminal liability. This paper will consider some of the potential legal issues that may arise. Its aim is to create awareness and care, as well as to highlight sensitivities, but not to the extent that it may impact, to any significant extent, the greater freedom of expression that so many of us take for granted when navigating cyberspace...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade or so, {{internet}} libel {{has become one of the}} hot topics in internet law. Internationally, courts have dealt with an enormous amount of cases brought by both the suppliers and consumers of the internet services. Although the advent of the World Wide Web has come with many legal problems; this paper will only focus at the problems that are being faced by the victims of <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> on the internet in trying to seek compensation through the courts. These problems include, inter alia, the reluctance of the courts in unmasking the identity of the authors of the <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> where such speech is posted in blogs where the true identity of the author is not known, jurisdiction, choice of law and enforcement. There are some crucial points that are worth emphasizing from the beginning. The problems that victims of <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> posted on the internet face are caused by the fact that internet speech is often anonymous and many speakers on the internet employ pseudonymous identities. The international connectivity of the internet, its speedy transmission of huge amounts of data, its lack of respect for national borders has caused problems more diverse than lawmakers and courts could have ever imagined. This has made it extremely easy for 2 ̆ 2 unknown 2 ̆ 2 persons with an internet connection to bypass mainstream media and speak directly to thousands, if not millions, of people similarly situated. This makes it very easy for a person in, say, Bangladesh to post defamatory statements about an American citizen via a computer situated in Bangladesh - where (as discussed in detail below) the law of, and defenses to, defamation in may be very different or, in some cases, almost nonexistent. Even if the identity of the author(s) is known, questions such as what country should have jurisdiction to hear the suit for damages, which country 2 ̆ 7 s law should be applied to that suit and, if judgment is obtained, how it can be enforced if the author of the internet <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> is domiciled outside the jurisdiction of the court, as is usually the case? As already mentioned above, the most common feature of internet libel or defamation is that it is transnational. In such cases, the defamed plaintiff will be faced, first, with the problem of where he or she may bring the suit. Of course in doing so, the plaintiff will look at the jurisdiction which is most favorable to plaintiffs in libel suits. It might be advisable for an Australian plaintiff who was defamed by, say, an article in Wall Street Journal to sue the defendant newspaper in Australia (as was the case in Dow Jones and Co v. Gutnick (2002) HCA 56, 77 ALJR 255 where the plaintiff sued the Wall Street Journal in Victoria, Australia for statements that it had published online that implied that he was a money launderer) than to bring the suit in New Jersey (United States of America) because the plaintiff has slim chances of winning the suit and/or being rewarded meaningful damages because, unlike in Australia, freedom of speech in the United States enjoys broader constitutional protection and United States courts are keen to protect the First Amendment right of speakers. It is critical to note that even in countries where such legitimate forum shopping is allowed by national laws, the question that a victim of defamatory statement may be confronted with is; can a plaintiff sue for damage caused by defamatory statements on the internet in every jurisdiction where the statements were published? If so, should the plaintiff be allowed to sue only in countries where he or it (in the case of legal persons) has reputation? If such reputation is recognized almost internationally, for example where the plaintiff is an internationally recognized celebrity or an international company, should he or it be allowed to sue in each and every jurisdiction since the internet is transnational? Or should suits be limited to countries which share the same language used in the internet post? More precisely, where a defaming online post originated in Chile and written in Spanish, should a company with international reputation which has been defamed by the publication be allowed to sue only in Spanish speaking countries...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments allow Internet users to disseminate ideas {{to a large}} audience. These technological advances empower individuals and promote important social objectives. However, they also create a setting for speech-related torts, harm, and abuse. One legal path to deal with online defamation turns to the liability of online content providers who facilitate the harmful exchanges. The possibility of bringing them to remove defamatory content and collecting damages from them attracted {{a great deal of}} attention in scholarly work, court decisions, and regulations. Different countries established different legal regimes. The United States allows an extensive shield—an overall immunity, as it exempts the liability of content providers in speech torts. This policy is not adopted worldwide. The E. U. directive outlines a “notice-and-takedown” safe haven. Other countries, such as Canada, use common tort law practices. This Article criticizes all of these policy models for being either over or under inclusive. This Article makes the case for a context-specific regulatory regime. It identifies specific characteristics of different content providers with their own unique settings, which call for nuanced legal rules that shall provide an optimal liability regime. To that end, the Article sets forth an innovative taxonomy: it relies on sociological studies premised on network theory and analysis, which is neutral to technological advances. This framework distinguishes between different technological settings based on the strength of social ties formed in each context. The Article explains that the strength of such ties influences the social context of online interactions and flow of information. The strength of ties is the best tool for designing different liability regimes; such ties serve as a proxy for the severity of harm that <b>defamatory</b> online <b>speech</b> might cause, and the social norms that might mitigate or exacerbate speech-related harm. The proposed taxonomy makes it possible to apply a sociological analysis to legal policy and to outline modular rules for content providers’ liability at every juncture. This Article does so while taking into account basic principles of tort law, as well as freedom of speech, reputation, fairness, efficiency, and the importance of promoting innovation...|$|R
40|$|Social {{media have}} the {{potential}} to revolutionize discourse between American citizens and their governments. At present, however, the U. S. Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s public forum jurisprudence frustrates rather than fosters that potential. This article navigates the notoriously complex body of public forum doctrine to provide guidance for those who must develop or administer government-sponsored social media or adjudicate First Amendment questions concerning them. Next, the article marks out a new path for public forum doctrine that will allow it to realize the potential of Web 2. 0 technologies to enhance democratic discourse between the governors and the governed. Along the way, this article diagnoses critical doctrinal and conceptual flaws that block this path. Relying on insights gleaned from communications theory, the article critiques the linear model underlying public forum jurisprudence and offers an alternative. This alternative model will enable courts to adapt First Amendment doctrines to social media forums in ways that further public discourse. Applying the model, the article contends that courts should presume government actors have created public forums whenever they establish interactive social media sites. Nevertheless, to encourage forum creation, governments must retain some power to filter their social media sites to remove profane, <b>defamatory,</b> or abusive <b>speech</b> targeted at private individuals. Although some will contend that ceding editorial control is no more necessary in social media than in physical forums, the characteristic 2 ̆ 2 disorders 2 ̆ 2 of online discourse, and particularly the prevalence of anonymous speech, justify taking this path...|$|R
40|$|The {{defamation}} tort is {{the common}} law 2 ̆ 7 s established remedy for false speech that causes reputational and emotional injury. That tort is subject to intricate constitutional, legislative, and common law rules that have evolved over decades. The false light invasion of privacy tort also provides a potential cause of action in response to injurious falsehood. False light, however, has been subject to much less judicial and legislative scrutiny than defamation. As a result, courts often are uncertain about the proper limits on false light and, in some cases, have countenanced false light claims that would have failed if filed as defamation claims. Allowing such claims conflicts with two important legal principles: (1) the common law principle disfavoring novel causes of action that duplicate established torts, and (2) the constitutional rule of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. These important legal principles require that courts reject false light claims that challenge <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> but fail to meet defamation law 2 ̆ 7 s standards...|$|E
40|$|The {{market for}} {{information}} {{has changed dramatically}} {{in the past decade}} with the popularization of the Internet, the exponential growth in number and variety of speakers, and the increased democratization of speech. These shifts have made digital media particularly vulnerable to harm from information pollution; the information market is not as capable as it once was of ensuring that the truth prevails. Anecdotal evidence suggests that information consumers are not looking for the truth, but rather, for information that confirms their own pre-existing biases. Moreover, there is significant evidence that people are resistant to changing their minds from what they had previously believed, even if it is later proven to be false. Combined, market failures in disseminating information and personal heuristics in interpreting information suggest that the remedy of more speech to combat false or <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> is not as effective as once thought. Instead, First Amendment jurisprudence should be rebalanced to allow for a general right of correction for digital speech...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores recent {{developments}} in the regulation of Internet speech, in specific, injurious or <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> and the impact such speech has {{on the rights of}} anonymous speakers to remain anonymous as opposed to having their identity revealed to plaintiffs or other third parties. The paper proceeds in four sections.   First, a brief history of the legal attempts to regulate defamatory Internet speech in the United States is presented. As discussed below this regulation has altered the traditional legal paradigm of responsibility and as a result creates potential problems for the future of anonymous speech on the Internet.   As a result plaintiffs are no longer pursuing litigation against service providers but taking their dispute directly to the anonymous speaker. Second, several cases have arisen in the United States where plaintiffs have requested that the identity of an anonymous Internet speaker be revealed.   These cases are surveyed.   Third, the cases are analyzed {{in order to determine the}} factors that courts require to be present before the identity of an anonymous speaker will be revealed.   The release is typically accomplished by the enforcement of a discovery subpoena instigated by the party seeking the identity of the anonymous speaker. The factors courts have used are as follows: jurisdiction, good faith (both internal and external), necessity (basic and sometimes absolute), and at times proprietary interest. Finally, these factors are applied in three scenarios [...] e-commerce, education, and employment [...] to guide institutions when adopting policies that regulate when the identity of an anonymous speaker [...] a customer, a student or an employee [...] would be released as part of an internal initiative, but would nonetheless be consistent with developing legal standards...|$|E
40|$|Internet Service Providers (ISP’s) {{are crucial}} to the {{operation}} {{and development of the}} Internet. However, through the performance of their basic functions, they faced the great risk of civil and criminal liability for unlawful content posted by third parties. As this risk threatened the potential of the Internet, various jurisdictions opted to promulgate legislation that granted ISP’s safe harbours from liability. The South African (RSA) response is Chapter XI of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA). The protection it provides is however not absolute. It is limited to ISP’s that are members of an Industry Representative Body (IRB) and those ISP’s must perform particular functions in relation to third party content in a certain manner to obtain limited liability. Due to the ECTA’s limited application and a lack of authority, the question is raised as to what is the liability of ISP’s for unlawful content posted by third parties? This dissertation pays particular attention to ISP liability for third party <b>defamatory</b> statements, hate <b>speech,</b> and obscene and indecent material. The role and characteristics of ISP’s in the functioning of the Internet is described. It is determined that a wide legal definition would be required to encompass the many roles they perform. The definition provided by the ECTA is wide and many different types of ISP can fall underneath it. This may have unintended consequences as entities may receive protection that the legislature did not intend. The appropriate laws in the United States of America (USA) and the United Kingdom are surveyed and suggestions as to the extent of ISP liability in circumstances where the ECTA does not apply are made. It is established that their position is uncertain due to difficulties in applying the law to the Internet. This could result in the law being applied incorrectly and ISP’s erroneously found liable. The ECTA’s threshold requirements limit the availability of the safe harbor provisions to ISP’s that are members of a recognised IRB. The IRB must comply with an extensive set of requirements to obtain recognition. The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that only responsible ISP’s obtain the protection provided by the act. After an examination of these requirements, their necessity is questioned as their purpose appears to be contrary to the logic of the safe harbours provided by the ECTA. The safe harbours are analysed and comparisons made to similar legislation that exists in the USA and the European Union (EU). It was established that the ECTA is a hybrid of the USA and EU legislation, and to a certain extent improves on them. It was suggested that the extent of ISP liability in relation to certain unlawful content is clearer under the ECTA. However, exceptions may exist in relation to hate speech and obscene and indecent content as a result of legislation that does not properly take the technology of the Internet into account. It was recommended that certain action be taken to correct this position to prevent any negative effects on the Internet industry and conflict with the objectives of the ECTA. The provision of limited liability contained in the ECTA is balanced with a notice and takedown procedure, which provides relief to victims of unlawful content. This procedure is analysed and it appears to be effective in providing relief. However, through an examination of concerns raised in relation to this type of procedure as it exists in the USA and the EU, it is suggested that certain flaws exist. The take-down procedure negatively effects the freedom of expression and the third party’s rights to due process. Further, the threshold requirements result in not all the users of the Internet being provided with the same remedies. It is recommended that certain action be taken to correct these flaws. The solution provided by the ECTA should be favoured over the uncertainty that existed before it promulgation. It may be necessary to correct particular flaws that exist. Certain recommendations are suggested in this regard and the concluding chapte...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been a fixture of Anglo-American law that {{defamation}} plaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief; their remedies are solely monetary. Indeed, it has been repeated as a truism: “equity will not enjoin a libel. ” This precept rests on one of the strongest presumptions in First Amendment jurisprudence: that injunctions against libel and other kinds of speech are unconstitutional prior restraints. But it may not be true, at least not anymore. Over the past decade, the Internet has brought increased attention to the adequacy of the remedies available in defamation cases. Prior to the widespread availability of digital publishing, most defamation lawsuits in the United States involved claims against the mass media. These defendants were amenable, at least in theory, to the threat of large damage awards and had professional and financial interests in maintaining their reputations for accurate reporting. Today, the defendants in defamation cases {{are more likely to be}} bloggers or users of social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. For this new crop of defendants, the threat of money damages does not appear to serve the same limiting function on their behavior. Although the Supreme Court has never held that an injunction is a permissible remedy for defamation, the past decade has seen a veritable surge in injunctions directed at <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech,</b> especially speech on the Internet. Despite this surge, courts have not clearly articulated why injunctions are permissible under the First Amendment and consistent with long-standing principles of equity. As a result, many judges—and scholars—remain confused about the availability and proper scope of injunctive relief in defamation cases. This Article challenges the widely held view that defamation law does not countenance injunctions. In doing so, it presents the first comprehensive analysis of more than two centuries of case law. Reviewing these cases, it draws out the rationales, both constitutional and equitable, for the no-injunction rule. The Article concludes that although courts should be cautious when granting injunctions, a limited form of injunctive relief would be constitutional and consistent with equitable principles if it were limited solely to false statements on matters of private concern that a court has found—after full adjudication—are defamatory. It then describes how such a remedy could be structured so that it would be both effective and compatible with the First Amendment...|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{courts have}} {{divided on the}} {{constitutionality}} of laws regulating false campaign speech, with some courts upholding some false campaign speech laws and other courts striking them down. This past June, however, the Supreme Court issued an opinion in U. S. v. Alvarez, a case which no doubt will cause courts to reconsider the constitutionality of such laws. Although Alvarez did not involve campaign speech, the Supreme Court discussed the general question whether the Constitution protects knowing lies {{in the context of}} a federal law barring false statements about military honors. The Court issued no majority opinion, but all of the opinions had something to say about laws regulating false speech generally, and Justice Breyer’s opinion (for himself and Justice Kagan) cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of many laws regulating false campaign (and possibly false election) speech. The upshot of Alvarez is that laws regulating false campaign speech are in even more constitutional trouble than they were before, and that any attempts to regulate such speech will have to be narrow, targeted, and careful in its choice of remedies. Part I of this article briefly describes the pre-Alvarez split in the lower courts on the regulation of false campaign and election speech, and the arguments which had been advanced for and against the constitutionality of regulating false campaign speech. Part II describes the Supreme Court’s fractured opinion in U. S. v. Alvarez. Part III discusses how Alvarez may affect the constitutional calculus in the false campaign speech arena and argues that, in light of Alvarez courts should hold unconstitutional most broad state laws barring false speech in campaigns. But courts should reject challenges to narrower laws which, under an actual malice/clear and convincing evidence standard, (1) bar false (though not misleading) election speech about the mechanics of voting, such as false statements about the date and time of voting; (2) give a government election authority the power to reject false campaign speech submitted for official ballot materials; and (3) allow a jury to punish <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> about candidates made with actual malice. Each of these proposed laws is consistent with the plurality’s and Justice Breyer’s opinions in Alvarez, although the defamation issue is somewhat in question. The hardest case is whether the government has authority to enjoin or punish non-defamatory false campaign speech made with knowledge of falsity (actual malice) which has the potential to trick or defraud voters into changing their votes. Consider, for example, the false statement of a judicial candidate on a campaign poster that she is an incumbent judge, or a statement that the president has endorsed her for office. While the case is close, I argue that following Alvarez, courts are likely to conclude that the risks of allowing the government to punish or enjoin false campaign speech process outweigh the benefits of providing voters with truthful information. Further, the narrower solution to the problem of this type of false campaign speech is counterspeech from opposing candidates and the media, as well as the use of a government “truth commission” with the power to declare, before the election but subject to judicial review, that campaign speech is false...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of his eloquent {{commentary}} upon New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, the late Professor Kalven enthused that the Court had written 2 ̆ 2 an opinion that may prove to be the best and most important it has ever produced in the realm of freedom of speech. 2 ̆ 2 This excitement was generated not by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s rather narrow holding but rather by the hope that Sullivan would serve as the opening wedge to dislodge the clear and present danger test, to dismantle the 2 ̆ 2 two-level 2 ̆ 2 approach to first amendment analysis (reflected in cases such as Chaplinsky, Beauharnais, and Roth), and instead to rest free speech theory on the idea that the first amendment is centrally concerned with the protection of speech relating to self-government. From that premise, Kalven thought the inclination to protect all speech in the 2 ̆ 2 public domain 2 ̆ 2 would prove to be 2 ̆ 2 overwhelming. 2 ̆ 2 Professor Kalven 2 ̆ 7 s hopes have not been realized. It is now clear that a variant of the clear and present danger test is solidly entrenched in a portion of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s first amendment theory and that the two-level approach to first amendment analysis is alive and well. Moreover, recent commentary by Justice Stewart and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s opinion in Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. suggest that Sullivan may be regarded as having nothing to do with free speech theory. Rather it may be described as a free press case and its principles are to be applied (at least insofar as the scope of first amendment protection is concerned) whether or not the communication is considered to be of public interest or relevant to self-government. Such developments make it appropriate to consider whether media communications should be accorded a greater level of protection than non-media communications, whether <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> unrelated to public issues (2 ̆ 2 non-public 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 private 2 ̆ 2 speech) is or should be protected under the first amendment, and whether there is a central meaning of the first amendment under prevailing Supreme Court doctrine. These comments should suffice to introduce the three major themes of this paper: First, media communications should be afforded no greater protection than non-media communications; second, defamatory non-public speech has been undervalued in first amendment theory; and third, the attempt to identify a category of speech deemed to be centrally protected under the first amendment is ill advised. Thus, first amendment methodology is explainable not in terms of self-government or absolutism (nor in terms of definitional or ad hoc balancing); instead first amendment methodology is rooted in general balancing principles which sometimes counsel ad hoc approaches and other times dictate rules of general application. Before addressing these contentions directly, it is necessary to discuss Professor Kalven 2 ̆ 7 s hopes, Justice Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, and some of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s observations with respect to these issues...|$|E
40|$|Imagine a {{beautiful}} fall {{day on a}} Southern college campus. The leaves are changing, {{and the sound of}} the band practicing for this weekend’s big game echoes throughout campus. Jane, a college freshman, is walking through campus on the way back to her dorm from her Biology 101 class. Usually, Jane’s walk is uneventful, aside from the occasional run-in with a friend or sorority sister; however, today is much different. Jane notices that many people are staring, pointing, and snickering at her. Is there something on her face? She quickly pulls out her compact and realizes that all makeup is intact. Is there something wrong with her clothes? She briskly looks herself over and nothing is out of place. Paranoid, Jane starts to walk back to her dorm a little faster, but people are still staring. All of a sudden, someone in the crowd yells, “Hey Jane, nice picture on collegegossip. com!” Confused, Jane tries to imagine what this guy is talking about. What picture? Her memory is faded from the events of last weekend due to her drinking too much at a keg party. But her friends would not have let anyone take picture of her passed out, right? Finally arriving at her dorm, Jane hurries onto the computer and goes to the website. There, Jane is horrified to view an anonymously posted picture of her passed out naked on a stranger’s bed. Under the picture is a string of comments claiming that Jane is a “whore, who gave me syphilis. ” Desperate, Jane contacts the operators of the website and begs them to remove the picture and the comments. Jane also informs the operators that she has never contracted a sexually transmitted disease and that, if they did not remove the material, she would sue for defamation. Days later, the operators respond to Jane, and tell her that they are protected by federal law and are not required to remove the statements. The operators also inform Jane that the anonymous posters have a First Amendment right to tell it how it is. Unfortunately, this nightmare is all too real. Anonymous gossip websites, blogs, social networking websites, online bulletin boards, and other similar types of Internet forums allow people to speak their minds and exercise their First Amendment right to free speech and expression; however, these online forums can be abused when people use the sites to defame others. When a defamatory statement is posted on the Internet, it is often times difficult to locate the individual responsible because most of the defamers are given anonymity by their Internet service provider (“ISP”). Plaintiffs in Internet defamation suits are unable to easily name their defamers since usually only the defamer’s screen name is available. Furthermore, most courts interpret the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“CDA”) to give ISPs complete immunity from liability for the defamatory posts of third parties, even if notified that certain statements are defamatory. Thus, ISPs have no civil liability to remove defamatory material, and the defamed plaintiffs are left with little recourse. This judicial interpretation of the CDA is significantly different from the well-established common law of defamation, as well as the very purpose for the enactment of the CDA. Internet defamation is an increasing problem, leaving the defamed helpless and the defamers believing they have a First Amendment right to post defamatory content. This Article will reemphasize the notion that the First Amendment does not protect <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> on the Internet. Part I of this Article will discuss defamation law as part of common law, as applied to the Internet before the passage of the CDA, while Part II will discuss the judicial interpretation of the CDA in defamation cases. Part III of this Article will address the problems with the CDA as currently interpreted by the judicial system. Finally, Part IV will propose amendments to the CDA, which are intended to clarify the statute in order to give more legal options to defamed victims.

40|$|The Dutch law of {{criminal}} defamation {{consists of a}} number of offences protecting a legal interest considered of great importance: a person’s honour and reputation. The nucleus of the present book consists of a description and analysis of those offences. Particular attention is devoted to the relationship between these offences and freedom of speech. The Dutch law {{of criminal}} defamation is based on age-old continental, partly Roman-law provisions. The current offences find their immediate origin in the Code Pénal which preceded the present Penal Code. Unlike most other European countries, in the Netherlands criminal defamation is distributed over various sections of the Penal Code. The ’classical’ provisions are libel, slander and insult. Libel and slander are distinguished from insult in that the punishability of the former requires accusing another of a specific act. The offence of insult covers terms of abuse and vague accusations. These offences require a complaint, that is, the Public Prosecutor can not bring charges unless the defamed party has lodged a complaint with the police and has requested prosecution except in the case of defamation of a public body or an official in function. The Dutch Penal Code specifically prohibits defaming the sovereign and his direct relatives, as well as foreign heads of state and members of foreign governments, insofar as the latter are present in the Netherlands in an official capacity. These offences are included in the Penal Code among the offences safeguarding the dignity of the sovereign and state security. Those having to do with foreign officials may also be considered intended to prevent unnecessary damage to international relations. All these offences are lapsing into desuetude: in actual practice, such charges are no longer brought. Another form of defamation is the deliberate insulting of a group of people on the grounds of their race, their religious convictions or their homo- or heterosexual inclination. This offence is found in the Penal Code among the offences against the public peace. In this case, in particular, the tension between protecting the rights of others on the one hand, and freedom of speech on the other, is palpable. Dutch law, in conformity with the consistent view of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), generally proceeds on the assumption that a defamation prohibition is not applicable if a conviction would conflict with section 10 of the European Convention safeguarding freedom of speech. This is certainly the case when the utterances contribute to public debate, even if they ’offend, shock and disturb’. European law has led Dutch judges to take a relatively lenient position on defamation uttered within the framework of public debate. Freedom of speech is seen as essential to the function of a democratic political system. The final chapter deals with the central element of all defamation: a person’s honour and reputation. The question discussed is what legal interests are protected by the defamation prohibitions. To begin with, attention is paid to the meaning of the term ’honour. ’ A number of more or less anthropological considerations lead to the conclusion that in their interpretation of the concept of honour earlier (small-scale) societies laid particular stress on reputation. Seen in this perspective, it is damage to reputation that leads to loss of honour. The link between a person’s honour and his physical appearance was also important: dishonour was associated with physical defects and certain physical taboos. With the growing dominance of bourgeois values, the emphasis of the concept of honour shifted to the dignity of the citizen. This shift implied the recognition that every human being, whatever his status or origins, has ’honour’. The prsent-day legal meaning of the concept of honour is based on that idea. Legally-protected honour is that recognition of his moral dignity that every citizen has a right to expect. Defamation prohibitions protect moral dignity. Self-esteem and self-respect, on the other hand, do not fall within the legally-protected notion of honour. The two basic defamation offences each have a particular emphasis. The notion of defamation in the case of libel and slander concerns a person’s public moral reputation. The notion of defamation in the offence of insult concerns the respect every individual is entitled to in social intercourse. Disrespect, for example by using invective, is insulting. Disregarding a person’s feelings, by contrast, is not covered by the concept of defamation. However, recent court rulings regarding injury to a group of people on the grounds of their race raise doubts whether the distinction between disregarding those feelings and <b>defamatory</b> <b>speech</b> is always properly drawn. The desirability of treating defamation as a criminal offence need not be doubted. The injury due to defamation is loss of status. A person’s position in society is closely bound up with his reputation and with the recognition of his entitlement to be treated with equal dignity as an individual. Disregarding this dignity opens the way to further invasions of his person and position. What begins with defamation may end in battery and genocide. ...|$|E
