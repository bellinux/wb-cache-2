25|$|Still {{the best}} {{club in the}} world <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> it doesn't care about being the best club in the world. The guys do what they want, {{the way they want}} and it {{continually}} works. No VIP, no mirrors in the bathroom, no expensive cocktails, just a good sound system and great crowd.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
500|$|I {{have faith}} in my fans. I believe they will come through <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> they always have. My house is not {{complete}} without an American Moonman, and I would say 'Touch My Body' deserves one. Brett Ratner directed it, I have a unicorn in there, I have [...] in there — who else has that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will. I {{suppose the}} reason they didn't come back <b>for</b> <b>me</b> is <b>because</b> {{they were in a}} hurry to get to Eastport and see Mr. Carrington before he went off to Chambersburgh." ...|$|R
5000|$|About {{the idea}} of the song, Simpson said [...] "it's cool <b>for</b> <b>me</b> just <b>because</b> it's my {{personality}} ... Nick loves me with nothing but a T-shirt on so that's where the song idea came from." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "it {{was because}} I fancied {{that you were}} {{beginning}} to care <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and <b>because</b> I knew that I cared for you that I went away--not because I was afraid." ...|$|R
500|$|I {{like the}} whole dance. It was really {{different}} and weird <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I usually don't, you know, be a crazy person every time. It was so fun to do {{and it was really}} out of the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!" [...] But this time it was like, you just need to let go and feel it.|$|E
500|$|Clark's adoptive mother. Lane was {{the first}} cast member to join the film after Cavill. [...] "This was a very {{important}} piece of casting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> Martha Kent is the woman whose values helped shape the man we know as Superman," [...] Snyder said in the release. [...] "We are thrilled to have Diane in the role because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|I really don't {{know where}} I'd be today if I {{had not gone}} to Mecca to make Hajj shortly after Malcolm was assassinated. ... That is what helped put me back on track. ... Going to Mecca, making Hajj, was very good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> {{it made me think}} of {{all the people in the}} world who loved me and were for me, who prayed that I would get my life back together. I stopped {{focusing}} on the people who were trying to tear me and my family apart.|$|E
6000|$|... "She always disliked me," [...] said Rowland. [...] "But {{that does}} n't matter now. I have come here simply <b>because</b> you sent <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> not <b>because</b> I can help you. I cannot advise your daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "You would not heed me," [...] I {{answered}} sadly. [...] "I dare not tell you. But {{there is one}} thing," [...] I added hastily. [...] "Will you do it <b>for</b> <b>me</b> simply <b>because</b> I ask you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{co-author}} Aravindan Neelakandan said: [...] "We {{wrote the}} book for all Indians <b>for</b> you and <b>me</b> <b>because</b> {{we do not want}} our children to end up in refugee camps." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles. The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E
500|$|Clem Burke of Blondie {{has said}} [...] "Early on all I cared about was Keith Moon and the Who. When I was about eleven or twelve, my {{favourite}} part of drum lessons {{was the last}} ten minutes, when I'd get {{to sit at the}} drumset and play along to my favourite record. I'd bring in 'My Generation'. At the end of the song, the drums go nuts. 'My Generation' was a turning point <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> before that it was all the Charlie Watts and Ringo type of thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon signing for Sydney FC, Del Piero said, [...] "It's {{a special}} day for me. I {{am happy to}} {{announce}} that I just signed for two years for Sydney FC. This {{is a very big}} moment <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I want to continue my career in a new part of the world where I can make a major contribution and help grow the game I love." [...] After the announcement of the transfer to Sydney FC, Juventus wished good luck to their former captain. Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi said they were saddened by his departure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{very first}} {{rehearsal}} I did with Perpetuum Jazzile, I practised a song I'd written called 'Anything can happen’… They were so fantastically good. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> that's <b>because</b> they have {{spent so much}} time together, so the friendship they have, that comes out in the music. Peder Karlsson ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last of all," [...] he said, {{and this}} time his voice was not quite so steady, [...] "are you really sure that you care <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> dear, <b>because</b> I have loved you so long, and I have wanted love so badly, and it {{is so hard to}} believe--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet {{you come}} to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> favour,--to <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I am her friend. You cannot win her yourself, and think I may help you! I {{do not believe in}} your love for her. There! If there were no other reason, and I could help you, I would not, because I think your heart is a sham heart. She is pretty, and has money--" ...|$|R
500|$|... "I {{just wanted}} to create and do {{something}} different and branch out. At {{the heart of it}} I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really good show <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I had not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know? It was really {{something}} he could sink his teeth into and he just did a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too". This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E
500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] he said, [...] "and {{try to be}} happy. It's useless <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to try, <b>because</b> I'm always wretched and miserable. But I'm hungry, and I {{hope you}} are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] he said. [...] "Please don't think me impertinent, but I am really {{curious to know}} whether that young woman was honest or not. She refused to read my hand or look into the crystal <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> simply <b>because</b> I was a man. Did she treat you in just the same way?" ...|$|R
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Cissé's two goals, {{there had}} been {{speculation}} linking Liverpool with re-signing Michael Owen, who had left the club for Real Madrid a year earlier. Liverpool fans had even chanted Owen's name during the match, singing, [...] "There's only one Michael Owen." [...] Cissé underlined the importance of scoring twice with speculation rife: [...] "It is clear scoring two goals in the Super Cup is important <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> {{there has been a}} lot of speculation about me of late and about my position within the club." [...] Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher stated the importance of the two goals for Cissé: [...] "Cissé wanted to prove a point – he wanted to show everyone what he can do and great credit to him. We're the players – it's up to us to play and the management decides which players we have." [...] Carragher confirmed that Liverpool missed their captain Gerrard, but was delighted to win the match despite this.|$|E
500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E
60|$|Of such stuff {{are the men}} of {{my beloved}} Helium, and when I meet another of their kind, of {{whatever}} race or color, {{my heart goes out}} to him as it did now to my new friend who had risked his life <b>for</b> <b>me</b> simply <b>because</b> I wore the mate to the ring his ruler had put upon his finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] said Sylvia right out. [...] "I've always cared--ever since I was {{a little}} girl coming here to school and {{breaking}} my heart over mathematics, although I hated them, just to be in your class. Why--why--I've treasured up old geometry exercises you wrote out <b>for</b> <b>me</b> just <b>because</b> you wrote them. But I thought I could never make you care <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I was the happiest girl in the world when your letter came today." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It wasn't {{just that}} writing songs for other artists was taking {{time away from}} me writing my next record", says Ruttan. [...] "It was that {{suddenly}} I {{was known as a}} guy who'd written radio hits for other acts - the bar had been raised <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> creatively, <b>because</b> of that. I felt the next record I made needed to be really, really good." ...|$|R
500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought it was funny as well [...] It really was wonderful to be able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That {{was a lot of fun}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|Stephanie McGrath of Jam! {{said the}} song is [...] "a nice break from the 'baby babys', 'yeah yeahs' and insistent drum beats that pepper the other songs" [...] of Oops!. David Veitch of the Calgary Sun {{compared}} the backing vocals to [...] "nicely old-fashioned shoo-be-doo-doos". Lyrically, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] alludes to how Spears wants to hear her boyfriend say he needs her {{all the way and}} that he loves her. Spears considered it a [...] "pure and delicate" [...] song. [...] "It's just one of those songs that pull you in. That's why I like it, and I like singing it as well," [...] she continued. [...] "I think they wrote it 'specially <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> the lyrics of the song, if you really listen... they're more of what I can relate to, 'cause they're kind of young lyrics, I think. I don't think Shania would probably sing some of the words that I'm saying." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day.

I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ...

5000|$|On 4 July 2012 Mills {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Bolton Wanderers for an undisclosed fee. Upon joining the club, Mills said, [...] "This deal has worked out perfectly <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> mainly <b>because</b> Bolton are a fantastic club.
