5000|$|Walkington was {{author of}} a book that {{anticipated}} Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. It was entitled 'The Optick Glasse of Humors, or the Touchstone of a Golden Temperature, or the Philosophers Stone to make a Golden Temper. Wherein the four Complections, Sanguine, Choleriche, Phligmaticke, Melancholicke are succinctly painted forth … by T. W., Master of Arts.' The first edition seems to be that which is stated on the title-page to have been printed by John Windet for Martin Clerke in London in 1607. This was dedicated to Sir Justinian Lewin from 'my study in St. Johns, Camb. 10 Kal. March. T. W.' An undated edition, which cannot be dated earlier than 1631, was printed by William Turner [...] at Oxford. This issue, which has the same dedication as its predecessor, has an elaborately <b>engraved</b> <b>title-page</b> on steel, in which two graduates in cap and gown, representing respectively the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, hold between them an optic class or touchstone ( [...] , Early Oxford Press, pp. 160-161). William Carew Hazlitt describes a fragment of an edition printed at Oxford with a different dedication addressed to the author's 'friend, M. Carye' (Collections, 1st ser.). Later editions, with the <b>engraved</b> <b>title-page,</b> appeared in London in 1630 and 1663. Richard Farmer, in his Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare, credited 'T. Wombwell' with the authorship of Walkington's treatise on the 'Optick Glasse,' and referred to a passage (traceable to Scaliger) by way of illustrating Shylock's remarks on irrational antipathies (Merchant of Venice, iv.i.49).|$|E

The heraldry and genealogy is based {{for the most part}} upon Milles, Guillim, Brooke, and Vincent, but the work has the great advantage of being arranged in alphabetical order of titles.|$|E
