25|$|On September 21, 2009, over a {{month after}} the {{election}} day, and after several weeks of wrangling, it was reported that the IEC and ECC had agreed to rely on statistical sampling in the interests of expediency instead of carrying out an <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> of all the alleged voting irregularities.|$|E
25|$|Papanicolaou's {{name was}} {{repeatedly}} {{submitted to the}} Nobel Committee and rejected every time. The Nobel Committee delegated the <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> of Papanicolaou's merits and demerits to Professor Santesson, who {{was at that time}} the head of pathology at the Stockholm Cancer Institute (Radiumhemmet). Santesson discovered Babeș' contributions that had never been cited by Papanicolaou and duly reported this fact to the Committee, which then rejected Papanicolaou's Nobel award.|$|E

25|$|Informally Gauss {{defined the}} {{curvature}} of a surface {{in terms of}} the curvatures of certain plane curves connected with the surface. He later found a series of equivalent definitions. One of the first was in terms of the area-expanding properties of the Gauss map, a map from the surface to a 2-dimensional sphere. However, before obtaining a more intrinsic definition in terms of the area and angles of small triangles, Gauss needed to make an <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> of the properties of geodesics on the surface, i.e. paths of shortest length between two fixed points on the surface (see below).|$|E
25|$|Evidence of a {{substantial}} MoD file {{on the subject}} led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this {{as part of a}} larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of internal correspondence and responses to inquiries from the public. The lack of any <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> in the publicly released documents is consistent with the MoD's earlier statement that they never took the case seriously. Included in the released files is an explanation given by defence minister Lord Trefgarne as to why the MoD did not investigate further.|$|E
500|$|Swiss {{cities and}} railway lines were {{repeatedly}} bombed by Allied aircraft during the war, beginning with minor attacks by the Royal Air Force on Geneva, Basel, and Zürich in 1940. Possibly {{the most egregious}} occurred 1April 1944when 50B-24 Liberators of the U.S. 14th Combat Bomb Wing bombed Schaffhausen, killing and injuring more than 100, and damaging {{a large portion of}} the city. In reaction to comments by Swiss Foreign Minister Marcel Pilet-Golaz that the incident [...] "apparently was a deliberate attack", American apologies were undermined by ill-advised statements made by Air Force commanders in London which blamed weather and minimized the size and accuracy of the attack. Although an <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> showed that weather in France, particularly winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the U.S. bombers, did in fact cause the wing to mistake Schaffhausen for its target at Ludwigshafen am Rhein, the Swiss were not mollified. Incidents escalated, resulting in 13 separate attacks on Swiss territory on 22February 1945—the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt's special assistant, Lauchlin Currie, went to Schaffhausen to lay a wreath on the graves of those killed a year earlierand simultaneous attacks 4March that dropped 29tons of high explosives and 17tons of incendiaries on Basel and Zürich.|$|E

40|$|Perhaps {{no other}} prison riot has {{received}} as much notoriety as the uprising at Attica (New York). From the onset, Attica became {{a metaphor for}} numerous social problems, including racism, oppression, and injustice.

2500|$|The Bernard and Anne Spitzer Hall of Human Origins, {{formerly}} The Hall of Human Biology and Evolution, {{opened on}} February 10, 2007. Originally known {{under the name}} [...] "Hall of the Age of Man", {{at the time of}} its original opening in 1921 it was the only major exhibition in the United States to present an <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> of human evolution. The displays traced the story of Homo sapiens, illuminated the path of human evolution and examined the origins of human creativity.|$|E
2500|$|Bohannon also {{alleged that}} Burnham told Science {{that he does}} not know exactly how the Iraqi team {{conducted}} its survey; the details about neighborhoods surveyed were destroyed [...] "in case they fell into the wrong hands and could increase the risks to residents." [...] These explanations have infuriated the study's critics. Michael Spagat, who specializes in civil conflicts, says the scientific community should call for an <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> into the researchers' procedures. [...] "It is almost a crime to let it go unchallenged," [...] adds Johnson.|$|E

5000|$|The {{report states}} that the mapping team “was not {{concerned}} with pursuing <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigations</b> or gathering evidence of sufficient admissibility to stand in court” but rather with “providing {{the basis for the}} formulation of initial hypothesis of investigation by giving a sense of the scale of violations, detecting patterns and identifying potential leads or sources of evidence”.|$|R
50|$|An SRO's {{responsibilities}} include; law enforcement, teaching law related classes, counseling students, {{and educating}} parents and staff.

The investigators also conduct educational presentations concerning gangs and drugs.|$|R
2500|$|In [...] – then a {{scholarly}} {{but not yet}} academic publication – two separate academics published reviews of Hutton's book. Gina O'Connor of the University of Colorado praised the intricate nature of Hutton's investigation, arguing that its purpose was twofold; both inspiring further, <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> and weave together {{a picture of the}} cultural milieu from which Wicca could emerge. She noted however that Hutton had failed to examine any influence on early Wicca from the countries neighbouring England, and wondered whether further investigation would reveal that England was not the only home of Pagan Witchcraft. She furthermore remains unconvinced by Hutton's argument that Gardner was the definitive founder of Wicca, but nevertheless proclaims that whether one accepts Hutton's arguments or not, his book remains the [...] "most comprehensive and readable" [...] of its kind.|$|E
2500|$|On June 18, Baton Rouge {{refinery}} representatives {{told the}} LDEQ that ExxonMobil's chemical team {{determined that the}} June 14 spill was actually a level 2 incident classification which means that a significant response to the leak was required. On {{the day of the}} spill the refinery did not report that their estimate of spilled materials was significantly different from what was originally reported to the department. Because the spill estimate and the actual amount of chemicals spilled varied drastically, the LDEQ launched an <b>in-depth</b> <b>investigation</b> on June 16 to determine the actual amounts of chemicals spilled as well as to find out what information the refinery knew and when they knew it. [...] On June 20, ExxonMobil sent an official notification to the LDEQ saying that the leak had actually released 28,688 pounds of benzene, 10,882 pounds of toluene, 1,100 pounds of cyclohexane, 1,564 pounds of hexane and 12,605 pounds of additional volatile organic compound. After the spill, people living in neighboring communities reported adverse health impacts such as severe headaches and respiratory difficulties.|$|E
