25|$|If the ordered pairs {{representing}} the original <b>input</b> <b>function</b> are equally spaced in their input variable (for example, equal time steps), then the Fourier transform {{is known as}} a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which can be computed either by explicit numerical integration, by explicit evaluation of the DFT definition, or by fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods. In contrast to explicit integration of input data, use of the DFT and FFT methods produces Fourier transforms described by ordered pairs of step size equal to the reciprocal of the original sampling interval. For example, if the input data is sampled for 10 seconds, the output of DFT and FFT methods will have a 0.1Hz frequency spacing.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>input</b> <b>{{function}}</b> is in closed-form and {{the desired}} output function {{is a series}} of ordered pairs (for example a table of values from which a graph can be generated) over a specified domain, then the Fourier transform can be generated by numerical integration at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which a value of the output variable is desired. Note that this method requires computing a separate numerical integration for each value of frequency for which a value of the Fourier transform is desired. The numerical integration approach works on a much broader class of functions than the analytic approach, because it yields results for functions that do not have closed form Fourier transform integrals.|$|E
25|$|If the <b>input</b> <b>function</b> is {{a series}} of ordered pairs (for example, a time series from {{measuring}} an output variable repeatedly over a time interval) then the output function must also be a series of ordered pairs (for example, a complex number vs. frequency over a specified domain of frequencies), unless certain assumptions and approximations are made allowing the output function to be approximated by a closed-form expression. In the general case where the available input series of ordered pairs are assumed be samples representing a continuous function over an interval (amplitude vs. time, for example), the series of ordered pairs representing the desired output function can be obtained by numerical integration of the input data over the available interval at each value of the Fourier conjugate variable (frequency, for example) for which the value of the Fourier transform is desired.|$|E

25|$|Nivasch {{describes}} an algorithm {{that does not}} use a fixed amount of memory, but for which the expected amount of memory used (under {{the assumption that the}} <b>input</b> <b>function</b> is random) is logarithmic in the sequence length. An item is stored in the memory table, with this technique, when no later item has a smaller value. As Nivasch shows, the items with this technique can be maintained using a stack data structure, and each successive sequence value need be compared only {{to the top of the}} stack. The algorithm terminates when the repeated sequence element with smallest value is found. Running the same algorithm with multiple stacks, using random permutations of the values to reorder the values within each stack, allows a time–space tradeoff similar to the previous algorithms. However, even the version of this algorithm with a single stack is not a pointer algorithm, due to the comparisons needed to determine which of two values is smaller.|$|E
500|$|In {{the context}} of {{probability}} theory, it is natural to impose the additional condition that the initial η1 in an approximation to the identity should be positive, as such a function then represents a probability distribution. [...] Convolution with a probability distribution is sometimes favorable {{because it does not}} result in overshoot or undershoot, as the output is a convex combination of the input values, and thus falls between the maximum and minimum of the <b>input</b> <b>function.</b> [...] Taking η1 to be any probability distribution at all, and letting [...] as above will give rise to an approximation to the identity.

40|$|The authors {{developed}} a transmission-dispersion model to estimate dispersion in blood sampling systems and to calculate dispersion-free <b>input</b> <b>functions</b> needed for kinetic analysis. Transport of molecules through catheters was considered in two parts: {{a central part}} with convective transmission of molecules and a stagnant layer that molecules may enter and leave. The authors measured dispersion caused by automatic and manual blood sampling using three PET tracers that distribute differently in blood (C 15 O, H 215 O, and 11 C-methylglucose). For manual sampling, dispersion was negligible. For the automated sampling procedure, characteristic parameters were calibrated for each tracer, and subsequently used in calculating dispersion-free <b>input</b> <b>functions</b> following real bolus injections. This led to shapes of dispersion-free <b>input</b> <b>functions</b> Ci(t) that had sharper peaks than the measured Co(t), and the authors quantified the effect of correcting for dispersion before kinetic modeling. The transmission-dispersion model quantitatively takes apart effects of transmission and dispersion, it has transparent noise properties associated with each component, {{and it does not}} require deconvolution to calculate dispersion-free <b>input</b> <b>functions.</b> Once characteristic parameters are estimated, <b>input</b> <b>functions</b> can be corrected before applying kinetic models.
