5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> 2009 was the worst <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|June 4, 1968– Tropical Storm Abby moves ashore near Punta Gorda, {{spawning}} 3 small tornadoes {{and producing}} up to 14.2inches (361mm) of precipitation at Cocoa.

5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> team history.|$|E
30|$|Except for <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> {{winter in}} Hebei Province, higher {{frequency}} of droughts {{can be detected}} mainly {{in the northern part}} of the study region rather than in the south. <b>In</b> Shandong Province, <b>droughts</b> occurred mainly <b>in</b> the eastern and the central areas. Generally, higher frequency of droughts can be identified across the entire Henan Province. Frequent droughts can be detected in southern Henan, the province’s region for winter wheat production, and frequent droughts pose serious challenges for stable production. Overall, <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> Jiangsu Province are less severe than in the other provinces and occurred mainly in central Jiangsu. In spring and summer, the frequency of <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> northern Anhui was higher and relatively low in southern Anhui.|$|R

5|$|Barkley {{maintained}} that Hoover's {{response to the}} continuing depression and the severe <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> 1930 were inadequate and {{pointed out that the}} $45million in loans to farmers that he approved amounted to less than half the losses sustained by Kentucky's farmers alone. He was angered that Hoover refused to call a special legislative session to adopt relief measures after the regular congressional adjourned in early March 1931. He planned a series of speeches condemning Hoover beginning in June but was injured in an automobile accident on June 22, limiting his political activities {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Due to Caroline’s compact size, {{sustained}} winds only reached 48mph (78km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped {{heavy rain}} the southern {{portion of the}} state, as much as 11.93in (302mm) in Port Isabel. In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period {{during the month of}} August. The rainfall caused minor flooding. This helped end a prolonged <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day holiday season for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island. Caroline also produced storm tides 1–4feet (0.3-1.2m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, and there were two indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston.|$|E
5|$|From 1875 until 1903, Hibs were {{managed by}} a committee, {{although}} Dan McMichael, who also acted as treasurer, secretary and a physiotherapist, was effectively the manager when the club won the 1902 Scottish Cup and the 1903 league championship. Willie McCartney {{took charge of}} part of the league-winning 1947–48 season, but he collapsed and died after a Scottish Cup match in January 1948. Hugh Shaw inherited that team, {{and went on to}} win three league championships in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alan Stubbs won the Scottish Cup in 2015–16, ending a 114-year <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> that competition. Eddie Turnbull, Alex Miller and John Collins all won one Scottish League Cup each. Bobby Templeton, Bertie Auld, Alex McLeish and Neil Lennon all won second tier championships.|$|E

5|$|From 1905–1907, Peng was {{enrolled}} in a traditional Confucian primary school. In 1908 Peng attended a modern primary school; but, at the age of ten, was forced to withdraw from this school due to his family's deteriorating financial situation. In 1905–1906, there was a severe <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> Hunan. Peng's mother died in 1905, and Peng's six-month-old brother died of hunger. Peng's father was forced to sell most of his family possessions for food, and to pawn most of his family's land. When Peng was withdrawn from school in 1908, he and his brothers were sent to beg for food in their village. From 1908–1910, Peng took a job looking after a pair of water buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, city {{officials}} {{announced that the}} Peachtree Road Race, Atlanta Pride Festival, the Atlanta Jazz Festival, and the Dogwood Festival would not {{be held in the}} park due to extreme drought. Some festivals which don't make use of green space were still allowed in the park. The Atlanta Arts Festival ran from September 12–14, 2008, and utilized only paved areas. Other festivals were temporarily moved to alternate venues, such as Centennial Olympic Park. The <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> Atlanta ended by late 2009. In 2010, several events returned to Piedmont Park, including the Dogwood Festival, the Jazz Festival, and Screen on the Green.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Mount Carmel {{was located}} in Edwards County. After a <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> 1820 killed a {{majority}} of the settlers, the county seat was moved from Palmyra, Illinois to Albion. At that time Albion was settled primarily by English immigrants. The Americans from Mount Carmel and surrounding settlements were resentful and tried to return the county seat to Mount Carmel by force. During the bickering for the county seat location, Hinde ran for county commissioner in 1821 against John Buckles, receiving only two votes against Buckles' 151. In 1822 Hinde ran for the office of Illinois House of Representatives and narrowly lost to Gilbert T. Pell. On December 24, 1824 the Illinois Legislature resolved the county seat issue by creating Wabash County from the eastern half of Edwards County.|$|E

40|$|Drought is {{a complex}} natural {{phenomenon}} that affects {{various parts of the}} world and causes social, economic and environmental impacts. The study of <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> Paraíba state is very important because approximately 80 % of its area is in the semiarid Northeast region of Brazil. The aim {{of this study was to}} subdivide the Paraíba state in three rainfall homogeneous sub-regions using cluster analysis and afterwards to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) on time scales of 12 and 24 months to monitor severe extreme <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> these sub-regions. The rainy season of each 49 rainfall sites was obtained by standardizing the rainfall data. The results showed the occurrence of severe drought for all three sub-regions. IPP- 12 months revealed the occurrence of longer duration <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> the period 1990 to 1994 in Araruna and Coremas cities. IPP- 12 months also identified extreme longer duration <b>droughts</b> <b>in</b> Monteiro city, Cariri sub-region, possibly due to local geography features. On another hand, the IPP- 24 months identified a severe drought with longer duration in Coremas from 1991 to 1995. In these periods, the droughts have been intensified, possibly due to El Niño effects. In short, the IPP- 12 months and IPP- 24 months proved to be effective for <b>drought</b> monitoring <b>in</b> the Paraíba state...|$|R

5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, they left their villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{untreated}} water is generally devoid of all minerals, bacteria, and suspended matter, approaching {{the purity of}} distilled water. In 1987 Malvern gained official EU status as a natural mineral water, a mark of purity and quality. However, in spite of regular quality analysis, <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> 2006 dried out the rock that filters the water, allowing the water to flow through it too quickly for the natural filtering process. Due to the slight impurities, the Coca-Cola Company, manufacturer of the Schweppes brand, had to install filtration equipment, which reclassifies the water as spring water under EU law.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the 2000s saw the club regaining its place in Allsvenskan and {{competing}} for the top spots once more.

By this time the club's home stadium, Malmö Stadion, was rapidly deteriorating, and Madsen, along with the club's board, started to plan a new stadium for Malmö FF. After a succession of mid-table finishes for the team, Swedbank Stadion stood ready in April 2009, when the club moved in. Madsen retired from the chairmanship in early 2010, the year of Malmö FF's centenary.|$|E

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought to be acquired from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|During mid-summer (July in the {{northern}} hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads {{to an increase in}} red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of <b>drought</b> <b>in</b> Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.|$|E
