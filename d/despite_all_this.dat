5|$|On 15 October, Stalin {{ordered the}} {{evacuation}} of the Communist Party, the General Staff and various civil government offices from Moscow to Kuibyshev (now Samara), leaving {{only a limited number}} of officials behind. The evacuation caused panic among Muscovites. On 16–17 October, much of the civilian population tried to flee, mobbing the available trains and jamming the roads from the city. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Stalin publicly remained in the Soviet capital, somewhat calming the fear and pandemonium.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} state {{repression}} was worse {{on the student}} movement: the AEU ended decimated. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> the association {{continued to be a}} belligerent organization during this campaign of terror.

25|$|When Leykis's show {{went off}} the air in 2009, {{he was in the}} middle of a five-year {{contract}} with CBS. This contract included the rights to his show over terrestrial radio, internet rights, and specific to airing on KLSX; this kept Leykis from appearing on any other CBS station. In addition, CBS also would not allow podcasts for them, as they were concentrating on other online ventures at the time. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Leykis has no regrets over his contract terms, and still speaks highly of CBS.|$|E
25|$|The Renaissance saw {{significant}} {{advances in}} anatomy and surgical technique. However, <b>despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> progress, surgery remained a treatment of last resort. Largely {{because of the}} associated pain, many patients with surgical disorders chose certain death rather than undergo surgery. Although {{there has been a}} great deal of debate as to who deserves the most credit for the discovery of general anesthesia, it is generally agreed that certain scientific discoveries in the late 18th and early 19th centuries were critical to the eventual introduction and development of modern anesthetic techniques.|$|E

25|$|Around the World in Eighty Days {{was written}} during {{difficult}} times, both for France and for Verne. It {{was during the}} Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) in which Verne was conscripted as a coastguard; he was having financial difficulties (his previous works were not paid royalties); his father had died recently; and he had witnessed a public execution, which had disturbed him. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Verne was excited about {{his work on the}} new book, the idea of which came to him one afternoon in a Paris café while reading a newspaper.|$|E
25|$|Most modern public {{museums and}} art {{education}} {{programs for children}} in schools {{can be traced back}} to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, was created by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But <b>despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.|$|E
25|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> {{there is}} no archaeological {{evidence}} of Achaemenid control over these region as not a single archaeological site that can be positively identified with the Achaemenid Empire has been found anywhere in Pakistan, including at Taxila. What {{is known about the}} easternmost satraps and borderlands of the Achaemenid Empire is alluded to in the Darius inscriptions and from Greek sources such as the Histories of Herodotus and the later Alexander Chronicles (Arrian, Strabo et al.). These sources list three Indus Valley tributaries or conquered territories that were subordinated to the Persian Empire and made to pay tributes to the Persian Kings: Gandhara, Sattagydia and Hindush.|$|E

25|$|Ukraine is {{regarded}} as a developing economy with high potential for future success, though such a development is thought likely only with new all-encompassing economic and legal reforms. Although Foreign Direct Investment in Ukraine remained relatively strong since recession of the early 1990s, the country has had trouble maintaining stable economic growth. Issues relating to current corporate governance in Ukraine were primarily linked to the large scale monopolisation of traditional heavy industries by wealthy individuals such as Rinat Akhmetov, the enduring failure to broaden the nation's economic base and a lack of effective legal protection for investors and their products. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Ukraine's economy was still expected to grow by around 3.5% in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Pepys {{had taken}} to {{sleeping}} on his office floor; on Wednesday, 5 September, he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. She {{told him that the}} fire had almost reached All Hallows-by-the-Tower and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold – about £2,350 – to Woolwich. In the following days, Pepys witnessed looting, disorder, and disruption. On 7 September, he went to Paul's Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul's Cathedral, of his old school, of his father's house, and of the house in which he had had his stone removed. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> destruction, Pepys's house, office, and diary were saved.|$|E
25|$|Whether Tobias had {{an affair}} with Claire is not certain; however, his {{infidelity}} is. Claire knows about an affair that Tobias had with a young woman, but she has never told Agnes about it. Claire only uses the information to taunt Tobias. Some critics have suggested that the young anonymous woman with whom Tobias had the affair was actually Claire. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> Tobias appears secure in his marriage with Agnes, even though they have not shared the same bed for many years. Their marriage seems to have become something of a habit. Tobias shows very little affection to his wife except in the way that he reinforces her thoughts, giving her assurances, for instance, that she, of all people, should not worry about going mad.|$|E

50|$|As {{stated by}} Springsteen in the Wings for Wheels documentary, {{the idea for}} the {{composition}} of the horn intro was Steven Van Zandt's. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> of <b>this,</b> the single was a chart dud, getting no higher than #83 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, it has always had a strong following on album-oriented rock radio and amongst Springsteen's fan base.|$|R
25|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> the Bulgarians {{still wanted}} to become a hegemonic power in the Balkans and made {{excessive}} claims to this end, while Serbia asked for more territory than what was initially agreed with the Bulgarians. Serbia was asking for a revision of the original treaty, since it had already lost north Albania due to the Great Powers' decision to establish the state of Albania, in an area that had been recognized as a Serbian territory of expansion under the prewar Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. Bulgarians also laid claims on Thessaloniki and most of Macedonia. In the conference of London, Venizelos rebuffed these claims, citing the fact that it had been occupied by the Greek army, and that Bulgaria had denied any definite settlement of territorial claims during the pre-war discussions, as it had done with Serbia.|$|E
25|$|Philip {{was the son}} of Landgrave William II of Hesse and {{his second}} wife Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His father died when Philip was five years old, and in 1514 his mother, after a series of struggles with the Estates of Hesse, succeeded in {{becoming}} regent on his behalf. The struggles over authority continued, however. To put an end to them, Philip was declared of age in 1518, his actual assumption of power beginning the following year. The power of the Estates had been broken by his mother, but he owed her little else. His education had been very imperfect, and his moral and religious training had been neglected. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> he developed rapidly as a statesman, and soon began to take steps to increase his personal authority as a ruler.|$|E
25|$|The Anniversary series found {{prominence}} with Joe Satriani in particular, who favoured {{the early}} EL34 powered versions and used only the clean channel live {{along with his}} signature Vox Satchurator distortion pedal {{which is based on}} his old modded Boss DS-1. Satriani used these older Boss pedals almost exclusively for live work and on a number of studio albums including The Extremist (1992) until the early 2000s. The Anniversary models were probably the most complicated Marshall ever (other than perhaps the later JVM), with MIDI channel selection, half power switching, pentode/triode switching, adjustable speaker excursion, and a low volume compensation switch. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> complication the amps had a pure signal path that did not share preamp tubes between channels (unlike later Marshall designs like the TSL and JVM). Other famous 6100 users included Alex Lifeson on Rush's album Test for Echo (1996) and Ocean Colour Scene (OCS) guitarist Steve Cradock.|$|E
50|$|On 2004, he {{replaced}} Alberto Cavasin {{as the head}} coach of ACF Fiorentina, which had just been admitted to play Serie B directly from Serie C2 by the federation. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> of <b>this,</b> Mondonico managed to qualify in a two-legged promotion playoff, winning it against Perugia. Mondonico also led Fiorentina to Serie A, but was subsequently fired and replaced by Sergio Buso.|$|R
50|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> of <b>this,</b> and <b>despite</b> the much-questioned {{treatment}} of HIV-infected orphans, the country {{continued to have}} a notably good system of schools. Also, not every industrialisation project was a failure: Ceaușescu left Romania with a reasonably effective system of power generation and transmission, gave Bucharest a functioning subway, and left many cities {{with an increase in}} habitable apartment buildings.|$|R
25|$|However, {{this success}} wasn't to {{continue}} through the season. The Hawks attained a fourth {{position in the}} league, lost every game in the Premier Cup, and finished second in playoffs table, missing out on the final. <b>Despite</b> <b>all</b> of <b>this,</b> Bobby Haig continued to flourish at Blackburn, and posted another great season with 52 points in 18 games (fifth points scorer in the league).|$|R
