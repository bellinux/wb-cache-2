5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, {{the doors of}} the Capitol were closed to the public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> alone with the casket.

After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E

However Mary insisted the game be played, saying that Morenz would have wanted the game to continue. The players on the Canadiens and Maroons wore black armbands for the game, and prior to the start, two minutes of silence were observed in his honour.

5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years.|$|E

A moment later, the aircraft was struck by a second SA-2 and exploded. The remainder of the aircraft's six-man crew—Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot; 1st Lt.. Robin F. Gatwood, co-pilot; and EWOs Lt. Col.

25|$|The 2003 Bam {{earthquake}} {{struck the}} Kerman province of southeastern Iran at 01:56UTC (5:26AM Iran Standard Time) on December 26. The shock <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> magnitude of 6.6 {{and a maximum}} Mercalli intensity of IX (Violent). The earthquake was particularly destructive in Bam, with the death toll amounting to at least 26,271 people and injuring up to 30,000. The effects of the earthquake were exacerbated {{by the use of}} mud brick as the standard construction medium; many of the area's structures did not comply with earthquake regulations set in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 San Fernando {{earthquake}} (also {{known as}} the Sylmar earthquake) occurred {{in the early morning}} of February 9 {{in the foothills of the}} San Gabriel Mountains in southern California. The unanticipated thrust earthquake <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> magnitude between 6.5 and 6.7 (as determined by independent institutions) and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (Extreme). The event was one in a series that affected the Los Angeles area in the late 20th century. Damage was locally severe in the northern San Fernando Valley and surface faulting was extensive to the south of the epicenter in the mountains, as well as urban settings along city streets and neighborhoods. Uplift and other effects affected private homes and businesses.|$|E

25|$|The fifth set {{would turn}} out to be an {{historic}} battle. Both players were dominant on serve throughout the first sixteen games without a single break point opportunity to be <b>had.</b> <b>A</b> <b>moment</b> of crisis arrived for Federer with him serving at 8-8 down 15-40, but he rallied to deny Roddick the opportunity to serve for the match. There was not another break opportunity until Roddick served at 14-15 and Federer broke him, for the first time in the entire match, to win a record shattering fifteenth Grand Slam championship. This set remains the longest fifth set in a Grand Slam final. It is the only time in Grand Slam final history where a player has lost despite only having their serve broken once.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 El Centro {{earthquake}} (or 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake) {{occurred at}} 21:35 Pacific Standard Time on May 18 (05:35 UTC on May 19) in the Imperial Valley in southeastern Southern California near the international {{border of the}} United States and Mexico. It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It {{was the first major}} earthquake to be recorded by a strong-motion seismograph located next to a fault rupture. The earthquake was characterized as a typical moderate-sized destructive event with a complex energy release signature. It was the strongest recorded earthquake to hit the Imperial Valley, and caused widespread damage to irrigation systems and led to the deaths of nine people.|$|E
25|$|The match {{had already}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of {{controversy}} earlier. During the Australian innings, Martin Snedden claimed a low outfield catch off the batting of Greg Chappell when Chappell was on 58. It was ruled not {{out by the}} umpires. It was some years before TV replays {{could be used in}} umpiring decisions. Viewers watching replays had divided opinions: some thought it was a clean catch, while others say it passed through the fielder's fingers to touch the grass before coming to rest in his hands. (If modern TV umpiring review had been in use, there was sufficient doubt to rule it not out.) Some commentators believed that Chappell should have taken Snedden's word that the catch was good, as had been a time honoured tradition. Chappell maintained he was not sure about the catch and was within his rights to wait for the umpires to rule. Chappell went on to score 90, before he was caught by Bruce Edgar in similar fashion. This time, Chappell walked after he clearly saw the fielder had cupped his hands under the ball.|$|E

They planned to seize him when he was walking beside an open field from the bus stop to his house.

Mossad agent Peter Malkin engaged him, asking him in Spanish if he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Frightened, Eichmann attempted to leave, but two more Mossad men came to Malkin's aid; the three wrestled Eichmann to the ground and, after a struggle, conducted him to a car where they hid him on the floor under a blanket.|$|E
