40|$|The {{concept of}} {{essential}} derivation {{was introduced by}} UPOV in 1991 to refine the scope of breeders' rights. The intention of the essential derivation concept was to confer breeders protection against fraudulent practices in which `new¿ varieties are produced from current, protected ones without a genuine breeding effort. A new variety that has passed the standard UPOV tests for <b>Distinctness,</b> <b>Stability</b> and <b>Uniformity,</b> and therefore is eligible for receiving breeders' rights, can still largely {{be the same as}} a currently protected variety for a conglomerate of `essential¿, phenotypic traits. Practical implementations of the essential derivation concept entail the definition of a threshold value for genetic conformity between initial and new, putatively derived varieties, beyond which the breeder of the new variety may be asked to prove the genuine nature of his breeding effort. An attractive option for the definition of threshold values for genetic conformity consists in the use of similarities calculated from molecular marker characterizations of varieties. The use of marker based similarities in essential derivation cases raises a number of predominantly statistical questions, such as how to define a reference population of varieties within which potential essential derivation disputes could occur, how many marker loci to use for a required precision, and how to define a threshold value {{on the basis of the}} observed distribution of similarity values. This paper describes the first results from special studies undertaken to answer these questions in lettuce and barley...|$|R

40|$|Bud {{sporting}} is {{the consequence}} of sudden variations in gene expression of somatic cells, leading to the occurrence of phenotypically altered shoots on plants. This phenomenon {{can be observed in}} most vegetatively propagated plant species and finds its origin in genetic as well as epigenetic events. In azalea the frequent occurrence of flower colour sports is appreciated as a valuable additional source of variation; {{more than half of the}} commercial assortment consists of flower colour bud sports. However, when clonal uniformity is desired for registration (<b>Distinctness</b> <b>Uniformity</b> <b>Stability,</b> DUS) and mass propagation, this somaclonal variation is perceived as a hindrance. Insight into the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the induction of bud sporting might improve breeding strategies, towards the appropriate choice of cultivars in hybridisation experiments. The complex beauty of sport phenotypes clearly indicates interactions within and between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, using azalea somaclonal variation as a model, a review of the literature on various genetic and epigenetic phenomena that regulate or influence gene expression, as well as on the links that exist between them is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of plant variety protection (PVP) {{is a major}} issue on the 'seed agenda' in many ACP countries. The discussion concentrates on issues of morality, and {{on the effects of}} plant variety protection on the international seed trade, subsistence farming and genetic diversity. Variety description is a standard procedure in many variety release programmes. Often this is done by a branch of the seed quality control and certification organization or by the breeder himself. The aim of this procedure is to characterize the new variety {{in such a way that}} field inspectors can identify the variety and off-types within a seed production field without bias. This system relates to a d. u. s. -test (<b>distinctness,</b> <b>uniformity,</b> <b>stability)</b> which is one of the steps in a variety registration procedure for plant variety protection. The legal dimension of the latter requires, however, a more elaborate administrative procedure and a more exhaustive method for variety characterization. The Center for Plant Breeding and Reproduction Research (CPRO-DLO), based in Wageningen, the Netherlands has recently started a new international service in the field of variety registration research. The service includes possibilities for training both in Wageningen and in national or regional settings, consultancy 'on-site' and a free question-and-ansvver service. Workshops will be organized in cooperation with the international plant variety protection organization, and other international bodies to exchange views and methods, and to investigate the effects of plant variety protection in different parts of the world. The service can be useful for countries that have already passed a plant variety protection legislation act. Such an act may be based on independent variety testing (European system), independent supervision of breeder's tests (Australian system) or a purely administrative procedure (US system). The Centre offers assistance in streamlining procedures in order to minimize delays in variety introduction, and in the execution or jointly developing appropriate methods of variety characterization. Also countries that do not have a PVP-act can request for the services in order to strengthen their variety characterization in the course of preparing for a PVP-act or for certification purposes only.

40|$|In the European Community, a new {{variety of}} an {{agricultural}} crop must submit official trials for DUS (<b>Distinctness,</b> <b>Uniformity,</b> <b>Stability)</b> and VCU (Value for Cultivation and Use) before commercialisation. The guidelines for those tests {{are summarized in}} the European directive 70 / 457 /EU (1970), revised in 2002 (2002 / 53 /EU). The result of the VCU-tests is the admission on the national variety catalogue of new varieties, which are better than the best existing ones. Better varieties in the market can increase the income of the farmers. The progress in breeding can be measured by comparison the level of recent with older (10 - 15 years ago) varieties. Incorporation of new varieties in the culture plan is only justified if they are better than existing varieties {{and if they have}} no great weaknesses. Therefore the farmers need criteria for cultivation security and high return (output, yield). The two most important factors for cultivation security are resistance to lodging and to stalk rot. In addition earliness is another important factor for silage maize to attain a sufficient dry matter of the total plant and for corn maize to attain a low moisture content in the grains. Important factors for cost-effectiveness are total dry matter yield and quality for silage and grain yield for corn maize. Until now each EU- country has a separate system for VCU testing. The aim of the VCU-research is to predict the agronomical and technological value of a new variety on a reliable way in comparison with standard varieties. For this purpose there is the necessity for a high number of field trials and analyses; this implicates high national experimentation costs. But the costs for experimentation are {{only a small fraction of}} the benefits for the farmers. International cooperation for VCU-testing will become necessary to reduce the costs for the national variety testing systems. However the aim of the research must still be to predict the agronomical value of a new variety with the same reliability as at national level. For the future variety testing should be realized on the basis of comparable agro-ecological regions with the same crop husbandry and use of the crop. These regions must be clearly defined so that the release of varieties corresponds to the high demands for harvest security and good conservation possibilities of the harvested material. The most important criteria for evaluation should be: harvest security, disease resistance, yield and quality. The basis for a good success for international cooperation is a good knowledge of the national systems: searching for similarities and finding a solution for differences. Once a variety on a catalogue in one European country, the breeding company tries to sell the variety in the whole agro-ecological for which the variety is adapted. Therefore it is important that in the surrounding zones, where the variety is tested, the same criteria are valid. In this presentation we will give a proposal for harmonization and international cooperation for controlling the VCU- value of new maize varieties...|$|R

40|$|Lubricin is a {{glycoprotein}} {{found in}} articular joints {{which has long}} been recognized as being an important biological boundary lubricant molecule and, more recently, an impressive antiadhesive that readily self-assembles into a well ordered, polymer brush layer on virtually any substrate.

Coating the surfaces of silica and polymeric microfluidic devices with self-assembled lubricin coatings affords a unique combination of excellent fouling resistance and high charge density that enables notoriously "sticky" biomolecules such as proteins to be used and controlled electrokinetically in the device without complications arising from nonspecific adsorption.
