50|$|Like other Guaicurue groups, the Qom {{organize}} {{themselves into}} bands composed {{by up to}} 60 families that would establish relationships with other bands.

5|$|Mahoning Creek lacks a {{riparian}} buffer in some places. However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and {{the nearby}} slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. Eastern hemlock trees <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> slopes and river birch, silver maple, and silky dogwood <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> floodplain itself. American basswood also grows {{in the vicinity of}} the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees in the area are affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{species of}} fish inhabit Messers Run. These include a highly {{substantial}} population of brook trout. Upstream of the Lofty Reservoir, there are two {{species of fish}} inhabiting the stream: brook trout, eastern blacknose dace. The 1990 survey observed these two species as well as white suckers and pumpkinseeds. Three species of fish <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> stream between the Lofty Reservoir and the Blue Head Reservoir. These species are brook trout, brown trout, and blacknose dace. Six species of fish <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> stream below the Blue Head Reservoir: brook trout, blacknose dace, tessellated darters, brown trout, white suckers, and sculpins. However, only the first three species were observed during the 1990 survey of the stream.|$|E
5|$|The palace complex {{fell out}} of use {{following}} an earthquake in 1867, which destroyed several buildings and drained the water features. Over time, squatters began to <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> site, surrounding {{the ruins of the}} deserted pavilions and filling the empty lakebeds.|$|E

5|$|According to NJDEP reports, two {{developed}} lake {{communities in}} the Papakating Creek watershed—Lake Neepaulin and the nearby Clove Acres Lake contribute to phosphorus loading {{in the waters of}} Papakating Creek. The phosphorus loading may originate from the runoff of fertilizer applications on residential lawns, nearby agricultural operations, or from large populations of geese that <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> lakes.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{pelicans}} and double-crested cormorants {{are mainly}} found on cliffs {{along the coast}} and on seastacks, while sandpipers and gulls <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> seacoast and inland areas. Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser, osprey, red-shouldered hawk, great blue heron, and Steller's jay {{are a few of}} the bird species that have been documented. At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands.|$|E

5|$|Internal parasites of {{the alpine}} pika include many worm species, such as Schizorchis altaica, Cephaluris andrejevi, Heligmosomum dubinini, and Eugenuris schumakovitschi.Schizorchis altaica {{was found in}} {{individuals}} <b>inhabiting</b> <b>the</b> southern Altai mountains, and Heligmosomum dubinini in those <b>inhabiting</b> <b>the</b> Sayan and Altai mountains.|$|R
50|$|In the {{northern}} {{half of the}} Yokuts region, there were some tribes <b>inhabiting</b> <b>the</b> foothills of the Coast Range, which lies to the west. There is evidence of Yokuts <b>inhabiting</b> <b>the</b> Carrizo Plain and creating rock art in the Painted Rock area.|$|R
5|$|Community ecology is {{the study}} of the {{interactions}} among a collections of species that <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> same geographic area. Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species. Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility. It might also include the analysis of predator-prey dynamics, competition among similar plant species, or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to humans, three primarily terrestrial mammalian species <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> archipelago: the Arctic fox, the Svalbard reindeer, and accidentally introduced southern voles, which are {{found only in}} Grumant. Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed. There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, seals, walruses, and polar bears.|$|E
5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), along the peripheries of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, and tends to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> Tarim Basin.|$|E
5000|$|The tribe's {{identity}} is unknown. According to M.G. Eastons Bible Dictionary, <b>the</b> Kadmonites <b>inhabited</b> <b>the</b> northeastern part of Palestine, {{and it is}} supposed that they are identical to the [...] "children of <b>the</b> east", which <b>inhabited</b> <b>the</b> land between Palestine and the Euphrat.|$|R
50|$|It <b>inhabits</b> <b>the</b> MacDonnell Ranges {{in central}} Australia. This {{confined}} distribution is not <b>inhabited</b> by <b>the</b> Australian green tree frog, which allows easy identification.|$|R
50|$|It is {{recorded}} that the Turrbul people, who long <b>inhabited</b> <b>the</b> seashore, the creeks and lagoons, {{in what we}} know as the locality of Nudgee Beach to the Pine River, were {{a branch of the}} clan of the Yugarabul speaking people.

5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E
5|$|Men {{are like}} plants: the {{goodness}} and flavour {{of the fruit}} proceeds from the peculiar soil and exposition in which they grow. We are nothing but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we <b>inhabit,</b> <b>the</b> government we obey, the system of religion we profess, {{and the nature of}} our employment.|$|E
5|$|Numerous rare or {{endangered}} {{plant species}} have been observed {{in the vicinity of}} Harveys Lake. Plants {{in the vicinity of the}} lake include Vasey's pondweed, flat-leaved pondweed, grassy pondweed, broad-leaved water-milfoil, and Beck's water-marigold. However, exotic and invasive plants such as fanwort and aquatic coontail also <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> area and have altered the habitat in the vicinity of the lake. Second-growth forests occur in the area surrounding the lake.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, muskrat, North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Reindeer herds {{visit the}} grasslands in summer. Other animals include red and Arctic foxes, wolverines, moose, otters, and lynx in the {{southern}} areas. American minks, which were released near the Olenitsa River in 1935–1936, are now common throughout the peninsula and are commercially hunted. Beavers, which became endangered by 1880, were re-introduced in 1934–1957. All in all, thirty-two species of mammals and up to two hundred bird species <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Betsimisaraka <b>inhabit</b> <b>the</b> eastern coast between Nosy Varaka and Antalaha. The {{historic}} {{capital of}} the Betsimisaraka kingdom was located at Fenoarivo Atsinanana.
