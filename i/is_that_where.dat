25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search.

25|$|Pope Julius' {{scheme for}} the grandest {{building}} in Christendom {{was the subject}} of a competition for which a number of entries remain intact in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. It was the design of Donato Bramante that was selected, and for which the foundation stone was laid in 1506. This plan was in the form of an enormous Greek Cross with a dome inspired by that of the huge circular Roman temple, the Pantheon. The main difference between Bramante's design and that of the Pantheon <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>where</b> the dome of the Pantheon is supported by a continuous wall, that of the new basilica was to be supported only on four large piers. This feature was maintained in the ultimate design. Bramante's dome was to be surmounted by a lantern with its own small dome but otherwise very similar in form to the Early Renaissance lantern of Florence Cathedral designed for Brunelleschi's dome by Michelozzo.|$|E
500|$|Equitable tracing {{is based}} not on legal {{ownership}} but on the claimant's possession of an equitable interest. There are several advantages to equitable tracing; first, it can trace property now mixed with other property. In Boscawen v Bajwa, Millett justified this by saying that [...] "equity's power to charge a mixed fund with the repayment of trust moneys enables the claimant to follow the money, {{not because it is}} his, but because it is derived from a fund which is treated as if it were subject to a charge in his favour". A limitation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>where</b> the property has been put into a bank account that no longer contains enough money to repay it, it cannot be traced.|$|E

500|$|The {{alternate}} approach taken is the [...] "beneficiary election" [...] approach. This <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>where</b> {{trust funds}} are wrongly {{mixed with the}} trustee's personal funds, used for an investment, and the money is thus not recoverable, the beneficiaries are allowed to [...] "elect" [...] whether the investment is to be held as a security for the amounts owed to them, or whether to take the unauthorised investment {{as part of the}} trust fund. This is considered the exception, rather than the rule; in Foskett v McKeown, Millett said that [...] "The primary rule in regard to a mixed fund, therefore, is that gains and losses are borne by the contributors rateably. The beneficiary's right to elect instead to enforce a lien to obtain repayment is an exception to the primary rule, exercisable where the fund is deficient and the claim is made against the wrongdoer and those claiming through him".|$|E
500|$|Forensic archaeologists employ their {{knowledge}} of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner. When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact. [...] The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>where</b> forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains, forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery. In addition to remains, archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained {{in and around the}} excavation area. These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints. [...] Their training extends further to observing context, association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect. A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques. For example, one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground. This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank.|$|E

[...] The historian and author Ian Mortimer disagrees. [...] In an essay published on his website, he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device, and that while it certainly took place on many occasions, the presumption that drawing means to disembowel is spurious. [...] Instead, drawing (as a method of transportation) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution.|$|E

2500|$|Most regiments {{carried a}} number and a name (normally a peregrini tribal {{name in the}} genitive plural case) e.g. cohors I Raetorum (lit. [...] "1st cohort of Raeti").

England lost their ninth wicket in their second innings [...] with eight wanted for victory. Tate joined Wilfred Rhodes and edged his first ball for four, but the fourth ball he received from Saunders bowled him.
