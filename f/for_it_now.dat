Simon {{commented that}} he [...] "wasn't enjoying it anymore," [...] wished to pursue other projects, and [...] "that any show I've ever worked on, it turns {{me into a}} monster. I go crazy. I hate myself." [...] Before leaving, he {{negotiated}} a deal that saw him receive {{a share of the}} show's profits every year, particularly from home media, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993. The deal means he made over $10 million a year from The Simpsons; he later told Stanford Magazine that [...] "tens of millions" [...] was a closer figure. Simon commented: [...] "When I was there I thought I was underpaid. I thought I wasn't getting enough credit <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Now,</b> I think it's completely the opposite. I get too much credit for it. And the money is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of MTV said he [...] "was {{surprised}} in {{more ways}} than one [...] "with his first listening of ...Baby One More Time, commenting he [...] "expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos." [...] Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox. Walters also said that [...] "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', are pure spam." [...] A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that [...] "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career". He also found the album premature, commenting, [...] "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the more happier <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Now</b> grow up, girl. Quick!" [...] Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic felt that, [...] "with the exception of the terrific title track, ...Baby One More Time is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed." ...|$|E
2500|$|After its {{proclamation}} of independence, Armenia {{put into circulation}} its own national currency – Armenian Dram, the usage of which revealed the necessity for a monetary sign. [...] As the result of common business practice and the unique pattern of Armenian letters {{the shape of the}} sign and its variations appeared in the business scratches (daybooks). Since that time and until the official endorsement of the sign a number of artists and businessmen developed and offered various shapes <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Now</b> the Sign (Dram symbol) is present in the Armenian standard for the national characters and symbols and in the Armenian computer fonts.|$|E

2500|$|At {{this point}} Burns was {{completely}} exhausted and {{quoted as saying}} “I don’t {{want to do anything}} more. I think we have done all this for women, and we have sacrificed everything we possessed for them, and now let them fight <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> I am not going to fight anymore.” [...] All of her time spent in jail and experiences as a suffragist had left her bitter towards married women and others who didn’t take action during the suffrage movement. [...] After the women of the United States gained the right to vote, Burns retired from political life and devoted herself to the Catholic Church and her orphaned niece. [...] She died on December 22, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 came a 4-song EP called £1.10 or Less {{and then}} their fourth studio album, Now Then... (actually their fifth album, as they had {{released}} a live LP, Hanx, as their official third album between Nobody's Heroes and Go <b>for</b> <b>It).</b> <b>Now</b> Then was the first album for former Tom Robinson band's drummer Dolphin Taylor. In the face of low sales and concert attendances, they broke up in 1983, when Burns said: [...] "Our last LP Now Then was to my mind the best album we have made. But it is also unfortunately the best I think we will ever make. So I have decided {{to call it a}} day." [...] The band later revealed the original split had been somewhat acrimonious, with band members apparently having fistfights rather than talking through their differences.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 February 1880 The Era reported: [...] "Mr Sothern says that, {{although}} his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 guineas, {{he would not}} take 6,000 guineas <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> It {{is a piece of}} the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense." [...] Obviously by that date Sothern had received an early version of the play and was enthusiastic about it. The same issue of The Era states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the Gaiety Theatre, London in Foggerty's Fairy, as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour. Sothern did not produce the play in the spring, and scholar Andrew Crowther speculates that Gilbert was late in completing it. In addition, Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the autumn, although he fulfilled his performing commitments.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the canonical account in the Gospel of Luke, the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel contains the first reference {{to the survival of}} Christ's severed foreskin. The second chapter has the following story: [...] "And when the time of his circumcision was come, namely, the eighth day, on which the law commanded the child to be circumcised, they circumcised him in a cave. And the old Hebrew woman took the foreskin (others say she took the navel-string), and preserved it in an alabaster-box of old oil of spikenard. And she had a son who was a druggist, to whom she said, [...] "Take heed thou sell not this alabaster box of spikenard-ointment, although thou shouldst be offered three hundred pence <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Now</b> this is that alabaster-box which Mary the sinner procured, and poured forth the ointment out of it upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, and wiped it off with the hairs of her head".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1879, after a long summer fishing trip, Sothern was on another American tour. [...] The Era wrote in October 1879 that [...] "It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [...] engagement, to bring out revivals of The Crushed Tragedian, Dundreary, and David Garrick, the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being {{reserved}} for the spring engagement." [...] On 29 February 1880 The Era reported: [...] "Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 guineas, he would not take 6,000 guineas <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> [...] It {{is a piece of}} the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense." [...] The same issue of The Era states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the Gaiety Theatre, London in Foggerty's Fairy, as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour. [...] Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the fall, although he fulfilled his performing commitments. [...] Sothern returned to England for a six-week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce Fogerty's Fairy in New York. [...] After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the fall, and his health declined until he died in January 1881, never having performed Gilbert's play.|$|E
2500|$|Max Gerner's GIIR sport, touring and {{training}} biplane was a development of his one-off G I. [...] The two types had low cost, easily repaired structures built from proprietary steel tubing and [...] unswept, constant chord wings with two truss braced spars; both had lattice girder fuselages and were largely fabric covered. Both also had open, tandem cockpits, fixed undercarriages {{and a single}} engine. However, the GIIR was larger, heavier and had a choice of engines which typically doubled the power. The fuselage was lengthened, mostly by increased cockpit separation, strengthened with diagonal cross members between the longerons, which placed the rear cockpit behind, rather than over, the trailing edge. [...] These changes raised the weight by 25% and so wing area was increased by extending the span by 20%. The GIIR retained the N-form interplane and cabane struts of the G I, though the former no longer leaned outwards and the upper wing was somewhat higher over the fuselage. It had two extra inter-spar trusses (six rather than four) in its lower wing, which alone carried ailerons. A newly patented method cramped, rather than welded, trusses and spars together. The [...] GIIR was easier to transport as it wings could be folded parallel to its fuselage despite the move of the fuel reservoir from behind the engine firewall {{to the top of}} the upper wings, <b>for</b> <b>it</b> <b>now</b> consisted of two side-by-side tanks, one on each wing.|$|E
