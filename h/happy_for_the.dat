5|$|Laser {{remained}} in character as Heiter throughout the filming process, often shouting {{at the rest}} of the cast on set, but wherever possible staying away from the other actors and crew between scenes to preserve a level of separation. He only ate food he had brought onto the set himself, eating mostly fruit. He contributed dialogue for his character and selected many of his character's outfits from his personal wardrobe. Six claims that the jacket Heiter wore, which was bought by Laser, was a genuine jacket worn by real Nazi doctors. Laser was also <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other actors in The Human Centipede to add their own ideas to the film. For example, when Heiter is explaining his procedure to his victims, Katsuro's dialogue was improvised, which pleased Laser. During filming Laser accidentally kicked Kitamura (Katsuro), leading to a fight on set between the actors. The incident contributed to the tension and anger throughout the scene they were filming, in which Heiter sits at his dining table eating while the centipede eats dog food from the floor alongside him. Laser also hurt Williams during the scene when Heiter roughly grabs and injects Lindsay, which caused a pause in shooting before the filmmakers could continue.|$|E
5|$|Stalwarts, led by Grant's old {{political}} ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw the ex-president's renewed popularity {{as a way}} {{for their}} faction to regain power, and sought to find ways to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E

Giddens asserts that intimate social relationships have become 'democratised', so that the bond between partners – even within a marriage – {{has little to do}} with external laws, regulations or social expectations, but is based on the internal understanding between two people – a trusting bond based on emotional communication.

25|$|The {{fate of the}} semi finalists {{rested on}} the return leg {{encounter}} in Goa. The match started off with nerves on both sides forcing rookie mistakes in both camps. It was however the visitors Aizawl, who drew first blood, all thanks to their wonderman Joel Sunday who put them ahead in the 37th minute. The 1–0 lead meant Aizawl had an away goal advantage and Sporting Goa would have to score two to progress into the final. The Goans however got their rescue act in place, seconds away from the lemon break whistle. A Sumit Passi header found {{the back of the}} net to draw Sporting Clube de Goa to level terms. The visitors however made the Goan recovery more difficult after the referee awarded a penalty to the highlanders as their captain David Lalrinmuana was tripped in the box by a Sporting Goa defender. Lalchawnkima made no mistake in finding the net from the penalty spot to give Aizawl a 2–1 lead. In the 80th minute however, a butter finger moment from Aizawl goalkeeper Soram Poirei saw him push an easy shot right onto Glan Martins' boots. The forward made no mistake in scoring from close range to draw the Goans 2–2. Sporting Goa however needed another goal to advance to the final. They had their best chance in injury time, but Sumit Passi failed to tap in an easy ball into an open net. The ending however was not very <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> visitors. Aizawl captain David Lalrinmuana was given the marching orders by the referee when he tried to delay a free-kick from being taken. This made the vital midfielder unavailable for the all important final encounter. The match finished 2–2 on the night and the same on aggregate seeing Aizawl go through to the final having two more away goals than their opponents.|$|E

The American Historical Review suggested that the Buena Vista Social Clubs mise en scène fueled nostalgic, idealistic feelings not only of many Americans and Cubans in the United States who remember the Havana of the 1950s, but also of Cubans in Cuba. The result was a reminiscence about the pre-revolutionary era—dominated by the politics of Gerardo Machado in the 1920s–30s and then General Fulgencio Batista until 1959—which [...] "no longer seems so bad".|$|E
500|$|Manchester City {{began the}} match the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams {{with the majority of}} possession and a number of shots forcing saves from goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen but the first half remained goalless.

In the 74th minute, Manchester City midfielder, Yaya Touré fired a loose ball in the Stoke City penalty area past goalkeeper Sørensen to give Manchester City the lead. Stoke attempted to equalise after Manchester City's goal without success and the final finished 1–0 with Manchester City claiming their fifth FA Cup. The result gave Manchester City their first major trophy for 35 years, ending the longest trophy drought in the club's history.

500|$|MCA at {{the time}} was riding out a dead spell, and was derisively {{referred}} to in the music industry as MCA — Musicians' Cemetery of America.

The trio signed a joint venture deal with MCA to distribute their sophomore album with Cargo. Drummer Scott Raynor was <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band's signing, but was uneasy with signing to a major label — he much preferred Epitaph, and when the band passed over the label, he began to feel only half-invested in the band. Raynor was not, however, difficult about the band's mainstream growth: [...] "I didn't measure success in terms of oppositional credibility. I loved being on the radio and MTV. We were certified products of pop culture, born and bred in suburbia." [...] Thanks to the band's established fan base and merchandising, MCA did not intervene much in the band's activities.

500|$|After {{the first}} two weeks of September were {{dedicated}} to international football, Benfica returned to competition on the 18th. In the first leg of the qualifying stage for the UEFA Cup, the club faced Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo. Suazo began the scoring for Benfica with a 16th-minute header, but the lead lasted only two minutes. Luigi Vitale tied the score, and Germán Denis scored again for Napoli a minute later. In the second half Christian Maggio added another for Napoli, with Luisão scoring for Benfica three minutes later. Although Quique Flores believed that the loss was a combination of referee mistakes and errors by his players, he believed his club could qualify. The following Monday, Benfica visited the Estádio da Mata Real to play Paços de Ferreira in a 4–3 win. Nuno Gomes scored the one-nil in the sixth minute, and Paços equalised less than 10 minutes later. Before half-time, Quique's men added two more goals. In the restart, Paços made the match 3–2 in the 63th minute before Benfica responded with a fourth goal from Jorge Ribeiro. Before the final whistle, William scored another for Paços. Sánchez Flores said about his first win at Benfica, [...] "I am <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fans, who needed this to feel that their team also fights for the league." [...] On 27 September, Benfica hosted Sporting CP for the first Derby de Lisboa of the season. With the visitors enjoying a four-point lead in the league, Benfica had to win to move up in the standings. The game's only goals were in the second half, the first in the 67th minute when Pablo Aimar assisted Reyes; four minutes later, Sidnei headed in a free kick from Carlos Martins for the second. Sánchez Flores was encouraged by the victory against a team as strong as Sporting.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made him feel like he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E
