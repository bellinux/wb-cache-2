40|$|High-energy {{radiation}} from the central T Tauri and protostars {{plays an important role}} in shaping protoplanetary disks and influences their evolution. Such radiation, in particular X-rays and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, is predominantly generated in unstable stellar magnetic fields (e. g., the stellar corona), but also in accretion hot spots. Even jets may produce X-ray emission. Cosmic rays, i. e., high-energy particles either from the interstellar space or from the star itself, are of crucial importance. Both highenergy photons and particles ionize disk gas and lead to <b>heating.</b> <b>Ionization</b> and <b>heating</b> subsequently drive chemical networks, and the products of these processes are accessible through observations of molecular line emission. Furthermore, ionization supports the magnetorotational instability and therefore drives disk accretion, while heating of the disk surface layers induces photoevaporative flows. Both processes are crucial for the dispersal of protoplanetary disks and therefore critical for the time scales of planet formation.

Corresponding signatures in the time-dependent cluster dynamics {{as well as in}} the final ion and electron spectra support that this transition is linked to a crossover in the electron emission processes.

40|$|Abstract We discuss {{here the}} energy {{deposition}} of solar FUV, EUV and X-ray photons, en-ergetic auroral particles, and pickup ions. Photons and the photoelectrons that they produce may interact with thermospheric neutral species producing dissociation, <b>ionization,</b> excita-tion, and <b>heating.</b> The interaction of X-rays or keV electrons with atmospheric neutrals may produce core-ionized species, which may decay by {{the production of}} characteristic X-rays or Auger electrons. Energetic particles may precipitate into the atmosphere, and their colli-sions with atmospheric particles also produce <b>ionization,</b> excitation, and <b>heating,</b> and auro-ral emissions. Auroral energetic particles, like photoelectrons, interact with the atmospheric species through discrete collisions that produce <b>ionization,</b> excitation, and <b>heating</b> of the ambient electron population.

Proximity zones in the spectra of the quasars (z= 3. 18, 3. 285) at 304 A resemble Stromgren spheres, suggesting that the intergalactic medium is only singly ionized in helium.

40|$|LkCa 15 in the Taurus star-forming {{region has}} {{recently}} gained attention {{as the first}} accreting T Tauri star likely to host a young protoplanet. High spatial resolution infrared observations have detected the suspected protoplanet within a dust-depleted inner gap of the LkCa 15 transition disk {{at a distance of}} 15 AU from the star. If this object's status as a protoplanet is confirmed, LkCa 15 will serve as a unique laboratory for constraining physical conditions within a planet-forming disk.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of intense extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser pulses (λ= 32 nm, I= 10 ^ 11 - 14 W/cm^ 2) with small rare-gas clusters (Ar_ 147) is studied by quasi-classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our analysis supports a very general {{picture of the}} charging and heating dynamics in finite samples under short-wavelength radiation that is of relevance for several applications of free-electron lasers. First, {{up to a certain}} photon flux, ionization proceeds as a series of direct photoemission events producing a jellium-like cluster potential and a characteristic plateau in the photoelectron spectrum as observed in [Bostedt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 013401 (2008) ]. Second, beyond the onset of photoelectron trapping, nanoplasma formation leads to evaporative electron emission with a characteristic thermal tail in the electron spectrum. A detailed analysis of this transition is presented. Third, in contrast to the behavior in the infrared or low vacuum ultraviolet range, the nanoplasma energy capture proceeds via <b>ionization</b> <b>heating,</b> i. e., inner photoionization of localized electrons, whereas collisional heating of conduction electrons is negligible up to high laser intensities. A direct consequence of the latter is a surprising evolution of the mean energy of emitted electrons as function of laser intensity. Comment: figure problems resolve...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{magnetic}} activity of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars through their X-ray emission is entering a mature phase. We review here two recent developments. First, we present some early {{findings from the}} Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) relating to the age-activity-rotation relations of PMS stars. COUP is a nearly continuous exposure of the Orion Nebula Cluster over 13 days and gives the most comprehensive view to date of X-ray emission from the PMS population. We find that the activity-rotation connection that dominates main sequence activity behavior is absent in PMS stars, although the activity-age relation is present as well as links to stellar mass and volume. Second, we discuss investigations of effects of PMS X-rays on their cold protoplanetary disks. It {{is possible that the}} the <b>ionization,</b> <b>heating</b> and spallogenic effects of high energy photons and particles produced in PMS stellar flares have significant effects on disk dynamics, heating and chemistry.

40|$|Any {{injection}} of electromagnetically interacting particles during the cosmic dark ages {{will lead to}} increased <b>ionization,</b> <b>heating,</b> production of Lyman-alpha photons and distortions to the energy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background, with potentially observable consequences. In this note we describe numerical results for the low-energy electrons and photons produced by the cooling of particles injected at energies from keV to multi-TeV scales, at arbitrary injection redshifts (but focusing on the post-recombination epoch). We use these data, combined with existing calculations modeling the cooling of these low-energy particles, to estimate the resulting contributions to <b>ionization,</b> excitation and <b>heating</b> of the gas, and production of low-energy photons below the threshold for excitation and ionization. We compute corrected deposition-efficiency curves for annihilating dark matter, and demonstrate how to compute equivalent curves for arbitrary energy-injection histories. These calculations provide the necessary inputs for the limits on dark matter annihilation presented in the accompanying Paper I, but also have potential applications {{in the context of}} dark matter decay or de-excitation, decay of other metastable species, or similar energy injections from new physics. We make our full results publicly available at [URL] to facilitate further independent studies.

40|$|Extreme {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) radiations (10 [...] 117 nm) from host stars play {{important roles}} in the <b>ionization,</b> <b>heating,</b> and mass loss from exoplanet atmospheres. Together with the host star's Lyman-alpha and far-UV (117 [...] 170 nm) radiation, EUV radiation photodissociates important molecules, thereby changing the chemistry in exoplanet atmospheres. Since stellar EUV fluxes cannot now be measured and interstellar neutral hydrogen completely obscures stellar radiation between 40 and 91. 2 nm, even for the nearest stars, we must estimate the unobservable EUV flux by indirect methods. New non-LTE semiempirical models of the solar chromosphere and corona and solar irradiance measurements show that the ratio of EUV flux {{in a variety of}} wavelength bands to the Lyman-alpha flux varies slowly with the Lyman-alpha flux and thus with the magnetic heating rate. This suggests and we confirm that solar EUV/Lyman-alpha flux ratios based on the models and observations are similar to the available 10 [...] 40 nm flux ratios observed with the EUVE satellite and the 91. 2 [...] 117 nm flux observed with the FUSE satellite for F 5 V [...] M 5 V stars.
