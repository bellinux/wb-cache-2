5|$|Andy assembles three applicants: a {{bodybuilder}} from Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) gym, Dwight's building handyman Nate (Mark Proksch), and a PhD {{candidate who}} can only work {{two days a}} week. Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he <b>deserves</b> <b>it</b> and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not only {{is not going to do}} that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E
25|$|Plaintiffs' {{lawyers say}} that the Texas law {{prevents}} patients from getting compensation or damages even {{in cases where the}} patient clearly <b>deserves</b> <b>it.</b> In particular, the “willful and wanton” negligence standard for emergency care, which requires that the harm to the patient be intentional, makes it impossible to win a case where the harm is clearly negligent but not willful.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of her wanderings, Psyche comes upon a temple of Ceres, and inside finds a {{disorder}} of grain offerings, garlands, and agricultural implements. Recognizing that the proper cultivation of the gods should not be neglected, she puts everything in good order, prompting a theophany of Ceres herself. Although Psyche prays for her aid, and Ceres acknowledges that she <b>deserves</b> <b>it,</b> the goddess is prohibited from helping her against a fellow goddess. A similar incident occurs at a temple of Juno. Psyche realizes that she must serve Venus herself.|$|E

500|$|History (MR: Ryŏksa) was {{the first}} long North Korean work to deal with Kim Il-sung during the Anti-Japanese struggle. Yan'an faction member Yi P'il-gyu {{expressed}} harsh criticism of History, aimed at Han's close relationship with Kim Il-sung: [...] "Han Sŏl-ya— he should be killed. He <b>deserves</b> <b>it</b> even only for just one book— History. He is a very bad and harmful man; he is Kim Il Song's sycophant, a bootlicker".|$|E
500|$|A [...] "ghostly" [...] woman, {{recently}} {{escaped from}} a mysterious box and having apparently infected S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Melinda May in the process, {{returns to her}} previous home where she terrifies its new occupants. Robbie Reyes is followed by Daisy Johnson, the vigilante Quake, to the mechanic where he works after she confronted him the previous night about his actions as the Ghost Rider. Johnson believes Reyes {{when he says that}} he, as the Ghost Rider, only murders people who [...] "deserve it", and now wants him to kill her. He refuses until he finds something that proves she <b>deserves</b> <b>it,</b> despite her thinking she already does.|$|E
500|$|In this vein, each of Hazlitt's essays {{incorporates}} numerous {{often very}} personal commentaries on the characters. For example, {{in the account}} of Cymbeline, he announces, [...] "We have almost as great an affection for Imogen as she had for Posthumus; and she <b>deserves</b> <b>it</b> better." [...] And comparing Falstaff with Prince Hal, he proclaims, [...] "Falstaff is the better man of the two." [...] Commenting on [...] "the character of Hamlet", he in effect joins a discussion among his contemporaries, adding to the mix of similar assessments by Goethe, Schlegel, and Coleridge his observation that Hamlet [...] "is not a character marked by strength of will or even of passion, but by refinement of thought and sentiment." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{the only}} Crusader {{whose job is}} mentioned, is a {{television}} drama actress. According to Blue Bayou, she is a [...] "genius" [...] in the field. She is shown to tune things out when she cannot understand something. For her part in the final attack on the Mew Mews, Sweet Juliet disguises herself as an announcer named [...] "Otome Sakuragasumi" [...] who gives an enthusiastic report of the Mew Mews saving the day. Sweet Juliet claims to feel bad for Berry when the plan successfully causes the public to attack Berry for [...] "making the Mew Mews evil", {{towards the end of}} the series, but she also notes that she [...] "guesses" [...] Berry <b>deserves</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News, Beyoncé talked {{about the meaning of}} the song: [...] "It basically talks about how a guy inspires you... You want to make him happy and you want to cater to him. I know it's going to be surprising {{to a lot of people}} that the independent survivors are being submissive to their man, but it's important that people know that, you know, it's fine if your man <b>deserves</b> <b>it</b> and gives that back to you." [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was released as the fourth and final single from Destiny Fulfilled. It was first released in the US as an extended play (EP) consisting of the audio version of the song along with four remixes on June 14, 2005. On July 19 another EP was released containing the original version and six remixes. Six days later an extended play of the single was released in Italy. [...] "Cater 2 U" [...] was included on two of Destiny's Child's compilation albums: the greatest hits album #1's (2005) and Love Songs (2013).|$|E
500|$|Of the victory, Baffert said, [...] "this little horse <b>deserves</b> <b>it.</b> There's {{something}} about this horse that he just brought it every time. He's a joy to be around." [...] In a post-race interview, Zayat said that the colt's racing schedule {{for the remainder of}} the year would be decided by Baffert, and that the needs of the horse would come first. He also acknowledged the need for horse racing to have [...] "stars" [...] and for them to race as long as they could. Though American Pharoah's stud rights had been sold with plans to retire the horse at the end of 2015, Zayat expressed hope that the horse would continue racing as long as he was healthy and [...] "has it in him". His winning time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont history, the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile was run in 24.32 seconds, which was over a half-second faster than Secretariat's final quarter-mile time of 25.00 when the 1973 winner set a world record and won by 31 lengths.|$|E

500|$|On June 22, 2017, Swanigan {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} (26th overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 3, 2017, Swanigan signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have been thinking of this moment for a long time. I know this is only the first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for to begin this journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft. It’s been an incredibly tough road for him to get to this point and no one <b>deserves</b> <b>it</b> more than he does". Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E
2500|$|David Cronenberg, one of {{the leading}} B-movie auteurs of the , had stepped up in {{financial}} grade with Scanners (1980), a $3.5 million production that Time critic Richard Corliss associated with his earlier, low-budget films as well as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1978) and John Carpenter's The Fog (1980) as [...] "hip parables of contemporary moral malaise." [...] Cronenberg's crowning achievement in that vein would come {{a decade and a half}} later: Like that of Scanners in 1980, the budget of Crash, $10 million, wasn't comfortably A-grade by 1996, but it was hardly B-level either. The film's imagery was another matter: [...] "On its scandalizing surface, David Cronenberg's Crash suggests exploitation at its most disturbingly sick," [...] is how Janet Maslin's New York Times review begins. The review ends with an explanation of the film's rating: [...] "Crash has the NC-17 rating (No one under 17 admitted) that it fully <b>deserves.</b> <b>It</b> includes frontal nudity, many sexual encounters and coolly grotesque situations linking sex and violence in graphic, sickening ways." [...] Financed, like King of New York, by a consortium of production companies, it was ultimately picked up for U.S. distribution by Fine Line Features. In more ways than one, this result resonated perfectly with the way the film scrambled definitions: Fine Line was a subsidiary of New Line, recently merged into the Time Warner empire—specifically, it was the old exploitation distributor's arthouse division.|$|E
2500|$|Mikael Wood for the Los Angeles Times {{enjoyed the}} first Gibson Amphitheatre concert, writing that it [...] "had the triumphant, {{sometimes}} self-satisfied {{feel of a}} victory lap." [...] MTV's Aimee Curran also gave the concert a positive review, writing: [...] "The cast {{was able to make}} every song their own while still managing to maintain the original artist's integrity." [...] Hahn Nguyen of Zap2it wrote: [...] "seeing it live is well worth the money and effort. Not only is there an elevated, infectious energy you don't get from just watching the show at home, but the feeling of togetherness can't be matched." [...] and [...] "One can truly hear the quality of the live vocals, which in the case of Lea Michele is the real deal. She sounds even better than on the show...Her [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] live is an amazing and thrilling treat." [...] Variety Andrew Barker gave a less favorable review, writing: [...] "while its distinctive blend of high camp and recognizable tunes may click on the small screen, when translated to stage the conceit becomes little more than a frantic, under-imagined jukeboxer, and only occasionally a well-performed one. Four-city tour will likely rake in the cash and merit a reprise, but whether it <b>deserves</b> <b>it</b> is a different matter." [...] Though he did, again, note Riley's [...] "solid" [...] performances and calling Lea Michele [...] "the most obvious pro" [...] claiming her songs were performed [...] "with power and presence". [...] "Wisely, the producers never left either woman offstage for long."" ...|$|E

2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who <b>deserves</b> <b>it.</b> He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool. [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold, please see the DVD), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a [...] "Mini de Ville" [...] by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in [...] "More Deadly Than the Sword". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: [...] "So clever, but oh so vulnerable." [...] This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian naïveté.|$|E
