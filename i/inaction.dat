40|$|This study targets the {{decision-making}} process and the politico-administrative relations in the Public Procurement Review System in Albania (PPRS). The inner logic {{of this study is}} composed of interrelation between decision making and accountability of actions and <b>inactions,</b> which pose the risk for decision making to face corruption {{due to the lack of}} legal and/or social auditing mechanisms. The study targets decision making in Public Procurement Commission (PPC) in Albania by reviewing decisions to identify stable patterns of fl awed, inconsistent interpretation which allow corruptive actions and <b>inactions</b> to take part...|$|R

50|$|An IRP is an {{alternate}} dispute resolution (ADR) juridical mechanism that empowers an Independent Panel of Jurists, {{acting as a}} third-party, {{to engage in a}} detailed, procedure-based accountability review process. The standard of adjudication, legal and policy review required in an IRP is very high, since the complainant, who is materially affected by the ICANN Board action or decision, has to prove that certain actions that have been taken by ICANN have violated the Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation of the organization. In deciding the IRP, the Panel has to compare the contested actions (or <b>inactions)</b> of the ICANN Board against the existing stipulations laid down in the Bylaws or Articles of Incorporation of ICANN by focusing on a pre-defined standard of review; and to rule whether such actions or <b>inactions</b> were wrongful and had indeed violated the Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation.|$|R

5|$|Kapil {{initially}} did not resign {{or take a}} {{leave of}} absence, from his coaching responsibilities. As the weeks progressed and as public discontent mounting on <b>inaction</b> in the match-fixing scandal and {{in no small measure}} the pressure from the then Union Sport Minister Shukdev Singh Dhindsa, Kapil Dev resigned from his position of Indian Cricket Coach on 12 September 2000 vowing farewell to the game of cricket.|$|E
5|$|The Armero {{catastrophe}} came {{shortly after}} the M-19 guerrilla group's raid and subsequent Palace of Justice siege on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation.

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{barriers to the}} widespread implementation of large-scale renewable energy and low carbon energy strategies are primarily political and not technological. According to the 2013 Post Carbon Pathways report, which reviewed many international studies, the key roadblocks are: climate change denial, the fossil fuels lobby, political <b>inaction,</b> unsustainable energy consumption, outdated energy infrastructure, and financial constraints.|$|E

5|$|The {{story has}} been retold many times and used to {{illustrate}} widely varying viewpoints. Among them: in 1960 about sympathy towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War; in 1980 about the impending collapse of civilization anticipated by survivalists; in the 1990s about <b>inaction</b> in response to climate change and staying in abusive relationships. It has also been used by libertarians to warn about slow erosion of civil rights.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote to Florence agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An <b>inaction</b> he would later grow to lament.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s. As with most major highway projects, the divided highway {{expansion}} projects received partial federal funding, and starting in 1970, those federally aided projects required {{environmental impact assessment}} under the National Environmental Policy Act. This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state <b>inaction</b> in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E

50|$|The racial {{theories}} {{were applied}} {{also in the}} British Raj in the great famine of India in 1876. Millions had begun to starve while Lord Lytton prepared to celebrate the coronation of Queen Victoria as Empress of India. The viceroy justified his <b>inactions</b> with the arguments of the social Darwinists and introduced a system of camps with heavy labour, which effectively became death camps.|$|R
5000|$|DCA Trust {{prevailed in}} the Independent Review Process ("IRP”) against ICANN when the Panel of jurists ruled on 9 July 2015, that ICANN {{violated}} its Bylaws and Articles of Incorporation; and therefore declared “that both the actions and <b>inactions</b> of the Board {{with respect to the}} application of DCA Trust relating to the [...]AFRICA gTLD were inconsistent with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of ICANN”.|$|R
5|$|<b>Inaction</b> chafed Ball, and {{he began}} {{agitating}} {{for a return to}} combat duty. He finally managed to obtain a posting as a flight commander with No.56 Squadron RFC, considered to be as close to an elite unit as any established by the RFC. Ball was still first among Britain's aces, and some documents hint that his attachment to No.56 Squadron was planned to be temporary. According to one account he had been slated to serve with the unit for only a month to mentor novice pilots.|$|E
5|$|Račić {{signed a}} mutual {{cooperation}} agreement against the occupation {{forces with the}} commander of the Podrinje Partisans, Nebojša Jerković. Due to its lack of action against the Germans and puppet government, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment became quite isolated. Their leadership realised that the Partisans were getting stronger with each success against the occupiers, and the Chetnik position was becoming relatively weaker due to their <b>inaction.</b> Misita's decision to attack Loznica was a consequence of the cooperation agreement Račić signed with the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|Shein's army {{retreated to}} its main camp, {{which was in}} turn {{surrounded}} by Commonwealth forces in mid-October. The besieged Russians waited for relief, but none arrived, as Commonwealth and Cossack cavalry {{had been sent to}} disrupt the Russian rear. Some historians also cite dissent and internal divisions in the Russian camp as responsible for their <b>inaction</b> and ineffectiveness (Jasienica blames the Russian warlords, and Parker the foreign mercenaries). The Tatar invasion threatening the south Russian borderlands was a contributory factor, with many soldiers and boyars from those regions deserting the Russian camp to return to protect their homes. Some foreign mercenaries also deserted to the Commonwealth side.|$|E

50|$|After {{the hanging}} of Afzal Guru, Ratanpuri often criticised his Governments <b>inactions</b> and wrong policies, thereby turning {{him into an}} outcast in his own party.

The Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah also chose {{to ask him to}} leave the party, but took no action for his removal.|$|R
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for <b>inaction,</b> supporters responded by saying there was little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's <b>inaction,</b> and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a few years earlier, {{which is why he}} could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.|$|E
5|$|The {{war against}} Bulgaria {{was the first}} major {{undertaking}} carried out by Basil II after his ascension to the throne in 976, although the Bulgarian attacks had begun in that year. One {{of the reasons for the}} ten years of <b>inaction</b> was the policy of one of the strongest nobles in Byzantium, Basil, who de facto ruled the Byzantine Empire in the first years of his namesake. During that time, the main objective of the government in Constantinople was to crush the rebellion of the military commander Bardas Skleros in Asia Minor between 976 and 979.|$|E
