5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or <b>gunmetal,</b> with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{the first}} Commonwealth nation to create its own VC, on 15 January 1991. Although it is a {{separate}} award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart. Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE. The New Zealand and Australian awards are still made by the jewellers Hancocks from the <b>gunmetal</b> used for the originals. The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{is a heavy}} smoker, at {{one point}} smoking 70 {{cigarettes}} a day. Bond has his cigarettes custom-made by Morland of Grosvenor Street, mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal; the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter. Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide <b>gunmetal</b> cigarette case which carried fifty; he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter. The cigarettes {{were the same as}} Fleming's, who had been buying his at Morland since the 1930s; the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander's rank. On average, Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day, although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball: Fleming himself smoked up to 80 cigarettes a day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gunmetal's</b> game {{engine was}} {{developed}} by Mad Genius Software. It was not, as many people at the time suspected, a Doom clone. It includes realistic lighting, spotlights, direct sunlight, and partial reflectivity (for reflections in pools and other details). At the time, very few video games had all of these features. It also featured original digital music.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{production}} of brass during the centuries immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Roman Empire. Disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from Western Europe may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the 6th-7th centuries AD over 90% of copper alloy artefacts from Egypt were made of brass. However other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the Islamic and Byzantine world. Conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in Western Europe during this period in favour of <b>gunmetals</b> and other mixed alloys but by about 1000 brass artefacts are found in Scandinavian graves in Scotland, brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in Northumbria and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of brass in Germany and The Low Countries, areas rich in calamine ore.|$|R
5|$|The {{barrels of}} the cannon used {{to cast the}} medals are {{stationed}} outside the Officers' Mess, at the Royal Artillery Barracks at Woolwich. The remaining portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 10kilograms (358oz), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington, and can be removed only under armed guard. It is estimated that 80 to 85 more Victoria Crosses could be cast from this source. A single company of jewellers, Hancocks of London, established in 1849, {{has been responsible for}} the production of every medal since its inception. Both the Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses are made from the same <b>gunmetal</b> as the originals.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins as police {{officers}} and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a <b>gunmetal</b> grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.|$|E

25|$|The R32 GT-R {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1988 including prototype cars. The first six Nismos {{were built in}} 1989. The other 554 NISMO GT-Rs were all built in 1990 and were all <b>Gunmetal</b> Grey in color.|$|E
25|$|The new {{lighthouse}} {{was designed}} by James Barnet in a design similar to the original tower, albeit built in stronger materials. The crown and the lantern room were larger so a larger apparatus can be accommodated. Also added was a black <b>gunmetal</b> railing, which was {{to become one of}} Barnet's hallmarks.|$|E
25|$|The dress sword for Heavy Cavalry {{officers}} was a {{much smaller}} and lighter weapon, having a knucklebow, ovoid pommel and boat-shell guard in gilt brass or <b>gunmetal.</b> The blade was much shorter and narrower than the service sword's, and usually double edged with a short narrow central fuller each side. The dress sword usually had a leather scabbard with gilt brass mounts, however, a number of examples exist of swords with iron service scabbards, suggesting that some officers may have employed the dress sword in the field.|$|E
25|$|Each leaf of {{the doors}} was cast as a single piece. Given the size (left: 472.0 x 125.0cm, right: 472.0 x 114.5cm, maximum {{thickness}} c. 3.5-4.5cm) and enormous weight (both c. 1.85 tonnes) {{of the doors}}, {{this is a great}} achievement for its time. The raw material for the casting was <b>Gunmetal,</b> which consisted predominantly of copper (above 80%) with roughly equal parts of lead, tin, and zinc. To date material analysis {{has not been able to}} show which ore deposit the metal came from, though the ironworks at Rammelsberg near Goslar has been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|BC Lions – Introduced a black {{alternate}} {{uniform in}} 2005 {{loosely based on}} the 1960s jersey, initially worn with white helmets. Switched to orange helmets with black uniform from 2006 to 2008, including the 2006 West final and 94th Grey Cup win. Worn with black retro helmets in 2009 and 2010 seasons. Retired the jerseys in 2011 wearing white helmets, in the final game at Empire Field. Introduced <b>gunmetal</b> uniforms, first worn on August 17, 2013, and worn twice during the 2013 and 2014 seasons, including an away game in Toronto on August 17, 2014. The Lions did not wear a third jersey in 2015 or 2016.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Victoria Cross {{was introduced}} in 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. That medal had been awarded 25 times to 24 individual military personnel from New Zealand; Captain Charles Upham receiving a bar. Only 14 medals have been awarded {{since the end of}} the Second World War. The medal is made from the <b>gunmetal</b> of a weapon supposedly captured at the siege of Sevastopol, but several historians have since questioned the true origin of the <b>gunmetal.</b> Originally all Commonwealth recipients were issued with the same award, but over the last 50 years, some Commonwealth countries have introduced separate award systems; three of these retain [...] "Victoria Cross" [...] as part of the name of the highest award for gallantry.|$|E
500|$|The Australian and New Zealand Victoria Crosses {{are made}} from the same <b>gunmetal</b> as the originals. It was {{originally}} intended that the VCs would be cast from the bronze [...] of two cannon that were captured from the Russians at the siege of Sevastopol. The historian John Glanfield has since shown that the metal used for VCs is in fact from Chinese cannon not Russian, and their origin is a mystery.|$|E
500|$|On top of {{the tower}} is a {{bluestone}} gallery and balcony with <b>gunmetal</b> railings. The gallery has a painted cast iron floor grate with a cast iron stair leading to the outdoor gallery. The lantern room is atop this gallery, made of metal and glass, encircled and protected by perspex and aluminium panels. It has a decorative iron catwalk encircling the glass to allow for cleaning. The lantern house is the original [...] Chance Bros. cast iron and copper lantern house, one of about 21 known to exist in Australia.|$|E
500|$|The first 48 {{members of}} the class were named after places in the West Country served by its trains or close to its lines. This {{represented}} a publicity success due to many of the locomotives being able to visit their namesake areas. Many 'West Country' locomotives sported an additional plaque with the coat of arms of the town or region the locomotive was named after. This plaque was mounted on the casing between the <b>gunmetal</b> locomotive nameplate and the West Country Class scroll, above the middle driving wheel. Several {{members of the}} class had only the nameplate and the [...] "West Country Class" [...] scroll, a gap being left where a crest would have been mounted. The background of the nameplate was usually painted red, though sometimes examples could be found in black if the locomotive works undertaking overhaul of the engine could not locate the correct colour paint.|$|E
500|$|Australia was {{the first}} Commonwealth realm to create its own VC, on 15 January 1991. Although it is a {{separate}} award, its appearance is identical to its British counterpart. [...] Canada followed suit when in 1993 Queen Elizabeth signed Letters Patent creating the Canadian VC, which is also similar to the British version, except that the legend has been changed from FOR VALOUR to the Latin PRO VALORE This language was chosen so as to favour neither French nor English, the two official languages of Canada. New Zealand was the third country to adapt the VC into its own honours system. While the New Zealand and Australian VCs are technically separate awards, the decoration {{is identical to the}} British design, including being cast from the same Crimean War <b>gunmetal</b> as the British VC. The Canadian Victoria Cross also includes metal from the same cannon, along with copper and other metals from all regions of Canada.|$|E
500|$|Maverick {{features}} six three-car steam-era style trains {{that seat}} twelve passengers each. The trains have tiered seating and are named and colored as follows: Brett— Brass, Brent— Gold, Ben— <b>Gunmetal,</b> Beau— Gold, Bart— Silver, [...] and Sam— Copper. The restraint system, similar to Accelerator Coasters, includes a hydraulic {{over the shoulder}} harness and an interlocking seat belt. The station features an elevated dual unloading and loading platform enabling two trains to be loaded and unloaded simultaneously. Maverick features western music, contributing to the western theme. There is also an elevator shaft designed {{to look like a}} silo, that also contributes to the western theme. The passenger height restriction was initially set to a minimum of [...] In May 2007, the height restriction was raised to a minimum of [...] per recommendations made by Intamin. At the 2015 Winter Chill Out, Cedar Point announced that the traditional over the shoulder restraints would be replaced with the soft vest style restraints seen on Intimidator 305.|$|E
500|$|The VC was {{introduced}} on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War. The traditional {{explanation of the}} source of the <b>gunmetal</b> from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol. Recent research has thrown doubt on this story, suggesting a variety of origins. The original Royal Warrant did not contain a specific clause regarding posthumous awards, although official policy was to not award the VC posthumously. Between 1897 and 1901, several notices were issued in the London Gazette regarding soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, six of the soldiers mentioned were granted the VC, but not [...] "officially" [...] awarded the medal. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the six officers and men. The Victoria Cross warrant was not officially amended to explicitly allow posthumous awards until 1920 but one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the motive}} power of screw {{propulsion}} is delivered along the shaft, a thrust bearing {{is needed to}} transfer that load to the hull without excessive friction. SS Great Britain had a 2ft diameter <b>gunmetal</b> plate on the forward end of the shaft which bore against a steel plate attached to the engine beds. Water at 200 psi was injected between these two surfaces to lubricate and separate them. This arrangement was not sufficient for higher engine powers and oil lubricated [...] "collar" [...] thrust bearings became standard from the early 1850s. This was superseded {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century by floating pad bearing which automatically built up wedges of oil which could withstand bearing pressures of 500 psi or more.|$|E
