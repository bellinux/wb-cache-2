2500|$|In Canada, {{expropriation}} {{is governed}} by federal or provincial statutes. Under these statutory regimes, public authorities {{have the right to}} acquire private property for public purposes, so long as the acquisition is approved by the appropriate government body. Once a property is taken, an owner is entitled to [...] "be made whole" [...] by compensation for: the market value of the expropriated property, injurious affection to the remainder of the property (if any), disturbance damages, business loss, and special difficulty relocating. Owners can advance claims for compensation above that initially provided by the <b>expropriating</b> <b>authority</b> by bringing a claim before the court or an administrative body appointed by the governing legislation.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} unique case of de facto {{expropriation}} {{to illustrate the}} lack of sufficient protection to private property in Canada. The article will review the case law with respect to expropriation in Canada and Australia and conclude that Canada should adopt the Australian attitude in order to afford landowners more protection from unfair practice of the <b>expropriating</b> <b>authority...</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1913, Moore built a {{large stone}} {{house on the}} east side of the mouth of the Rouge River in what is now Toronto. The {{property}} consisted of 175 acres that he had purchased from the original patentee, William Holmes. He called the estate Moorlands and it was kept in the family until the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation <b>Authority</b> <b>expropriated</b> it in the 1960s. It was opened to the public as the Petticoat Creek Conservation Area in 1975.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, under the governance of Colonel Carlos Sarmiento, the town was legally named Rivadavia on August 25, 1908. In 1909, the executive branch authorized the creation of a villa in the department for the seat of municipal <b>authorities,</b> <b>expropriating</b> the required land. In 1928 a new law was enacted by the Municipal Regime, which included Rivadavia within the department capital. On March 7, 1935, during Juan Maurín's term of office, new legislation on the subject reappeared independently.|$|R
50|$|Pecci {{defended the}} papacy and its claims. When Italian <b>authorities</b> <b>expropriated</b> convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, {{turning them into}} {{administration}} or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians. The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation, according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were {{to be approved by}} the government before their publication.|$|R
5000|$|The last miller was Roman Ścieżka. Just {{after his}} death [...] "the unknown perpetrators" [...] have {{destroyed}} some of the mill infrastructure based on the river leading to the mill and the authorities have used this fact to withdraw the permission for using the mill. Soon the main springs area has been <b>expropriated</b> by the <b>authorities</b> and {{the course of the}} river leading to the mill has been changed leaving the water mill with no river. There has been a water intake plant built.|$|R
5000|$|The synagogue was in use until 1974, {{when the}} <b>authorities</b> <b>expropriated</b> it {{and gave it}} to the University of Wrocław, which used it as a library. In 1989, the {{university}} transferred the building to the Musical Academy. It was purchased by a private firm in 1995. It was subsequently returned to the Jewish community and was under renovation for over a decade. [...] The renovations were completed and the synagogue rededicated in 2010. There are plans for the synagogue {{to be used as a}} Jewish Museum.|$|R
50|$|A storm {{caused a}} {{landslide}} that destroyed the eastern/northern corner tower, {{leading to a}} formal request to the DGEMN to begin a project of restoration and lookout. Simultaneously, the municipality solicited ideas for {{the reconstruction of the}} castle from Engineer Manuel Tavares dos Santos, but lacking any funds, this project was abandoned. By 1975, the possibility of demolishing the wall along Rua Vaz Preto was examined: the DGEMN analyzed the walls along this corridor in 1977, {{in order to determine the}} viability, while the municipal <b>authority</b> <b>expropriated</b> homes along the segment of the walls.|$|R
5000|$|In contrast, Amnesty International {{highlight}} {{in these}} figures {{the small number}} of Palestinian permit requests (only about 10 percent of the Israeli requests), and argue that this is indicative of the tiny (and ever-shrinking) percentage of land that the Palestinians have available for their use. In 2008 Nicoletta Dimova wrote in the Palestine-Israel Journal that [...] "today, the city's Palestinians are only allowed to build on about 9% of the 17,600 acres of land comprising East Jerusalem", the remainder having been <b>expropriated</b> by Israeli <b>authorities</b> for use by Israeli settlers or as land where Israel currently permits no construction.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, the Old City was conquered by the Jordanian army, and {{the same}} Arab family {{continued}} living in the houses. When Israel conquered East Jerusalem in 1967, the family members returned to the houses and claimed ownership to the property. At the time, the Israeli <b>authorities</b> <b>expropriated</b> and demolished all the houses in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem {{in order to build}} a new neighborhood, and hence the family members were able to collect only compensation, which they felt they were not allowed to collect because of Baruch Mizrachi's will. Instead it was agreed that on the new building, a plaque would be mounted with the family's story.|$|R
50|$|When Vesterbro {{started to}} develop {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, after the city had been allowed to develop beyond its now {{decommissioned}} fortifications, the Royal Shooting Society once again found itself situated in urban surroundings. City <b>authorities</b> <b>expropriated</b> much of its grounds and in 1887, 100 years after the completion of its building, a tall wall was constructed to shield the newly established street Istedgade from stray bullets from the shooting range. The wall was built to the design of architect Ludvig Knudsen in a neo-gothic style. Ludvig Knudsen also modernized the interior of the Shooting Society's mansion in the 1890s and added a small new wing towards the gardens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{they were}} granted {{had been part}} of a medieval almshouse or hospital complex and the interior of the church is to this day dominated by the heavy medieval vaulting. During the upheavals of World War II and the Soviet occupation of Estonia, most Estonian Swedes fled the country and resettled in Sweden, and the Soviet <b>authorities</b> <b>expropriated</b> the building which was used as a sports club until the restoration of Estonia's independence in 1991. In 1992, following a state visit by the king of Sweden, the building once more passed {{into the hands of the}} Estonian-Swedish congregation. The church was reconsecrated after a period of repairs in 2002. Apart from the aforementioned Gothic vaulting, the church is notable for its fine baroque altar (artist Joachim Armbrust) and baptistery (artist Christian Ackermann) ...|$|R

5000|$|King Creek {{is the old}} {{name for}} what {{is now known as}} the East Humber River. Originally a small {{community}} called [...] "Humber Trails" [...] nestled in the valley around the King Creek west of The Mill Road. After hurricane Hazel, in the fall of 1954, the Toronto Regional Park <b>Authority</b> <b>expropriated</b> the land creating the Humber Trails Conservation area. One street named Elmpine Trails, {{on the south side of}} the King Creek, was not expropriated as the homes were on high ground with no chance of a flood damaging the houses. Several properties on the Mill Road were also not expropriated for the same reason. For approximately fifteen years the Humber Trails Conservation Area was a manicured Park. However a decision was made to allow the park to become a nature preserve. Today there are few signs that streets and homes and later, a manicured park had existed in the valley, except for a few walking paths and a Humber Trails post office structure that was assimilated into the buildings of a private residence and working farm located on either side of Mill Road. King Township, Ontario, Canada.The area is located immediately east of Nobleton. To the east is King City.|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, about 1275 acre {{of land in}} the Israeli Arab {{villages of}} Deir al-Asad, Bi'ina and Nahf were {{declared}} [...] "closed areas" [...] by Israeli authorities. This area, near the main road between Acre and Safed, had been an important marble quarrying site. In 1961, the Israeli <b>authorities</b> <b>expropriated</b> the land to build Karmiel. The villagers offered [...] "equally good land" [...] in the area, but when Moshe Sneh (Maki) and Yusef Khamis (Mapam) brought the case to the Knesset on behalf of the villagers, the Knesset established that there was no such land. According to the Haredi newspaper She'arim, about 10 km2 (394 lots) were confiscated by a court order on 4 March 1963, {{at the request of the}} Israel Development Authority. However, the land was rocky, uninhabited and unfit for agriculture.In 1964, when local Arabs applied for permission to move into the town, Minister of Housing Yosef Almogi replied that [...] "Karmiel was not built to solve the problems for the people in the surrounding area." [...] In February 1965, 400 protesters marched from Tel Aviv to protest against [...] "discrimination of a group of our citizens". Representatives went to a local police station, informing the police that they were staying in the area without permission. Eventually the perceived leaders were arrested and tried before a military tribunal.|$|R
40|$|In his {{exhaustive}} {{study of}} ‘shamanism’ among the Altaic peoples in Southern Siberia, the renowned Soviet ethnographer Leonid P. Potapov contends that ‘under the present conditions {{there are no}} remnants or survivals of Shamanism as such left in Altai’. What remains are legends and reminiscences, but these {{can no longer be}} told by people with personal experiences of Altaic ‘shamans’ and their rituals. According to Potapov, modern socialist culture has changed the minds of the Altaic peoples to the degree that they are now a materialistically thinking people, and ‘shamanism’ has completely disappeared. In addition, he contends that there are no prospects of its return after the deathblow dealt by Soviet anti-religious repression in the 1930 s ‘shamanic’ rituals were forbidden and ritual paraphernalia such as drums and costumes were <b>expropriated</b> by the <b>authorities.</b> Considering that Potapov in his study follows Altaic ‘shamanism’ through 1500 years, depicting it as a ‘religion’ and ‘theology’ which stayed more or less intact over the centuries, his statement seems more like a pious hope based on the Soviet vision of a society liberated from superstition, religion, and spiritual exploitation. Potapov himself delineates Altaic ‘shamanism’s’ development from a ‘state religion’to a ‘folk religion’. From this perspective it might seem remarkable that ‘shamanism’ should not have survived 70 years of atheist repression, missionary work and the Soviet transformation of society. Already by the time Potapov’s book was published, during the very last months of the existence of the Soviet Union, there had, in fact, appeared a number of persons claiming to be ‘shamans’, with an ancestry dating from the time of ‘shamans’ {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century. These individuals were also part of organisations and movements promoting the revival of ‘shamanism’ in the autonomous Altai Republic. In other parts of the former Soviet Union similar processes took place. Today, in post-Soviet Altai, as well as in many other parts of Siberia, shamanism exists in the same sense that there is Buddhism, Christianity and Islam in the region. ...|$|R
