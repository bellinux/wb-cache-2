30|$|The {{mechanism}} of differentiation of tracheid (earlywood or latewood) should be elucidated {{to improve the}} wood properties of sugi trees (Cryptomeria japonica). Water deficit affects tracheid differentiation in conifers. However, the signals, which transmit the information of water contents in the soil to the differentiating tracheid, remain unknown. Plant responses with deficits of macronutrients or water showed some differences but also similarities, mostly involving hormonal long-distance signaling. In Arabidopsis, trans-zeatin (tZ)-type cytokinins play a role as a root-to-shoot acropetal signal. In this study, we report the effects <b>of</b> applying <b>tZ</b> alone or {{in combination with other}} phytohormones on tracheid differentiation in mature sugi trees forming latewood.

The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> against the mobile spirochetes was> 128 µg/ml at 37 °C in micro-oxic atmos-phere when incubated for 14 days. TZ significantly reduced {{the conversion of}} mobile spirochetes to cystic forms during incubation. The MBC for older (10 -months-old) cysts at 37 °C in a micro-oxic atmosphere was> 0. 5 µg/ml, but> 0. 125 µg/ml for young (1 -day-old) cysts. Acridine orange staining, dark-field microscopy and transmission electron microscopy revealed that, when the concen-tration <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> was ≥ MBC, {{the contents of the}} cysts were partly degraded, core structures did not develop inside the young cysts, and the amount of RNA in these cysts decreased significantly. When cysts were exposed to TZ, both the spirochetal structures and core structures inside the cysts dissolved, and the production of blebs was significantly reduced. These observations may be valuable in the treat-ment of resistant infections caused by B. burgdorferi, and suggest that a combina-tion <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> and a macrolide antibiotic could eradicate both cystic and mobile form...|$|R

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB), {{caused by}} Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{has been treated}} with the same arsenal of {{antibiotics}} since the 1970 s; and with an estimated {{one third of the}} world s population latently infected at the moment, new regimens are sorely needed. Treatment remains lengthy and difficult, and inappropriate dosing or administration of drugs as well as patient non-compliance is contributing to the rising threat of multi-, extensively- and now totally- drug resistant TB. Should further expansion of resistant strains become a reality it would render our current antibiotics useless. To address the need for new therapies, this thesis explores both in vitro and in vivo approaches using a novel nanoparticle-based efflux pump inhibitor-antibiotic combination treatment. Bacterial efflux pumps (EPs) are inducible membrane-based transporters that can reduce intracellular concentrations of drugs, which leaves open a window for the development of permanent genetic drug resistance. By blocking these EPs with EP inhibitors such as thioridazine (TZ), while simultaneously treating {{with one of the most}} efficient anti-TB drugs, rifampicin (RIF), we predicted a synergistic effect likely caused by an increased intracellular concentration of both drugs in the bacteria. The first aim of this study was to develop a protocol for the encapsulation <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> in polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid nanoparticles (PLGA NPs). Our group has previously established that PLGA NPs with RIF localize in the same cells as the bacteria, and improve therapy both in vitro and in vivo relative to free drug. Slow release from these particles and facilitated macrophage uptake could potentially lead to treatment that can be administered less frequently in a more targeted and consequently less toxic manner. This may be especially beneficial in the case <b>of</b> <b>TZ,</b> which is associated with serious dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. The second aim of the study was therefore to determine if the encapsulated form <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> was less toxic than the free form. The third aim of this study was to explore the possible role <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> as a potentiator of traditional anti-TB therapy. We found that encapsulating TZ in PLGA NPs reduced TZ toxicity, and had a synergistic effect when administered together with RIF. This was the case both in vitro, in primary murine macrophages infected with Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and in vivo, in the zebrafish model infected with Mycobacterium marinum...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A pilot-scale {{treatment}} zone (TZ) injected {{across the}} width of a carbon tetrachloride (CT) plume effectively decreased the concentration of CT in groundwater at downgradient wells by 97 % within 13 months, with no accumulation of degradation products. The CT plume extends from a grain elevator approximately 2, 500 feet (760 meters) downgradient where it discharges into a small creek; the highest concentrations of CT (2, 500 µg/L) are located near the source area. Chloroform (CF), chloromethane, and methylene chloride have also been identified in study area groundwater. Bench-scale testing was conducted using soil and groundwater collected from the study area to identify the preferred pilot test remedial technology – injection of Adventus EHC ™ across the plume width near the source area to form the TZ. EHC acts through in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) and combines controlled-release, fibrous organic carbon, and micro-scale zero-valent iron. Following injection of EHC into the aquifer, various physical, chemical, and microbiological processes combine to create strongly reducing conditions in situ that stimulate rapid dechlorination of CT and other chlorinated solvents. Groundwater sampling results as early as four months after installation <b>of</b> the <b>TZ</b> showed a 76 % and 88 % decline in CT concentration at monitoring wells located 70 and 140 feet (21 and 43 meters) downgradient <b>of</b> the <b>TZ,</b> respectively. Groundwater sampling results 13 to 22 months after installation <b>of</b> the <b>TZ</b> have shown a 97 % decline in CT concentration 70 feet (21 meters) downgradient <b>of</b> the <b>TZ.</b> Groundwater sampling results 22 months after installation <b>of</b> the <b>TZ</b> have shown a 88 % decline in CT concentration 600 feet (183 meters) downgradient <b>of</b> the <b>TZ.</b> Implementation <b>of</b> this remedial technology as a pilot test has allowed us to achieve cleanup goals. Following implementation <b>of</b> the EHC <b>TZ</b> and upon acquiring groundwater data that document the success of this remedial technology, our client received an approved voluntary cleanup plan from the state regulatory agency as part of a long-term remediation solution...|$|R
50|$|Třinec Iron and Steel Works (TŽ) (Třinecké železárny, Huta trzyniecka) is a {{producer}} of long rolled steel products in Třinec, Moravian-Silesian Region, Czech Republic. TŽ produces {{over a third of}} all steel produced in the Czech Republic (roughly 2.5 million tons annually). Since its establishment, Třinecké železárny's plants have produced more than 150 million tons of crude steel.

40|$|Aims. TZ Fornacis is an evolved {{binary system}} with an orbital period of 75. 7 days and a {{circular}} orbit. The two stars have similar masses (2. 045 ± 0. 055 and 1. 945 ± 0. 027 M) but very different radii: 8. 33 ± 0. 12 and 3. 966 ± 0. 088 R. One {{of its most}} interesting characteristics {{is that while the}} primary rotates synchronously with the mean orbital angular velocity, the secondary is rotating 16 times faster than this reference value. The stellar and tidal evolution of such a system was investigated in the past using some simplifications: integration of the time scales for circularization and synchronization that are valid only for low eccentricities and small departures from the synchronism, which are not fully valid for the case <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> Fornacis. Another detected problem is the inconsistency between the observed levels of circularization/synchronization and the theoretical critical times and the inferred age (the time of synchronization of the secondary was found to be shorter than its age). The main goal of the present paper is to advance a little more in our understanding of the stellar and tidal evolution <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> For. Methods. In order to improve our understanding of the tidal evolution <b>of</b> <b>TZ</b> For, we adopt new absolute dimensions and compute specific stellar evolutionary models for the precise observed masses. We explicitly integrate the differential equations that govern the tidal evolution (eccentricity, angular velocities and orbital period) by using these stellar models. Results. The stellar models indicate that there are two possibilities for the position of the primary on the HR diagram: case A (primary on the clump) and case B (primary on the first ascendent branch). The integration of the complete differential equations of tida...|$|R
