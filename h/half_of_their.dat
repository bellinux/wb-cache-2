5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964.

Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later.

As the astronauts descend, an electrical storm damages their Dove lander shuttle, which crashes in a mountainous region near Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. When an air-sea rescue unit returns Ross and Kane, the latter critically injured, to the Space Centre, it appears that the Phoenix mission has returned to Earth.|$|E

40|$|Background. Finding a usual {{source of}} care (USC) is {{difficult}} for certain populations. This analysis determines how insurance type and having a USC affect the settings in which patients seek care. Methods. In this cross-sectional study of the 2000 – 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys, we assessed the percentage of low-income persons with <b>half</b> or more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory visits to the emergency department (ED). Respondents were stratified based on insurance type and presence of a USC. Results. In 2011, among Medicaid enrollees without USCs, 21. 6 % had <b>half</b> or more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory visits to EDs compared to 8. 1 % for those with USCs. Among the uninsured without USCs, 24. 1 % went to an ED for <b>half</b> or more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory visits compared to 8. 8 % for those with USCs in 2011. Among the privately insured without USCs, 7. 8 % went to an ED for <b>half</b> or more <b>of</b> <b>their</b> ambulatory visits compared to 5. 0 % for those with USCs in 2011. These differences remained in multivariate analyses. Conclusions. Those who lack USCs, particularly the uninsured and Medicaid enrollees, {{are more likely to}} rely on EDs...|$|R

5|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} estates were managed by single families. The father acted {{as the head}} manager, the sons as field workers. Wives and daughters worked with female servants to weave cloth and produce silk. Very wealthy landowners who had a large peasant following often used a sharecropping system to similar to the government's system for state-owned lands.
