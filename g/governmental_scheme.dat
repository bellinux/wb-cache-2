5000|$|The Madisonian Model is a {{fundamental}} philosophy of Presidential conduct that adheres primarily to the denoted powers {{of the executive branch}} in the U.S. Constitution. First exhibited by James Madison, the model is a philosophy of the use of the presidential powers.The Madisonian model is a structure of government in which the powers of the government are separated into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. This came about because the delegates saw the need to structure the government in such a way to prevent the imposition of tyranny by either majority or by a minority. [...] James Madison proposed this <b>governmental</b> <b>scheme</b> so that one branch would not accumulate enough power to influence the others (or, in the worst case, become dominant). The separation of powers was by function and also by personnel; this is a result of Congress passing laws, the president enforcing laws, and the courts interpreting the laws. The three branches of government will be independent from each other, yet the three will have to cooperate to govern. In the Federalist Paper No. 51, Madison illustrated his beliefs on how a balance in the power was necessary for a government to exist.|$|E
40|$|As {{illustrated}} by liquidity support, equity injections and asset repurchases in financial crises and by IMF credit lines to countries, authorities often intervene {{in order to}} revive markets that have dried up or to create new ones. In such situations, agents participate only if they receive from the <b>governmental</b> <b>scheme</b> {{more than in the}} marketplace, while the market outcome depends on who joins the scheme. The paper provides a first analysis of market jumpstarting and its two-way interaction between mechanism design and participation constraints. In the model, sellers in need of cash have private information about the value of their legacy asset. The absence of buyer confidence forces authorities to intervene to jump-start the market. We characterize the optimal intervention, and draw two main implications. First, the government should clean up the market, through buybacks of the weakest assets and then through some equity injections, and leave the agents with the strongest legacy assets to the market. In particular, authorities should not substitute fully for the market, even when they have no comparative disadvantage in acquiring assets or shares thereof. Second, the government creates its own competition by cleaning up the market from its most toxic pieces. At the optimal intervention the government always strictly overpays for the legacy asset. Yet, and unlike what would be suggested by Coasian profit evasion, the existence of a later market imposes no welfare cost. While it is cast in a public intervention context, the analysis of mechanismdependent reservation utilities also admits important private sector applications...|$|E

40|$|The Revista de Crítica Cultural, {{under the}} {{direction}} of the academic Nelly Richard, appeared in 1990 at the same time as the return to democracy in Chile after 17 years of dictatorship. This journal fostered incisive critical thinking and was one of the most fruitful non-governmental spaces for reflection, criticism, and proposals in order to rethink and reconstruct the fragmented memory of Chile. The journal focused on the new international conditions that were related to the diminishing of global left-wing movements and to the emergence of a victorious transnational capitalism. In this dissertation, I propose to understand the new codes and narratives that appeared in the Revista. I am putting particular attention to how the journal allows us to better understand the post-dictator period, and also I am exam the journal’s use of post-modernist or post-structuralist modes of thought as tools for thinking about Chile and Latin America beyond the classic notions of identity, people, and nation. In particular, I want to observe if these new modes of thought contributed to an inadvertent form of complicity with the neoliberal model or to resistance against it. Taking the journal as the setting of overlapping reflections and diverse multidisciplinary dialogues, I inquire into the relationship among the intellectuals participating in the production of a new culture in Chile during the early years of the restoration of democracy (1990 - 2008). I explore how the journal can be thought of as a critical experience of the governmental situation in Chile, that is, as an attempt to rearticulate a new academic leftism that is not complicit in the neoliberal <b>governmental</b> <b>scheme</b> that still dominates the country. The journal was able to link different disciplines like cultural critique, cultural studies, literature, and especially the ceaseless discussion about modernity and post-modernity, aesthetics and politics. This reflection moves on to the question of the particularity of what the journal is proposing, not only the participation of the heterogeneous theoretical voices, but also the changes in the journal’s purpose over eighteen years of existence. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the impact of community involvement on management of water tanks in the Arkavathi sub-basin in the state of Karnataka, South India. Water management was analysed from a socio-environmental perspective, with emphasis on village-level stakeholders’ roles and perceived responsibility. The efficiency of community participation was investigated by comparing two villages having undergone the same World Bank launched program to restore water bodies traditionally used to sustain the livelihood of the rural population. In one village there was a resistance towards how the implementation of the tank rejuvenation project had been performed, in the other there was no local involvement. A minor field study was conducted by visiting the two villages. Qualitative interviews were held with village-level stakeholders of three age groups, to analyse changes over time in knowledge and attitudes. Additionally, ocular observation and photo documentation were made of the study areas. Some informal interviews were carried out with members of an external non-governmental organisation and locals in the study villages. The collected data were analysed by comparing the results for the two villages, as well as the results of the different age groups and genders. There were significant differences in awareness and sense of responsibility, but not knowledge, between the two villages. In the village with a community involvement resisting the <b>governmental</b> <b>scheme</b> for tank renovation, this involvement had proved to be of some advantage to the local community. Contrary to the guidelines, the governmental implementation of the water management strategy did not include local stakeholders’ participation, nor were the tanks restored. Overall, the villagers considered the tank management to be the responsibility of external authorities. There were generally no significant differences between the age groups or men and women, though there were indications of a lower level of knowledge and awareness in women. Absence of effective institutions for water management on all levels as well as difficulties in mainatining efficient village level leadership for community participation are factors causing a major gap between planning and implementation...|$|E

40|$|The {{demonetisation}} {{that took}} place in India in November 2016 caused an unprecedented shock. Among its other objectives, the measure was championed as an efficient means to promote a less-cash economy, in order to formalise economic transactions and boost social protection. This paper draws on ground-breaking data from rural South India to voice serious reservations over those stated goals. In the short run, the importance of cash in the Indian economy resulted in this measure strongly affecting employment, daily financial practices, and social network use for over three months. People came to rely more strongly on their networks to sustain their economic and social activities. Demonetisation has not fought, but has largely strengthened the informal economy. It has also probably further marginalised those without supportive networks. In a context such as India, where state social protection is weak and <b>governmental</b> <b>schemes</b> are notoriously subject to patronage and clientelistic networks, dense networks of supportive relatives, friends and patrons remain key for safeguarding daily life and the future. It can only be counterproductive to eliminate such arrangements without offering alternative protection. With cashless policies flourishing {{in various parts of the}} world, we believe our findings have major implications, seriously questioning their merit, especially among the most marginalised segments of the population...|$|R

40|$|Recognizing {{that the}} right to free speech for dissidents is {{increasingly}} at risk in the United States, this submission catalogs manifold methods the government has employed to constrain free speech and urges that courts not only serve as a bulwark against further erosion of public expression of dissent but endeavor to restore access to the public forum that recently has been lost. The submission surveys the background of the right to free expression and provides details and examples of the government’s increasing tendency to suppress dissident speech by deploying heavily armed police in demonstrations, committing violent acts against peaceful protesters, engaging in mass arrests, exaggerating the crimes charged against detained demonstrators, and holding those demonstrators for unreasonably long periods of time in ignominious conditions. Further, the paper briefly examines how such government actions violate constitutional protections of speech by deterring participation in public debate. Beyond such street tactics, government in recent years has begun placing public fora off limits by forcing dissenters into protest pens, determining based on viewpoint where they may engage in political expression, or limiting the landscape of free speech via privatization schemes. Thus, the paper analyzes the First Amendment implications of such developments and concludes that courts must defend the right to free expression by limiting or disallowing these <b>governmental</b> <b>schemes</b> that have the effect of limiting access to the public forum...|$|R
40|$|On {{a global}} scale, {{the usage of}} a variety of digital ID and {{surveillance}} technologies in both civic and security governance is increasingly taking place, leading to standardised forms and practices. India is implementing the largest biometric scheme in history. As part of a larger plan to digitalise the country’s governance, the objective of the Unique Identification (UID) project is to enrol the entire populace, roughly speaking 20 % of the world’s population. This dissertation investigates the implementation of biometric IDs in India, asking what are the governmental rationales of biometric identification in India? How does national biometric identification shape the conditions of possibility for governing conduct? And, how do people utilise and appropriate digital, biometric IDs? Based on observation of enrolment sites, semi-structured- and narrative interviews of officials, as well as persons enrolled into the scheme, the dissertation shows how biometric IDs are imagined and experienced. Analytically, the dissertation places the Indian project within the larger framework of governmentality in the post-colony. The concept of appropriation is developed to describe the processes by which <b>governmental</b> <b>schemes</b> are altered or modified to benefit local contexts. I investigate the identification of the homeless in Delhi, narratives on fraud by inhabitants in the northern Indian town of Vrindavan, and the daily utilisation of software by Indian bankers, to describe such processes of subversion. The dissertation shows that standardised biometric tools, albeit applicable to multiple contexts and usages, become enmeshed and appropriated in the contexts in which they are implemented...|$|R

40|$|Mexico {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on fossil fuels. One of the governmental initiatives proposes to investigate the possibilities for biogas production in rural areas. Agricultural producers are highly susceptible to energy price variations {{and in most cases}} the steadily growing prices of electricity and fuels are lowering the profits and income of farmers. Environmental concerns about fossil fuels give additional stimulus towards a switch to more sustainable energy sources. Literature research on different types of biogas production technologies was carried out. Various anaerobic fermentation stages and techniques were studied in order to familiarise with particular features and to understand which of them will be more suitable for locations in rural Mexico, also taking into account the local conditions, availability of raw material, energy demands, etc. Mexico's agricultural policies and <b>governmental</b> support <b>schemes</b> were also studied. The agricultural sector in Mexico is strategically important and brings around 6 % of the country's GDP. Security and availability of energy for the rural areas is crucial. A lot of improvements need to be done in this field to make this sector attractive for investors and more profitable for people who already work there. Such governmental organizations as SAGARPA - The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing, and Food - and its support schemes and programs are aimed to help farmers both financially and technically to overcome the difficulties concerning this procedure. A detailed description of a proposed biogas production plant for a case study project at a milk farm in southern Mexico is presented in this study. Different stages and control strategies of biogas production as well as possibilities for biogas utilization in a small-scale CHP unit are assessed. Economical study was aimed to determine the financial flows of the sample project. A simplified economic analysis showed that the electricity produced in the biogas-driven CHP unit can compete with actual grid electricity prices. In addition, comparatively short payback time could be expected and the available <b>governmental</b> support <b>schemes</b> could be efficiency exploited for a commercially viable biogas production...|$|R

40|$|American {{courts and}} legislatures have {{struggled}} to define the participation rights of genetic fathers in <b>governmental</b> adoption <b>schemes</b> for infants born to unwed mothers {{as a result of}} consensual sexual intercourse. Federal constitutional privacy interests in both paternity opportunity and childrearing compel a certain level of genetic father participation. However, excessive levels of participation undermine the goals of swift, final, and inexpensive adoptions, as well as deny some maternal preferences. The difficulties in balancing genetic father participation with competing interests are well illustrated by recent developments in Florida. There, the so-called "Scarlet Letter" law of 2001 (effectively branding women as promiscuous and unfit parents for little reason) was rather quickly replaced by a "Putative Father Registry" law in 2003. Unfortunately, neither law strikes a proper balance. Scarlet Letter laws are unwarranted (as well as unconstitutional), while putative father registries confer inadequate participation rights for unwed fathers. The most appropriate course of action would be for Florida, and other states, to incorporate a good-faith cooperation responsibility for most genetic mothers during newborn adoptions, under which mothers would have greater duties in naming or helping to name the genetic fathers of newborns who are placed for adoption...|$|R
