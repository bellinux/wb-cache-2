50|$|For high-precision {{measurements}} of very small resistances, the above types of meter are inadequate. This {{is partly because}} the change in deflection itself is small when the resistance measured is too small {{in proportion to the}} intrinsic resistance of the ohmmeter (which can be dealt with through current division), but mostly because the meter's reading is the sum of the resistance of the measuring leads, the contact resistances and the resistance being measured. To reduce this effect, a precision ohmmeter has four terminals, called <b>Kelvin</b> <b>contacts.</b> Two terminals carry the current from and to the meter, while the other two allow the meter to measure the voltage across the resistor. In this arrangement, the power source is connected in series with the resistance to be measured through the external pair of terminals, while the second pair connects in parallel the galvanometer which measures the voltage drop. With this type of meter, any voltage drop due to the resistance of the first pair of leads and their contact resistances is ignored by the meter. This four terminal measurement technique is called Kelvin sensing, after William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, who invented the Kelvin bridge in 1861 to measure very low resistances. The Four-terminal sensing method can also be utilized to conduct accurate {{measurements of}} low resistances.|$|E

Within this framework, this paper presents a study on capillary forces due to capillary condensation. A simulation tool had already been presented using Surface Evolver and Matlab to compute {{the shape of a}} meniscus in accordance with the <b>Kelvin</b> equation and <b>contact</b> angles. The numerical results of this simulation complied well with literature results. One very important result is the ability to compute the evolution of the capillary force depending on the tilt angle of the gripper with respect to the object.

State of the art devices are now achieving efficiencies comparable to much older technologies like silicon, while utilising simple manufacturing processes and starting materials. A key parameter to consider when optimising solar cell devices or when designing new materials is the position and effects of the energy levels in the materials. We present here a comprehensive study of the energy levels present in a common structure of perovskite solar cell using an advanced macroscopic Kelvin probe and UV air photoemission setup. By constructing a detailed map of the energy levels in the system we are able to predict the importance of each layer to the open circuit voltage of the solar cell, which we then back up through measurements of the surface photovoltage of the cell under white illumination. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of air photoemission and <b>Kelvin</b> probe <b>contact</b> potential difference measurements as a method of identifying the factors contributing to the open circuit voltage in a solar cell, as well as being an excellent way of probing the physics of new materials.

Rc(W), where W stands for the contact widths, is found to display a non- / quadratic dependence. Thus, our ex-I perimental observat ions show that the commonly used device scal ing theory which assumes that contact impedance increases inversely with {{the square of the}} scal ing factor is incorrect. In recent years use of the four-terminal Kelvin resistor test structure has been suggested in order to char-acterize the contact resistance of metal- to-semiconductor contacts. [I- 4] Such a structure, however, cannot yield unambiguous values of the con-tact resistance because, as depicted in Figure i, only a port ion of the contact carries the largest fraction of the total current. This situation is common to other methods of contact resistance measurement and was dis-cussed previously. [5] Nevertheless, the four-terminal <b>Kelvin</b> resistor <b>contact</b> structure [2] is very interest-ing because of its s imilar ity to actual device contacts.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the applicability of Ti/Co bilayers for the salicide technology is presented. In the first place the silicide formation on poly-Si gale lines using Ti/Co bilayers has been studied. It is demonstrated that lateral silicide growth over the spacers can be avoided by making use of a two-step silicidation. In addition, the thermal stability of CoSi 2 obtained on small poly-Si lines by two-step silicidation of a Ti/Co bilayer has been investigated and compared to the thermal stability of CoSi, obtained by standard silicidation of a 20 nm Co film. The performance of Ti/Co silicidation with respect to bridging has been studied making use of a special yield monitor chip with dedicated bridging cells. Similar as for standard Co silicidation, close to 100 % yield numbers are obtained for two-step Ti/Co silicidation. Finally, the contact resistance between the silicide and the p(+) and n(+) diffusion areas has been evaluated making use of four terminal cross-bridge <b>Kelvin</b> resistor structures. <b>Contact</b> resistivity values were calculated {{to be in the}} range of 5 - 6 X 10 (- 7) Omega. cm(2) for CoSi 2 /p(+) contacts and in the range of 1 - 2 x 10 (- 7) Omega. cm(2) for CoSi 2 /n(+) contacts. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Building {{pounding}} is a recognised phenomenon where adjacent buildings collide under lateral loading due to insufficient {{provision of}} building separation. The {{consequences of this}} interaction {{are known to be}} complex, and both buildings’ responses can be significantly affected. In the absence of extensive experimental data, numerical modelling has been frequently adopted as a means of evaluating building pounding risk during earthquakes. In performing numerical analysis, it becomes necessary to create specialised ‘contact’ elements to simulate building contact. While many contact elements have been previously proposed, detailed consideration of their inherent assumptions has frequently been overlooked. This thesis considers the significance and consequences of using the <b>Kelvin</b> <b>contact</b> element for a variety of pounding situations and with varying levels of model detail. Pounding between two adjacent floors (floor/floor collision) is considered as a one dimensional wave propagation problem. By modelling each floor as a flexible rod (termed distributed mass modelling), theoretical relationships for collision force, collision duration and post-collision velocity are derived. This theory is then compared to the predictions made when using the traditionally adopted assumptions of fully rigid colliding floors (termed lumped mass modelling). The post-collision velocities obtained from each method are found to agree only when the axial period of both floors is identical. Relationships between lumped mass and distributed mass models are formed, and an ‘equivalent lumped mass’ method is developed where distributed mass effects can be emulated without explicit modelling of floor flexibility. The theoretical solution method is then adapted for use in Non-Linear Time History Analysis (NLTHA) software to model specific pounding situations. Numerical modelling of a single collision is performed to compare these results to the theoretical predictions. Good agreement is found, and the model’s complexity is simplified until a sufficiently accurate simulation is performed without overly onerous computational requirements. Five methods are detailed that incorporate energy loss during collision into the distributed mass models and a calibration method is developed that enables researchers to define the level of energy loss that occurs during a single collision. Using the developed modelling methods, the pounding response of two existing Wellington buildings is predicted. This is first performed using 2 D analysis of the stiffest frame from each building. The predicted building pounding damage is categorised into local damage (damageresulting from the magnitude of the force applied during contact) and global damage (damage due to the change in dynamic building properties resulting from momentum transfer during collision). Local and global damage effects are found to be fundamentally different consequences of collision, with the two categories responding differently to changes in the modelled system. The effects of building separation, scaling of input motion, modelling of soil-structure-interaction, collision damping, and floor rigidity are investigated for the considered system. 3 D analysis of the building configuration is then investigated. Additional complications arising from the transverse movement of buildings prior to and during collision are identified and refined modelling methods are developed. The 3 D configuration of these buildings causes torsional interaction, despite both buildings being perfectly symmetrical. This torsion is due to the eccentric positioning of the buildings relative to each other, which causes an eccentric contact load when pounding occurs. The 3 D models are used to test the effects of building separation, 2 D vs. 3 D modelling, collision damping, floor rigidity, and the significance of the torsional interactions. Attention is then focused on collisions between a building’s floors and an adjacent building’s columns (floor/column collision). Due to the high frequency content of pounding impacts, the significance of using Timoshenko beam theory instead of Euler-Bernoulli theory is assessed. The shear stiffness in the Timoshenko formulation is found to significantly affect the columns’ predicted performance, and is used in subsequent modelling. An appropriately accurate method of modelling that minimises computational effort is then developed. The simplified model is used to predict the performance of two three-storey buildings that experience floor/column collision. The effects of floor/column impact are predicted for collisions at mid-height, and near the support of the impacted column. Each of these scenarios investigates the effect of building separation on local damage and global damage. Finally, a method to model collision between two adjacent walls that collide out-of-plane is developed (wall/wall contact). The adopted contact element properties are selected using analogous situations that have been previously investigated. The method is used to investigate a single collision between two different wall configurations. In the conclusions, the developed modelling methods from all the considered collision configurations are collected and presented in a summary table. It is intended that these recommendations will assist other researchers in selecting appropriate building pounding modelling properties...|$|R

The oxidation was performed at 600, 700 and 800 8 C and silicon and silicon dioxide were chosen as substrates for their compatibility to silicon CMOS technology. Work function measurements {{were carried out}} on these films upon exposure to NO 2 in the concentration range 5 – 100 ppm at a particular temperature under dry and humid conditions using a commercial Kelvin probe measurement set-up. <b>Kelvin</b> probe measures <b>contact</b> potential difference (CPD) resulting from change in work function of a film material on exposure to a gas. The dependence of NO 2 sensitivity of films on oxidation temperature, film thickness and substrate was investigated. The influence of temperature on NO 2 response from 30 to 130 8 C was investigated. It has been observed that humidity has negligible effect at 130 8 C. It was further observed that response of SnO 2 film on silicon to NO 2 increases with oxidation temperature of the film whereas for the films grown on silicon dioxide the response was parabolic. In the later case, increase in signal was exhibited by the films oxidized up to 700 8 C while it was found to decrease for films oxidized at 800 8 C. The films of three different thickness (10, 35 and 55 nm) prepared at 800 8 C on silicon showed negligible variation in sensitivity. However, sensitivity of the films grown on silicon dioxide is observed to be thickness dependent. The films were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to study the surface morphology and depth profile respectively. The observed results are discussed to understand the NO 2 sensing behavior of ultra thin SnO 2 films...|$|R
