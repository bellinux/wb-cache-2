5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable {{if he could have}} reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where it is necessary to interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E

25|$|Plaintiffs' {{lawyers say}} that the Texas law {{prevents}} patients from getting compensation or damages even {{in cases where the}} patient clearly deserves it. In particular, the “willful and wanton” negligence standard for emergency care, which requires that the harm to the patient be intentional, makes it impossible to win a case where the <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> clearly negligent but not willful.|$|E
25|$|The main remedy against {{tortious}} loss is compensation in 'damages' or money. In {{a limited}} range of cases, tort law will tolerate self-help, such as reasonable force to expel a trespasser. This is a defence against the tort of battery. Further, {{in the case of}} a continuing tort, or even where <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> merely threatened, the courts will sometimes grant an injunction. This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm.|$|E

25|$|Intentional {{weight loss}} {{is the loss}} of total body mass as a result of efforts to improve fitness and health, or to change {{appearance}} through slimming. Weight loss in individuals who are overweight or obese can reduce health risks, increase fitness, and may delay the onset of diabetes. It could reduce pain and increase movement in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Weight loss can lead to a reduction in hypertension (high blood pressure), however whether this reduces hypertension-related <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> unclear.|$|E
25|$|To {{protect the}} rights and {{well-being}} of research participants, {{and at the same}} time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or Institutional Review Board. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.|$|E

25|$|Abortion {{is illegal}} in Brazil {{except for the}} case of rape or when the mother's life is in danger. Though abortions are against the law, it is {{estimated}} that over one million abortions are performed in Brazil each year, though data on abortion incidence is not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women are treated for abortion complications each year in Brazilian hospitals. The punishment for a woman performing an abortion on herself or consenting to an abortion is one to three years of imprisonment. The punishment for those performing abortions is one to four years of imprisonment, and this number increases by one-third if <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> caused to the women or one-half if the abortion leads to the death of the woman.|$|E

This means a command, for something other than money by the court, such as restraining the continuance or threat of harm. Usually injunctions will not impose positive obligations on tortfeasors, but some Australian jurisdictions can make an order for specific performance to ensure that the defendant carries out their legal obligations, especially in relation to nuisance matters.|$|E

Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> meant, but is instinctively very protective of its family, home and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, {{keeping an eye on the}} surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area. The dogs usually knock down intruders and keep them down until the owner arrives. Hungarian Komondor breeders used to say that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to come out again.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To study related social harms due to {{identification}} {{with a group}} of participants in an HIV- 1 vaccine trial who are potentially high risk for HIV/AIDS. Material and Method: Two thousand five hundred forty six injecting drug users (IDU) were enrolled in a 36 -month vaccine trial. Volunteers received education and risk reduction counseling at every six-month study visit. Social <b>harms</b> <b>were</b> not actively solicited, but volunteers were encouraged to report any during the process of counseling at every six-month visit. If a social <b>harm</b> <b>was</b> reported, a questionnaire was administered and the <b>harm</b> <b>was</b> tracked. If necessary, clinic staff assisted in resolving the social harm. Results: Thirty-nine social <b>harms</b> <b>were</b> reported by 37 participants; 33 (84. 6 %) were disturbances in personal relationships, three (7. 7 %) in employment, one (2. 6 %) was medically related, one (2. 6 %) was related to admission in the military and one (2. 6 %) was related with misbelieve about the vaccine. The most common reason for disturbances in personal relationships was suspicion of HIV infection (n = 20). The impact of these harms on quality of life was characterized as minimal by 31 (79. 5 %) participants, as moderate by seven (17. 9 %), and as major by one (2. 6 %). All social <b>harms</b> <b>were</b> documented to be resolved {{by the end of the}} study...|$|R
25|$|Pregnant or {{breastfeeding}} {{women should}} consult a doctor {{before taking a}} vitamin D supplement. The FDA advised manufacturers of liquid vitamin D supplements that droppers accompanying these products should be clearly and accurately marked for 400 international units (1 IU is the biological equivalent of 25ng cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol). In addition, for products intended for infants, the FDA recommends the dropper hold no more than 400 IU. For infants (birth to 12 months), the tolerable upper limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without <b>harm)</b> <b>is</b> set at 25μg/day (1,000IU). One thousand micrograms per day in infants has produced toxicity within one month. After being commissioned by the Canadian and American governments, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) , has increased the tolerable upper limit (UL) to 2,500IU per day for ages 1–3 years, 3,000IU per day for ages 4–8 years and 4,000IU per day for ages 9–71+ years (including pregnant or lactating women).|$|E
25|$|When {{people choose}} to do things about which they are {{ambivalent}} and which they would have difficulty justifying, they experience a state of cognitive dissonance, {{which can lead to}} rationalization, denial, or even self-deception. For example, a 2011 experiment found that, when the harm that their meat-eating causes animals is explicitly brought to people's attention, they tend to rate those animals as possessing fewer mental capacities compared to when the <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> not brought to their attention. This is especially evident when people expect to eat meat in the near future. Such denial makes it less uncomfortable for people to eat animals. The data suggest that people who consume meat {{go to great lengths to}} try to resolve these moral inconsistencies between their beliefs and behaviour by adjusting their beliefs about what animals are capable of feeling. Ethical vegetarians argue that it is behaviour rather than supporting beliefs that should be adjusted.|$|E
25|$|Lead is {{a potent}} neurotoxin whose {{toxicity}} has been recognized for at least thousands of years. Though neurotoxic effects for lead are found in both adults and young children, the developing brain is particularly susceptible to lead-induced harm, effects which can include apoptosis and excitotoxicity. An underlying mechanism by which lead is able to cause <b>harm</b> <b>is</b> its ability to be transported by calcium ATPase pumps across the BBB, allowing for {{direct contact with the}} fragile cells within the central nervous system. Neurotoxicity results from lead’s ability to act in a similar manner to calcium ions, as concentrated lead will lead to cellular uptake of calcium which disrupts cellular homeostasis and induces apoptosis. It is this intracellular calcium increase that activates protein kinase C (PKC), which manifests as learning deficits in children as a result of early lead exposure. In addition to inducing apoptosis, lead inhibits interneuron signaling through the disruption of calcium-mediated neurotransmitter release.|$|E
