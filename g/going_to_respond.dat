5|$|Starting in April 2006, Bethesda {{released}} small {{packages of}} additional downloadable content (DLC) {{for the game}} from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first update came {{as a set of}} specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release. Oblivions final content pack was released October 15, 2007.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, after George Zimmerman's {{acquittal}} for {{the shooting death of}} Trayvon Martin, the movement began with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. The movement was co-founded by three black community organizers: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. Garza, Cullors and Tometi met through [...] "Black Organizing for Leadership & Dignity" [...] (BOLD), a national organization that trains community organizers. They began to question how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to what they saw as the devaluation of black lives after Zimmerman's acquittal. Garza wrote a Facebook post titled [...] "A Love Note to Black People" [...] in which she said: [...] "Our Lives Matter, Black Lives Matter". Cullors replied: [...] "#BlackLivesMatter". Tometi then added her support, and Black Lives Matter was born as an online campaign.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go. He’s shooting from the hip {{with a lot of}} these moves he’s making, and I’m sure that’s going to rub the director the wrong way. [...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience time to get to know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
5000|$|On August 28, 2001, U.S. {{aviation}} {{officials said}} that Morales had been hired by Blackhawk International Airways just {{two days before the}} crash, and was not authorized by the FAA to fly the aircraft for the operator. FAA records showed that Blackhawk International Airways was clear to fly aircraft under a single-pilot certificate. However, according to Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the FAA in Atlanta, Morales was not on the name authorization papers. Bergen did not identify the pilot who was on the papers, since [...] "it would not be appropriate" [...] to release it, but confirmed Morales was not qualified to fly the Cessna. Morales's father addressed his son's death and responsibility in the crash. [...] "Luis was responsible for nine lives - eight plus his own. Someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> for those eight lives. And someone is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> for his life to me." [...] He said he had spoken to his son in early August 2001 and the younger Morales related he was doing something he was passionate about.|$|R

Interestingly, Christopher Gorham, who officially became a recurring regular starting with this episode, co-starred with Hathaway in the 2001 film The Other Side of Heaven.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of a diagnostic test with a therapeutic entity is termed theranostics. The diagnostic test aims at identifying patients who will likely benefit from a specific therapeutic intervention, fail <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> or eventually manifest side effects to a given drug. The appropriate selection of patients for innovative therapies would promote an enrichment of patient population that can potentiate clinical trials and eventually accelerate the drug development process. For these reasons many drug companies adopted a theranostic approach as a new and promising avenue for drug development. From an historical perspective, the concepts underlying the theranostic strategy are well known in nuclear medicine and constituted the basis of many nuclear imaging procedures currently used in clinical practice. Nevertheless the adoption of these concepts by regulatory authorities is a real progress and reflects the remarkable advances {{in the development of}} drugs against molecular targets. In this respect, the oncological field provides the strongest evidence of the clinical need to link diagnostics to therapeutics. Here we review the contribution that non-invasive nuclear imaging may give to cancer theranostics and report prominent examples of nuclear imaging procedures that can be coupled to specific therapies. The main focus lies on imaging procedures that can identify patients who will benefit from molecularly targeted therapy or are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fail <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> standard treatment...|$|R
500|$|On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, {{took the}} stand and refuted {{statements}} about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities {{during the early years}} of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: [...] "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." [...] Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was [...] "guilty until we learned about this character here," [...] referring to Guandique. On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship. He replied, [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to that question out of privacy for myself and Chandra." [...] FBI biologist Alan Giusti testified that semen found on underwear from Levy's apartment contained sperm matching Condit's DNA profile.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2016 that Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler were working on a memoir titled The 15:17 to Paris, which would highlight {{the events of the}} 2015 Thalys train attack. Perseus Books Group, who will be publishing the book, described the memoir as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three American boys, their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” Jeffrey E. Stern, an international journalist, will co-write the book. David Steinberger, {{president and chief executive of}} Perseus Books Group, said that he is “confident that this is going to be a film. It’s extremely cinematic, and there’s a lot of interest in the movie.” He further said that [...] "based on the material, that this was going to be an important book and one that readers were really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to.” The memoir was made available to the public on August 23, 2016, almost a year after the 2015 Thalys train attack. In the acknowledgements, Stone stated that he [...] "give all the credit to God" [...] and made further acknowledgement of his family, friends, the United States Air Force, the citizens of Sacramento and the United States Armed Forces.|$|E

Now I've got time to be able to start doing things for my own project."

5000|$|C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} response, including some comments by critics, most notably Richard C. Carrier, who on Internet Infidels called the book [...] "surely the most extensive defense of the so-called 'Argument from Reason' yet to appear in print." [...] Carrier's review [...] "is {{about as long as}} the book itself", Reppert noted only half-jokingly, before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> some of Carrier's criticisms. Another response to Carrier's review came from Darek Barefoot, who, while he did not [...] "find all of Reppert's arguments to be persuasive and all of Carrier's criticisms to be off-target", believed that the core of the argument from reason [...] "is sound and that Reppert's book is a landmark contribution to the subject." [...] Barefoot argued that Reppert had made a strong case for Lewis's claim [...] "that the process of inference by which consideration of premises causes us to adopt a conclusion cannot be coherently conceived of in terms of physical cause-and-effect alone." [...] Furthermore, if Reppert's version of the Argument from Reason [...] "is successful, it reveals that rationality is fundamental to the universe, not simply a by-product of physical cause-and-effect; and this, in turn, is readily explicable on theism, but problematic for naturalism." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, Lloyd-Webber {{announced}} that the Australian production would open on 21 May 2011 at Melbourne's Regent Theatre. This production, the first outside of the UK, featured brand new direction and design by an Australian creative team, including director Simon Phillips. Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne were cast as the leads. Before the show's opening, Phillips addressed the negative reaction of fans of Phantom to the London production, stating: [...] "I think {{the majority of the}} noise about Love Never Dies wasn't literary. They didn't care that Andrew was creating a sequel to the original story." [...] However, Love Never Dies is not a sequel to Gaston Leroux's original novel, in which the character of the Phantom dies at the end. Phillips additionally addressed the audience's suspension of disbelief with regard to the plot of Love Never Dies: [...] "The central plot idea is that the Phantom and Christine have slept together. If people don't buy that, then they're never going to come onboard with the show, they're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chomsky {{has shown}} cynicism towards the {{credibility}} of postmodernism and poststructuralism. In particular he has criticised the Parisian intellectual community; the following disclaimer may be taken as indicative: [...] "I wouldn't say this if I hadn't been explicitly asked for my opinion – and if asked to back it up, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> that I don't think it merits {{the time to do}} so" [...] (ibid). Chomsky's lack of interest arises from what he sees as a combination of difficult language and limited intellectual or [...] "real world" [...] value, especially in Parisian academe: [...] "Sometimes it gets kind of comical, say in post-modern discourse. Especially around Paris, it has become a comic strip, I mean it's all gibberish ... they try to decode it and see what is the actual meaning behind it, things that you could explain to an eight-year old child. There's nothing there." [...] (Chomsky on Anarchism, pg. 216). This is exacerbated, in his view, by the attention paid to academics by the French press: [...] "in France if you're part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there's a front-page story in Le Monde. That's {{one of the reasons why}} French intellectual culture is so farcical – it's like Hollywood" [...] (Understanding Power, pg. 96).|$|E
60|$|The toasts now {{began in}} the {{customary}} order, attended with speeches neither more nor less witty and ingenious than the specimens of table-eloquence which had heretofore delighted me. As preparatory to each new display, the herald, or whatever he was, behind the chair of state, gave awful notice that the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor was about to propose a toast. His Lordship being happily delivered thereof, together with some accompanying remarks, the band played an appropriate tune, and the herald again issued proclamation {{to the effect that}} such or such a nobleman, or gentleman, general, dignified clergyman, or what not, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to the Right Honorable the Lord Mayor's toast; then, if I mistake not, there was another prodigious flourish of trumpets and twanging of stringed instruments; and finally the doomed individual, waiting all this while to be decapitated, got up and proceeded to make a fool of himself. A bashful young earl tried his maiden oratory on the good citizens of London, and having evidently got every word by heart (even including, however he managed it, the most seemingly casual improvisations of the moment), he really spoke like a book, and made incomparably the smoothest speech I ever heard in England.|$|E
