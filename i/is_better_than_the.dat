The Br–Br {{distance is}} 227pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331pm within a layer and 399pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195pm). This structure means that bromine {{is a very}} poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5×10−13Ω−1cm−1 just below the melting point, although this <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long waiting time, and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E

25|$|The Proton Prevé has {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in Australia. Daniel DeGasperi from CarAdvice gave the Prevé GX 2 out 5 stars. The five-year warranty, free servicing and roadside assistance {{as well as}} the roomy interior, steering and handling were well-received and complemented the Prevé's five-star ANCAP rating. However, the car was met with severe criticism in terms of its expensive pricing, poor performance and fuel economy, lackluster build quality and refinement, uncomfortable urban ride quality and detail design flaws. Daniel commented “The Proton Preve should be priced at least $4,000 cheaper, to be reasonably competitive against light sedans such as the Holden Barina and Nissan Almera. It <b>is</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Chery J3 that sells for $6000 less, but the Proton isn’t necessarily 35 per cent better, and it certainly shares some of the Chinese-made hatchback’s quality and refinement shortfalls.” Proton Cars Australia however responded swiftly and positively, and the Prevé GX received a major $3,000 price cut on 1 August 2013, 2 months after the review was published. The 5-speed manual and 6-speed CVT variants are currently priced at $15,990 and $17,990 driveaway, down from $18,990 and $20,990 respectively. Both variants are still offered with 5 years warranty and 5 years roadside assist, but 5 years free servicing is no longer offered and has been replaced with a 5-year capped-price servicing scheme. Nonetheless, Proton Cars Australia bills the Prevé as “Australia's most affordable small car” with all things considered.|$|E

David Hodgson of Maximum acknowledged the similarity to the original Ridge Racer but gave it a strong recommendation, arguing that removal of the slowdown and track updating of the original, the unlockables, and the two-player mode make it worth buying.
