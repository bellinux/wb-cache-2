25|$|The 5-HT2c {{receptor}} agonist <b>Fenfluramine</b> (market names Pondimin, Ponderax and Adifax) {{was discovered in}} 1972 {{as a result of}} research performed to identify anorectic compounds lacking the effects of psycho-stimulants and sympathomimetic agents (such as amphetamines). Prior to the discovery of <b>fenfluramine,</b> amphetamines were the primary form of anorectic drugs available, however the side effects made them difficult to use. Fenfluramine's anorectic effect is achieved through an increase in serotonin levels, imparting a sensation of fullness, which leads to a lower intake of food. <b>Fenfluramine</b> was sold as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, dexfenfluramine and levofenfluramine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Use of <b>fenfluramines</b> {{for weight}} loss has been {{associated}} with the development of characteristic plaques on cardiac valves causing regurgitation. However, previously published studies of exposure to <b>fenfluramines</b> have been limited by relatively small sample size, short duration of follow-up, and the lack of any estimate of the frequency of subsequent valvular surgery. We performed an observational study of 5743 users of <b>fenfluramines</b> examined by echocardiography between July 1997 and February 2004 in a single large cardiology clinic. Results The prevalence of at least mild aortic regurgitation (AR) or moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) was 19. 6 % in women and 11. 8 % in men (p p p = 0. 002), and tricuspid regurgitation (TR) (p p p Conclusion Regurgitant valvulopathy was common in individuals exposed to <b>fenfluramines,</b> more frequent in females, and associated with duration of use in all valves assessed. Valve surgery was performed as frequently for aortic as mitral valves and some tricuspid valve surgeries were also performed. The incidence of surgery appeared to be substantially increased compared with limited general population data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension {{is a disease}} in which pulmonary arterial pressure is raised, leading to right heart failure. Survival is poor despite current therapeutic strategies. The `serotonin hypothesis of pulmonary {{arterial hypertension}}' arose in the 1960 s following an `epidemic' of pulmonary arterial hypertension in women taking the indirect serotinergic agonist aminorex as an anorexigen. In the 1980 s, the hypothesis was revisited following the occurrence of pulmonary arterial hypertension {{associated with the use}} of <b>fenfluramines</b> as anorexigens; these are also indirect serotinergic agents. Research has identified changes in serotonin synthesis, serotonin receptor activation and serotonin uptake via the serotonin transporter in experimental and clinical pulmonary arterial hypertension. This review will discuss our current understanding of this serotonin hypothesis with particular reference to the role of the serotonin transporter...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{pulmonary}} hypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, {{which has been}} associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs. The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. Thirty-five patients with primary {{pulmonary hypertension}} and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992 - 1994) in Belgium. Exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly <b>fenfluramines,</b> as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6 %, p< 0. 0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension. Intake of appetite suppressants may accelerate the progression of the disease. Comparative StudyJournal ArticleMulticenter StudyResearch Support, Non-U. S. Gov'tinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|Tramadol is {{well-established}} as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. In addition, a {{few studies}} have found that it also acts as a serotonin releasing agent (1–10μM), similar in effect to <b>fenfluramine.</b> The serotonin releasing effects of tramadol could be blocked by sufficiently high concentrations of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor 6-nitroquipazine, which is in accordance with other serotonin releasing agents like <b>fenfluramine</b> and MDMA. However, two more recent studies failed to find a releasing effect of tramadol at respective concentrations up to 10 and 30μM. In addition to serotonergic activity, tramadol is also a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is not a norepinephrine releasing agent. Tramadol does not inhibit the reuptake or induce the release of dopamine.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{phentermine}} {{had been}} FDA approved in 1959 and <b>fenfluramine</b> in 1973. The two {{were no more}} popular than other drugs until in 1992 a researcher reported that when combined the two caused a 10% weight loss which was maintained {{for more than two}} years. Fen-phen was born and rapidly became the most commonly prescribed diet medication. Dexfenfluramine (Redux) was developed in the mid-1990s as an alternative to <b>fenfluramine</b> with fewer side-effects, and received regulatory approval in 1996. However, this coincided with mounting evidence that the combination could cause valvular heart disease in up to 30% of those who had taken it, leading to withdrawal of Fen-phen and dexfenfluramine from the market in September 1997.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>fenfluramines</b> can {{increase}} the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in humans, but the mechanisms responsible are unresolved. A recent study reported that female mice lacking the gene for tryptophan hydroxylase- 1 (Tph 1 (-/-) mice) were protected from PAH caused by chronic dexfenfluramine, suggesting a pivotal role for peripheral serotonin (5 -HT) in the disease process. Here we tested two alternative hypotheses which might explain the lack of dexfenfluramine-induced PAH in Tph 1 (-/-) mice. We postulated that: 1) Tph 1 (-/-) mice express lower levels of pulmonary 5 -HT transporter (SERT) when compared to wild-type controls, and 2) Tph 1 (-/-) mice display adaptive changes in the expression of non-serotonergic pulmonary genes which are implicated in PAH. SERT was measured using radioligand binding methods, whereas gene expression was measured using microarrays followed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Contrary to our first hypothesis, the number of pulmonary SERT sites was modestly up-regulated in female Tph 1 (-/-) mice. The expression of 51 distinct genes was significantly altered in the lungs of female Tph 1 (-/-) mice. Consistent with our second hypothesis, qRT-PCR confirmed that at least three genes implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH were markedly up-regulated: Has 2, Hapln 3 and Retlna. The finding that female Tph 1 (-/-) mice are protected from dexfenfluramine-induced PAH could be related to compensatory changes in pulmonary gene expression, in addition to reductions in peripheral 5 -HT. These observations emphasize the intrinsic limitation of interpreting data from studies conducted in transgenic mice that are not fully characterized...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn lung vasculature, {{reversible}} constriction {{of smooth}} muscle cells exists {{in response to}} acute decrease in oxygen levels (hypoxia). Progressive and irreversible structural remodeling that reduces blood vessel lumen takes place in response to chronic hypoxia and results in pulmonary hypertension. Several studies have shown a role of serotonin in regulating acute and chronic hypoxic responses. In this review the contribution of serotonin, its receptors and transporter in lung hypoxic responses is discussed. Hypoxic conditions modify plasma levels of serotonin, serotonin transporter activity, and expression of 5 -HT 1 B and 5 -HT 2 B receptors. These appear to be required for pulmonary vascular cell proliferation, which depends on the ratio between reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. A heterozygous mutation was identified in the 5 -HT 2 B receptor gene of a patient who developed pulmonary hypertension after <b>fenfluramines</b> anorexigen treatment. This C-terminus truncated 5 -HT 2 B mutant receptor presents lower nitric oxide coupling, and higher cell proliferation capacity than the wild-type receptor. Under low oxygen tension, cells increase the transcription of specific genes via stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1. Factors such as angiotensin II or thrombin that can also control HIF- 1 pathway contribute to pulmonary vascular remodeling. The 5 -HT 2 B receptor via phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase/Akt activates nuclear factor-kappaB, which {{is involved in the}} regulation of HIF- 1 expression. Acontrol of HIF- 1 by 5 -HT 2 B receptors explains why expression of pulmonary vascular remodeling factors, such as endothelin- 1 or transforming growth factor-beta, which is HIF- 1 -alpha regulated, is not modified in hypoxic 5 -HT 2 B receptor mutant mice. Understanding the detailed mechanisms involved in lung hypoxic responses may provide general insight into pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis...|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} the cause of aortic insufficiency, is often due to the aortic root {{dilation}} (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation {{is the most common}} cause of aortic insufficiency in developed countries. Additionally, aortic insufficiency has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing <b>fenfluramine</b> or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of aortic insufficiency, the main causes are infective endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma.|$|E

2500|$|Sibutramine is a monoamine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (MRI) that, in humans, {{reduces the}} reuptake of norepinephrine (by ~73%), serotonin (by ~54%), and dopamine (by ~16%), thereby increasing {{the levels of}} these substances in synaptic clefts and helping enhance the serotonergic action, in particular, is thought to influence appetite.

50|$|The {{distinctive}} valvular abnormality {{seen with}} <b>fenfluramine</b> is a thickening of the leaflet and chordae tendineae.

The suggested mechanism by which <b>fenfluramine</b> causes damage is through over or inappropriate stimulation of these receptors leading to inappropriate valve cell division. Supporting this idea is the fact that this valve abnormality has also occurred in patients using other drugs that act on 5-HT2B receptors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fenfluramine,</b> {{a related}} drug, had been {{withdrawn}} from the market in 1997 after reports of heart valve disease, pulmonary hypertension, and development of cardiac fibrosis.

Both <b>fenfluramine</b> and benfluorex form norfenfluramine as a metabolite. This side effect led to the withdrawal of <b>fenfluramine</b> as an anorectic drug worldwide, and later to the withdrawal of benfluorex in Europe.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, {{researchers}} at the University of Rochester Medical Center {{reported that they had}} performed a double-blind, controlled clinical trial comparing phentermine alone, <b>fenfluramine</b> alone, a combination of phentermine and <b>fenfluramine,</b> and placebo, for weight loss in humans.

5000|$|There {{have been}} reports associating <b>fenfluramine</b> with depression, psychosis, {{exacerbation}} of pre-existing psychosis (schizophrenia), and sleep disturbances.
