40|$|The present paper {{gives the}} {{comparative}} study {{with respect to}} the profit between two models for sulphated <b>juice</b> <b>pump</b> standby systems—one (Model I) comprising two big units and the other (Model II) comprising one big and two small units. In model I, initially one unit is operative and the other is kept as cold standby whereas in Model II, initially one big unit is operative and both the small units are kept as cold standby. Comparative study with respect to profits is made between two models taking into consideration the installation cost and consumption cost for both types of units (big as well as small). System is analysed by making use of semi-Markov processes and regenerative point technique...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{continuous}} {{patented process}} is described for the extraction {{at ambient temperature}} of juice from shredded cane in three stages. In each stage air is displaced from the cane bed by upward flow of displacement juice ('Meichage') followed by downward displacement of the enriched juice in true plug flow by lower brix <b>juice</b> <b>pumped</b> from the succeeding stage. In the third (final) stage the displacement is by a mixture of presswater and imbibition water. Megasse from the final stage is conventionally dewatered. Total processing time including dewateringldrying is about two minutes. Pol extraction of 98 % has been achieved in laboratory tests. The theory on which the design is based, a flow diagram, brix balance, typical layout drawing and comparative costings of a Rivibre Juice Extractor and other methods of juice extraction are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of clear juice softening {{in the raw}} house, such as reduced evaporator scaling, have been discussed previously. The effects on boiling house operation, including exhaustion, need to be quantified for a full economic evaluation to be performed. Mill clear <b>juice</b> was <b>pumped</b> through a pilot softening unit and evaporated to syrup in the Felixton (FX) evaporator pilot plant. Extended evaporator fouling tests on raw and softened clear juice showed greatly reduced fouling from the softened juice. Batches of raw and softened syrup were boiled in the Sugar Milling Research Institute (SMRI) pilot pan to produce A- and B-massecuites and molasses. The effects of softening on operational parameters such as purity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper summarises {{the results}} of a joint R+D project between {{university}} and industry. The study was developed at the Alt Penedès region, in Barcelona, during the 2006 and 2007 (on 3, 22, 69 fields respectively). The quality sensors set-up in year 2007, mounted on a New Holland SB 55 grape harvester, were: two load cells, one refractometer, an ambient temperature prove and a GPS antenna, while in 2006 only the load cells and the GPS performed properly. The method used for this study is as follows: 1. Data recording from GPS and Logger (the latter is use for according and digitalising the sensor signal); 2. Wireless download of data to a PC; 3. Automatic data integration in a single file; 4. Lane automatic identification based on trajectory angles, machine forward speed determination, effective time calculation, masic flow, kg/m, and total amount harvested, kg/hopper, computation of characteristic soluble solid content and temperature during harvest; 5. Data broadcasting through GPRS to the winery; 6. Comparison of transmitted data with the invoice of the winery containers. After the season was finished, a data post processing was performed in order to a assess the causes of isolated incidences that were registered in 10 fields. Also a recalibration of the sensors for future seasons was performed. At current stage R 2 of 0. 9547 is found between winery and in field yield data. Beside georeference data were gathered and compare to the remote photos in “Instituto Cartográfico de Cataluña”. Site-specific yield maps and speed maps have been computed while broad soluble solid information is not available due to slight dysfunctions of the grape <b>juice</b> <b>pumping</b> system towards to the refractometer...|$|R
5000|$|Wide {{perspectives}} for pumpable ice usage open up for {{the production}} of special wines reminiscent of [...] "ice wine" [...] (German Eiswein). In comparison with the existing technology for ice wine production, pumpable ice technology does not require a wait of a few months for the freezing of the grapes. Freshly squeezed grapes are harvested in a specific container connected to the pumpable ice machine. The <b>juice</b> is <b>pumped</b> through this machine, from which comes a mixture of ice (in the form of tiny, pure ice crystals) and a somewhat concentrated juice. Liquid ice returns to the accumulation tank, {{in which there is a}} natural (according to Archimedes law) separation of ice and juice. The cycle is repeated many times until the sugar concentration reaches 50-52°Brix. Then a process of fermentation takes place, resulting in this alcoholic drink.|$|R
5000|$|Sugarcane {{diffusion}} is {{the process}} of extracting the sucrose from the cane with the use of imbibtion but without the squeezing by mills. Shredded cane is introduced into the diffuser at the feed end, Hot water is poured over the shredded cane just before the discharge end of the diffuser. The hot water percolates through the bed of cane and removes sucrose from the cane. This dilute juice is then collected in a compartment under the bed of cane and is pumped to a point a little closer to the feed end of the diffuser and this dilute juice is allowed to percolate through the bed of cane. At this point the concentration of sucrose in the cane is higher than the concentration of sucrose in the dilute juice just mentioned and so sucrose diffuses from the cane to the juice, this now slightly richer <b>juice</b> is <b>pumped</b> back up the diffuser and the process is repeated, typically, 12 to 15 times (compared with the four to six times for the milling process) ...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design an ethanol {{production}} process from sweet sorghum {{for use as a}} renewable fuel. Sorghum stalks are first harvested and sent through a series of 2 three-roller extractors (70 % total efficiency). Extracted <b>juice</b> is <b>pumped</b> to the reactor for preservation and fermentation. Sodium metabisulfite preserves the juice. Ethanol Red (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is the fermentation yeast. Following fermentation, the juice (8 % ethanol by mass) is distilled to achieve 90 % ethanol. A molecular sieve extracts excess water, resulting in 100 % ethanol. Plant wastes accumulate during the process. These wastes are collected, dried, and sold as animal feed for profit. The project economics indicate that the overall process is not currently economically feasible. The net present value (NPV) for the optimum economic situation, assuming a 15 year plant lifetime and 15 % interest rate, is -$ 125 M. Under these circumstances, the ethanol would need to be sold at $ 44. 37 per gallon to break even. To improve this process, further development of methods for increasing juice extraction efficiency should be explored. Additionally, the distillation process could be enhanced with a second distillation column to achieve 95 % ethanol prior to using the molecular sieve...|$|R
40|$|A {{traditional}} lagar (stone trough) fermentation, with crushing by treading, {{was compared}} with fermentation {{in a tank}} with mechanical crushing. For the tank fermentation, pigment extraction was increased by <b>pumping</b> <b>juice</b> drawn {{from the bottom of}} the tank through a spray head at the top of the tank. Yeast growth, sugar depletion, ethanol formation, and changes in amino acid composition were monitored during the two kinds of fermentation. No marked differences in these fermentation characteristics were found between the lager and tank systems. The effect on the quality of the end product was assessed by color analysis and sensory assessments of the wine during maturation. The results showed initial differences in pigment extraction and significant differences in sensory attributes; but as the wine matured over three years, this difference in sensory quality became insignificant. Hence, the sensory quality of the finished wines did not depend on the method of production...|$|R
40|$|Apple juice inoculated with Escherichia coli ATCC 23472 was {{processed}} continuously {{using either}} ultraviolet (UV), high-voltage pulsed electric field (PEF), {{or a combination}} of the PEF and UV treatment systems. Apple <b>juice</b> was <b>pumped</b> through either of the systems at 3 flow rates (8, 14, and 20 mL/min). E. coli was reduced by 3. 46 log CFU/mL when exposed in a 50 cm length of UV treatment chamber at 8 mL/min (2. 94 s treatment time with a product temperature increase of 13 °C). E. coli inactivation of 4. 87 log CFU/mL was achieved with a peak electric field strength of 60 kV/cm and 11. 3 pulses (average pulse width of 3. 5 μs, product temperature increased to 52 °C). E. coli reductions resulting from a combination treatment of UV and PEF applied sequentially were evaluated. A maximum E. coli reduction of 5. 35 log CFU/mL was achieved using PEF (electrical field strength of 60 kV/cm, specific energy of 162 J/mL, and 11. 3 pulses) and UV treatments (length of 50 cm, treatment time of 2. 94 s, and flow rate of 8 mL/min). An additive effect was observed for the combination treatments (PEF and UV), regardless of the order of treatment (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). E. coli reductions of 5. 35 and 5. 30 log CFU/mL with PEF treatment (electrical field strength of 60 kV/cm, specific energy of 162 J/mL, and 11. 3 pulses) followed by UV (length of 30 cm, treatment time of 1. 8 s, and flow rate of 8 mL/min) and UV treatment followed by PEF (same treatment conditions), respectively. No synergistic effect was observed...|$|R
