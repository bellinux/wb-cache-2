5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} {{deep inside the}} Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to take}} advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SN 1987A supernova.|$|E

5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth. Hardcore exploded in the American metropolises of Los Angeles, Washington, DC, New York and Boston and most American cities had their own local scenes {{by the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E

When the Hab's airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture, it destroys Watney's crops. Sanders orders the team {{to speed up the}} supply mission with the Iris probe by skipping the safety inspections. However, an oversight causes the destabilization and subsequent <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket 40 seconds after liftoff, causing Watney to think about his seemingly inevitable death.|$|E

5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface explosion that does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|These {{guns were}} {{air-cooled}} {{and used a}} gas blowback recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II {{the barrel of the}} 20mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next round of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander.

The brief quiet that had resulted from the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded.

50|$|Captured {{ammunition}} {{was partially}} disassembled and reassembled with substituted components. Rifle and machine gun cartridges had the smokeless powder {{replaced with a}} high explosive of similar appearance which would generate approximately five times <b>the</b> design pressure <b>of</b> firearms. <b>The</b> bolt and pieces of an exploding AK-47 receiver would typically be projected backward into <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual firing the rifle. Substitute fuzes {{were placed in the}} mortar shells to detonate the shell when <b>the</b> mortar fired. <b>Explosions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team-fired machine guns and mortars often killed or injured anyone near the exploding weapon.|$|R

Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, {{and the two}} drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find {{a team led by}} Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural gas distribution system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroshima {{authorities}} took {{advice about}} the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, suggested they build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> atomic bomb. In 1949 the authorities enacted the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Reconstruction Act, {{which gave the}} city access to special grant aid, and in August 1949, an international competition was announced {{for the design of}} the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.|$|E
5|$|West Gates engines {{were shut}} down while American {{backed out of the}} tangle. West Gate quickly began to settle and the order to abandon ship was issued.

5|$|Even so, {{there is}} no {{shortage}} of criticism against Beyonce's particular brand of feminism. Many critics argue that Beyonce is part of the hyper sexualization of women in the pop industry since the 90's, something that occurred largely in sync with the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> porn industry. Beyond this, some feminist critics argue that Beyonce fuels a culture of post-feminism. With songs like Girls (Who Run the World), Beyonce creates a mindset - particularly among teenage girls - that women are already outdoing men in every aspect of life. When the reality is, these critics say, there are still vast gender inequalities that keep them from doing so. The danger of post-feminism is that while they still exist, young people lack the language to label these inequalities as sexism.|$|E
5|$|Like the infantry, the {{engineers}} {{had been pushed}} off their targets, and only five of the 16 teams arrived at their assigned locations. Three teams came in {{where there were no}} infantry or armor to cover them. Working under heavy fire, {{the engineers}} set about their task of clearing gaps through the beach obstacles—work made more difficult by loss of equipment, and by infantry passing through or taking cover behind the obstacles they were trying to blow. They also suffered heavy casualties as enemy fire set off the explosives they were working with. Eight men of one team were dragging their pre-loaded rubber boat off the LCM when artillery hit; only one survived the resulting detonation of their supplies. Another team had just finished laying its explosives when the area was struck by mortar fire. The premature <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charges killed or wounded 19 engineers, as well as some nearby infantry. Nevertheless, the engineers succeeded in clearing six gaps, one each at Dog White and Easy Green on the 116th RCT front, the other four at Easy Red on the 16th RCT front. They had suffered casualties of over 40%.|$|E
5|$|Other {{locations}} used {{included the}} real-life new town of Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, which was under construction {{at the time}} and doubled for the fictional new town of Winnerden Flats. Other scenes were shot in London including Trafalgar Square, where the police agreed to hold up the traffic for just two minutes to allow Guest to take shots of trucks ferrying equipment through London to Winnerden Flats, and in the foyer of the House of Lords for the scene where Quatermass first meets Vincent Broadhead. The climactic scenes of the hurricane caused by the <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Winnerden Flats complex were shot on the South Downs near Brighton. A minor mishap occurred during the filming of this scene when the wind machines blew Brian Donlevy's toupée off his head and the crew had to chase after it. As well as shooting on location, Guest and his crew made use of Stages 2 and 5 of the New Elstree Studios, the first Hammer production to shoot there. This was production designer Bernard Robinson's first film for Hammer; he went on to become their regular set designer, working on many Hammer films.|$|E
