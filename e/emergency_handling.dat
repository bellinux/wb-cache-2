Work at the station became hazardous: the equipment was not maintained, most of the control and <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> instrumentation was stolen from the power station.

50|$|Following an {{intensive}} ground school, the EFT course covers {{the rudiments of}} flying, stalling and circuits with the pilots flying their first solo after just 10 hours of tuition. They then advance to spinning, aerobatics, instrument flying, formation flying and low level navigation. As the course progresses, <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> and airmanship are introduced, this includes simulated engine failures {{and the use of}} emergency frequencies. EFT culminates in the Final Handling Test which is a composite sortie comprising any elements taught during the course.|$|E

This was based on concerns posed by the 750-volt third rail that powers the trains in addition to possible abuse by pranksters.

50|$|However, {{investigators}} {{stated that}} even if a mid-air engine failure occurred, the pilots still could {{have returned to the}} airport safely. It was revealed that if an aircraft had a mid air engine failure in one of its engine, the plane still could fly. All twin engine aircraft are designed to sustain a safe flight even if one of the engines has failed or is switched off due to any abnormality provided the <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> procedures are correctly followed. Similarly, Beechcraft 1900C also had the capability to sustain safe flight with single engine operation. This suggests that pilot error maybe the main cause of the accident.|$|E

5000|$|Basic Flight TrainingUpon {{graduating from}} RMC-D the pilot trainee begins their basic flight {{training}} {{course at the}} Basic Flying Training School (BFTS) in Tamworth for fixed-wing flight training of approximately 6 months duration on the CT-4B trainer aircraft (PAC CT/4 [...] "parrot"). The BFTS course encompasses both an extensive ground training program (such as airmanship, aerodynamics, aircraft systems, aviation medicine, air power, air traffic control, radio, meteorology, navigation, morse code, instrumentation, and cockpit systems, etc.) {{as well as an}} intensive flight training course (including general flying, instrument flying, night flying, navigation, aerobatics, formation flying, and <b>emergency</b> <b>handling).</b> As part of the Basic Flying Training Course, Army pilot trainees complete the Intermediate Pilots Course (IPC) where navigational techniques are taught for Army graduates.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{students}} learn {{a vast number}} of new disciplines and techniques to build upon their Elementary Flying Training, the focus on the Squadron is Crew Resource Management (CRM) and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Handling.</b> Students are encouraged to develop their airmanship and decision making, with the aim of producing the front line captains of tomorrow. Asymmetric flight is perhaps the most significant change to previous flying experiences and as such it is covered thoroughly throughout the course to ensure students are confident with handling the aircraft on just one engine. Most of the training is completed around Lincolnshire, with regular visits to RAF Scampton, Marham and Coningsby along with local civilian airports Doncaster and Humberside for circuit training and Instrument Approaches. Short detachments are also often run to escape poor weather and maximise the output of the King Airs and staff alike.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{advantage}} of using an RSL is a faster reserve parachute deployment compared with using <b>emergency</b> <b>handles</b> alone; after a cut-away, the RSL will usually activate before the reserve deployment ripcord is pulled. However, proper emergency procedures require the reserve ripcord {{to be pulled}} {{in the event that}} the RSL is disconnected or not functioning correctly. An RSL also offers protection in the event a jumper cuts-away but does not (or can not) reach for the reserve deployment handle.|$|R

30|$|Fortunately, the IEEE 802.15. 4 {{standard}} reserves {{a guaranteed}} time slot called GTS {{for future use}} [4]. However, there is no reliable support for on demand and emergency traffic. Thus, the pure concept of superframe structure of 802.15. 4 {{cannot be applied to}} emergency data handling. Other proposals for the <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> are basically based on the CSMA/CA mechanism in BAN. Their medium is radio signal whose frequencies might be 400 [*]M or 2.4 [*]GHz and network range is purposed to be up to 5 meters. But HBC network uses human body as medium of 10 ~ 30 [*]MHz frequencies and its PHY layer does not support carrier-sense capability. The MAC approach is totally different, and so is the <b>emergency</b> <b>handling.</b> Complete list of MAC technical requirements are derived from the approval of TG 6 technical requirement document [5]. The documents mandate emergency management capabilities for the IEEE 802.15. 6 specification. The specification must support alarm state notification across BAN in less than 1 second and must provide prioritization mechanisms for emergency traffic and notification. In this work, we proposed specific <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> operation for HBC-MAC to meet emergency requirements of BAN.|$|E

40|$|The current <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> {{services}} are cumbersome; a caller needs to dial 999 {{in order to}} report an emergency. In most occasions civilians are urged to call an emergency centers, which normally not remembered by many. The distance between the occurrence of the incident and the center remains as the major aspect for instant assistance. An assistance may not able to reach at soonest time if caller fail to describe his/her exact location. Worst of all the current system hinders handicapped from reporting an emergency. The advancement in wireless technology and infrastructure has amplified the usage of cell phone in our lives, therefore a location-based ah hoc <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> system is a value-add to the 999 service. This research studies the issues in providing an <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> system (EHS), which deploys location based technology that will detect {{the location of a}} caller and connect to database server that store required data. The system enable user to forward distress message either to police station, rescue team, hospital and etc. The professional application checks an emergency message, view location of an incident and respond to an emergency request. The system employs CGI+TA technique in determining the locations of caller and the nearest professional within the incident vicinity. In addition, every message that is transmitted through the network in encrypted and authenticated to ensure integrity and authenticity of an emergency call. This research shows that EHS has several advantages over current emergency services, and beneficial to handicapped...|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{proposed}} a specific <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> operation for HBC-MAC using EGTS to meet the emergency requirements from IEEE 802.15. 6 BAN.

We formulated ETGS rate factor according to the guaranteed low latency of emergency data.|$|E
30|$|These MAC {{protocols}} for IEEE 802.15. 6 {{follow the}} emergency requirements. However {{most of them}} use carrier sense operation to get the channel.

Thus, existing <b>emergency</b> <b>handling</b> techniques for BAN are not well suitable for HBC.|$|E
