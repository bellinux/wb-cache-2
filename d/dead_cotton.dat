50|$|Charlie accompanies a policewoman who informs Dot Branning (June Brown) of {{the death}} of her son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). He returns later and {{explains}} that he is Nick's son. Charlie indicates that he is a police detective by saying that a friend down at the station mentioned a <b>dead</b> <b>Cotton.</b> Dot struggles to accept Charlie, while he helps with the arrangements for Nick's funeral. Dot insists that the coffin will be in the house on the day before the funeral. When Dot's friends visit to pay their respects to Nick, Charlie gets into an argument with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and the coffin falls open and an arm falls out. Charlie is quick to react, and tells the funeral director Les Coker (Roger Sloman) to nail the coffin closed so nothing like it happens again. After Nick's funeral, Charlie takes Dot to the crematorium to see Nick's body before cremation, but they are too late, leaving Dot devastated. Charlie later has sex with Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) after she accidentally runs over Lola Pearce (Danielle Harold) in her car.|$|E

5000|$|Dale Cregan, 29, {{was arrested}} by police after walking into a police station in Hyde an hour after Hughes and Bone were killed. Cregan was wanted in {{connection}} with the murders of Mark Short, 23, who was shot <b>dead</b> in the <b>Cotton</b> Tree pub in Droylsden on 25 May 2012, and of his father David Short, 46, who was killed in a gun and grenade attack at his home on Folkstone Road East in Clayton on 10 August 2012. Cregan was on bail after being arrested in June 2012 for questioning over the murder of Mark Short. Greater Manchester Police chief constable Peter Fahy defended the decision to grant bail, saying [...] "It is absolutely normal in complex crime inquiries that when people are arrested there are occasions where there is insufficient evidence available for them to be charged." ...|$|R
50|$|The week {{featured}} four thirty-minute episodes, {{including one}} flashback episode set on Good Friday 2014, and one sixty-minute episode. All episodes featured live portions, with Friday's episode being broadcast live in its entirety. The week also featured a recreation {{of the first}} scene of EastEnders, including use of sound effects from 1985 as three residents find Nick <b>Cotton</b> <b>dead.</b> Dominic Treadwell-Collins stated {{that there had been}} sickness within the cast and crew in the buildup to the event and that there is no contingency plan if an actor is unavailable. He added that unlike pre-recorded television, the reveal of Lucy's killer cannot be contained by having multiple endings recorded or withholding the scripts {{and the fact that the}} killer is not exposed in one line, like had been the case with the reveal of Archie Mitchell's murderer in a live episode that broadcast in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Principal {{photography}} for Scream 3 {{began on}} July 6, 1999 {{in and around}} Hollywood, Los Angeles on a budget of $40 million and finished on September 29, 1999 after twelve weeks. Filming took place largely {{in the areas of}} San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silverlake with the isolated home of Campbell's character situated in Topanga Canyon. The opening scene involves Cotton Weary (Schreiber) driving before arriving home where he is murdered by the Ghostface character. For the driving scene, the production filmed on Hollywood Boulevard but the following scene in Cotton's apartment was changed frequently, requiring alterations to the driving scene to maintain continuity, modifying who speaks to Cotton by phone and what the conversation entailed. Unable to return to Hollywood Boulevard, the scene was reshot on a street outside of the production studio in San Fernando Valley and intermixed with footage taken on the Boulevard. The opening attack scene was filmed partially at the exterior and interior of Harper House in West Hollywood but changes were made to the scene including introducing a live girlfriend for Cotton instead of her being <b>dead</b> when <b>Cotton</b> arrives. It was later decided that the confrontation between Cotton and Ghostface, featuring Cotton physically dominating the character and attempting to escape by skylight, was unrealistic and made Ghostface appear weak and this scene was reshot. Again however, they were unable to return to Harper House to conduct filming and resorted to constructing a replica of the apartment interior to produce the necessary footage which had the Ghostface character appear more dominant and completely excised the attempted skylight escape. Cox's character is introduced during a seminar which takes place within a classroom at UCLA, a location previously used in Scream 2 to represent the fictional Windsor College. The film studio where the fictional [...] "Stab 3" [...] is filmed is represented by the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, San Fernando Valley while scenes at the home of Posey's character were filmed in the Hollywood Hills at Runyon Ranch in Runyon Canyon Park. The finale, featuring the final attacks of the film and confrontation between the antagonist and Sidney, was filmed at the Canfield-Moreno Estate, a mansion in Silverlake.|$|R
