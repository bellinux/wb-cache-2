5|$|Lucas's {{conceptualization}} of Palpatine {{and the role}} the character plays <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Wars changed over time. From Return of the Jedi onwards, Palpatine became the ultimate personification of evil <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Wars, replacing Darth Vader as the central villain.|$|E

5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted {{back to being a}} muted blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Wars were meant to be reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E

5|$|The use of John Williams' soundtrack {{from the}} Star Wars films {{was met with}} praise, though one {{reviewer}} believed that the music is overused <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Wars video games.

5|$|A devoted Star Trek fan, Pausch {{was invited}} by film {{director}} J. J. Abrams to film a role <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Trek.

5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto.

5|$|Barney Burman {{supervised}} the makeup {{for the other}} aliens: his team had to rush the creation {{of many of the}} aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in one scene towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence <b>in</b> <b>Star</b> Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film. A tribble was placed in the background of Scotty's introduction. Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Chemical {{composition}} {{is a good}} tracer of hydrodynamical processes that occur <b>in</b> <b>stars</b> as they often lead to mixing and particle transport. By comparing abundances predicted by models and those observed <b>in</b> <b>stars</b> we can infer some constraints on those mixing processes. As pulsations <b>in</b> <b>stars</b> are often very sensitive to chemical composition, we can use asteroseismology to probe the internal chemical composition of stars where no direct observations are possible. In this paper I focus on main sequence stars Am, λ Bootis, and HgMn stars and discuss what we can learn of mixing processes <b>in</b> those <b>stars</b> from seismology. Key words: variable stars – diffusion 1...|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Star</b> Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself.

5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was believable, and that the story itself was very effective.
