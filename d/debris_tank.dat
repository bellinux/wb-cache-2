40|$|Geophysical {{surveying}} around Building E 5032 {{using three}} new continuously recording geophysical instruments - {{two types of}} electromagnetic induction instruments and a cesium vapor magnetometer that were unavailable {{at the time of}} the original survey - has provided additional information for defining the location of buried <b>debris,</b> vaults, <b>tanks,</b> and the drainage/sump system near the building. The dominant geophysical signature around Building E 5032 consists of a complex pattern of linear magnetic, electrical-conductivity, and electromagnetic field anomalies that appear to be associated with drainage/sewer systems, ditches, past railway activity, the location for Building T 5033 (old number 99 A), and the probable location of Building 91. Integrated analysis of data acquired using the three techniques, plus a review of the existing ground-penetrating-radar data, allow a more thorough definition of the sources for the observed anomalies...|$|R

50|$|The {{programme}} {{was delayed}} after three Scaled Composites employees - Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May - {{were killed in}} an accident in Mojave on 26 July 2007, where the detonation of a tank of nitrous oxide destroyed a test stand. They had been observing the test from behind a chain link fence that offered no protection from the shrapnel and <b>debris</b> when the <b>tank</b> exploded. Three other employees were injured in the blast and the company was fined for breaches of health and safety rules. The cause of the accident has never been made public.|$|R
50|$|Following the Battle of the Hotels, Lebanese Front {{troops in}} the Port District of Beirut brought their Panhards into action {{for the first time}} in the civil war, {{engaging}} Charioteer tanks crewed by Amal and Lebanese Arab Army (LAA) militants. Having lost nearly all their heavy armour and tanks to the militias, the predominantly Christian remnants of the Lebanese Army appropriated three AML-90s and nine obsolete T17 Staghounds to stave off repeated assaults by LAA forces from the hotel district. Due to the armoured cars' heightened vulnerability to RPG-7s, their crews began using debris as makeshift barricades. Muslim fighters failed in attempting to destroy the AMLs with RPGs, as well as B-10 and M40 recoilless rifles, since the projectiles lacked a clear trajectory in the rubble. The AML-90s' immense firepower at close quarters soon resulted in great structural damage to portside Beirut; a number of fortified buildings were wrecked by 90mm HE shells, and those struck by multiple HEAT volleys demolished on their foundations. With truck-mounted ZU-23-2s covering their advance, the AMLs advanced on Allenby Street, flattening all resistance, and took the waterfront. Although both the LAA and the leftist Lebanese National Movement hastily brought up Charioteers and M41 Walker Bulldog tanks, so much wreckage was blocking the streets they could not manoeuvre. It was impossible to shoot accurately through the <b>debris,</b> and <b>tanks</b> could only manage speculative fire to discourage the AMLs.|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{a partial}} flow-through culture system for larvae of the blacklip pearl oyster (Pinctada margaritifera L.). Water flowed through the 500 -l larval rearing tanks for 12 h day- 1 {{and provided a}} 100 % water exchange during this period. Larvae were prevented from leaving the culture tanks by a conical mesh screen placed over a central stand-pipe. Tanks were completely drained every 7 days to prevent build-up of <b>debris</b> on the <b>tank</b> bottom. First 'eyed' larvae were seen on day 23 and, by day 28, approximately 5 % of the larvae initially stocked had reached the 'eyed' stage and were removed into settlement tanks. Larval growth and survival compared fabourably with previous studies in which P. margaritifera larvae were cultured using conventional static culture methods. However, when compared to static culture systems, the partial flow-through system described in this study requires less labour and, as such, {{is likely to be}} more appropriate for hatchery culture in developing Pacific nations...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} flight tests has been {{performed}} {{to assess the}} structural survivability of space shuttle external <b>tank</b> <b>debris,</b> known as divots, in a real flight environment. The NASA F- 15 B research test bed aircraft carried the Aerodynamic Flight Test Fixture configured with a shuttle foam divot ejection system. The divots were released in flight at subsonic and supersonic test conditions matching points on the shuttle ascent trajectory. Very high-speed digital video cameras recorded the divot trajectories. The objectives of the flight test were to determine the structural survivability of the divots in a real flight environment, assess the aerodynamic stability of the divots, and provide divot trajectory data for comparison with debris transport models. A total of 10 flights to Mach 2 were completed, resulting in 36 successful shuttle foam divot ejections. Highspeed video was obtained at 2, 000 pictures per second {{for all of the}} divot ejections. The divots that were cleanly ejected remained structurally intact. The conical frustum-shaped divots tended to aerodynamically trim in both the subsonic and supersonic free-stream flow...|$|R
40|$|With {{the design}} and {{development}} of the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle (OMV) progressing toward an early 1990 initial operating capability (IOC), a new era in remote space operations will evolve. The logical progression to OMV front end kits would make available in situ satellite servicing, repair, and consummables resupply to the satellite community. Several conceptual design study efforts are defining representative kits (propellant <b>tanks,</b> <b>debris</b> recovery, module servicers); additional focus must also be placed on an efficient combination module servicer and consummables resupply kit. A remote servicer kit of this type would be designed to perform many of the early maintenance/resupply tasks in both nominal and high inclination orbits. The kit would have the capability to exchange Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs), exchange propellant tanks, and/or connect fluid transfer umbilicals. Necessary transportation system functions/support could be provided by interfaces with the OMV, Shuttle (STS), or Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV). Specific remote servicer kit designs, as well as ground and flight demonstrations of servicer technology are necessary to prepare for the potential overwhelming need. Ground test plans should adhere to the component/system/breadboard test philosophy to assure maximum capability of one-g testing. The flight demonstration(s) would most likely be a short duration, Shuttle-bay experiment to validate servicer components requiring a micro-g environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the underground technologies deployed during the cleanup of nine large underground storage tanks (USTs) that contained residual radioactive sludge, liquid low-level waste (LLLW), and other <b>debris.</b> The Gunite <b>Tanks</b> Remediation Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) was successfully completed in 2001, ending with the stabilization of the USTs and the cleanup of the South Tank Farm. This U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) project was {{the first of its kind}} completed in the United States of America. The Project integrated robotic and remotely operated technologies into an effective tank waste retrieval system that safely retrieved more than 348 m 3 (92, 000 gal) of radioactive sludge and 3. 15 E+ 15 Bq (85, 000 Ci) of radioactive contamination from the tanks. The Project successfully transferred over 2, 385 m 3 (630, 000 gal) of waste slurry to ORNL's active tank waste management system. The project team avoided over $ 120 Million in costs and shortened the original baseline schedule by over 10 years. Completing the Gunite Tanks Remediation Project eliminated the risks posed by the aging USTs and the waste they contained, and avoid the $ 400, 000 annual costs associated with maintaining and monitoring the tanks...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{mobilize}} and transport non-Newtonian waste {{is essential to}} advance the closure of highly radioactive storage tanks. Recent waste removal operations from Tank 12 H at the Savannah River Site (SRS) encountered sludge mixtures with a yield stress too high to pump. The waste removal equipment for Tank 12 H was designed to mobilize and transport a diluted slurry mixture through an underground 550 m long (1800 ft) 0. 075 m diameter (3 inch) pipeline. The transfer pump was positioned in a well casing submerged in the sludge slurry. The design allowed for mobilized sludge to enter the pump suction while keeping out larger <b>tank</b> <b>debris.</b> Data from a similar tank with known rheological properties were used to size the equipment. However, after installation and startup, field data from Tank 12 H confirmed the yield stress of the slurry to exceed 40 Pa, whereas the system is designed for 10 Pa. A revision to the removal strategy was required, which involved metered dilution, blending, and mixing to ensure effective and safe transfer performance. The strategy resulted in the removal of over 255, 000 kgs of insoluble solids with four discrete transfer evolutions for a total transfer volume of 2400 m{sup 3 } (634, 000 gallons) of sludge slurry...|$|R
40|$|This Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) study {{addresses}} the Sludge Treatment Project (STP) Engineered Container Retrieval and Transfer System (ECRTS) preliminary design for retrieving sludge from underwater engineered containers {{located in the}} 105 -K West (KW) Basin, transferring the sludge as a sludge-water slurry (hereafter referred to as 'slurry') to a Sludge Transport and Storage Container (STSC) located in a Modified KW Basin Annex, and preparing the STSC for transport to T Plant using the Sludge Transport System (STS). There are six, underwater engineered containers located in the KW Basin that, {{at the time of}} sludge retrieval, will contain an estimated volume of 5. 2 m{sup 3 } of KW Basin floor and pit sludge, 18. 4 m{sup 3 } of 105 -K East (KE) Basin floor, pit, and canister sludge, and 3. 5 m{sup 3 } of settler tank sludge. The KE and KW Basin sludge consists of fuel corrosion products (including metallic uranium, and fission and activation products), small fuel fragments, iron and aluminum oxide, sand, dirt, operational debris, and biological <b>debris.</b> The settler <b>tank</b> sludge consists of sludge generated by the washing of KE and KW Basin fuel in the Primary Clean Machine. A detailed description of the origin of sludge and its chemical and physical characteristics can be found in HNF- 41051, Preliminary STP Container and Settler Sludge Process System Description and Material Balance. In summary, the ECRTS retrieves sludge from the engineered containers and hydraulically transfers it as a slurry into an STSC positioned within a trailer-mounted STS cask located in a Modified KW Basin Annex. The slurry is allowed to settle within the STSC to concentrate the solids and clarify the supernate. After a prescribed settling period the supernate is decanted. The decanted supernate is filtered through a sand filter and returned to the basin. Subsequent batches of slurry are added to the STSC, settled, and excess supernate removed until the prescribed quantity of sludge is collected. The sand filter is then backwashed into the STSC. The STSC and STS cask are then inerted and transported to T Plant...|$|R
