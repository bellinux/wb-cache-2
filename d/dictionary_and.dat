5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to have him marry a second time, to Anna Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic <b>Dictionary</b> <b>and</b> Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use.

The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E

Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English <b>Dictionary</b> <b>and</b> other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.|$|E
5|$|In China, {{the tree}} of heaven has a long and rich history. It was {{mentioned}} in the oldest extant Chinese <b>dictionary</b> <b>and</b> listed in countless Chinese medical texts for its purported ability to cure ailments ranging from mental illness to baldness. The roots, leaves and bark are still used today in traditional Chinese medicine, primarily as an astringent. The tree has been grown extensively both in China and abroad as a host plant for the ailanthus silkmoth, a moth involved in silk production. Ailanthus has {{become a part of}} western culture as well, with the tree serving as the central metaphor and subject matter of the best-selling American novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Monolingual <b>and</b> bilingual <b>dictionaries</b> for {{learners}} of English {{as foreign}} language differ {{from each other}} in many aspects. Among the differences are the types of information a dic-tionary provides outside the A–Z word list, especially in its introductory matter. Yet, dictionary in-troductions have been referred to rather peripherally in the literature on <b>dictionary</b> users <b>and</b> uses. Within the context of lexicographic practice, this study aims to outline the differences between EFL learner's <b>dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> bilingual English–Arabic <b>dictionaries,</b> <b>and</b> to determine to what extent a given set of popular <b>dictionaries</b> provide varied <b>and</b> sufficient information in their introductions. Three categories of dictionaries will be the subject of comparison: EFL dictionaries, European bilin-gual <b>dictionaries,</b> <b>and</b> bilingual <b>dictionaries</b> in the Arab world...|$|R

The Canon Jean-Baptiste Daranatz published a wordlist in the periodical Eskualdun Ona in 1906 and in 1921 Berraondo and Oyarbide carried out some research. Although labelled gitano (Spanish for 'gypsy') or bohémien / gitan (French for 'gypsy'), some data {{can also be found}} in Azkue's 1905 <b>dictionary</b> <b>and</b> Pierre Lhande's 1926 dictionary, both of which list a number of words identifiable as Erromintxela.|$|E
5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with Ottawa speakers when he met a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly members of the Society of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript Ottawa grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, Ottawa speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the Ottawa people that included a description of Ottawa grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of Ottawa as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in Ottawa communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on Ottawa linguistics. Piggott also prepared a comprehensive description of Ottawa phonology. Rhodes produced a study of Ottawa syntax, a <b>dictionary,</b> <b>and</b> a series of articles on Ottawa grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive descriptive grammar, a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of Ottawa dialect features.|$|E
5|$|Social reforms {{aimed at}} {{removing}} {{practices such as}} sati and social discrimination based upon untouchability, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. Remarriage of widowed women and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their franchise in elections. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the Kodagu uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the Kanara uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably Hermann Mögling, resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the Pampa Bharata and the Jaimini Bharata), a Kannada-language Bible, a bilingual <b>dictionary</b> <b>and</b> a Kannada newspaper called Kannada Samachara {{began in the early}} 19th century. Aluru Venkata Rao published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of Kannadigas in his book Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{reproduction}} {{of culture in}} dictionaries constitutes {{one of the fundamental}} prob-lems of lexicographers today. What is the nature of cultural data in dictionaries?

This article attempts to discuss the relevance of the {{reproduction of}} Gabonese cultural aspects in <b>dictionaries</b> in French <b>and</b> the Gabonese languages. One of the main problems the compilers of these dictionaries encountered was the transfer and the translation of some cultural aspects. In order to discuss {{the nature and extent of}} cultural information in Gabonese dictionaries, this article will restrict itself to the following points: — The translation of different realities — The role of culture in the change of meaning — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> cultural activities — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> cultural ethics — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> language registers — <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>and</b> culture maintenanc...|$|R
