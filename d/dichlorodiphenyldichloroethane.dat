5000|$|Clear Lake is {{well-known}} among entomologists for the Clear Lake gnat (Chaoborus astictopus) and historical control efforts. This species of [...] "phantom midge" [...] (so called because the larvae are transparent and {{very difficult to}} see) measures less than 1/4" [...] long and resembles a tiny mosquito, but is non-biting. Clear Lake gnat hatches start anytime from March through June, depending on weather. Before pesticide use began in the 1940s (Refer to Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring, chapter 4), the gnat was so abundant around the lake in the summer that large piles of dead gnats appeared beneath streetlights, looking like dirty snow. The gnat swarms were so thick that people driving {{along the edge of}} the lake reported stopping every 1/4 mile to clean off the gnats off the windshields and headlights of their cars so they could see, and pedestrians tied kerchiefs over their faces to avoid inhaling the gnats. In 1949, as part of an effort to boost tourism and improve the local economy, DDD (<b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane)</b> was applied to the lake in heavy doses to eradicate the gnats that were driving summer tourists away from the lake. The treatment succeeded in controlling the gnats that year and for the following year, however in 1953 the gnat population rebounded, prompting another application in 1954. The final application of DDD to Clear Lake was made in 1957 (Cook 1963). Numbers of western grebe were found dead, their tissues containing high concentrations of DDD. The effects were devastating to the local ecology. From 1962 to 1975 carefully planned applications of methyl parathion were made for Clear Lake gnat control. The gnat still occurs in Clear Lake, but at much lower numbers than in the 1940s-1970s. The Clear Lake gnat's population is believed to be kept in check now by two introduced fish species (the threadfin shad and the inland silverside) that compete with the Clear Lake gnat for its preferred zooplankton for food.|$|E

To investigate whether in utero exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolite, <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDE), is associated with childhood physical growth, we took a novel statistical approach to analyze data from the CHAMACOS cohort study. To model heterogeneity in the growth patterns, we used a finite mixture model in combination with a data transformation to characterize body mass index (BMI) with four groups and estimated the association between exposure and group membership. In boys, higher maternal concentrations of DDT and DDE during pregnancy are associated with a BMI growth pattern that is stable until about age five followed by increased growth through age nine. In contrast, higher maternal DDT exposure during pregnancy is associated with a flat, relatively stable growth pattern in girls. This study suggests that in utero exposure to DDT and DDE may be associated with childhood BMI growth patterns, not just BMI level, and both the magnitude of exposure and sex may impact the relationship.

40|$|Background. Production {{of foods}} safe for {{consumption}} {{is an important}} issue worldwide. Organochlorine pesticides (OCP) are often used to preserve crops. Their use can have serious impacts on human health. Objectives. This research aims at assessing OCP residues in food samples from markets in Lagos in southwestern Nigeria and their risk to human health. Methods. Sixteen food samples were collected from Lagos, Nigeria and analyzed for organochlorine pesticide residues. Extraction was performed using an ultrasonicator, and analysis was carried out using a gas chromatograph-electron capture detector. Risk assessment was carried out by determining the hazard quotient. Results. Results of the OCP residues found in the foods were generally low, with dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) having the highest residue concentration. The concentration of p,p'-DDE was as high as 110 ng/g in pulses and 123 ng/g in Cameroon and chili peppers. The risk index was < 1 in most cases, with the exception of <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (p,p'-DDD) in fruits for children. Discussion. The results were generally lower than what has been documented {{in other parts of the}} world and suggest that consumption of the foods investigated in the present study in Nigeria may be considered safe for the 13 OCPs investigated. Conclusions. There is a need for continuous monitoring of these OCPs and investigation of carbamate and phosphate pesticide residues since they are more widely used in farming practices in Nigeria.

However, few studies have compared the bioaccumulation potential of various test species over a range of sediment contaminants (hydrophobic organics and metals). As part of the development and standardization of a laboratory bioaccumulation method for the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, mayfly nymph Hexagenia spp., and juvenile fathead minnow Pimephales promelas were exposed {{to a variety of}} field-contaminated sediments (n 10) to evaluate their relative effectiveness for accumulating different contaminants (e. g., dichlorodiphe-nyltrichloroethane [DDT] and metabolites, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs), polychlori-nated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans [PCDD/Fs), and heavy metals). Bioaccumulation was usually highest in L. variegatus but also most variable within and (relative measures) between sediments. Bioaccumulation was similar between L. variegatus and Hexagenia spp. in most of the sediments tested. Significant differences in bioaccumulation between species were observed for DDT, <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDD), PAHs, and PCDD/Fs. The present study indicates that species-specific differences in bioaccumulation may, but do not always, exist and can vary with contaminant and sediment type.

40|$|Endocrine-disrupting organochlorines, {{such as the}} {{pesticide}} dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs), thereby eliciting estrogen-like effects. Although ERs function predominantly through activation of transcription via estrogen-responsive elements, both ERs, alpha and ss, can interact with various transcription factors such as activator protein- 1 (AP- 1). Additionally, estrogens may regulate early signaling events, suggesting that the biological effects of environmental estrogens may not be mediated through classic ER (alpha and ss) activity alone. We hypothesized that known environmental estrogens, such as DDT and its metabolites, activate AP- 1 -mediated gene transactivation through both ER-dependent and ER-independent means. Using two Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line variants that we confirmed to be estrogen responsive [Ishikawa(+) ] and estrogen unresponsive [Ishikawa(-) ], we generated stably transfected AP- 1 luciferase cell lines to identify {{the role of an}} estrogen-responsive mechanism in AP- 1 -mediated gene expression by various stimuli. Our results demonstrate that DDT and <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDD) were the most potent activators of AP- 1 activity; 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid failed to activate. Although stimulated in both Ishikawa(+) and Ishikawa(-) cells by DDT and its congeners, AP- 1 activation was more pronounced in the estrogen-unresponsive Ishikawa(-) cells. In addition, DDT, DDD, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) could also stimulate AP- 1 activity in the estrogen-unresponsive human embryonic kidney 293 cells using a different promoter context.

40|$|Pot {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of various fertilizers, as well as soil dilution treatments on the dynamics of soil-borne DDTs [sum of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), chlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDD) ] and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs, sum of α-HCH, β-HCH, γ-HCH and δ-HCH) and their subsequent impacts on the uptake of DDTs and HCHs by a test plant. The results show that the soil residual DDTs and HCHs concentrations in the iron-rich fertilizer-treated soil were significantly lower than those in other fertilizer-treated soils. There was a close relationship between the soil residual DDTs and the plant tissue DDTs. This suggests that the uptake rate of DDTs by the plant was dependent on the concentration of soil-borne DDTs. A less close relationship between soil residual HCHs and plant tissue HCHs was also observed. Dilution of pesticide-contaminated soil with the non-contaminated soil not only physically reduced the concentration of pesticides in the soil but also enhanced the loss of soil-borne pesticides, possibly through the improvement of soil conditions for microbial degradation. Soil dilution had a better effect on promoting the loss of soil-borne HCHs, relative to soil-borne-DDTs. The research findings obtained from this study have implications for management of heavily contaminated soils with DDTs and HCHs. Remediation of DDTs and HCHs-contaminated soils in a cost-effective way can be achieved by incorporating treatment techniques into conventional agricultural practices. Applications of iron-rich fertilizer and soil dilution treatments could cost-effectively reduce soil-borne DDTs and HCHs, and subsequently the uptake of these organochlorine pesticides by vegetables...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Estuarine Ecosystem Indicators Research Consortium {{seeks to}} develop bioindicators of toxicant-induced stress and {{bioavailability}} for wetland biota. Within this framework, {{the effects of}} environmental and pollutant variables on microbial communities were studied at different spatial scales over a 2 -year period. Six salt marshes along the California coastline were characterized using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (TRFLP) analysis. Additionally, 27 metals, six currently used pesticides, total polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlordanes, nonachlors, <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane,</b> and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene were analyzed. Sampling was performed over large (between salt marshes), medium (stations within a marsh), and small (different channel depths) spatial scales. Regression and ordination analysis suggested that the spatial variation in microbial communities exceeded the variation attributable to pollutants. PLFA analysis and TRFLP canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) explained 74 and 43 % of the variation, respectively, and both methods attributed 34 % of the variation to tidal cycles, marsh, year, and latitude. After accounting for spatial variation using partial CCA, we found that metals had a greater effect on microbial community composition than organic pollutants had. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were positively correlated with PLFA biomass, whereas total metal concentrations were positively correlated with biomass and diversity. Higher concentrations of heavy metals were negatively correlated with branched PLFAs and positively correlated with methyl- and cyclo-substituted PLFAs. The strong relationships observed between pollutant concentrations and some of the microbial indicators indicated the potential for using microbial community analyses in assessments of the ecosystem health of salt marshes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{numerous}} researches done on Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in China {{and in the}} world, information regarding emissions and concentrations of OCPs in Karst caves is extremely limited. Karst areas have much higher ecological vulnerability and are so easy to be contaminated. This paper presents results of a monitoring program conducted in Dayan cave, Guilin, China {{that was designed to}} characterize levels, trends and sources of pesticides in soil (sediment) samples. Thirteen soil samples were collected and OCPs were analysed. Inside the cave a total concentration of OCPs (∑OCPs) detected was 29. 659 ng /g with a mean value of 3. 295 ng /g and ∑OCPs detected outside the cave was 74. 108 ng /g with a mean value of 18. 527 ng/g. ∑OCPs outside the cave was higher than ∑OCPs outside the cave. The concentration of Chlordane in OCPs was highest among all the OCPs detected with range of 0. 12 ─ 13. 253 ng/g and mean value of 3. 93 ng /g. The next compound with high level of concentration was Heptachlor which ranged from Non-detected (ND) to 2. 465 ng/g with a mean value of 1. 4 ng/g. The pollution of OCPs in soil comparing with other countries and other areas in China was light. The analysis of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers showed that there was fresh input of Dicofol and Lindane in the study area. By calculating the ratios of <b>Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDD) to Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), {{it was found that the}} degradation of DDT outside the cave was aerobic and the degradation of DDT inside the cave wa...|$|E
40|$|Although {{approximately}} 123 {{million people}} may be exposed {{to high levels of}} insecticides through the use of indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria control, fewstudies exist on indoor insecticide contamination due to IRS and its relationship with human exposure. In the present study, we developed a sampling method to collect undisturbed dust from 50 homes in Limpopo, South Africa, a region where dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been used in IRS programs to preventmalaria for ~ 70 years. WequantifiedDDT and its degradation products, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDD) in dust samples to determine dust loading levels and compared these levels to paired serum concentrations of p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE in women residents. p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE had the highest detection frequencies in both dust (58 % and 34 % detection, respectively) and serumsamples (98 % and 100 % detection, respectively). Significantly higher detection frequencies for o,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDE, and p,p′-DDDwere observed in dust samples collected in buildings that had been previously sprayed for malaria control. We also observed a significant, positive association between dust loading and serumconcentrations of p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE (Spearman's rho= 0. 68 and 0. 54, respectively). Despite the lowdetection frequency in dust, our results indicate that undisturbed dustmay be a goodmetric to quantify longterm home exposure to DDT-related compounds and that contamination of the home environment may be an important determinant/source of DDT and DDE exposure.

40|$|M. Tech. (Biotechnology) Abstract: The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues in both animals and humans remained major public health concerns which require some serious attention especially in South Africa with high consumption rate of cattle and cattle products. However, review of literature revealed that, {{there seems to be}} no studies conducted to establish estimated levels of dairy cattle exposure to OCP by estimating levels in dairy cattle feeds, milk, urine, and water, in South Africa. Therefore, this present study was carried out to analyse the possible presence of OCP residues in cattle/ bovine feed, milk, water and urine samples. The samples analysed included, milk (24 samples), urine (12 samples), water (12 samples) and feed (36 samples) which were collected into 50 mL sterile capped bottle from 12 selected farms in Gauteng province of South Africa. Six different OCP residues namely, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane</b> (DDD), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and endrin were analysed. The samples preparation method for OCP involved the use of liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure, while separation and quantification was done using a two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight with mass spectrometer (GCXGC TOF MS). The results of the perception study revealed that out of the 12 farms, 41. 7 % practice chemical method and 58 % practice biological method of pest control. The majority of farmers (75 %) were found to be aware of pesticide residues risks but (92 %) neither tested for pesticide residues nor attended any food safety training on pesticide uses. Moreover, the results from GCXGC TOF MS analysis revealed that urine samples were contaminated with OCP residues with high concentration of endosulfan I ranging from 0. 03 to 0. 05 mg/kg, while DDT and its isomers ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 02 mg/kg. Milk also showed high levels of endosulfan I (range: 0. 05 to [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Twenty {{successive}} daytime and nighttime air {{samples were}} collected and analyzed for 23 currently used and/banned organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) between 14 and 23 May 2003 in Izmir, Turkey. Average individual OCP concentrations ranged from 5 ± 4 pgm- 3 (p,p′- <b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane)</b> to 391 ± 306 pgm- 3 (chlorpyrifos) and they were within the ranges previously measured at different sites. Most of the OCPs did not exhibit strong diurnal cycling. The temperature dependence of gas-phase atmospheric concentrations of OCPs investigated using Clausius-Clapeyron plots was statistically significant for β-HCH and endosulfan sulfate (p< 0. 1) and was not significant for other compounds (0 - 21 % of the variability in their gas-phase concentrations). In addition to temperature, the effect of wind speed and direction was also investigated using multiple linear regression analysis and these three parameters together explained the 2 % (aldrin) to 72 % (endosulfan II) of the variability in gas-phase OCP concentrations. Results of the multiple regression analysis indicated that wind speed was a statistically significant factor {{for most of the}} OCPs and wind direction was important for some compounds. The temperature-dependent diurnal cycling of most OCPs was probably masked by the higher wind speeds observed during daytime periods with high temperatures, different source sectors and ongoing sources. The lack of correlation for heptachlor, aldrin, p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p-p′-DDE), and p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p-p′-DDT) with temperature, wind speed and direction suggested that their concentrations were affected by long-range transport. The partitioning of OCPs between particle and gas phases was investigated and compared to KOA (octanol/air partition coefficient) absorption model. The overall agreement between experimental and modeled logKp (gas/particle partition coefficient) values was good (p< 0. 01, slope= 0. 94). Prediction of absorption model for particulate percentages was excellent for β-HCH, endosulfan I, and p-p′-DDT. However, the model underpredicted the particulate percentages for α,γ-HCHs, chlorpyrifos, and dieldrin, and overpredicted those for p-p′-DDE.

40|$|With the {{worldwide}} use of insecticides, {{the number of}} resistant insect species increases resulting in decreased efficacy of pesticides and threat of human welfare by crop failures and disease transmission. Environmental concentrations of some insecticides are so high that even populations of non-target organisms are selected for resistance. Thus, Cyp 6 g 1 -overexpressing strains of Drosophila melanogaster Meig. were selected; they are resistant {{to a wide range}} of diverse insecticides, including DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and imidacloprid. Up to now however, no evidence has been available that the cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase CYP 6 G 1 is able to metabolise insecticides. This should be studied regarding imidacloprid, DDT, and methoxychlor by heterologous expression of Cyp 6 g 1 in cell suspension cultures of Nicotiana tabacum L. as convenient in vitro system. The required vectors with cDNA of Cyp 6 g 1 and vectors with cDNA of Cyp 71 u 4 v 2 (barley) and Cyp 3 a 4 (human) for additional studies, were constructed, tobacco cells were transformed and studied by molecular biology. It was demonstrated, that CYP 6 G 1 is capable of metabolising the (14 C-labelled) insecticides. Cyp 6 g 1 -transgenic culture 6 L converted 400 µg imidacloprid within 48 h to 60 % of 4 -hydroxyimidacloprid, 20 % of 5 -hydroxyimidacloprid, 7 % of olefinic imidacloprid and minor amounts of 4, 5 -dihydroxyimidacloprid with an absolute metabolic rate of 86 % (no detectable turnover in the non-transgenic culture LS). In supplementary studies, the metabolic pathway of imidacloprid derived from CYP 6 G 1 was elucidated, and it was shown that the appearance of the olefinic metabolite was traced back to the influence of the acidic media. After simultaneous application of P 450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (200 µg), the CYP 6 G 1 -dependent metabolism of imidacloprid (20 µg, 24 h) was inhibited by 82 %. DDT (20 µg) was only converted under anaerobic conditions in a closed system within 48 h by reductive dechlorination to 16 % DDD (<b>dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane)</b> (in one parallel) besides low amounts of possible further metabolites with an absolute metabolic rate of 37 %. However, this result showed only a limited reproducibility. In the LS culture only 2 % DDD were detected in the closed system with an absolute metabolic rate of 11 %. Methoxychlor (45. 8 µg) was converted to 17 % of catechol methoxychlor, 16 % of trishydroxymethoxychlor, 8 % of bishydroxymethoxychlor, and 6 % of monohydroxymethoxychlor in the 6 L cell culture within 24 h (absolute metabolic rate: 96 %). In contrast to studies with imidacloprid and DDT, LS culture showed a high absolute metabolic rate of 62 % regarding methoxychlor. Nevertheless, 34 % of the metabolic rate and especially the increased formation of trishydroxymethoxychlor and catechol methoxychlor could be traced back to the enzymatic activity of CYP 6 G 1. Similarly, the absolute metabolic rate of methoxychlor in 6 L and LS culture was inhibited by 43 % and 92 %, respectively, after simultaneous application of piperonyl butoxide (458 µg). Due to this treatment, the glycoside fraction decreased in favour of primary metabolites. The metabolic capacity of CYP 6 G 1 leads to detoxification of different insecticides towards Drosophila. Thus, the gap between the supposed resistance gene Cyp 6 g 1 and the observed resistance phenomenon was closed by the evidence that CYP 6 G 1 is at least able to metabolise three insecticides. It should be mentioned that CYP 6 G 1 is presumably not alone responsible for the resistance towards DDT but confers probably resistance towards methoxychlor. Using 4 -n-nonylphenol, a substrate of CYP 71 U 4 v 2, which was shown to be overexpressed in barley during pathogen defence, was finally identified. Cyp 71 u 4 v 2 -transgenic culture formed the main metabolites 4 ’-hydroxy- 4 -n-nonylphenol and 5 ’-hydroxy- 4 -n-nonylphenol with an absolute metabolic rate of 93 %. In the non-transgenic culture, a high metabolic rate of 60 % was also detected. However, the pattern of side chain hydroxylated metabolites with the main metabolite 8 ’-hydroxy- 4 -n-nonylphenol differed obviously from that of the transgenic culture – thus clearly proving the enzymatic activity of CYP 71 U 4 v 2. The turnover of the degradation product of nonylphenol polyethoxylates formerly used in pesticide formulations by endogenous enzymes could be quite relevant for barley. The present work showed that the tobacco cell suspension culture is a convenient expression system for P 450 genes of diverse origin enabling to elucidate or predict metabolism-based resistance phenomena without the need of expression of appropriate P 450 reductase...|$|E
