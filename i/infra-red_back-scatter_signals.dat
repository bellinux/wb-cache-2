50|$|One typical {{implementation}} of the SAU is the one proposed by Jensen. In his model, only one array element in the transducer is used each time to emit a nearly spherical wave that will cover the whole region of interest. All elements are used to receive the <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signal</b> at the same time, obtaining a low-resolution for each firing. The <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signal</b> contains information required to form the image in all directions and the specific direction can be acquired by applying different delays to signals received by different elements, thus this process works as dynamic focusing at the receiver. By summing all the low-resolution images acquired each time with a determined weight, the final high resolution image is formed and dynamic focusing at transmission is synthesized.|$|R

Thus, the base-station is able to distinguish data signal from user and <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signal</b> from object. We assume a time division duplex (TDD) framework. The pilot sequences are designed for MIMO channels. We evaluate channel MSE as a figure of merit for communication system. We also show that the designed pilots are uncorrelated for a range of time lags. Moreover, designed uplink pilot has negligible autocorrelation for a range of time lags leading to an impulse-like autocorrelation for radar sensing.

However, up to now most approaches are built upon single-wavelength Lidar system, which could only provide structure information of the vegetation canopy, the intensity information was rarely used to monitor vegetation growing state as its limitation on spectral characteristics. On the other hand, positive multi/hyper-spectral imaging instruments highly rely on the effects of weather, shadow and the background noise etc. The attempts to fuse single-wavelength Lidar data with multi/hyper-spectral data also been effected this way. Thus, a concept for a multi-wavelength, active canopy Lidar has been tested in this paper.

The theoretical approach for the derivation of the back-scattered field is based on Bloomfield generalization [1] of Jensen formalism [2]. The <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signals</b> are obtained by spatially convolving the spatial distribution of the inhomogeneity with the temporal auto-convolution function of the transmitted impulse response calculated. A spatial one-dimensional convolution is first operated in the depth direction. After summation and amplitude detection of the back-scattered echoes, an A-mode then a B-mode echography of the considered axis is obtained. Juxtaposition of the B-mode lines furnishes the two-dimensional image of the structure. Phantom image of tissues have been simulated under Matlab.

40|$|A pulse {{compression}} technique that gives an optimum contrast and visibility of targets in radar-based medical imaging is presented. A smoothing window for microwave beamforming technique which more properly alleviates {{the effect of}} abrupt truncation in finite length signals {{with the aid of}} the uncertainty principle is utilized. It is found that using a closer output signal shape to the Gaussian pulse results in a lower uncertainty and ambiguity in the reconstructed images. Hence, when the <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signal</b> passes through a window whose uncertainty is the least, the visibility of the target in the imaged domain will be the highest with high signal-to-noise ratio and fine resolution in microwave medical imaging. The accumulation of the above properties together increases the chance of detecting any abnormality in the human body at early stages and thus resulting in a higher chance of survival. The idea is tested on a real-sized head model surrounded by an array of dipoles operating across the band 1. 3 - 1. 4 GHz.

Conventional echoscopic techniques are not feasible because the <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signal</b> from a possible defect is usually overshadowed by much stronger reflections from {{the walls of the}} thin plate and by additional scattering from inherent inhomogeneities such as imbedded fibers and alternating plies. Single or double transmission attenuation measurements offer a convenient, but rather insensitive alternative. Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagrams of the conventional normal incidence and the oblique incidence so-called Lamb wave inspection techniques. At normal incidence, we can use a focused transducer of very good lateral resolution, but the sensitivity might be rather low when the defect exhibits a very small scattering cross-section from this particular direction of interrogation. This occurs, for instance, in the case of weak porosity when the defects tend to be concentrated in a thin layer parallel with the plies, or as is shown in Fig. 1, in the case of transverse cracks. In such cases, oblique incidence inspection can be expected to give better sensitivity since Lamb modes propagating parallel to the plate are more attenuated. At the same time, the lateral resolution will be inherently lower, therefore the ultrasonic contrast must be carefully optimized on a case-by-case basis...|$|R

40|$|The {{gradient}} {{method is}} applied to the total recorded backscatter signal (including the background) multiplied by squared range and divided by molecular backscatter coefficient and molecular transmission terms (known). Thus, the new function has a linear dependence on squared range divided by molecular backscatter and molecular transmission terms. On a 2 dimensional plot, as a function of time and range (altitude here), for each time stamp, the intercept corresponding to the derivative of the new function is determined. The mean and the standard deviation (STD) of the intercept, calculated from the derivative of the function over the far-end region (12 - 15 km) are computed. Next, the heights where the corresponding intercepts are outside the limits defined by mean +/- 1 STD are selected. Thus, intercepts larger than the mean + 1 STD represent regions of decreasing <b>back-scatter</b> <b>signal</b> and intercepts smaller than mean - 1 STD represent regions of increasing backscatter sig-nal.

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{interferences}} for the pulsed radar system is the arrival of unwanted echoes after the transmission of a new pulse. The range ambiguity then appears if the current transmitted pulse does {{not contribute to the}} <b>back-scattered</b> <b>signal</b> received after the transmission of this pulse. These late arrival echoes can appear when there are strong reflectors located after the maximum range detected by the radar system, namely ambiguity range. These kinds of echoes induce shadows in the image, which can be misinterpreted. Removal of this kind of ambiguities is an important matter for SAR images. The fundamental and theoretical analysis on ambiguities have been already achieved [2]. The ambiguity treatment remains an important issue as the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) raises, whereas reasonable swath widths are required [4]. The use of a low PRF makes possible to mitigate range ambiguities but induces Doppler ambiguities degrading the azimuth resolution. To solve this trade-off, several ambiguity suppression techniques are proposed. For example, the use of alternating up and down chirp modulation is often presented [5]. Another technique is based on the azimuth phase coding to reduce the ambiguities [6]. Pulse block coding technique also makes possible to detect false targets due to the range ambiguity through matched filtering operations [7]. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals are also proposed to reduce the cross-correlation between each transmitted pulse [8]. Moreover, these OFDM signals are designed to optimize the imaging quality parameters using genetic algorithms [9, 10].|$|R
