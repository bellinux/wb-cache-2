40|$|A {{means for}} {{developing}} a space shuttle maintenance program which will be acceptable to the development centers, the operators (KSC and AF), and the manufacturer is presented. The general organization and decision processes for determining the essential <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> requirements for the space shuttle orbiter are outlined. The development of initial <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> programs is discussed. The remaining maintenance, that is non-scheduled or non-routine maintenance, is directed by {{the findings of the}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> program and the normal operation of the shuttle. The remaining maintenance consists of maintenance actions to correct discrepancies noted during <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> tasks, nonscheduled maintenance, normal operation, or condition monitoring...|$|R
40|$|<b>Scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{procedures}} for civil aircraft structures went through decades of evolution from hard time replacement to time-based inspection. Currently, different inspection tasks {{are carried out}} at predetermined intervals to check the condition of structural components. If {{the condition of the}} structure exceeds a certain threshold, repair activities are initiated. The two key parameters in <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> are the inspection interval and the repair threshold. The development of new materials such as composites and the introduction of advanced Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) techniques, will {{have a profound effect on}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Considering the current level of maturity of SHM technologies, several combinations of SHM and <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> are proposed in this paper and a probabilistic analysis is performed to quantify the savings on maintenance cost...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{gives the}} {{comparative}} analysis between two models with production depending on demand. The two models (Model 1 and Model 2) considered {{are on a}} cable manufacturing plant with the difference of <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Model 1 considers a single unit system with <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> whereas Model 2 is without <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Initially, the system is in operative state and demand is {{greater than or equal}} to the production. As variation in demand affects the production of system, consequently, the system needs to be in down state when the numbers of produces are more than those demanded. This model has been compared with the model wherein the <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> is carried out. Comparative study with respect to the availability and the profit has been made between two models. Semi-Markov processes and regenerative point technique have been used to obtain various measures of the system effectiveness for each model...|$|R

50|$|Planned {{preventive}} maintenance (PPM), more {{commonly referred to}} as simply planned <b>maintenance</b> (PM) or <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance,</b> is any variety of <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> to an object or item of equipment.

40|$|The current {{aircraft}} maintenance philosophy, {{referred to as}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance,</b> follows a preventative strategy in which maintenance tasks are carried out at predetermined intervals or according to prescribed criteria related to safety, operational and economic aspects. Emerging technologies, such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), are proposed by airframe manufacturers to reduce long-term maintenance cost and increase aircraft availability. It introduces a timely and automatic diagnostic and prognostic capability which may bring substantial changes to the current maintenance philosophy. This study investigates an integrated approach of <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> and SHM by suggestion various logical maintenance procedures. A probabilistic model is established {{to examine the effects}} of the SHM synchronization with <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> and the impact on both safety and economy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the stochastic modeling of recorded Times Between Failures (TBF) of electric rail vehicles, {{taking into account}} <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> actions these vehicles undergo. The study is based upon historical data from the Athens Electric Railways and a novel non-stationary Functional Series (FS) modeling framework, which allows for the modeling, <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> actions incorporation, analysis, as well as failure time prediction. Modeling of TBF series using square root and logarithmic transformations is considered as a simple means of accounting for non-Gaussianity and positiveness. The {{results of the study}} indicate that FS models incorporating <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> actions are signi cantly better than models not accounting for them. It is specically shown that knowledge of the maintenance actions signicantly improves prediction of the next Time to Failure...|$|R

40|$|Aircraft <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{requirements}} are rapidly extending and developing due to rapid evolution of small aircraft. This evolution leads to implementation of until recently exclusively airliner class maintenance standards. In {{the field of}} general aviation and FAR 23 / EASA CS- 23 especially, preventive maintenance based on part replacing or repairing is still dominant. DAMAGE TOLERANCE philosophy implementation into an aircraft design influences maintenance procedures, which are adjusted to older SAFE LIFE philosophy. Aircraft manufactures are developing new ways, how to integrate requirements of damage tolerance application into <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> procedures. Huge airliner manufactures (FAR 25 / CS- 25) are using the ATA MSG- 3 intelligent maintenance approach based on inspection.

40|$|Advances in {{aviation}} technology including {{the development of}} relatively cheap, very light jets {{and the possibility of}} free-flight have led to the realization of a per-seat, on-demand air transportation business that operates without a published flight schedule. One of the decision problems this business faces is planning the <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{that has to be done}} period-ically for safety reasons. Careful planning of <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> in this dynamic business environment is required to ensure safe and efficient operations. In this paper, we address both tactical and operational planning for <b>scheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> of per-seat, on-demand air transportation. At the tactical level, we determine the daily mainte-nance capacities. As the fleet size grows over time, decisions pertaining to when and how much to increase maintenance capacity are made. At the operational level, we assign itineraries to jets and determine the jets to be maintained on a daily basis. We further embed operational main-tenance planning into a framework that captures the interaction between maintenance decisions and daily flight scheduling. ...|$|R
