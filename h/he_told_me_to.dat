25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train {{with some of the}} best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He was a little too anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E
500|$|During {{the snake}} {{handling}} {{scene at the}} Church of God with Signs and Wonders, the song being sung by the congregation is called [...] "May Glory Protect Us". The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I told him I could write one that was better and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it. [...] It was a great tribute {{that he was able}} to ask me and accept my opinion on it." ...|$|E

500|$|Life Is Peachy {{opens with}} the forty-nine second prelude [...] "Twist", {{which is made}} up of improvised scat singing done by Davis. Doug Small {{described}} the singing as [...] "spitting out the twisted rantings of a madman", and said that it was fit for the album's introduction. An a cappella version of [...] "Twist" [...] is included as a hidden track after [...] "Kill You". [...] "Chi" [...] is named after former Deftones bassist Chi Cheng. Davis said that the song [...] "Chi" [...] is [...] "about a lot of alcohol and drug abuse". The song was named after Cheng for the sole reason that Cheng liked reggae and had taken it into his head that the song [...] "Chi" [...] was actually a reggae song. [...] "Swallow" [...] is about drug-induced paranoia. [...] "Mr. Rogers" [...] is about Fred Rogers. Davis said: [...] "As a kid, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be polite, and all it did was get me picked on. I fucking hate that man. Thanks for making me polite and trusting everyone, and easy to take advantage of." [...] "K@#Ø%!" [...] is about women who have hurt Davis. Munky said the band were going to send it to the radio as a joke because they [...] "knew they wouldn't play it, then follow up about a week later with the real thing". [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] is an Acronym for [...] "All Day I Dream About Sex". Davis explained the background behind [...] "Good God": [...] "Ass Itch" [...] is about Davis' difficulty with songwriting. [...] "Kill You" [...] is about Davis' ex-stepmother. Davis explained: ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{commentary}} track, Ben Affleck says he [...] "asked Michael {{why it was}} easier to train oil drillers to become astronauts than it was to train astronauts to become oil drillers, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> shut the fuck up, so {{that was the end of}} that talk." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So it was. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> not <b>to</b> omit seeing I had a {{life-preserver}} in my state-room; {{said the}} boat supplied them, too. But where are they? I don't see any. What are they like?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Jill Lawler: “I felt so disgusting, but I {{just did}} what <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do, which was basically, like, {{manually}} jerk him off. [...] I hated doing it. [...] But I felt like I owed him, you know? I felt like I owed him for, like, my life.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Beat Takeshi told a {{documentary}} crew during filming {{that he believes}} [...] "an actor's job is to satisfy the director... I move the way I'm told to. I try to look the way I'm told to. I don't {{know much about the}} emotional side", before adding, [...] "Mr. Fukasaku told me to play myself. I did not really understand, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play myself, as I ordinarily would be! I'm just trying to do what he tells me." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, by August the BBC {{had decided}} to {{terminate}} the group due to perceived unpopularity and being [...] "... {{out of step with}} viewers". Their final appearance was in October 1976 (by this time Trace and Gillespie had already left, reducing Ruby Flipper to five members), with the senior management insisting on a replacement all-female grouping. Flick Colby recalled of this time [...] "Bill Cotton called me in and said the British public didn’t want to see black men dancing with white women...I argued, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> form another all-girl group or I was out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not me, sir!" [...] {{protested the}} boy, in haste. [...] "I'm very ignorant about--about health, and {{medicine}} and the like. But in New York I consulted a famous doctor, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> what <b>to</b> do." ...|$|R

"Mr. Travers {{from the}} police, sir, 'e called <b>to</b> see <b>me</b> at the club, and 'e {{took me in}} a taxicab to Grosvenor Square, and told the shoffer, sir, to pull up by the curb on the garden side.

I didn't 'arf like it, sir, because I'm not supposed to absent myself for very long of a morning, though the committee ain't very partik'lar.

2500|$|In high school, he met {{his future}} wife, Grace Martin, {{daughter}} of Gib Martin, an evangelical pastor. In 1989, he graduated from Highline High School in Burien, Washington, where he served as student body president, captain of the baseball team, editor of the school newspaper, and the [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] in his graduating class. At age 19, as a college freshman, Driscoll converted to evangelical Christianity. The same year, according to Driscoll, [...] "God spoke to me... <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry Grace, preach the Bible, train men, and plant churches... I began preparing to devote my life to obey [...] call for me." [...] He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications from Washington State University with a minor in philosophy and holds a Master of Arts degree in exegetical theology from Western Seminary.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets IV is the {{grandson}} of Paul W. Tibbets, Jr., the pilot of the aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945. He grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and was inspired to join the United States Air Force (USAF) not by his famous grandfather but by his father, Paul W. Tibbets III, a pharmacist and hospital administrator {{who served in the}} United States Army Reserve, retiring as a colonel. [...] "When I was in 9th grade," [...] he recalled [...] "I became involved in youth service projects. It was a passion of mine to serve. My father said 'You seem to be very interested in serving – {{what do you want to}} do with your life?' I told him I was interested in serving, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> look into something like the ROTC or service academies." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{not more}} than {{thirteen}} years old, when in my loneliness and destitution I longed for some one to whom I could go, as to a father and protector. The preaching of a white Methodist minister, named Hanson, was the means of causing me to feel that in God I had such a friend. He thought that all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinners {{in the sight of}} God: that they were by nature rebels against His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinct notion of what was required of me, but one thing I did know well: I was wretched and had no means of making myself otherwise.I consulted a good old colored man named Charles Lawson, and in tones of holy affection <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pray, and to [...] "cast all my care upon God." [...] This I sought to do; and though for weeks I was a poor, broken-hearted mourner, traveling through doubts and fears, I finally found my burden lightened, and my heart relieved. I loved all mankind, slaveholders not excepted, though I abhorred slavery more than ever. I saw the world in a new light, and my great concern was to have everybody converted. My desire to learn increased, and especially, did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contents of the Bible.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> roughly <b>to</b> get <b>me</b> gone; but 'I {{had laughed}} [...] on the lass with my bonny black eye.' So {{the next day}} I [...] got an invite to Glenbogie, and at the {{appropriate}} time in [...] August, ...|$|R
