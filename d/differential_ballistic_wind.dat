The general approach was to derive regression equations from a dependent data sample of nearly coincident subsatellite points and rawinsonde locations.

Tests with the <b>ballistic</b> <b>wind</b> component normal to {{the path of the}} NIMBUS 3 suggested standard errors of less than 10 kts can be achieved. Both zonal and meridional components can be calculated from SIRS-B radiance data which is grouped in clusters. Because the geostrophic <b>ballistic</b> <b>wind</b> is proportional to a horizontal gradient, several techniques were attempted for calculating the gradient at the central point of the irregularly spaced set of data.

40|$|AbstractIt {{follows from}} the {{analysis}} of artillery fire errors that approximately two-thirds of the inaccuracy of indirect artillery fire is caused by inaccuracies in {{the determination of the}} meteo parameters included in fire error budget model. Trajectories calculated under non-standard conditions are considered to be perturbed. The tools utilized for the analysis of perturbed trajectories are weighting factor functions (WFFs) which are a special kind of sensitivity functions.

We have found that the existing theory of WFF calculation has several significant shortcomings.

40|$|Much {{theoretical}} and observational {{work has been}} done on stellar winds within binary systems. We present a new solution for a <b>ballistic</b> <b>wind</b> launched from a source in a circular orbit. Our method emphasizes the curved streamlines in the corotating frame, where the flow is steady-state, allowing us to obtain an exact solution for the mass density at all pre-shock locations. Assuming an initially isotropic wind, fluid elements launched from the interior hemisphere of the wind {{will be the first to}} cross other streamlines, resulting in a spiral structure bounded by two shock surfaces. Streamlines from the outer wind hemisphere later intersect these shocks as well. An analytic solution is obtained for the geometry of the two shock surfaces. Although the inner and outer shock surfaces asymptotically trace Archimedean spirals, our tail solution suggests many crossings where the shocks overlap, beyond which the analytic solution cannot be continued. Our solution can be readily extended to an initially anisotropic wind. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, accepted to Ap...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{terminal}} ballistics experiments and 2 -D simulations, with small scale tungsten alloy penetrators, {{was performed in}} order to quantify the ballistic efficiency of confined ceramic tiles. The data includes both depth of penetration (DOP), into thick steel backing and X-ray shadowgraphs during the penetration process. Impact velocities ranged between 1. 25 to 3. 0 km/s. The size of the tiles varied in order to check their performance {{as a function of}} thickness and lateral dimensions. We found that the <b>differential</b> <b>ballistic</b> efficiency of alumina tiles is practically independent on impact velocity and tile thickness, within the ranges of velocity and thicknesses, investigated here. A detailed simulation study, using the Eulerian processor of the PISCES 2 -D ELK code, was performed in order to better understand the interaction between long-rods and ceramic tiles, and particularly, to adjust a proper failure criterion to the tiles. We found that a simple version of the Johnson- Holm quist model, with a single parameter, is fairly adequate to account for most of the data. These include: lateral confinement, tile thickness and impact velocity influence on the penetration depth. We used the code to further investigate the influence of lateral dimensions on tile performance...|$|R

Throughout this period, there has been an interesting interaction between analytic theory of differential equations, numerical and graphical techniques of integration, and empirical research by means of experimental measures. Mathematicians, ballisticians and artillerymen, although belonging to different milieus, collaborated and inspired themselves mutually. All this led however to a relative failure, both experimentally to find a good law of air resistance, and mathematically to find a simple solution of the ballistic equation. Mathematical research on the ballistic equation has played nevertheless the role of a laboratory where the modern numerical analysis was able to develop. Mathematicians have indeed been able to test on this recalcitrant equation all possible approaches to calculate the solution of a differential equation.

40|$|When a {{high voltage}} (~ 30 kV) {{is applied to}} a {{capacitor}} whose electrodes have different physical dimensions, the capacitor experiences a net force toward the smaller electrode (Biefeld-Brown effect). We have verified this effect by building four capacitors of different shapes. The effect may have applications to vehicle propulsion and dielectric pumps. We review {{the history of this}} effect briefly through the history of patents by Thomas Townsend Brown. At present, the physical basis for the Biefeld-Brown effect is not understood. The order of magnitude of the net force on the asymmetric capacitor is estimated assuming two different mechanisms of charge conduction between its electrodes: <b>ballistic</b> ionic <b>wind</b> and ionic drift. The calculations indicate that ionic wind is at least three orders of magnitude too small to explain the magnitude of the observed force on the capacitor. The ionic drift transport assumption leads to the correct order of magnitude for the force, however, {{it is difficult to see}} how ionic drift enters into the theory. Finally, we present a detailed thermodynamic treatment of the net force on an asymmetric capacitor. In the future, to understand this effect, a detailed theoretical model must be constructed that takes into account plasma effects: ionization of gas (or air) in the high electric field region, charge transport, and resulting dynamic forces on the electrodes. The next series of experiments should determine whether the effect occurs in vacuum, and a careful study should be carried out to determine the dependence of the observed force on gas pressure, gas species and applied voltage.

40|$|Abstract For many {{plant species}} in eastern North America, short {{observed}} seed dispersal distances (ranging up {{to a few}} tens of meters) fail to explain rapid rates of invasion and migration. This discrepancy points to a substantial gap in {{our knowledge of the}} mechanisms by which seeds are dispersed long distances. We investigated the potential for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.), the dominant large herbivore in much of eastern North America, to disperse seeds via endozoochory. This is the first comprehensive study of seed dispersal by white-tailed deer, despite a vast body of research on other aspects of their ecology. More than 70 plant species germinated from deer feces collected over a 1 -year period in central New York State, USA. Viable seeds included native and alien herbs, shrubs, and trees, including several invasive introduced species, from the full range of habitat types in the local flora. A mean of> 30 seeds germinated per fecal pellet group, and seeds were dispersed during all months of the year. A wide variety of presumed dispersal modes were represented (endo- and exozoochory, <b>wind,</b> <b>ballistic,</b> ant, and unassisted). The majority were species with small-seeded fruits having no obvious adaptations for dispersal, underscoring the difficulty of inferring dispersal ability from diaspore morphology. Due to their broad diet, wide-ranging movements, and relatively long gut retention times, white-tailed deer have tremendous potential for effecting long-distance seed dispersal via ingestion and defecation. We conclude that white-tailed deer represent a significant and previously unappreciated vector of seed dispersal across the North American landscape, probably contributing an important long-distance component to the seed shadows of hundreds of plant species, and providing a mechanism to help explain rapid rates of plant migration...|$|R
