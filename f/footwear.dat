5|$|Even <b>footwear</b> {{indicated}} a person's social status. Patricians wore red and orange sandals, senators had brown <b>footwear,</b> consuls had white shoes, and soldiers wore heavy boots. The Romans also invented socks for those soldiers required {{to fight on}} the northern frontiers, sometimes worn in sandals.|$|E
5|$|Elk hides {{have been}} used for {{thousands}} of years for tepee covering, blankets, clothing and <b>footwear.</b> Modern uses are more decorative, but elk skin shoes, gloves and belts are not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex {{style of}} {{sheepskin}} boot. In many other countries, however, UGG boots are a well-known brand of <b>footwear</b> owned by Deckers. The boots {{are made of}} twin-faced sheepskin with fleece {{on the inside and}} with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole. The boots originated in Australia and New Zealand, initially as utilitarian <b>footwear</b> worn for warmth and comfort. UGG boots emerged as a fashion trend in the United States in the late 1990s and as a world-wide trend in the late 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Cadets {{in uniform}} shall be well groomed with <b>footwear</b> cleaned and shone. Their uniform shall be clean and {{properly}} pressed at all times. In particular, buttons, fasteners and zippers shall be kept closed. Hair must be of natural colour.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Henry {{switched}} to Puma boots, first wearing the brand in the 2011 MLS All Star game against Manchester United, before announcing a multi-year partnership for Puma {{to be his}} performance and lifestyle <b>footwear</b> and apparel sponsor. His first official game with Puma was in the Emirates Cup against former club Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, the Conservation Authority of Borobudur {{reported}} some severe abrasion of {{the stone}} stairs caused by the scraping of visitors' <b>footwear.</b> The conservation authority planned to install wooden stairs to cover and protect the original stone stairs, just like those installed in Angkor Wat.|$|E
5|$|No {{body parts}} were {{recovered}} by the Soviet search {{team from the}} surface of the sea in their territorial waters, though they would later turn over clothes and shoes to a joint U.S.–Japanese delegation to Nevelsk on Sakhalin. On Monday, September 26, 1983, a delegation of seven Japanese and U.S. officials arriving aboard the Japanese patrol boat Tsugaru, had met a six-man Soviet delegation at the port of Nevelsk on Sakhalin Island. KGB Major General A. I. Romanenko, the Commander of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands frontier guard, headed the Soviet delegation. Romanenko handed over to the U.S. and the Japanese, among other things, single and paired <b>footwear.</b> With <b>footwear</b> that the Japanese also retrieved, the total came to 213 men's, women's and children's dress shoes, sandals, and sports shoes. The Soviets indicated these items were all that they had retrieved floating or on the shores of Sakhalin and Moneron islands.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} a strong association exists between an increased {{body mass index}} {{and the development of}} plantar fasciitis in the non-athletic population; this association between weight and plantar fasciitis has not been observed in the athletic population. Achilles tendon tightness and inappropriate <b>footwear</b> have also been identified as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Style Encore buys {{and sells}} used women's clothing. In January 2013, Winmark {{announced}} that it would start a new franchise, Style Encore, that would focus on used women's clothing. The first store opened in Texas in August 2013. Style Encore immediately pays cash to people looking to sell used women's attire, <b>footwear,</b> handbags, and jewelry.|$|E
5|$|The element, {{like other}} lanthanides, has no {{biological}} role. Promethium-147 can emit X-rays during its beta decay, which are dangerous for all lifeforms. Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, <b>footwear</b> covers, safety glasses, and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.|$|E
5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the <b>footwear</b> spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|After his career, McLaughlin {{allegedly}} {{worked in}} the counterfeit consumer goods industry in Mexico making knock-off athletic <b>footwear,</b> which included shoes designed to look like Converse, Vans, and Adidas. In 1990, {{he was arrested for}} trafficking the counterfeit shoes and money laundering. He pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, and proceeded to post bail. Before being sentenced, McLaughlin fled and his current whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|China's {{economic}} policies laid {{the basis of}} the industrialization drive in export-oriented development, and its reliance on low-wage manufacturing to produce consumer goods for the world market. Young migrant women left their homes in rural settings to work in urban industrial areas. Work included export-oriented industrialization, manufacturing in electronics and toy assembly, sewing in garment production, and mixed assembly and sewing in the <b>footwear</b> industry. Hong Kong and Shenzhen were cities established as centers of export-oriented industrialization, and migrant women workers have made up 70% of Shenzhen's three million people.|$|E
5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, <b>footwear,</b> cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|Federer has a {{contract}} with Nike <b>footwear</b> and apparel. For the 2006 championships at Wimbledon, Nike designed a jacket emblazoned with a crest of three tennis racquets, symbolising the three Wimbledon Championships he had previously won, and which was updated the next year with four racquets after he won the Championship in 2006. At Wimbledon 2008, and again in 2009, Nike continued this trend by making him a personalised cardigan that also had his own logo, an R and an F joined together.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Sindy {{manufacturers}} {{took advantage}} of new colour-changing technology and released Magic Moments Sindy, a doll whose hair and swimming costume changed colour when immersed in warm water. Sindy's senior designer Jane Braithwaite travelled to Paris each month to research fashion trends for Sindy's clothing {{in an attempt to}} reverse declining sales. As an example of Sindy's continually updated fashions, during this period the doll's <b>footwear</b> included kitten heels, sandals, knee-high boots, ankle boots, trainers, slippers, court shoes and slingbacks.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, {{a warrant}} was issued for McLaughlin's arrest after {{he failed to}} appear in court on {{previous}} charges. McLaughlin was arrested in for illegally trafficking counterfeit shoes and money laundering in 1990. According The New Yorker, McLaughlin, who had ties in Mexico from when he played baseball there, made deals with Korean businesspeople to make counterfeit <b>footwear.</b> The brands that he counterfeited included Converse, Vans, and Adidas, which he manufactured to sell in the Mexican market. Harley Lewin, a lawyer who pursued people in the counterfeit business, found that McLaughlin was making 80,000 pairs of sneakers for about $750,000 any given month. Lewin also discovered that half of all counterfeit <b>footwear</b> in Mexico could be traced back to McLaughlin's business. McLaughlin pleaded guilty to the money laundering charges, but fled the county before being sentenced. While it is believed he has been living near Cannes in France for years, he has moved from that spot and his whereabouts are now unknown as he is a fugitive from justice.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 35 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, High {{provides}} brief {{descriptions of}} 16 ásynjur. High lists Fulla fifth, stating that, like the goddess Gefjun, Fulla is a virgin, wears her hair flowing freely {{with a gold}} band around her head. High describes that Fulla carries Frigg's eski, looks after Frigg's <b>footwear,</b> and that in Fulla Frigg confides secrets.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled <b>footwear,</b> which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts {{to create the illusion}} of underwater swimming.|$|E
5|$|In the manga {{illustrated}} by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after {{the conclusion of}} the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the <b>footwear</b> college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him in the park. Also, at {{the conclusion of the}} story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her at their hotel wedding.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia ants are {{frequently}} encountered by humans, and avoiding them is difficult. Wearing closed <b>footwear</b> such as boots and shoes {{can reduce the}} risk of getting stung; these ants are capable of stinging through fabric, however. A risk of being stung while gardening also exists; most stings occur when someone is gardening and is unaware of the ants' presence. Eliminating nearby nests or moving to areas with low Myrmecia populations significantly decreases the chances of getting stung.|$|E
5|$|Shoe {{manufacturing}} {{improvements in}} the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century {{and led to a}} surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by <b>footwear</b> consumers.|$|E
5|$|The Sibu Night Market was {{established}} in 1973. It was situated in the town centre. Local traders will usually set up their mobile stalls from 5pm to 10pm every day. The stalls offer household goods, <b>footwear,</b> fashion items, and varieties of food. In August 2012, the market was relocated to Butterfly Garden at Cross Road near the Tua Pek Kong Temple to ease traffic jams.|$|E
5|$|The Society of Friends {{had become}} {{established}} {{there by the}} mid-17th century. One Quaker family, the Clarks, started a business in sheepskin rugs, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes. This became C Clark which still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. The Shoe Museum provides information {{about the history of}} Clarks and <b>footwear</b> manufacture in general.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{industries}} in the city's economy are: food processing (production of meat products, fruit and vegetable products, the production of spirits, the production of frozen food, grain processing), electrical engineering (production tools and equipment for machine tools, production of electric heaters, manufacture and production mixers household appliances). There is also a developed machine industry (electronics, machinery and metal), plastic processing (production of household appliances), textiles (textiles and upholstery, manufacture of underwear, clothing accessories, <b>footwear</b> and backpacks), Wood (production plywood and furniture) building materials.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{minimum age}} requirement, but {{passengers}} {{must meet the}} miniumum height requirement of 52inches and a maximum of 78inches to ride. Some persons over a certain weight/waist size will {{not be permitted to}} ride if the seat and lapbar harness cannot accommodate them. Passengers on Dragster may not bring any loose articles onto the train and will be required to wear shirts and <b>footwear.</b> Headphones must be removed before boarding.|$|E

5|$|Wellingborough has {{approximately}} 2,500 registered businesses {{within its}} boundaries. Much {{of the town}} centre was redeveloped during the 1970s, when it grew rapidly from London overspill. The Borough Council has adopted a 'Town Centre Action Plan'. The former traditional economic structure based on <b>footwear</b> and engineering is gradually diversifying with wholesale, logistics, and service sectors providing new opportunities for employment.|$|E
5|$|Wilsonville {{is home to}} {{many other}} {{business}} located in industrial parks straddling Interstate 5 that are filled with manufacturing and distribution facilities. Xerox and Mentor Graphics are the city's two largest employers as of 2006, the only two to employ more than 1000 people. Other large employers in the city are Tyco Electronics (Precision Interconnect), Sysco, Rockwell Collins, and Rite Aid. Additionally, Coca-Cola operates a bottling plant in the city. Nike had one of its U.S. distribution centers for <b>footwear</b> in Wilsonville until closing it in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé and {{her mother}} {{introduced}} House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005. The concept is inspired by three generations of women in their family, with the name paying tribute to Beyoncé's grandmother, Agnèz Deréon, a respected seamstress. According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and brand management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon. House of Deréon pieces were exhibited in Destiny's Child's shows and tours, during their Destiny Fulfilled era. The collection features sportswear, denim offerings with fur, outerwear and accessories that include handbags and <b>footwear,</b> and are available at department and specialty stores across the US and Canada.|$|E
5|$|C Clark {{still has}} its {{headquarters}} in Street, behind a frontage that includes the clock tower and water tower, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom. Despite strong concerns being voiced by local retailers at the time, the retail outlets have not led to a demise of the existing shops. The Shoe Museum provides information {{about the history of}} Clarks and <b>footwear</b> manufacture in general, and a selection of shop display showcards from the 1930s, the 1950s and the 1960s, and television advertisements.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack jumpers, but this is difficult to do. Closed <b>footwear</b> (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack jumpers by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
5|$|Manek Chowk {{is an open}} square {{near the}} centre of the city that {{functions}} as a vegetable market in the morning and a jewellery market in the afternoon. However, it is better known for its food stalls in the evening, which sell local street food. It is named after the Hindu saint Baba Maneknath. Parts of Ahmedabad are known for their folk art. The artisans of Rangeela pol make tie-dyed bandhinis, while the cobbler shops of Madhupura sell traditional mojdi (also known as mojri) <b>footwear.</b> Idols of Ganesha and other religious icons are made in huge numbers in the Gulbai Tekra area. The shops at the Law Garden sell mirror work handicraft.|$|E
5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, <b>footwear,</b> rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal <b>footwear</b> with sneakers for everyday use.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden <b>footwear.</b> Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
