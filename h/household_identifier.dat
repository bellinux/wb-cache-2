The main difficulty is to take account of other explanatory factors. We tested for an association between a patient’s death and the timing of any bereavement of a cohabitee. Method: Self-controlled case series study in which each case serves as his or her own control and which thereby accounts for all fixed measurable and unmeasurable confounders. We used the Health Improvement Network (THIN) primary care database to identify patients who died aged 50 – 99 years during the period 2003 to 2014.

30|$|Due to the {{rotating}} sampling scheme {{used for the}} CPS, surveyed households and individuals are in the sample for two separate periods of 4 consecutive months (with an intervening 8 -month period spent out of the sample). This enables month-to-month matching for about three-fourths of the sample (all but the “outgoing rotation groups” that are exiting the sample for eight months or permanently). The monthly match is based on <b>household</b> <b>identifiers</b> and validated by ensuring that the reported data on age, education, race, and gender do not conflict across matched observations.|$|R

The full dataset consists of 1, 091, 629 observations {{at the individual level}} but we convert these to the household level, using <b>household</b> <b>identifiers</b> unique to each individual. When we include only English, Indian and Pakistani households, this comprises a total of 251, 667 households in the dataset. Among them, 102, 430 households have at least one child.|$|R

It also facilitated targeted health interventions by a research team of youth from Mumbai, including intensive door-to-door education of residents, targeted follow-up meetings, and a full census. In addition, LBHCS permitted rapid and low-cost preparation of GIS mapping of all households in the slum, and spatial summation and spatial analysis of survey data.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Pledging campaigns, where individuals make a public commitment {{to act in a}} civic way, have been widely adopted by charities and policy-makers to help encourage charitable giving, but have been rarely tested as against a simple request. It is hard to infer from observational data whether pledging makes a difference. To overcome this problem, a randomised controlled trial on the effects of pledging was undertaken in Manchester, in partnership with the Community HEART charity. A total of 11, 812 households in two electoral wards were sent information about an upcoming charity campaign to develop school libraries in South Africa: they were told that in a few weeks they would be asked to donate a children's book. Households were randomly assigned to receive differently worded requests to test whether {{people are more likely to}} pledge and later donate if they are told their involvement will be made public. Further information on the project may be found on the ESRC's Rediscovering the Civic and Achieving Better Outcomes in Public Policy award page. This is an ESRC Ventures research programme, co-funded by the Department of Communities and Local Government and the North West Improvement and Efficiency Network. This particular project aimed to find out the most effective means to encourage active citizenship, using innovative experimental methods including randomised controlled trials and design experiments as well as survey re-analysis to understand the civic-outcome link. A previous study conducted under the same project is held at the UK Data Archive under SN 6874, How to Get Those Recycling Boxes Out: a Randomised Controlled Trial of a Door-to-Door Recycling Service, 2008. Main Topics : Variables in the data file include <b>household</b> <b>identifier,</b> pledge made and book donated, geographic units such as ward and Super Output Area, and population characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters that study issues related to workers and families, and the intersection of these two topics. The first chapter examines domestic outsourcing of labor services in Germany. This chapter uses a novel method to identify outsourcing in administrative data, and finds that outsourcing leads to a 10 - 15 % drop in wages that is persistent, lasting at least 10 years. There is evidence that these wage losses {{are associated with the}} loss of firm-specific rents, suggesting that labor costs savings are an important consideration in outsourcing. Finally, the increase in outsourcing activity is tied to broader changes in the German wage structure, particularly increases in wage dispersion and occupational sorting. The second chapter analyzes the relationship between state abortion restrictions and the living circumstances of children living in these states. It uses data on 15 years of abortion laws in the US connected to individual level data on children and their family structure from the Census and American Community Survey, and finds evidence that low-income children who are born in states with more restrictive abortion laws are more likely to live with a single mother than similar children born in more permissive states. To address the endogeneity of these laws, data on nullified laws is incorporated; nullified laws have no impact, indicating that it is likely the hurdles faced by women seeking abortions in stricter states that impacts family structure. The third chapter develops a new method to identify married couples in administrative worker data that do not include a <b>household</b> <b>identifier.</b> Couples are identified using information on their geo-coded location, name, gender and age; using German social security records, about 3. 3 million couples are identified. Consistency checks are provided using a subsample of the data for which marriage information is available, as well as a comparison to a known sample of married couples from the German Microcensus. These identified couples are then used to analyze patterns of relative income within households, where strikingly different patterns are found for couples who work in the same establishment and those who do not...|$|E

3000|$|The {{importance}} of household attributes for time allocation contrasts with age. Household attributes {{can account for}} 63 percent {{of the variation in}} the prevalence of paid employment, 70 percent of the variation in school enrollment, and 62 percent of the variation idle status. The individual country partial R 2 s are in Figure 3 B. The figure is constructed identically to Figure 3 A except the figure is a plot of the partial R 2 for the household fixed effects in explaining variation in paid employment. The contrast between Figure 3 A (partial R 2 for age) and Figure 3 B (partial R 2 for household fixed effects) is striking. The {{importance of}} child-invariant household attributes may be driven by low family income, parental characteristics and attitudes, or community level attributes such as the prevalence of certain types of employment or schools.

30|$|Because the PSID main files do {{not contain}} any direct {{question}} concerning {{the duration of the}} marriages, we rely on the “Marital History File: 1985 - 2007 ” Supplement of the PSID to obtain the year of marriage and number of marriages, to account {{for the duration of the}} couples’ current marriage. We merge this information to our married sample using the unique <b>household</b> and person <b>identifiers</b> provided by the PSID, and we consider married couples who have been married for at least 4 years, to capture the role of intrahousehold allocation of resources rather than unobserved heterogeneity due to sorting at the time of the match.|$|R
30|$|The GSOEP {{was first}} {{administered}} in 1984; we use data until (and including) 2010. In the GSOEP, all household members are interviewed individually once {{they reach the}} age of 16. In principle, all persons {{who took part in}} the first wave of the survey as well as their children whenever born are surveyed in the following years. ‘New’ persons thus become part of the GSOEP by being born into a surveyed household/reaching the minimum respondent’s age or by moving into a surveyed household (either from somewhere else in Germany or from abroad). Individuals who move out of a surveyed household or split off into new households are still followed (within Germany) but under a new <b>household</b> <b>identifier.</b> Individuals moving into existing GSOEP households are followed even if they subsequently leave that household. People exit the sample by death, moving abroad or refusal to interview. Individuals or households which could not be successfully interviewed in a given year are followed until there are two consecutive temporary dropouts of all household members or a final refusal. As noted above, compared to the German population, immigrants are oversampled: the ‘B Foreigner West sample’ started with 1393 households, and the sampling probability was about 0.0008. We have not reweighted the data, so our pooled regressions of natives and immigrants should not be seen as representing the German population. We restrict our analysis to first-generation immigrants as we do not wish to pool first- and second-generation immigrants together and the sample of second-generation immigrants who were asked about our variables of interest is unfortunately too small for separate analysis. However, we do not explicitly restrict the age range. Our sample is also not restricted to adults present at the start of the panel. Individuals can re-enter our sample under the same identifier if they drop out only temporarily. Children present in ‘native’ GSOEP households are allowed to enter our sample when they reach the minimum respondent’s age. Our results are robust to explicitly enforcing common support on age (as discussed in Section  5.5) and to excluding them to match the exclusion of second-generation immigrants. We include all adults in the household who answered our questions of interest—our results are robust to clustering standard errors at the household level. Our findings also hold up when controlling for the number of years an individual is present in the panel (the median number of years in our sample is 9 for natives and 11 for immigrants). We also rely on the ‘Microm indicators’, a unique dataset providing information on the ethnic composition of neighbourhoods at various levels of aggregation, which can be merged with the GSOEP. 7 These indicators are discussed in detail in Section  5.3.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Background The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a unique source of information using international definitions of employment and unemployment and economic inactivity, together {{with a wide range}} of related topics such as occupation, training, hours of work and personal characteristics of household members aged 16 years and over. It is used to inform social, economic and employment policy. The LFS was first conducted biennially from 1973 - 1983. Between 1984 and 1991 the survey was carried out annually and consisted of a quarterly survey conducted throughout the year and a 'boost' survey in the spring quarter (data were then collected seasonally). From 1992 quarterly data were made available, with a quarterly sample size approximately equivalent to that of the previous annual data. The survey then became known as the Quarterly Labour Force Survey (QLFS). From December 1994, data gathering for Northern Ireland moved to a full quarterly cycle to match the rest of the country, so the QLFS then covered the whole of the UK (though some additional annual Northern Ireland LFS datasets are also held at the UK Data Archive). Further information on the background to the QLFS may be found in the documentation. Household datasets Up to 2015, the LFS household datasets were produced twice a year (April-June and October-December) from the corresponding quarter's individual-level data. From January 2015 onwards, they are now produced each quarter alongside the main QLFS. The household datasets include all the usual variables found in the individual-level datasets, with the exception of those relating to income, and are intended to facilitate the analysis of the economic activity patterns of whole households. It is recommended that the existing individual-level LFS datasets continue to be used for any analysis at individual level, and that the LFS household datasets be used for analysis involving household or family-level data. From January 2011, a pseudonymised <b>household</b> <b>identifier</b> variable (HSERIALP) is also included in the main quarterly LFS dataset instead. Change to coding of missing values for household series From 1996 - 2013, all missing values in the household datasets were set to one '- 10 ' category instead of the separate '- 8 ' and '- 9 ' categories. For that period, the ONS introduced a new imputation process for the LFS household datasets and it was necessary to code the missing values into one new combined category ('- 10 '), to avoid over-complication. This was also in line with the Annual Population Survey household series of the time. The change was applied to the back series during 2010 to ensure continuity for analytical purposes. From 2013 onwards, the - 8 and - 9 categories have been reinstated. LFS Documentation The documentation available from the Archive to accompany LFS datasets largely consists of the latest version of each volume alongside the appropriate questionnaire for the year concerned. However, LFS volumes are updated periodically by ONS, so users are advised to check the ONS LFS User Guidance page before commencing analysis. Additional data derived from the QLFS The Archive also holds further QLFS series: End User Licence (EUL) quarterly datasets; Special Licence access and Secure Data Service access datasets; two-quarter and five-quarter longitudinal datasets; quarterly, annual and ad hoc module datasets compiled for Eurostat; and some additional annual Northern Ireland datasets. LFS move from seasonal to calendar quarters In accordance with European Union regulations, the LFS moved from seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, winter) quarters to calendar quarters (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) in 2006. Household datasets are therefore released for each April-June and October-December quarter. Seasonal datasets from 1996 (spring quarters) and 2004 (winter quarters) onwards that had been replaced by calendar quarters were withdrawn at the request of ONS. The ONS advise that, because of the method of construction and the weighting factors used in the datasets, comparison cannot be made between datasets of a calendar and seasonal nature. Time series and longitudinal analysis should only be conducted on datasets of the same type. Further information on the seasonal to calendar quarter change and its impact on LFS data may be found in the following article: Madouros, V. (2006) Impact of the switch from seasonal to calendar quarters in the Labour Force Survey, London: ONS. Household data weighting : Household datasets from 2010 onwards are weighted to 2014 population figures. Those from 2006 onwards are weighted either to 2007 or 2009 figures. Prior to these, data are weighted to Census 2001 figures or earlier; users should consult the individual datasets for details. For the fifth edition (November 2014) an updated version of the data file was deposited, weighted to 2014 population figures (based on Census 2011). The new weighting variable is PHHWT 14 (household weight). Main Topics : The LFS household datasets cover: characteristics of the household: number of people of working age; number of people over working age; number of children aged 0 to 4; number of children aged 5 to 15; number of dependent children (i. e. those in full-time education) aged 16 to 18 economic activity in the household: number of people in employment; number of people in full-time employment; number of people in part-time employment; unemployed; economically inactive; students; sick or disabled; economically inactive but would like to work and are not seeking work because they do not believe there is work available ('discouraged workers'); care of dependants </ul...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This project aimed to extend knowledge of late nineteenth century Scottish, and hence British, demography, by producing four parallel longitudinal data sets by linking individuals in the decennial censuses of 1861 - 1901 with the births, deaths and marriages from civil registers for the lowland town of Kilmarnock, the Hebridean Island of Skye, and the rural parishes of Torthorwald and Rothiemay, places with contrasting economic and social structures and physical environments. The resulting data source is rich in information relating to the social, occupational, household, and demographic characteristics of individuals, who can also be situated within their physical environment. The relatively large scale of the data-sets allows greater accuracy and detail in the multivariate analysis of mortality, fertility, nuptiality and migration. Special permission was granted by the General Register Office, Edinburgh, {{for access to the}} civil registers of births, marriages and deaths, and these have been linked to the census entries for the same individuals, allowing the creation of full or partial life histories. Linkage has been carried out using a sets of related individuals approach in a relational data-base system using computer algorithms and hand-finishing (see Reid, Davies and Garrett (2006) 'Nineteenth century Scottish demography from linked censuses and civil registers: a sets of related individuals approach', History and Computing, 14 (1 + 2), 2002 (publ. 2006), pp. 61 - 86). The terms of our agreement with the General Register Office for Scotland do not allow us to deposit the births, marriages and deaths for archiving, which prevents deposit of the linked material. However we can deposit the census material annotated to include the years of birth, death and marriage of an individual (but no other details of these events). Two separate census deposits are being made. This is a version of the raw data, with no standardisation or enhancement apart from corrections or changes to ensure consistency, notes made by data entry personnel, and <b>household</b> and individual <b>identifiers.</b> Main Topics : The data consist of transcriptions of the census enumerators' books for Skye, Kilmarnock, Rothiemay and Torthorwald, for the years 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891 and 1901. The following information on all individuals within all households on census night is provided: address (three fields); forename(s), surname(s); relationship to head of household; marital status; age; sex; occupation; other occupational information such as employment status, where available; county or birth, parish of birth; language; and number of rooms in the household. The data collection also contains details of where each individual appears in the census returns by giving the name of the registration district, the number of the enumeration district, the schedule number as indicated on the census enumerators' books, and household and person identification codes created by the project. Some variables are not available for all years or places: see project documentation for more details. <br...|$|R
