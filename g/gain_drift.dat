40|$|Abstract: Gain {{stability}} of the photomultiplier (PMT) cameras for The Fluorescence Detectors (FD) in the Telescope Array experiment has been monitored by using Am- 241 loaded scintillator pulsers (YAP) and diffused xenon flashers (TXF). Each FD camera consists of 16 × 16 PMT(Hamamatsu-R 9508) array, and contains two or three absolutely calibrated PMTs carrying a YAP. YAP, which is attached on an PMT cathode, is a small light source which emits UV photons at 50 Hz. A TXF which is a relative calibration installed on each camera shoots photons simultaneously on all the 256 PMTs uniformly from about 3 meter away. From the monitoring of YAP pulsers over 4 years of FD operation we found an annual average of slow monotonic PMT <b>gains</b> <b>drift</b> is 0. 01 ± 0. 31 (stat.) ± 0. 21 (syst.) % and it’s sigma is 1. 7 %.

Its detrimental impact on the performance of MIMO systems is already well-known and has been empirically studied in [34 – 36]. Some other effects, such as amplification <b>gain</b> <b>drift</b> (also known as transmitter droop) [37] and packet-to-packet power variations, have not been studied yet in the context of IA.
