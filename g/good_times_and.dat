25|$|Though Britpop is seen {{retrospectively}} as {{a marketing}} tool, {{and more of a}} cultural moment than a musical style or genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music of the Sixties, glam rock and punk rock of the Seventies, and indie pop of the Eighties in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur and Oasis drew from the Kinks and the Beatles, respectively, while Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past. Alternative rock acts from the indie scene of the Eighties and early Nineties were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of the Smiths is common to the majority of Britpop artists. The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis's Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on <b>good</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music.|$|E

He also said that [...] "LOST" [...] will have darker beats, and no comedy on it. The album is like {{looking at the world}} through negative lenses. He said that [...] "FOUND" [...] is like you have been found, and has songs about the <b>good</b> <b>times,</b> <b>and</b> songs with comedy.

500|$|With {{decreasing}} album {{sales and}} a lack of commercially successful singles, Cher decided to further develop her acting career. While she had previously aspired to venture into film, she had only the critically and commercially unsuccessful movies <b>Good</b> <b>Times</b> <b>and</b> Chastity to her credit, and the Hollywood establishment did not take her seriously as an actress. She moved to New York in 1982 to take acting lessons with Lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors Studio, but never enrolled after her plans changed. She auditioned for and was signed by director Robert Altman for the Broadway stage production Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean, playing a member of a James Dean fan club holding a 20-year reunion. That year, Altman cast her again in the film adaptation of the same title. Cher credits Altman for launching her acting career: [...] "Without Bob [...] I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me... I am convinced that Bob {{was the only one who}} was brave enough to do it." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 16, 1999, tragedy {{struck the}} Kennedy family again when [...] John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s [...] Piper Saratoga light {{aircraft}} {{crashed into the}} Atlantic Ocean {{off the coast of}} Martha's Vineyard. The accident killed Kennedy, his wife, and sister-in-law. As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service. He paraphrased William Butler Yeats by saying of his nephew: [...] "We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years." [...] Ted now served as a role model for Maria Shriver, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Joseph Patrick Kennedy II, and other family members. The Boston Globe wrote of the changed role: [...] "It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in <b>good</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> bad." ...|$|E
500|$|Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine {{thought that}} the game {{resolved}} {{some of the problems}} of open world design and thus allowed for an experience with <b>good</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> no filler, such as Burnout-style arrows on the streets instead of hidden in the minimap GPS. He added that this was the game Volition [...] "was born to make". Grimm from GamesRadar similarly praised Volition for their [...] "http://deckers.die" [...] mission, which was [...] "so insanely creative and funny that it single handedly makes the game worth playing". He added that the game's unrealistic driving made the game more fun. IGN's Hatfield was [...] "really won ... over" [...] by his character and both was convinced she cared about her friends and impressed by her voice actress. Whitehead of Eurogamer found Zimos, the pimp who speaks in Autotune, to be the game's best character. Edge found some of the writing [...] "sharp" [...] and executed well by the voice actors. PC Gamer Tom Senior found the major story missions to be a highlight. Hatfield of IGN thought the single-player game fell apart at the end and called the two endings either [...] "a super downer" [...] or nonsense. He found the cooperative mode easy to set up, but felt like the game's missions were not designed well for multiple players, and that the visiting player became a [...] "third wheel". On the other hand, CBS News's Christina Santiago called the cooperative mode [...] "near perfect" [...] and exemplary.|$|E
