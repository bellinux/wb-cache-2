50|$|One of {{the benefit}} {{packages}} revised through UCBP {{is the development of}} a health screening package under the universal health coverage in 2010. Currently, the three public insurance schemes in Thailand offer different health screening packages. The study was designed as a response to requests from stakeholders including decision-makers and representatives from the general public, to develop an evidenced-based health screening package for the population that could ensure equitable access to essential health screening under the three schemes. The results led to advice against elements of current clinical practice, such as annual chest X-rays and particular blood test (e.g. <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> <b>test),</b> and indicated that the introduction of certain new population-based health screening programs, such as for chronic hepatitis B, would provide substantial health and economic benefits to the Thais. The final results were presented to a wide group of stakeholders, including decision-makers at the Ministry of Public Health and the public health insurance schemes, to verify and validate the findings and policy recommendations. The package has been endorsed by the Thai UHC Benefit Package Committee for implementation in fiscal year 2016.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} how many <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> are done, on whom, how frequently they are performed and how they have changed over time. Design: Retrospective study of all serum creatinine, urine albumin and urine creatinine tests Setting: Primary and secondary care in Oxfordshire from 1993 to 2013 Participants: Unselected population of 1, 220, 447 people Main outcome measures: The total number of creatinine and urinary protein tests ordered from primary and secondary care {{and the number of}} tests per year stratified by categories of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The frequency of testing in patients having their <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> monitored. Results: Creatinine requests from primary care increased steadily from 1997 and exceeded 220, 000 requests in 2013. Tests corresponding to normal <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> (eGFR > 60 /mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2) constituted 59 % of all <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests</b> in 1993 and accounted for 83 % of all tests in 2013. Test corresponding to CKD stages 3 - 5 declined after 2007. Reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>function,</b> albuminuria, male gender, diabetes and age were independently associated with more frequent monitoring. For a female patient between 61 and 80 years and with stage 3 a CKD, the average number of serum creatinine tests (95 % C.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are highly responsible for cisplatin induced nephropathy, so we determined the effects of oral administration of ethanolic olive leaf extract (OLE) as a plant antioxidant on nephrotoxicity of this drug. Material and methods: 21 adult male wistar rats were divided to 3 groups: “OLE 75 +CP” group [14 days of oral administration of OLE (75 mg/kg) before i. p. injection of 5 mg/kg cisplatin], “Water+CP” group [14 days of oral administration of water before i. p. injection of cisplatin] and “Water+Saline” [As previous group with administration of saline instead of cisplatin]. Plasma samples were collected 72 h after cisplatin injection and Urine samples were collected for 24 h before blood sampling. Plasma creatinine (PCr) and urea, fractional excretion of Na and K, creatinine clearance and relative kidney weights were determined in various groups as <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> Results: Cisplatin led to significant deterioration {{of all of this}} <b>kidney</b> <b>function</b> <b>tests.</b> Oral aministration of OLE significantly reduced PCr and fractional excretion of K.

40|$|Background Nephrotoxicity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} side effects of the use of gentamicin sulphate (GS) resulted in reactive oxygen species generation. Antioxidant compounds played effective roles in reduction of renal injuries caused by using of gentamicin. Carvacrol is a strong antioxidant compound. Objectives The aim of this study is to explore the effect of carvacrol inhibition in lesions of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, 32 male mature Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups of 8; group 1 : control, group 2 sham received daily carvacrol injection (74 mg/kg) for 12 days, group 3 received daily GS injection (100 mg/kg) for 12 days, group 4 received daily GS (100 mg/kg) and carvacrol (74 mg/kg) for 12 days. After 12 days, rats were anaesthetized, blood sample were obtained and kidneys were removed then stained with hematoxylin and eosin method and then were studied histophatologically. Serum creatinine and urea were measured. Results Flow treatment of nephrotoxic animals with carvacrol could significantly inhibit leukocyte infiltration (9. 42 %) and tubular necrosis (38. 18 %) in comparison with the nephrotoxic untreated group. Carvacrol significantly decreased the levels of urea and creatinine in treated group compared with the nephrotoxic untreated group.
