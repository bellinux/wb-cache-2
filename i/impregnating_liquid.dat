These interactions control the droplet motion and positioning on an otherwise completely slippery surface. We present experimental results using a V-shape channel geometry as a model system. The interaction between deformations on the lubricant layer induced by the droplet and the underlying V-shape geometry leads to both local and global equilibrium positions for the droplet within the channel. We present a mathematical model to quantify the transition from local equilibrium states to the global equilibrium state and show that the latter can be described {{on the basis of}} a force balance along the apparent contact line of the droplet.

International audienceWe show how dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy {{can be used to}} characterize polymorphs and solvates of organic solids. We applied DNP to three polymorphs and one hydrated form of the asthma drug molecule theophylline. For some forms of theophylline, sample grinding and impregnation with the radical-containing solution, which are necessary to prepare the samples for DNP, were found to induce polymorphic transitions or desolvation between some forms. We present protocols for sample preparation for solid-state magic-angle spinning (MAS) DNP experiments that avoid the polymorphic phase transitions in theophylline. These protocols include cryogrinding, grinding under inert atmosphere, and the appropriate choice of the <b>impregnating</b> <b>liquid.</b> By applying these procedures, we subsequently demonstrate that two-dimensional correlation experiments, such as H- 1 -C- 13 and H- 1 -N- 15 HETCOR or C- 13 -C- 13 INADEQUATE, can be obtained at natural isotopic abundance in reasonable times, thus enabling more advanced structural characterization of polymorphs...|$|E

Njegov je angažman predložio glavni konzervator II. odjeljenja carskoga kraljevskoga Središnjega povjerenstva za umjetničke i historijske spomenike Max Dvořák koji je sastavio i smjernice za obnovu vratnica vođene načelom očuvanja starosne vrijednosti. Rad donosi pojedinosti tehnološkoga procesa. Nakon uspješnog okončanja posla, Švimberský je imenovan dopisnikom Središnjega povjerenstva. Obnova jednog od najvažnijih artefakata srednjovjekovne dalmatinske skulpture i europski poznatoga spomenika, prema novom konceptu zaštite kulturne baštine postala je, zajedno s očuvanjem zgrade stare biskupije, prijelomnom za prevagu novih načela u splitskoj sredini koju je uvelike obilježilo stilsko restauriranje. Na projektu su sudjelovale i osobe koje će postati jezgrom reorganizacije Središnjega povjerenstva 1911. godine: Max Dvořák, Julius Deininger i Karl Holey. The monumental Romanesque {{door on the}} Split cathedral, work of Master Andrija Buvina (1214), was renovated in 1908. The protagonists of {{the renovation}} were the chief conservator of the Second Department of the Central Commission, art historian–Max Dvořák and the technician, teacher at the Wood Processing School in Chrudim, Bohemia–Anton Švimberský. In 1907, the conservator of the Central Commission for Artistic and Historical Monuments, don Frane Bulić, initiated the renovation {{with a view to}} harmonizing it with the completion of works on the cathedral belfry. Upon the suggestion of Kaspar von Zumbusch, Švimberský was engaged to do the job by Max Dvořák. He developed renovation guidelines that respected the principle of preservation of age-value. He requested that the door leaves not be supplemented, that the damage be repaired and wormholes prevented from spreading, and that the most severely damaged panels be physically protected. Švimberský found that the door was covered with dirt, the wood was dry and damaged (see fg. 2), and five to ten percent of the wooden material was infested with wormholes. He also established that the front side of the door was made of carob wood. The figural reliefs and ornaments were dismantled, cleaned, impregnated and petrified with hot turpentine. The <b>impregnating</b> <b>liquid,</b> which had to be boiled for 15 minutes in an enamel pot, and then cooled, filtered and kept in a closed receptacle, consisted of 1. 5 l of vinegar, 12. 5 g of garlic, 25 g of onion, 11. 5 g of salt, 80 g of absinthe leaves and 2. 25 g of crushed pepper. Depending on the scope and degree of infestation, the damaged pieces of wood had to be placed in their own specially made wooden receptacles containing <b>impregnating</b> <b>liquid</b> for 10 – 20 minutes. The liquid was to be heated to a temperature between 30 and 50 ºR. The new elements for the front side were made in walnut wood, while the sections of the core and the rear side were made in oak wood. To allow for it to be reused, the core had to be reinforced with steel screws with heads that served as plugs, and they were kept in place by a metal frame extending along three sides of the door leaf. Švimberský, who had originally planned just to make the conservation interventions, impregnate the door and display it in Opera del duomo, found himself torn between the local community, which requested that the bottom parts be replaced with new ones that would feature motifs analogous to those on the door leaves, and the Dvořák guidelines that prevented any such supplementations. Having learned about the engraving of the bottom-most lines, Dvořák suspended the works on September 1 st 1908, and on October 6 th he personally visited the site. He proposed that holes be made in new planks and the old ornamented planks inserted into them, that hollow ornaments be lined with impregnated canvas and worm- holes filled. The newly engraved planks were, however, covered with smooth planks. Later, they were removed and nowadays the interventions of Švimberský are visible Continuation and again. The numbers in the chapter on Completion of Works indicate that the interventions on the door were indeed numerous. The door was coated with hot linseed oil, filled and coated with wax. The indications of renovation were sited {{on the back of the}} door, and after the works were completed, a gypsum cast was also made. Following a request by Bulić, Dvořák compiled a list of museums and institutions in the country and abroad to which the cast could be offered for sale. In line with the Riegl concept of the protection of cultural heritage, the key fgures in this renovation were the technician Švimberský, who endeavoured to preserve the item, and the art historian Dvořák, who protected the historical value and judged what the impact of the proposed measure would be on the overall appearance. The renovation of one of the most important artefacts of mediaeval Dalmatian sculpture, and a well-known monument on a European scale, had a decisive effect – together with the preservation of the old diocese building – on the sway of new principles in Split, which was significantly marked by the stylistic restoration, and also in the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, since some of the leaders of the new concept participated in the project: Max Dvořák, Julius Deininger and Karl Holey, personages who led the Central Commission towards its reorganization in 1911...|$|E

It is also discussed the q-dc process in pressboard insulation due to the charge transport between water and oil cavity based charge clusters through a percolation network of water molecules and hydroxyl groups along the cellulose fiber wall.

Fabrication will take place at the Idaho Microfabrication Laboratory (IML) located at BSU and under the leadership of Pete Miranda. We will manufacture the photovoltaic cells using four inch diameter P-type silicon wafers. The electroconductivity for these wafers is quite high, at 0. 5 ohm-cm which will allow the later formation of a PN junction. When the wafers arrive from the supplier they will likely suffer from a slight surface oxidation that might inhibit electrical flow so our first step is to strip off this native oxide and clean the wafer surface. Following that we will coat the wafer with a phosphorous <b>impregnated</b> <b>liquid.</b> The application of this liquid followed by a hot diffusion process will dope the wafer with a negative charge. A PN junction will then be formed within the substrate of the wafer where the positively doped silicon meets the new negatively doped silicon. This junction is sensitive to light.

It was observed a notorious transport and enrichment of molybdenum ions from feed solution towards receiving strip liquor. The transport of molybdenum through the membrane was greatly influenced by the amine concentration in the organic film and by the addition of a certain amount of NH 4 NO 3 into the stripping agent. Alamine presented a high affinity for Mo(VI) practically being not observed coextraction of all contaminant ions. The transport of metal through the membrane corresponds to a mechanism of mass transfer with chemical reaction, controlled by the extraction reaction of ionic species of molybdenum with the amine salt of Alamine "carrier" via anion exchange.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades it has been {{observed}} that copper (Cu) ‘supported on’ or ‘incorporated into’ solid matrices are widely used as catalysts for various types of reactions. It was reported that the high activity of supported Cu catalyst is generated by properties of the clusters and nanoparticles including high dispersion and uniform distribution of nanoparticle Cu on the support material. All these factors exert a direct effect on the formation of active surface of Cu and their catalytic properties accordingly. In this study, Cu based catalysts supported on silica, SiO 2 were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of SiO 2 with aqueous metal citrate salt solution. A chelated precursor was chosen because previous work has shown that catalyst prepared in the presence of some specific chelated metal-complexes resulted in catalysts with high dispersion of small metal (oxide) particles with a narrow particle size distribution. The Cu based catalysts consisting of a second metal (Zn and Ni) were also prepared and examined for their influence on surface and structural properties of the final catalysts. Characterization of the catalysts was carried out by Xray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX), Ultraviolet Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Thermal Gravimetric Analysis-Mass Spectrometer (TGA-MS), Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) and Temperature Programme Reduction (TPR). The catalysts were later screened for their performance in process of hydrogenation of fatty alcohol to fatty amines using high throughput reactor. The results from the characterization indicate that second metal influences the final. catalysts produced with different characteristics. The morphology and BET surface area of SiO 2 as a support was not preserved in Cu-Zn and Cu-Ni catalysts. This is due to agglomeration that changes the basic structural units (BSU) through precipitation of active metal oxide particles, and/or through modification of the support oxide surface occurring from their contact with the <b>impregnated</b> <b>liquid</b> and also the thermal treatment during drying and calcination. The XRD analysis shows the formation of amorphous nano-structured Cu supported on SiO 2 in the calcined catalysts. The Nitrogen physisorption measurement (BET) analysis shows that higher surface area (191. 84 m 2 /g) was obtained in Cu-Ni catalyst and this gives the best Cu metal dispersion on support. This study shows that the choice of appropriate synthesis parameters and thermal treatment for Cu-Zn/SiO 2 and Cu-Ni/SiO 2 are extremely important to obtain superior surface area of nanocrystallites active Cu metals for the target reaction. Similarly, from this study, undesirable conditions of catalysts preparation and activation parameter that gave rise to catalysts with poor structure and thermal characteristics are identified. The two catalysts, Cu-Zn and Cu-Ni, were studied for their catalytic behaviour in hydrogenation of fatty alcohol. Upon in situ activation, the catalysts were then screened in a high-throughput Oleobed reactor, conducted at a 30 bar pressure and over a temperature range of 443 - 523 K.

Maximum extracellular and intracellular tannase activities (11. 35 and 6. 95 U/mL respectively) were recorded with 100 g/L of tannic acid. The substrate uptake was 100 % at concentrations of 12. 5, 25 and 50 g/L, while 74. 4 % was consumed {{in the presence of}} 100 g/L of tannic acid after 48 h of culture. These results suggest that high concentrations of tannins can be removed by SSF and tannase production can be reached in high levels. The present work was performed as part of a cooperative agreement between the Universidad Autonoma de Coahuila (UAdeC, Mexico) and the Universidade do Minho (UM, Portugal) within a specific international exchange program (VALNATURA project, alfa network from European Union) undertaken at the Biological Engineering Department (UM, Portugal) M A Cruz-Hernandez thanks to Concejo nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACYT) the fellowship to study the doctoral program at the Department of Biotechnology (UAdeC...|$|R
40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} investigations were executed for determination of macroscopic regularities {{of heat and}} mass transfer processes under {{the conditions of the}} phase transformations and chemical reaction at the ignition of vapors coming from fabrics <b>impregnated</b> by combustible <b>liquid</b> into oxidant area at the local power supply. It was established that initial temperature Θp> 1 of local energy source and volume fraction φ> 30 % of combustible liquid vapors in fabric are necessary for realization of ignition conditions in a system “fabric—combustible liquid—oxidant. ”. Thus three ignition modes are possible for such system. The most widespread mode is an arrangement of ignition zone near the lateral side of local energy source. Also we obtained approximating expressions of ignition delay time on initial temperature and characteristic size of a local energy source for fabrics impregnated by some kinds of combustible liquids (gasoline, kerosene, and diesel fuel). Its dependences may be useful at engineering calculations of fire danger for processes of single hot particles interaction with liquid combustible substances...|$|R
40|$|Demand for {{alternative}} insulating liquids for power transformers are increasing {{due to the}} safety and environment concerns. Ester based insulating liquid is considered as a potential alternative for mineral oil since it is highly biodegradable and has high fire point. On the other hand, Polarization and Depolarization Current (PDC) measurement technique has been widely used to evaluate moisture and ageing condition of transformer 2 ̆ 7 s insulation system. However, there is limited experience of using PDC measurement for ester liquid filled power transformers. This paper investigates dielectric response of four types of insulating <b>liquids</b> <b>impregnated</b> pressboard specimens under varying moisture and temperature conditions. The PDC measurement results of esters and mineral oil impregnated pressboards at approximately same moisture levels are compared in the paper. Moreover, this paper adopts an equivalent circuit for interpreting the PDC response of the pressboard specimens. The variations of {{the parameters of the}} equivalent circuit under different moisture levels are also discussed in the paper...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{composite}} polymer matrix for gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) is {{prepared by the}} electrospinning process, combining poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) and nano-sized Al 2 O 3 ceramic particles. The composite matrix is <b>impregnated</b> with a <b>liquid</b> electrolyte to prepare the GPE-Al 2 O 3 composite and its properties are {{compared with those of}} pure GPE. The GPE-Al 2 O 3 composite improves the interfacial resistance, ion coordination and the electrochemical stability of the GPE. The electrochemical performances are analyzed by applying the GPEs to LiNi 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 O 2 (NMC) and Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) cells. The GPE-Al 2 O 3 composite exhibits a higher discharge capacity than the GPE at 0. 1 C-rate and excellent performance in both the LTO and the NMC half-cells under cyclic conditions. The GPE-Al 2 O 3 composite shows good compatibility and high electrochemical property on LTO/NMC full-cell. clos...|$|R
