500|$|In {{contrast}} to the group's previous albums, each member arranged, composed, and produced songs on their own before putting the finished recordings together for House of Music.

[...] He worked with his own recording crew for House of Music, featuring guitarist Chalmers [...] "Spanky" [...] Alford, drummer Tommy Branford, and keyboardists Kelvin Wooten and Cedric Draper.

Axelrod, who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz {{played a crucial role}} in the music: [...] "For years, all <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> jazz.

500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research.

Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time.

500|$|As with Oasis' {{previous}} two albums, {{the songs on}} Be Here Now are generally anthemic. The structures are traditional, and largely follow the typical verse – chorus – verse – chorus – middle eight – chorus format of guitar-based rock music. Reviewing for Nude as the News, Jonathan Cohen noted that the album is [...] "virtually interchangeable with 1994's Definitely Maybe or its blockbuster sequel, (What's the Story) Morning Glory?", while Noel had previously remarked {{that he would make}} three albums in this generic style. Yet the songs on Be Here Now differ in that they are longer than previous releases; an extended coda brings [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] to almost eight minutes, while [...] "All Around the World" [...] contains three key changes and lasts for a full nine minutes. The tracks are more layered and intricate than before, and each contains multiple guitar overdubs. While Morris had previously stripped away layers of overdubs on the band's debut Definitely Maybe, during the production of Be Here Now he [...] "seemed to gleefully encourage" [...] such excess; [...] "My Big Mouth" [...] has an estimated thirty tracks of guitar overdubbed onto the song. A Rolling Stone review described the guitar lines as composed of [...] "elementary riffs." [...] There was some experimentation: [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] contains a slowed down loop from N.W.A's [...] "Straight Outta Compton", while [...] "Magic Pie" [...] features psychedelically arranged vocal harmonies and a mellotron. According to Noel, [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> run my elbows across the keys and this mad jazz came out and everyone laughed." [...] The album's production is dominated by top-end high frequency tones, and according to Uncuts Paul Lester, its use of treble is reminiscent of both late 1980s Creation Records bands such as My Bloody Valentine, and The Stooges' famously under-produced Raw Power.|$|E
500|$|Carpenter and {{his crew}} persuaded the city to shut off the {{electricity}} to ten blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. [...] "We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending {{on whether or not}} we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for {{about two and a half}} months I never saw daylight, which was really strange." [...] The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, [...] "That day was a nightmare. All <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> swing a [...] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape." [...] In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system. In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. [...] "We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble".|$|E

500|$|Kneale {{began writing}} the scripts, working to a {{delivery}} deadline of February 1973. Much {{of the setting}} for the story was influenced by contemporary political events such as strikes, power cuts, the Oil Crisis and developments in the Space Race, especially the planned Apollo-Soyuz missions and Skylab. Writing in the listings magazine TV Times to promote the serial, Kneale said, [...] "Quatermass {{is a story of}} the future – but perhaps only a few years from now. There are some clues already in the most obvious places: the streets. Pavements littered with rubbish. Walls painted with angry graffiti. Belfast black with smoke and rage. Worst of all, the mindless violence". Concerns about the state of society, especially the [...] "dropout" [...] culture of the youth movement, had been a theme of Kneale's writing for some time. This was seen in such works as The Big, Big Giggle, an unmade play about a teenage suicide cult; The Year of the Sex Olympics, about the consequences of a world with no censorship or inhibitions; and Bam! Pow! Zap! (1969), about teenage delinquents, all of which fed into the world depicted in the new Quatermass serial. Kneale said, [...] "I looked at the alarming aspects of contemporary trends. Since then, we'd seen 'flower power' and hippies, so all <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>was</b> bring them into the story. It was written in 1972 and it was about the sixties really". Another theme that had crept into Kneale's writing at this time—as seen in Wine of India, about compulsory euthanasia for the elderly, and later the Beasts episode [...] "During Barty's Party", about an elderly couple terrorised by rats—was the consequences of growing old. Kneale later recalled, [...] "The theme I was trying to get to was the old redressing the balance with the young, saving the young, which I thought a nice, paradoxical, ironic idea after the youth-oriented 60s".|$|E
