5|$|Architectural {{management}} can {{be defined}} as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice. The term architectural management has been in use since the 1960s. The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared {{to be concerned about the}} conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or practice management and project management. Office management provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the design process, construction, and project management, through to <b>facilities</b> <b>management</b> of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.|$|E

40|$|Security {{is applied}} in the built {{environment}} and this requires {{a close relationship with}} facility managers. Therefore, this study puts forward an approach to establish the <b>facility</b> <b>management</b> knowledge categories within the built environment. In part, the significance of the study stemmed from research undertaken into the compliance to Australian fire door maintenance within nursing homes, which demonstrated 87 percent noncompliance. This high level of non-compliance appeared to identify a lack of <b>facility</b> <b>management</b> knowledge, among other issues (Doleman & Brooks, 2011). The article uses a method to test the supposition of <b>facility</b> <b>management</b> knowledge construct in a three-phase Grounded Theory analysis. Phase-one examines international tertiary <b>Facility</b> <b>Management</b> courses, where course content is critiqued through linguistic analysis to extract the knowledge categories. Phase-two of the study further analyses these findings through the use of multidimensional scaling to present underlying conceptual knowledge interrelationships. The final third-phase uses experts in order to validate the findings of the previous two phases. A pilot study identified 18 common knowledge concepts, for example project management, space planning, budgeting and principles of <b>facility</b> <b>management.</b> The study outcomes will improve the understanding of building knowledge requirements within the built environment, resulting in a framework of <b>facility</b> <b>management</b> knowledge categories. Such an outcome will support the consensual development of a <b>facility</b> <b>management</b> body of knowledge. The specific outcomes put forward for this research includes establishing the primary knowledge categories found within the <b>Facility</b> <b>Management</b> Industry.

Their proposal intended for most of the rides to stay, but called for the Big Dipper to be replaced with a multipurpose concert venue, and asked to redevelop Crystal Palace as a function centre. Further consultation with North Sydney Council brought the development to a standstill, with the Council and the directors of Metro Edgley clashing over several aspects of the proposed redevelopment. A revised proposal was submitted in early 2000, but this was not approved by the Council until 2002. On top of this, specific applications had to be lodged for each element of the plan, each of which in turn would require community consultation. The development eventually began in 2003.|$|E
