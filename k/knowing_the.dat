50|$|Educologists {{distinguish}} {{at least}} four kinds of educological <b>knowing.</b> Each of <b>the</b> kinds may be manifested in at least five forms and at three levels.

The three levels are preconventional, conventional and postconventional. The four kinds of knowing are distinguishable {{with respect to the}} object or states of affairs in relation to which <b>the</b> <b>knowing</b> is performed. <b>The</b> five forms of knowing are distinguishable with respect to the manner in which <b>the</b> <b>knowing</b> is manifested. <b>The</b> three levels of knowing are distinguishable with respect to the degree of expertise with which <b>the</b> <b>knowing</b> is performed.|$|R

Later the full membership list was obtained and the PMO in Lithuania was dissolved. The coup further strained Polish–Lithuanian relations.|$|E

However, Williams remembered in 2004 how, in her experience, Girlschool were more inspirational for young male musicians than for female ones in starting rock bands. Moreover, important female metal bands of the 2000s, such as Crucified Barbara and Drain STH, denied even of <b>knowing</b> <b>the</b> music of Girlschool.

40|$|Defenders of the Knowledge Argument {{contend that}} {{physical}}ism is false because <b>knowing</b> all <b>the</b> physical truths {{is not sufficient}} to know all the truths about the world.

This dissertation is a defense of the Knowledge Argument.
