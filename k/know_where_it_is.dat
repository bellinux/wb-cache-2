5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It is a more {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
25|$|For a robot to {{associate}} behaviors with a place (localization) requires it to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{and to be}} able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based triangulation. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created CAD floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' PatrolBot and autonomous wheelchair, both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} also {{received}} positive reviews, particularly the episodes following the winter finale when Quantico {{switched to a}} single timeline and began focusing on character development. Kelsey McKinney of New York magazine noted that the show had finally found its groove, writing [...] "For {{the first time since}} its first season, Quantico actually seems to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> headed. Itâ€™s quite a welcome development, and the newfound confidence ... makes Quantico a much more enjoyable show to watch." [...] In a five-star review of the sixteenth episode, Kelsey McKinney of New York wrote that [...] "the show is grappling more and more with the emotions that make us all human, not just the ones that drive the story forward." [...] The series' plot lines, involving current political situations, were also praised.|$|E
500|$|After {{discovering}} Corky and Violet {{stole the}} money, Caesar ties them up, gags them, threatens to torture them, and demands to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> When Mickey arrives {{to see what}} is going on, Caesar, panicked, makes a deal with Violet to help him stall. As he prepares to kill Mickey, Violet calls the landline from Johnnie's cell phone and quickly convinces Caesar to pretend that he's on the phone with Gino, who's calling from a hospital to explain that he and Johnnie were in a car accident. Mickey is convinced and leaves for the hospital. Corky tells Caesar where she has hidden the money, and he goes next-door to find it. Violet escapes and makes a phone call to Mickey, telling him that Caesar stole the money and forced her to keep quiet. In the meantime, Corky tries to stop Caesar from taking the money, but he beats her to the ground. Just as he is about to kill her, Violet arrives and pulls a gun on Caesar, telling him that Mickey is on his way and that he should run while he can. Caesar tells Violet that he knows she will not shoot him, to which she replies, [...] "Caesar, you don't know shit", before killing him.|$|E

2500|$|Jack and Lureen {{meet and}} befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone. It is implied that Jack begins {{an affair with}} Randall, {{although}} he later tells Ennis he {{had a relationship with}} a woman, who is assumed to be Lashawn. At the end of a regular fishing trip with Jack, Ennis tries to delay their next meeting. Jack's frustration erupts into argument, and Ennis blames Jack for being the cause of his own conflicted actions. Ennis begins to cry. Jack tries to hold him and there is a brief struggle, but they end up locked in an embrace. Jack watches as Ennis drives away. Some time later, Ennis receives a postcard he had sent to Jack, stamped [...] "Deceased". He calls Lureen, who says that Jack died in an accident, when a tire he was changing exploded. As she is speaking, Ennis imagines that Jack was actually beaten to death by a gang of thugs, the same exact fate that Ennis feared. Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

50|$|Of course, the Soviets could {{target the}} {{interceptor}} if they <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> To avoid this, LoADS was packed into a container the size, shape and weight as the MX missile. (LoADS, for Low Altitude Air Defense System, {{was the name}} the Sentry system was known by {{for most of its}} existence.) This too would be moved about the cell, so the Soviets could not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> There were lingering concerns whether or not the system could actually be built and packaged into an MX-like container. To do so the interceptor itself would have to be quite small, but more importantly, the radar and fire control systems would also have to fit.|$|R
