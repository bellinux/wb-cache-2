It can be well modeled by a superposition of the Global Anisotropy and the Midscale Anisotropy. The Global Anisotropy would be generated by galactic cosmic rays interacting with the magnetic field in the local interstellar space of scale ~ 2 pc surrounding the heliosphere. On the other hand, the Midscale Anisotropy, possibly caused by the modulation of galactic cosmic rays in the heliotail, is expressed as two intensity enhancements placed along the Hydrogen <b>Deflection</b> <b>Plane,</b> each symmetrically centered away from the heliotail direction.

30|$|In Kirchhoff’s {{theory and}} shear {{deformation}} theories including the widely used FSDT, vertical deflection w 0 (average displacement in Reissner’s sixth-order theory) is {{same in the}} face parallel planes. However, it is known physically that neutral <b>plane</b> <b>deflection</b> has {{to be higher than}} face deflection. This {{is due to the fact}} that an elastic medium is on either side of the neutral plane, whereas it is on one side of each of the top and bottom faces. Proper estimation of neutral <b>plane</b> <b>deflection</b> is dependent on normal strain εz ignored in Kirchhoff’s theory and shear deformation theories. In an earlier investigation (Vijayakumar 2011 a), it is shown that the expansion of displacements in polynomials of thickness coordinate z is not adequate to properly estimate face and neutral <b>plane</b> <b>deflections.</b> This fact is overlooked in the analysis of even isotropic homogeneous plates through the widely used FSDT and other shear deformation theories. A solution to a supplementary problem is required to obtain neutral <b>plane</b> <b>deflection.</b> It is, however, observed that the error in the estimation of face deflection is much higher than that of neutral <b>plane</b> <b>deflection.</b> However, it is desirable to provide uniform approximation to deformations through thickness of the plate. It appears to the author’s knowledge that no suitable 2 -D modeling which gives more or less the same percentage of approximation to thickness-wise distribution of a displacement variable is reported until now. Proper higher-order theories are to reduce only maximum error in the estimation of a physical variable to a desirable level.|$|R

Flexible steerable needles may allow the surgeon to reach targets deep inside solid organs while avoiding sensitive structures (e. g. blood vessels). This article provides a systematic classification of possible mechanical solutions for three-dimensional steering through solid organs. A scientific and patent literature search of steerable instrument designs was conducted using Scopus and Web of Science Derwent Innovations Index patent database, respectively. First, we distinguished between mechanisms in which deflection is induced by the pre-defined shape of the instrument versus mechanisms in which an actuator changes the deflection angle of the instrument on demand. Second, we distinguished between mechanisms deflecting in one versus two planes. The combination of deflection method and number of <b>deflection</b> <b>planes</b> led to eight logically derived mechanical solutions for three-dimensional steering, of which one was dismissed because it was considered meaningless.

In order that the DLR system received the optimum dynamic capacity curve, combined the WM and TS model.

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{diagnostic}} between two different {{states of the}} local interstellar medium (LISM) near our solar system using a sensitivity study constrained by several distinct and complementary observations of the LISM, solar wind, and inner heliosphere. Assuming the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) He flow parameters for the LISM, we obtain a strength of ∼ 2. 7 ± 0. 2 μG and a direction pointing away from galactic coordinates (28, 52) ± 3 ^∘ for the interstellar magnetic field as resulting from fitting Voyager 1 & 2 in situ plasma measurements and IBEX energetic neutral atoms ribbon. When using Ulysses parameters for the LISM He flow, we recently reported the same direction but a strength of 2. 2 ± 0. 1 μG. First, we notice that with Ulysses He flow, our solution is in the expected hydrogen <b>deflection</b> <b>plane</b> (HDP). In contrast, for the IBEX He flow, the solution is ∼ 20 ^∘ away from the corresponding HDP plane. Second, the long-term monitoring of the interplanetary H I flow speed shows a value of ∼ 26 km/s measured at upwind from the Doppler-shift in the strong Lyman-α sky background emission line. All elements of diagnostics seem therefore to support Ulysses He flow parameters for the interstellar state. In that frame, we argue that reliable discrimination between superfast, subfast, or superslow states of the interstellar flow {{should be based on}} most existing in situ and remote observations used together with global modelling of the heliosphere.

40|$|Garnet porphyroblasts from {{southern}} Vermont and northwestern Massachusetts typically preserve multiple generations of inclusion trails, reflecting a potentially complex deformation and metamorphic growth history. Textural discontinuities, such as inclusion trail truncations or <b>deflection</b> <b>planes,</b> are commonly preserved within these complex inclusion trails {{and they are}} dominantly sub-vertically and sub-horizontally oriented. This observation cannot be adequately explained using the rotational model of spiral inclusion trail formation, leading {{to the conclusion that}} the trails were formed by the inclusion of multiple sub-vertical and sub-horizontal foliations during episodic garnet growth without porphyroblast rotation. Foliation inflection/intersection axes preserved within porphyroblasts (FIAs) provide important information about the kinematics of deformation, particularly the direction of bulk shortening at the time they formed. Samples from this study preserve a succession of six FIA sets resulting from a progressive change in the direction of bulk shortening through time. The distribution of these FIA sets across the field area indicates that the deformation was heterogeneously partitioned and occurred at different scales throughout orogenesis. Localization of deformation is an important control on garnet growth and repartitioning during successive deformation events resulted in a heterogeneous spatial distribution of garnet growth through time. The episodic nature of garnet growth is reflected in compositional zoning anomalies in garnet porphyroblasts from the Hoosac Formation. Zones of manganese enrichment, accompanied by calcium depletion, reveal pauses in garnet growth that may have been accompanied by fluid infiltration, garnet dissolution-reprecipitation and metasomatism at crystal or greater scales. The metamorphic history of these samples was further investigated using P-T pseudosections constructed via THERMOCALC. The mineral assemblages predicted are in good agreement with the observed mineralogy of the samples and estimates of P-T conditions at the time of garnet core growth were made using compositional isopleths based on microprobe analyses of garnet core composition. The samples do not show a clear relationship between the P-T data and the FIA data, suggesting that the preservation of different FIAs is not simply a function of P-T conditions. In samples where initial garnet appears to have occurred at temperature and/or pressure conditions higher than the minimum P-T conditions predicted for garnet stability, deformation probably played an essential role in garnet nucleation and growth. These “overstepped” samples indicate a progressive increase in pressure through the different phases of orogenesis. This study reveals that garnet porphyroblasts in southern Vermont and northwestern Massachusetts grew during a complex history of deformation involving the production of multiple sub-horizontal and sub-vertical foliations with garnet growth primarily controlled by deformation partitioning, resulting in a heterogeneous spatial distribution through time. FIAs allow the relative age of different phases of garnet growth to be established and provide a framework for interpreting the relationship between deformation and metamorphism. Compositional zoning anomalies reflect the episodic nature of garnet growth and P-T modelling suggests that deformation took place under conditions of increasing pressure...|$|R
