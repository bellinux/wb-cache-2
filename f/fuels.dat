5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil <b>fuels</b> {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. However, they offer the prospect of increased market competition and oil price moderation. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes and reduce dependency on fossil <b>fuels,</b> especially in the transport sector. Using transportation <b>fuels</b> more efficiently is also an integral part of a sustainable transport strategy.|$|E
5|$|Land {{management}} employees remove {{dead and}} hazardous <b>fuels</b> from areas as prioritized by the Hazard <b>Fuels</b> Reduction Plan. This {{is to ensure}} fires have less opportunity to threaten lives, historical structures, and visitor facilities. As of 2007, fuel is reduced within 400feet (120m) of structures and other high-priority locations.|$|E
5|$|Low carbon fuel {{standards}} {{is administered by}} the California Air Resources Board and attempts to make wider choice of cleaner <b>fuels</b> to Californians. Producers of petroleum-based <b>fuels</b> are required to reduce the carbon intensity of their products to 10 percent in 2020.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuel</b> is transported {{from the}} <b>fuel</b> tank (via <b>fuel</b> lines) and {{pressurised}} using <b>fuel</b> pump(s). Maintaining the correct <b>fuel</b> pressure {{is done by}} a <b>fuel</b> pressure regulator. Often a <b>fuel</b> rail is used to divide the <b>fuel</b> supply into the required number of cylinders.

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. <b>Fuels</b> containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create <b>fuels</b> with increased octane ratings. Such <b>fuels,</b> directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor <b>fuels</b> and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

50|$|As engines {{moved away}} from carburetors and towards <b>fuel</b> injection, {{mechanical}} <b>fuel</b> pumps were replaced with electric <b>fuel</b> pumps, because <b>fuel</b> injection systems operate more efficiently at higher <b>fuel</b> pressures (40-60 psi) than mechanical diaphragm pumps can generate. Electric <b>fuel</b> pumps are generally located in the <b>fuel</b> tank, {{in order to use}} the <b>fuel</b> in the tank to cool the pump and to ensure a steady supply of <b>fuel.</b>|$|R
5|$|Since {{the model}} assumes {{homogeneous}} mixture, {{the theory is}} well applicable to study the explosive behavior of solid <b>fuels</b> (spontaneous ignition of bio <b>fuels,</b> organic materials, garbage, etc.,).

5|$|The Ford Model T, {{produced}} from 1908 through 1927, was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of ethanol, gasoline or kerosene (each by itself), {{or a combination of}} the first two mentioned <b>fuels.</b> Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. Henry Ford continued to advocate for ethanol as fuel even during the prohibition. However, cheaper oil caused gasoline to prevail, until the 1973 oil crisis resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol and other alternative <b>fuels,</b> such as methanol, gaseous <b>fuels</b> such as CNG and LPG, and also hydrogen. Ethanol, methanol and natural gas CNG were the three alternative <b>fuels</b> that received more attention for research and development, and government support.|$|E

25|$|Water in <b>fuel</b> {{can damage}} a <b>fuel</b> {{injection}} pump; some diesel <b>fuel</b> filters also trap water. Water contamination in diesel <b>fuel</b> {{can lead to}} freezing while in the <b>fuel</b> tank. The freezing water that saturates the <b>fuel</b> will sometimes clog the <b>fuel</b> injector pump. Once the water inside the <b>fuel</b> tank has started to freeze, gelling {{is more likely to}} occur. When the <b>fuel</b> is gelled it is not effective until the temperature is raised and the <b>fuel</b> returns to a liquid state.|$|R
50|$|Alkaline anion {{exchange}} membrane <b>fuel</b> cells (AAEMFC) also known as hydroxide exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> cells (HEMFCs), anion-exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> cells (AEMFCs), or alkaline membrane <b>fuel</b> cells (AMFCs), are a type of alkaline <b>fuel</b> cells (AFCs). Alkaline <b>fuel</b> cells, {{one of the oldest}} type of <b>fuel</b> cell, operate between ambient temperature and 90 °C with an electrical efficiency higher than the other <b>fuel</b> cells such as proton exchange membrane <b>fuel</b> cells (PEMFC), solid oxide <b>fuel</b> cells and phosphoric acid <b>fuel</b> cells. Alkaline {{anion exchange}} membrane <b>fuel</b> cells (AAEMFCs) are functionally similar to AFCs, the difference being AAEMFCs employ a solid polymer electrolyte while AFCs use aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) as an electrolyte.|$|R
50|$|The nuclear <b>fuel</b> cycle, {{also called}} nuclear <b>fuel</b> chain, is the {{progression}} of nuclear <b>fuel</b> {{through a series of}} differing stages. It consists of steps in the front end, which are the preparation of the <b>fuel,</b> steps in the service period in which the <b>fuel</b> is used during reactor operation, and steps in the back end, which are necessary to safely manage, contain, and either reprocess or dispose of spent nuclear <b>fuel.</b> If spent <b>fuel</b> is not reprocessed, the <b>fuel</b> cycle is referred to as an open <b>fuel</b> cycle (or a once-through <b>fuel</b> cycle); if the spent <b>fuel</b> is reprocessed, it is referred to as a closed <b>fuel</b> cycle.|$|R

5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both <b>fuels</b> into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions.
