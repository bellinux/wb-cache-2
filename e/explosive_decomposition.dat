40|$|Chemical, thermal and {{mechanical}} stability are important {{parts in the}} quality and safety assessment of propellants and <b>explosives.</b> <b>Decomposition</b> reactions limit the safe use time, the socalled lifetime. With explosives consisting of nitric acid esters, stabilizer consumption and molar mass (molecular weight) decrease are very suitable methods to predict the safe of use time or the remaining safe lifetime. Kinetic models for stabilizer and molar mass decrease are presented and the prediction methods discussed. A new model for stabilizer depletion, a combination of of first and zero order reaction, describes the decrease very good and the prediction of the lifetime is improved. The Arrhenius parameters for stabilizer consumption and molar mass decrease of gun and rocket propellants are given. Propellants produced with crystalline explosives and polymeric binders are more stable against thermal stress, but they also decompose exothermally at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The role of dislocations in {{assisting}} initiation of (<b>explosive)</b> chemical <b>decomposition</b> of energetic materials has {{connection with the}} known influences for crystals and polycrystals of dislocations facilitating permanent deformations and phase transformations.

Both model evaluations of the load dependence of cracking at hardness indentations and the derived hardness stress-strain behaviors show that dislocation movement is difficult whether in the indentation strain fields or at the tips of indentation-induced cracks. Thus, energetic crystals are elastically compliant, plastically hard, and relatively brittle [1]. Nevertheless, cracking is shown to be facilitated by the shear stress driven, normally limited, dislocation flow that, on molecular dynamics and dislocation pile-up model bases, is shown to be especially prone to producing localized hot spot heating for explosive initiations.

40|$|International audienceLaser-produced {{nanoparticles}} {{have found}} many applications in bio-photonics, medicine {{and in the}} development of photovolvatic cells. Many experiments have been performed demonstrating the formation of these particles from solid targets in vacuum, {{in the presence of a}} gas or a liquid. However, it is still difficult to predict the size distribution of these particles. Therefore, we have performed an extensive numerical modeling of the involved physical processes. The developed models allow us to compare the relative contribution of several processes involved in the cluster production by laser ablation: (i) direct cluster ejection from a target under rapid laser interaction, (ii) condensation/evaporation; (iii) fragmentation/aggregation processes during cluster diffusion; and (iv) diffusion and coalescence if nanoparticles are deposited on a substrate. The calculation results of both hydrodynamic and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that an exposure of a target to a short or ultra-short laser pulse leads to an <b>explosive</b> target <b>decomposition</b> and to the ejection of nanoparticles. These cluster precursors are formed during rapid target expansion through both thermal and mechanical processes. Collisions with background species affect the cluster size distribution. The influences of the parameters, such as initial cluster temperature and size, background temperature and density, on the cluster evolution are analyzed. Laser-induced phase explosion process affects the formation of small surface structures, obtained with small number of shots. However, the non-resonant “conical” surface structures with the mean size as large as several micrometers are formed due to the presence of harder less absorbing centers.

XRD and FT-IR analysis did not show {{any change in the}} crystal structure before and after the preparation of HMX and CL- 20, still maintaining β-HMX and Ɛ-CL- 20, respectively. Compared with the raw <b>explosives,</b> the thermal <b>decomposition</b> peak temperature of the composite energetic particles after adding MUF was reduced; however, the reduction effect of the thermal decomposition peak temperature of the sample 3 was not significant. The characteristic height H 50 of the composite particles prepared by interfacial polymerization method increased by three to four times, most obviously improving the safety performance. In short, HMX/MUF, RDX/MUF, and CL- 20 /MUF particles prepared by each method have similarities in morphology, particle size, and even performance. In particular, the three composite particles fabricated by interfacial polymerization method possess better thermal stability and safety performance with smooth surfaces, dense and uniform coating layers. Therefore, in order to improve the thermal stability of the composite particles, it is an effective approach to select a coating material with excellent thermal performance. And under the premise of choosing a specific binder, it may be effective to prioritize the use of interfacial polymerization method to prepare composite particles. This study provides certain reference for the application of high-energy and low-sensitivity ammunition in weapon firepower and rocket systems.|$|R
