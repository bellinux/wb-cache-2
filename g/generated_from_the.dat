5|$|Heat <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Farallon Plate subducting {{below the}} North American Plate {{led to the}} {{creation}} of an island arc of volcanoes on the west coast of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods. Later volcanism in the Jurassic intruded and covered these rocks in what may have been magmatic activity associated with the early stages of the creation of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. 95% of these rocks were eventually removed by uplifted-accelerated erosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{names of}} most of the provinces were <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Mashonaland and Matabeleland divide at the time of colonisation: Mashonaland was the {{territory}} occupied first by the British South Africa Company Pioneer Column and Matabeleland the territory conquered during the First Matabele War. This corresponds roughly to the precolonial territory of the Shona people and the Matabele people, although there are significant ethnic minorities in most provinces. Each province is headed by a Provincial Governor, appointed by the President.|$|E

5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower numbers of passengers using the lines made it difficult for the operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E
5|$|Compressive forces {{built up}} along {{the entire length of}} the broad {{continental}} shelf. The Sierran Arc, also called the Cordilleran Mesozoic magmatic arc, started to form from heat and pressure <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> subduction. Compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop and granitic blobs of magma called plutons to rise in the Death Valley region and beyond, most notably creating the Sierra Nevada Batholith to the west. Thrust faulting was so severe that the continental shelf was shortened and some parts of older formations were moved on top of younger rock units.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{protests from}} TVA {{that it was}} unnecessary, the Manhattan District built a {{coal-fired}} power plant at K-25 with eight 25,000 KW generators. Steam <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> K-25 power plant was subsequently used by S-50. Additional power lines were laid from the TVA hydroelectric plants at Norris Dam and Watts Bar Dam, and the Clinton Engineer Works was given its own electrical substations at K-25 and K-27. By 1945, power sources were capable of supplying Oak Ridge with up to 310,000 KW, of which 200,000 KW was earmarked for Y-12, 80,000 KW for K-25, 23,000 KW for the township, 6,000 KW for S-50 and 1,000 KW for X-10. Peak demand occurred in August 1945, when all the facilities were running. The peak load was 298,800 KW on 1 September.|$|E

5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3AU. If the eccentricity was actually this high, the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The Daily Mirror noted at the end of April 1906 that the BS offered poor value for money compared to the equivalent motor bus service, which cost only 1d. per journey, and that passengers disliked the distances that they had to walk between the trains and the lifts. Such problems were not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenue <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower passenger numbers made it difficult for the UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}} cluster, multi-cell lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can {{be responsible for the}} development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires from the heat <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler was {{concerned}} about a Balkan invasion, as the area had {{been the source of}} raw materials for the German war industry, including copper, bauxite, chrome and oil. The Allies knew of Hitler's fears, and they launched Operation Barclay, a deception operation to play upon his concerns and to mislead the Germans into thinking the Balkans were the objective, thereby keeping Sicily less defended than it could have been. In doing so, the deception operation reinforced German strategic thinking about the likely British target. To suggest the eastern Mediterranean was the target, the Allies set up a headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, for a fictional formation, the Twelfth Army, consisting of twelve divisions. Military manoeuvres were conducted in Syria, with numbers inflated by dummy tanks and armoured vehicles to deceive observers. Greek interpreters were recruited and the Allies stockpiled Greek maps and currency. Falsified communications about troop movements were <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Twelfth Army headquarters, while the Allied command post in Tunis – which was to be the headquarters of the Sicily invasion – reduced radio traffic by using land-lines wherever possible.|$|E
5|$|Although cinema, theatre, {{dance and}} live music are popular, the {{favourite}} pastime of the British is watching television. Public broadcast {{television in the}} United Kingdom began in 1936, with {{the launch of the}} BBC Television Service (now BBC One). In the United Kingdom and the Crown dependencies, one must have a television licence to legally receive any broadcast television service, from any source. This includes the commercial channels, cable and satellite transmissions, and the Internet. Revenue <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> television licence is used to provide radio, television and Internet content for the British Broadcasting Corporation, and Welsh language television programmes for S4C. The BBC, the common abbreviation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the world's largest broadcaster. Unlike other broadcasters in the UK, it is a public service based, quasi-autonomous, statutory corporation run by the BBC Trust. Free-to-air terrestrial television channels available on a national basis are BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 (S4C in Wales), and Five.|$|E

5|$|Because higher league {{placement}} {{results in}} {{a greater share of}} television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51million, compared to £42.5million at Chelsea, £39.3million at Liverpool, £34million at Arsenal and £27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.|$|E

Hamar Energi Holding AS (HEH), which owns Hamar Municipality's share of Eidsiva Energi, had large assets. Both HEH and BE1 had as chair Hans Kolstad, who proposed that HEH could issue a guarantee of NOK75 million for BG and BE1—which was issued in September 2007. This allowed construction to start, but the project was still under-financed by NOK50 million. HEH therefore issued another guarantee the same month, for NOK58.75 million. Because of delays in the regulation work, HEH issued another two guarantees, NOK60 million in March and NOK25 million in June 2008.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, a {{constitutional}} convention {{was called to}} determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth <b>generated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> endeavor led {{to the establishment of}} Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted by the promise of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region.
