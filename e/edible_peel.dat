40|$|Banana (Musasapientum) {{has been}} part of human diet for ages to their health benefits, but {{consumption}} of these fruit generates outer skin wastes that may lead to environmental pollution. The production of sugar evaluated from the non <b>edible</b> (<b>peel)</b> portion of banana fruit has considerable promise in the future to achieve economical profit. Banana (Musasapientum) is polysaccharide source that can be converted to reducing sugar. Banana peels was hydrolyzed using sulphuric acid at temperature 75 ˚C. It was observed that the degradation has significant effect with respect by varying time (60, 90 minutes) and concentration of (Sulphuric acid and Hydrochloric acid). In turn sugar yield is around 40 - 50 %, each which is estimated by Bertrand’s, Benedict’s, and Lane-Eynon methods...|$|E
40|$|O Brasil Ã um dos paÃses que mais produz resÃduos agroindustriais, como os resÃduos de frutas pelas indÃstrias de polpas, o que tem contribuÃdo para o aumento da produÃÃo do lixo orgÃnico provocando graves problemas ambientais. O Nordeste se destaca devido Ã enorme diversidade de frutos considerados exÃticos, sendo o cajÃ (Spondias mombin L.) um forte exemplo. Este fruto contÃm substÃncias antioxidantes, presenÃa de compostos fenÃlicos, tais como flavonoides, Ãcidos fenÃlicos, antocianinas, carotenoides, alÃm das vitaminas A e C. Desta forma, este estudo propÃs caracterizar e quantificar a pelÃcula comestÃvel de cajÃ a fim de direcionar o processo de extraÃÃo de carotenoides por maceraÃÃo enzimÃtica e assim determinar a melhor condiÃÃo, atravÃs de um planejamento experimental, alÃm de avaliar a influÃncia de fatores fÃsicos e fÃsico-quÃmicos na maceraÃÃo enzimÃtica de pelÃcula comestÃvel de cajÃ, e por fim realizar a maceraÃÃo enzimÃtica de pelÃcula de cajÃ em reator de bancada e obter um produto em pÃ atravÃs de secagem por atomizaÃÃo. A pelÃcula de cajÃ apresentou-se como uma boa fonte de carotenoides, onde a melhor condiÃÃo para recuperaÃÃo de carotenoides foi ao utilizar 300 ÂL do complexo enzimÃtico Pectinex XXL durante o perÃodo de 3 horas de incubaÃÃo, conseguindo o teor de 120, 94 Âg/g. Dentre os fatores fÃsicos e fÃsico-quÃmicos, a utilizaÃÃo de preparaÃÃes enzimÃticas de carÃter celulolÃticos junto Ãs preparaÃÃes pectinolÃticas, para a recuperaÃÃo de carotenoides de pelÃcula comestÃvel de cajÃ, nÃo se mostrou eficiente e o ajuste do pH prÃximo Ã neutralidade (pH 6, 0), antes de iniciar a maceraÃÃo mostrou-se eficiente para uma maior recuperaÃÃo de carotenoides, isto a nÃvel laboratorial. A quantidade de Ãgua adicionada no processo nÃo altera a recuperaÃÃo de carotenoides, podendo ser utilizada nas proporÃÃes pelÃcula: Ãgua de 1 : 2, 1 : 3 ou 1 : 4. O emprego do ultrassom associado Ã maceraÃÃo enzimÃtica funcionou em escala laboratorial. A utilizaÃÃo de reator de bancada foi tecnicamente viÃvel especialmente pela melhora das condiÃÃes de homogeneizaÃÃo da mistura reacional, o que por sua vez levou Ã obtenÃÃo de maior teor de carotenoides recuperados na fase aquosa, nÃo sendo necessÃrio ajuste do pH do meio reacional. A secagem por atomizaÃÃo foi possÃvel sendo necessÃria uma adequaÃÃo dos fatores que influenciam a secagem para que se encontre a melhor condiÃÃo. Brazil {{is one of}} the {{countries}} that most produces organic residues, such as residues of fruit pulp industries, which have contributed to the increased production of organic waste causing serious environmental problems. The Brazilian Northeast stands out due to the huge diversity of fruits considered exotic, where the yellow mombin (Spondias mombin L.) is a good example. This fruit contains antioxidants, phenolic compounds such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, anthocyanins, carotenoids, and also vitamins A and C. Thus, this study aimed to characterize and quantify the yellow mombin <b>edible</b> <b>peel,</b> in order to direct the process of extraction of carotenoids by enzymatic maceration and then determine the best condition, through an experimental design, and also to evaluate the influence of physical and physico-chemical factors on enzymatic maceration of the yellow mombin <b>edible</b> <b>peel,</b> and finally performing enzymatic maceration in the the yellow mombin <b>edible</b> <b>peel</b> in a batch reactor and obtain a product powder through spray drying. The yellow mombin <b>edible</b> <b>peel</b> presented himself as a good source of carotenoids, where the best condition for recovery of carotenoids was using 300 ÂL of the Pectinex enzymatic complex XXL during 3 hours of incubation, reaching the level of 120. 94 Âg/g. Among the physical and physico-chemical factors, the use of enzyme preparations of cellulolytics status with the pectinolytic preparations for the recovery of carotenoids yellow mombin <b>edible</b> <b>peel</b> was not efficient, and adjusting the pH to neutrality (pH 6. 0) before starting maceration proved efficient for a greater recovery of carotenoids, that in the laboratory level. The amount of water added in the process does not alter the recovery of carotenoids, used in proportions skin: water of 1 : 2, 1 : 3 or 1 : 4. The use of ultrasound associated with enzymatic maceration worked at the laboratory scale. The use of batch reactor was technically feasible especially for the improvement of the conditions of homogenization of the mixture, which in turn led to obtaining higher levels of carotenoids recovered in the aqueous phase, not being necessary to adjust the pH of the reaction environment. Spray drying was possible being necessary suitability of the factors that influence drying to find the best condition necessary...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from BASF SE to modify the existing MRLs for the active substance metrafenone in various crops. In order to accommodate for the intended uses of metrafenone in France, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the limit of quantification of 0. 05 mg/kg to 0. 6 mg/kg in strawberries, 0. 3 mg/kg in tomatoes and aubergines, 2 mg/kg in peppers, 0. 1 mg/kg in cucurbits (edible and inedible peel) and 0. 4 mg/kg in cultivated fungi. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive the following MRL proposals: 0. 6 mg/kg in strawberries, 0. 4 mg/kg in tomatoes and cultivated fungi, 2 mg/kg in peppers, 0. 15 mg/kg in cucurbits with <b>edible</b> <b>peel</b> and 0. 1 mg/kg in cucurbits with inedible peel. The intended use on aubergines is not supported by GAP compliant residue trials. EFSA derived a MRL proposal of 0. 3 mg/kg from the overdosed trials on tomatoes by applying the proportionality approach. Risk managers should decide whether this tentative MRL proposal is acceptable since the use of the down-scaling of overdosed trials is not common practice in the EU. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of metrafenone in the commodities under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of metrafenone on strawberries, tomatoes, peppers, aubergines, cucurbits and cultivated fungi will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{understanding}} {{the contribution of}} the fruit physicochemical parameters to Musa sp. diversity and plantain ripening stages. A discriminant analysis was first performed on a collection of 35 Musa sp. cultivars, organized in six groups based on the consumption mode (dessert or cooking banana) and the genomic constitution. A principal component analysis reinforced by a logistic regression on plantain cultivars was proposed as an analytical approach to describe the plantain ripening stages. The results of the discriminant analysis showed that <b>edible</b> fraction, <b>peel</b> pH, pulp water content, and pulp total phenolics were among the most contributing attributes for the discrimination of the cultivar groups. With mean values ranging from 65. 4 to 247. 3 mg of gallic acid equivalents/ 100 g of fresh weight, the pulp total phenolics strongly differed between interspecific and monospecific cultivars within dessert and nonplantain cooking bananas. The results of the logistic regression revealed that the best models according to fitting parameters involved more than one physicochemical attribute. Interestingly, pulp and peel total phenolic contents contributed in the building up of these models...|$|R

40|$|The article {{gives the}} results of {{hygienic}} and epidemiologic research of morbidity, nutrition structure, food stuffs safety, working conditions, and actual nutrition of workers employed at metallurgy productions. The research was carried out at "Magnitogorskiy metallurgy plant" PLC. 1208 steel workers and founders made up the main group. Average age of research participants amounted to 40. 0 ± 0. 75. The sampling was representative. We studied actual nutrition over 2010 – 2015 via analyzing food consumption frequency and applying extended base of food stuffs chemical structure and analyzing menus with lists of dishes offered for an organized group nutrition. We assessed both qualitative and quantitative parameters, including consumption of basic nutrients, energy, irreplaceable amino acids, lipids, vitamins, dietary fiber, essential and conditionally essential microbiological elements (60 nutrients totally, allowing for losses on a product <b>peeling,</b> <b>edible</b> contents, and other losses occurring at various treatments during cooking). We also assessed nutrition regime and other nutrition features. We detected that ratio between proteins, fats and carbohydrates was the evidence of mostly fat nutrition type. Workers were found to consume insufficient quantity of certain vitamins (A, D, and folic acid) and biological elements (calcium), but they instead consumed excessive quantities of saturated fats and common salt. It is shown that actual nutrition of specific workers' groups at metallurgy production is not rational, imbalanced, and doesn't satisfy body needs causing risks of nutrition state shifts and alimentary-dependent diseases evolvement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), <b>edible</b> fruit, nuts, <b>peel</b> of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), lac, gums, resins, vegetable saps and extracts nes (HS- 13), rubber and articles thereof (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or tufted fabric, lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not knit or crochet (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87).

40|$|Background. Elevated arsenic {{and trace}} metal {{contamination}} of the terrestrial food chain {{represents one of the}} most significant environmental risk exposures for human populations in developing countries. Metalloid and metal contamination in horticultural crop produce such as fruit is a public health concern in Nigeria. Local fruits are cheap sources of vitamins and minerals for the resident population and pose an important dietary threat of metal(loid) toxicity through consumption. Objectives. Market basket investigation of five locally grown (guava, pineapple, orange, and pawpaw) and imported (apple) fruits was conducted to measure the total concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) present in these fruits from southeastern Nigeria (Awka, Anambra). Methods. Fruits were analyzed for As and the three metals using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Moisture content of fruits was determined and used to transform metal concentrations in dry weight to wet weight and compared to Codex food grade standards and assorted (sub) tropical fruits, <b>edible</b> and inedible <b>peels.</b> Results. The mean ± standard deviation of elemental concentrations in dry weight ranged from 20. 0 ± 0. 71 – 96. 84 ± 0. 00 μg g− 1 for As, 0. 02 ± 0. 02 – 0. 89 ± 0. 33 μg g− 1 for Hg, 0. 11 ± 0. 01 - 0. 18 ± 0. 40 μg g− 1 for Cu, and < 0. 001 – 0. 03 ± 0. 05 μg g− 1 for Pb. The As concentrations (wet weight) in fruits were ~ 32 – 166 orders of magnitude higher than Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) maximum As food grade levels. Guava and apple methyl Hg concentrations were ~ 6 –~ 1 orders of magnitude higher than Codex maximum levels, while the content of Cu and Pb in fruits were within acceptable standard limits. Conclusions. The significant concentrations of As and Hg in the examined fruits indicate a potential public health threat. Efforts are needed to initiate and sustain continued monitoring of trace elements in fruits and food sold to consumers due to variation in contaminating sources to ensure food safety. Although a great deal of information exists on Hg toxicity, research on metalloids such as As remains limited in Nigeria and no reliable guidelines exist. Further research is recommended to determine the ecotoxicity of As in Nigeria. Competing Interests. The authors declare no competing financial interests...|$|R
