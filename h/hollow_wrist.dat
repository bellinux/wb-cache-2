50|$|The {{instrument}} MICA {{is mounted}} {{directly to the}} <b>hollow</b> <b>wrist</b> of the robot MIRO, thus the lost 2DoF of motion due to the trocar in case of the minimally invasive setup MiroSurge are re-established, giving the surgeon full dexterity inside patient's body.|$|E
40|$|Robotic surgery {{systems are}} highly complex and {{expensive}} pieces of equipment. Demands for lower cost of care {{can be met}} if these systems are employable in a flexible manner for a large variety of procedures. To protect the initial investment the capabilities of a robotic system need to be expandable as new tasks arise. To oblige the needs of future robotic support in hospitals, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed the versatile robotic system MiroSurge for medical applications. This paper presents a 3 DoF instrument for Minimally Invasive Robotic Surgery which is mounted to the <b>hollow</b> <b>wrist</b> of the DLR MIRO robot arm. The MICA instrument consists of a versatile drive train and a detachable task specific tool with its tool interface, shaft, 2 DoF wrist, 7 DoF force/torque sensor and the actuated functional end. With the current cabledriven tool, gripping and manipulation forces of above 10 N are feasible and dynamics is high enough for surgery at the beating heart...|$|E
40|$|The 7 R 6 -DOF robots with <b>hollow</b> nonspherical <b>wrist</b> {{have been}} proven more {{suitable}} for spray painting applications. However, the inverse kinematics {{of this kind of}} robot is still imperfect due to the coupling between position and orientation of the end-effector (EE). In this paper, a new and efficient algorithm for the inverse kinematics of a 7 R 6 -DOF robot is proposed. The proposed inverse kinematics algorithm is a two-step method. The geometry of the 7 R 6 -DOF robot is analyzed. A comparison between the 7 R 6 -DOF robot and the well-known equivalent 6 R robot is made. Based on this comparison, a rational transformation between these two kinds of robots is constructed. Then the general inverse kinematics algorithm of the equivalent 6 R robot is applied to calculate the approximate solutions of the 7 R 6 -DOF robot, in the first step. The Damped Least-Squares (DLS) method is employed to derive the exact solutions, in the second step. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are tested on a 7 R 6 -DOF painting robot. The results show that the proposed algorithm is more advantageous in the case without an approximate solution, such as the initial point of a continuous trajectory...|$|R
