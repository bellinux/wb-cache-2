40|$|A decade {{into the}} transition, {{many of the}} {{successor}} states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) continue to use energy sector quasi-fiscal activities (QFAs), especially low energy prices and the toleration of payment arrears, to provide large implicit and untargeted subsidies. These activities disguise the overall size of the government, cause overconsumption and waste, and contribute to macroeconomic imbalances. This paper analyses such activities in FSU countries, with particular emphasis on two case studies (Azerbaijan and Ukraine). The paper''s policy conclusions point {{to the need to}} increase energy prices, combined with a strengthening of safety nets to protect the poor, better <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> discipline, and more efforts to achieve fiscal transparency.

Whilst adjudication under the New Zealand Construction Contracts Act 2002 has been hailed a success, further refinements were proposed in the Construction Contracts Amendment Bill first published in 2013. As part of the legislative process, 48 submissions {{were made to the}} Commerce Committee. There was general support for most of the amendments, but some parties expressed concerns on some of the changes. A documentary analysis of the Amendment Bills and submissions to the Commerce Committee was made to critically evaluate the changes proposed and establish if they were improvements. The findings show the major changes proposed include (i) removing most of the distinctions between the treatment of residential and commercial contracts under the Act, (ii) extending the scope of the Act to apply to contracts for certain professional services, (iii) removing the distinction between <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> determinations and of those relating to rights and obligations, and (iv) making the enforcement process more efficient. The findings also show that during a period of over two years from when the Bill was first introduced in January 2013, one other significant improvement for retentions to be held in trust was made. A few proposals to further refine the Bill such as the suggestion to mandate retentions to be kept in a separate trust account were however not accepted. The Construction Contract Amendment Bill (Bill 97 - 3) was uninanimously passed during the third and final reading in Parliament on 20 October 2015 with most of the amendments coming into force on 1 December 2015, those incorporating professional services on 1 September 2016, and the retention provisions on 31 March 2017.

40|$|The time {{is coming}} when {{regional}} and international conflicts will be about water supply since water touches nearly every aspect of life. Water is becoming a scarce commodity everywhere including Balochistan (Pakistan), where environmental challenges are at a peak. Most of the poor (Quetta, Pakistan) pay high prices for water from private vendors or, with their labour, collect free water from distant sources. Tragically, all the money paid to private water vendors could easily fund an adequate public piped water system. Imaginative tariffs for metered supply {{would be needed to}} ensure the poor were not excluded. The overall objective of the study is to discover gaps between demand and supply by collecting and analysing secondary and primary data related to cost recovery. From a survey of urban water users and water vendors in Quetta, Pakistan, about 40 % of respondents have access to a piped supply. However the supply is irregular and unreliable. 50 % percent of connections receive water for five or more hours per week but 25 % have less than two hours supply per week. 92 % percent of respondents thought water should be free. The very small monthly charge for an unmetered connection is PKR 12 ($US 0. 17) but 50 % of the connected respondents never pay, citing unreliability and un-affordability, and there is no mechanism for <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> Water vendors (mainly using road tankers) deliver about 10 Ml (mega litre) per day with a charge of about PKR 1 ($US 0. 0. 014) per 10 litres. The inequity and economic absurdity of the situation is obvious. Monies currently paid to water vendors would easily fund the operation of a potentially safe, reliable, piped water supply system for all. However, due to the very low payment collection, the water supply body cannot maintain its inadequate system. Construction of a universal self funding piped and metered supply system would seem to be the logical solution. However, before self funding could be realised, a major public education program would be needed to teach the population about the real cost of water and to inform the legislators of the need for enforcing water charges...|$|R

40|$|Why do firms {{choose to}} locate in the {{informal}} sector? Researchers often {{argue that the}} high cost of regulation prevents informal firms from becoming formal and productive. Our results point to a more nuanced story. Using data from surveys of microenterprises in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda, we find that the labor productivity of informal firms is virtually indistinguishable from that of formal firms in East Africa, but very different in Southern Africa. We provide a theoretical model to explain this result, based on the key assumption that firms may evade taxes subject to a cost (or concealment cost) that is increasing and convex in the firm’s employment size. Consequently, the productivity distributions reflect the differences in concealment costs and the opportunity cost <b>of</b> formality. Greater <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> laws and better provision of services such as finance and electricity to formally registered firms in Southern Africa means that firms are more likely to register; those that do not are likely to be operating as “survivalist” firms. But in East Africa, weak <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>payment</b> and no significant difference in access to services between formal and informal firms means that these variables do not explain the allocation of firms across the informal-formal divide. We conclude that in countries with weak business environments, informal firms are just as likely as formal firms to increase their productivity as they grow. Thus, interventions to increase productivity and lower the cost of formality may be helpful. But in countries with strong business environments such as those in Southern Africa, owners of informal firms are likely to be better off entering the labor market as wage labor. In the latter case, investment in education or vocational training is probably more important. microenterprise; informal sector; Southern Africa; East Africa; formalization; regulations...|$|R
