40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between trade liberalisation, consumers' environmental awareness and a negative <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> in consumption. We adopt an international Hotelling duopoly setup, where firms are located in two asymmetric countries. We find that, if the intensity of <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> is common knowledge for country governments, this setup delivers no need of accompanying trade policies in order to enforce trade liberalisation. In the opposite case, in which information is asymmetric, i. e., the small country's Government cannot observe the positive enviromental effects of its firm's exports to foreign consumers, we find that: (i) the Pareto optimum is always enforced, since the brown country always relaxes the distortionary trade policy, and (ii) cheating on the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> allows the brown country's government to extract extra surplus from the green country. Allowing for trade in green technology delivers opposite conclusions: the externality is minimised and welfare is maximised in equilibrium if information is symmetric while trade liberalisation with asymmetric information always entails a second best outcome...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a rationale for}} subsidizing green (renewable) energy production. Within a multi-country model where energy is produced with mobile capital in green and dirty production, we investigate the countries' decentralized choice of emissions taxes and green energy subsidies. Without green subsidies, the emissions tax is set inefficiently low, since each country ignores the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> in icted on other countries and since the emissions tax leads to a capital out ow to other countries. When the green subsidy is available, countries choose a positive subsidy rate since this reduces the overall distortion of the tax-subsidy system. In doing so, each country internalizes a larger part of the <b>environmental</b> <b>externality.</b> As consequence capital is relocated from the dirty into the clean sectors and reduces global pollution. Hence, the subsidy is not only bene cial for the country which imposes it but for all countries. renewable energy, capital mobility, green subsidy, emissions regulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates <b>environmental</b> <b>externality</b> {{when the}} {{structure}} of the externality is cumulative. The evaluation exercise {{is based on the assumption}} that the agents in question form conjectural variations. A number of environments are encompassed within this classification and have received due attention in the literature. Each of these heterogeneous environments, however, possesses considerable analytical homogeneity and permit subscription to a general model treatment. These environments include <b>environmental</b> <b>externality,</b> oligopoly and the analysis of the private provision of public goods. We highlight the general analytical approach by focusing on this latter context, in which debate centers around four issues: the existence of free-riding, the extent to which contributions are matched equally across individuals, the nature of conjectures consistent with equilibrium, and the allocative inefficiency of alternative regimes. This paper resolves each of these issues, with the following conclusions: A consistent-conjectures equilibrium exists in the private provision of public goods. It is the monopolistic-conjectures equilibrium. Agents act identically, contributing positive amounts of the public good in an efficient allocation of resources. There is complete matching of contributions among agents, no free-riding, and the allocation is independent of the number of members within the community. Thus the Olson conjecture—that inefficiency is exacerbated by community size—has no foundation in a consistent-conjectures, cumulative-externality, context (212 words) ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{environmental}} law and policy, market-based instruments (MBIs) are policy instruments that use markets, price, {{and other economic}} variables to provide incentives for polluters to reduce or eliminate negative <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> MBIs seek to address the market failure of externalities (such as pollution) by incorporating the external cost of production or consumption activities through taxes or charges on processes or products, or by creating property rights and facilitating {{the establishment of a}} proxy market for the use of environmental services.

50|$|The {{extraction}} of minerals, {{and therefore the}} cumulative extraction leads to environmental damage. Thus, a conflict of interests between environmentalists, governments and firms exists. Since different taxes cause different strategies of firms, {{the protection of the}} environment {{is an important part of}} taxing minerals. Some taxes, as the property tax, increase extraction, which leads to <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> One of the goals of mineral taxing is therefore to internalize externalities by imposing the right tax. The Pigovian tax, or a nearly similar tax, serves as part of a combination to reach this objective. Taxes can initiate environmental behaviour, and can serve as a market-based alternative to intervening directly by regulating.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{conventional}} and formal subsidies as outlined above there are myriad implicit subsidies principally {{in the form of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>externalities.</b> These subsidies include anything that is omitted but not accounted for and thus is an externality. These include things such as car drivers who pollute everyone's atmosphere without compensating everyone, farmers who use pesticides which can pollute everyone's ecosystems again without compensating everyone, or Britain's electricity production which results in additional acid rain in Scandinavia. In these examples the polluter is effectively gaining a net benefit but not compensating those affected. Although they are not subsidies in the form of direct economic support from the Government, they are no less economically, socially and environmentally harmful.|$|E
