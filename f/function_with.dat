A Boolean function {{is said to be}} correlation immune if its output leaks no information about its input values. Balanced correlation immune {{functions are}} called resilient functions. Finding methods for easy construction of resilient <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> additional properties is an active research area. Maitra and Pasalic [3] have constructed 8 -variable 1 -resilient Boolean <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> nonlinearity 116. Their technique interlinks mathematical results with classical computer search. In this paper we describe a new technique to construct 8 -variable 1 -resilient Boolean <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> the same nonlinearity. Using a similar technique, we directly construct 10 -variable (resp. 12 -variable), 1 -resilient <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> nonlinearity 488 (resp. 1996).

Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to <b>function</b> <b>with</b> sufficient workforces.

The Bernstein operators with growing degree, and the Schoenberg operators, when represented as spline subdivision schemes, converge to set-valued <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> convex images. To obtain approximating operators for set-valued <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> general images, we use a binary average between sets, termed the “metric average”, which was introduced by Artstein {{for the construction of}} piecewise linear interpolants to set-valued functions. Representing each of the above mentioned operators in terms of repeated binary averages, and replacing the binary average between numbers by the metric average, we obtain operators for set-valued <b>functions</b> <b>with</b> compact images. In case of the Schoenberg operators, represented either by the de Boor algorithm or by spline subdivision schemes, the operators are approximating.

5|$|The {{layers of}} the adrenal gland differ by <b>function,</b> <b>with</b> each layer having {{distinct}} enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E
