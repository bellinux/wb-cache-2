50|$|The total {{cultivable}} {{area of the}} islands is only about 400 hectares. Although rainfall is abundant, wet and dry seasons are sharply defined. Better irrigation and drainage systems are needed to improve food crops. The government has taken various measures to reduce dependency on imported foods, including deregulating production and marketing and reducing the trades tax on fertilizers and equipment. As a result, vegetable and fruit production climbed from 505 tons in 1990 to 1,170 tons in 1992. This increase failed to be matched by a commensurate decrease in imports of fruits and vegetables, which reached 3,471 tons in 1992. Local consumption had apparently increased, and substitution between imported and domestic foodstuffs was possible only to a limited degree. In most cases, imported produce is significantly cheaper in spite of air freight, import taxes, and other costs, necessitating a high <b>import</b> <b>markup</b> by the SMB to prevent disruption of domestic production. Neither rice, a dietary staple, nor other grains can be grown on the islands.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{long panel}} of US 4 -digit {{industries}} to analyse {{the impact of}} US Antidumping (AD) and Countervailing duties (CVD) on domestic producers' price-cost margins (PCM). In the analysis I account for selection bias in the imposition of AD/CVD {{as well as the}} intensity of the protection granted. I find evidence of a positive effect of AD/CVD on PCM. However, the point estimates are small suggesting that whilst the effects of these policies on the market of the products directly affected may be important, their sector level effects are modest.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{exchange}} rate pass-through for Indian export and <b>import</b> prices. A <b>markup</b> model for aggregate export/import prices is set up, and the analysis is carried out using Johansenâ€“Juselius cointegration and error correction models. The evidence shows partial pass-through into export prices, but more than complete pass-through into import prices, with the long-run pass-through coefficients being larger than the short-run coefficients. Thus, the Indian exporter does {{appear to have a}} little bargaining power, but it is not so with the Indian importer. The results cast a question mark over the efficacy of exchange rate changes as a policy tool in correcting trade balances, and also point to the risk of imported inflation...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{test key}} micro-level {{theoretical}} predictions ofMelitz and Ottaviano (MO) (2008), {{a model of}} international trade with heterogenous firms and endogenous mark-ups. At the firm-level, the MO model predicts that: 1) firm markups are negatively related to domestic market size; 2) markups are positively related to firm productivity; 3) markups are negatively related to <b>import</b> penetration; 4) <b>markups</b> are positively related to firm export intensity and markups are higher on the export market than on the domestic ones {{in the presence of}} trade barriers and/or if competitors on the export market are less efficient than competitors on the domestic market. We estimate micro-level price cost margins (PCMs) using firm-level data extending the techniques developed by Hall (1986, 1988) and extended by Domowitz et al. (1988) and Roeger (1995) for the French manufacturing industry from 1986 to 2004. We find evidence in favor of these theoretical predictions.
