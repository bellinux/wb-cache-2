40|$|We {{model the}} density {{dependence}} of the Gruneisen parameter as gamma(rho) = 1 / 2 + gamma_ 1 /rho^{ 1 / 3 } + gamma_ 2 /rho^{q}, where gamma_ 1, gamma_ 2, and q> 1 are constants.

The numerical values of the constants are obtained for 20 elemental solids. Using the Lindemann criterion with our model for gamma, we calculate the melting curves for Al, Ar, Ni, Pd, and Pt and compare them to available <b>experimental</b> <b>melt</b> data.

The density of the <b>experimental</b> <b>melt</b> at pressure was determined by observing sinking and floating of pure forsterite (Fo 100) and 90 % forsterite (Fo 90) buoyancy markers. Values for VCO 2 were bracketed at 4. 3 GPa (23. 71 cm 3 /mol) and at 5. 5 GPa (22. 06 cm 3 /mol), normalized to 1850 °C. Combining the current data with previous work we now more accurately constrain the compression curve of VCO 2 over the pressure range of 1 bar to 20 GPa. These data allow the calculation of density at pressure of carbonated silicate melts, such as kimberlite and silica undersaturated alkali basalts, and the determination of their buoyancy and eruptibility.

40|$|The {{development}} of an accurate analysis procedure for many laser applications, including the surface treatment of architectural materials, is extremely complicated due to the multitude of process parameters and materials characteristics involved. A one-dimensional analytical model based on Fourier’s law, with quasi-stationary situations in an isotropic and inhomogeneous workpiece with a parabolic meltpool geometry being assumed, was successfully developed. This model, with the inclusion of an empirically determined correction factor, predicted high power diode laser (HPDL) induced melt depths in clay quarry tiles, ceramic tiles and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) that were {{in close agreement with}} those obtained experimentally.

The ~ 1, 500 -m-long drilled gabbroic section of ODP Hole 735 B (Legs 118 and 176) at the Southwest Indian Ridge contains numerous small plagiogranitic veins often associated with zones which are characterized by high-temperature shearing.

40|$|The {{modification}} of the thermal conductivity and melting temperature of unrelaxed amorphous Ge films on Si substrates upon laser-induced relaxation and crystallization is presented. Real-Time Reflectivity (RTR) measurements are used to determine experimentally both the melting threshold and the melt durations, and the finite element method is used to simulate the laser-induced heat-flow process. A thermal conductivity of k= 0. 010 W dem K is determined for the unrelaxed material by fitting the experimental melting thresholds of unrelaxed films of different thicknesses. A similar procedure applied to the amorphous relaxed and crystallized materials lead to a shift to higher values of both the thermal conductivity and the melting temperature.

40|$|A general approach, {{based on}} the polymer {{reference}} interaction site model (PRISM) integral equation theory, suitable for characterizing arbitrarily complex polyolefin melts is described. We tested the method by calculating the melt structures of linear polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and the spinodal decomposition temperatures for PE/iPP blends. The computational expense of the PRISM calculation was reduced with a single-site united atom model in which the polyolefin CH, CH 2, and CH 3 groups were approximated as chemically equivalent sites with spherically symmetric energetic interactions. The site-site interactions were defined by a potential function comprising a hard core with an attractive Lennard-Jones term. These energetic parameters were optimized with a central composite design strategy that enabled a simultaneous fit of <b>experimental</b> <b>melt</b> density and structure factor data. Values were obtained for PE and iPP individually and for common universal parameters that could potentially be used for all polyolefins.

Particular emphasis has been given to the creation of 3 D biomimetic cellular microenvironments that replicate the complex nature of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A key factor that has not been rigorously deconstructed using scalable, layered manufacturing approaches is the structural dimension or scale aspect of in vitro culture models. Melt electrospinning represents a bio-additive manufacturing process that has been relatively under-reported. Although complex in nature, the melt electrospinning process can furnish a 3 D cell delivery format with physiologically relevant 3 D structural cues.

Two oxygen fugacity ranges were investigated: close to the Ni-NiO (NNO) buffer and 2. 6 log unit above NNO buffer (a dagger NNO + 2. 6). At 1, 100 A degrees C, olivine is the liquidus phase and co-crystallized with phlogopite and augite at 1, 000 A degrees C for the whole range of investigated pressure and water content in the melt. At 900 A degrees C, the mineral assemblage consists of augite and phlogopite, whereas olivine is not stable. The stability field of both alkali feldspar and plagioclase is restricted to low pressure (100 MPa) at nearly water-saturated conditions (< 3 - 4 wt. % H 2 O) and T < 900 A degrees C. A comparison between experimental products and natural minerals indicates that mafic durbachites have a near-liquidus assemblage of olivine, augite, Ti-rich phlogopite, apatite and zircon, followed by alkali feldspar and plagioclase, similar to the mineral assemblage of minette magma. Natural amphibole, diopside and orthopyroxene were not reproduced experimentally and probably result from sub-solidus reactions, whereas biotite re-equilibrated at low temperature. The crystallization sequence olivine followed by phlogopite and augite reproduces the sequence inferred in many mica-lamprophyre rocks. The similar fractionation trends observed for durbachites and minettes indicate that mafic durbachites are probably the plutonic equivalents of minettes and that K- and Mg-rich magmas in the Bohemian Massif may have been generated from partial melting of a phlogopite-clinopyroxene-bearing metasomatized peridotite. <b>Experimental</b> <b>melt</b> compositions also suggest that felsic durbachites can be generated by simple fractionation of a more mafic parent and mixing with mantle-derived components at mid crustal pressures...|$|E

These technologies {{rely on the}} ability to produce defect free parts through a delicate control of the process. However, this process has not been attempted or has failed for many common metallic materials such as Aluminum. The objective of this thesis was to understand the thermal transport phenomenon in electron and laser beam powder melting technology through simulation and experiments and determine the suitable range of parameters {{that can be used for}} common metallic materials. A finite element model was developed using ANSYS APDL to explore thermal transport and phase change behavior in metallic powder bed additive manufacturing processes. To explore a broad base of novel engineering materials, simulations were run in Ti 6 Al 4 V, Inconel 718, Stainless Steel 316 L and Al 7075 in both selective laser melting and {{electron beam}} melting scenarios. Comparison of the four materials in each process showed that it is very challenging to develop and maintain melt pools in aluminum while melt pools are broad and robust in Inconel and titanium, even when subjected to much lower energy densities. Titanium and Inconel were also shown to have larger melt pools and shallower thermal gradients. Effective powder thermal conductivity was used to encapsulate all modes of heat transfer occurring at the inter-particle level and allow the use of macro-level size scale parameters for the finite element analysis. Additionally, an effective liquid conductivity is derived to capture the effects of fluid dynamics and advective transport effects within the melt pool and more accurately predict melt pool geometries without the need for coupled computational fluid dynamics analyses governing the melt pool.

In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, NP CD 4 + counts remain stable and plasma viremia is substantially reduced. Recent data affirms that NPs exhibit decreased trans-infection efficiency due to reduced cellular cholesterol levels in antigen presenting cells (APCs) through cholesterol efflux protein, ABCA- 1. Because defective trans infection in NPs was also observed prior to seroconversion, {{it is believed that}} nonprogression is influenced by a genetic trait. Further transcriptome analysis of Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) immature dendritic cells (iDCs) reveals elevated expression profiles for Siglec- 10, CD 1 B, and Palladin (PALLD) in NPs compared to PRs. While the explicit mechanism remains elusive, our aim is to elucidate the genetic origin of NP viremic control. I have hypothesized that upregulated expression of Siglec- 10, CD 1 b, and Palladin in HIV+ MACS NPs is responsible for control of HIV progression by attenuating trans infection between iDCs and CD 4 lymphocytes through unrelated molecular and immunological mechanisms. MACS CD 14 + monocytes were cultured with IL- 4 and GM-CSF to yield iDCs. Protein expression of Siglec- 10, CD 1 B, and PALLD in seronegative (SN), PR, and NP iDCs has been assessed using flow cytometry. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of MACS iDCs RNA is used for corroboration of gene expression data from the transcriptome findings. TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays examined if there is a link between NP disease state and single base-pair variations within DNA.

Calcium suberate, a selective beta-nucleating agent was used to produce samples that consist entirely of beta-form i-PP. The <b>experimental</b> <b>melting</b> points were recorded at different crystallization times and were extrapolated {{to the start of the}} crystallization process in order to eliminate the effect of lamellar thickening. Using the non-linear Hoffman-Weeks approach to correlate these extrapolated <b>experimental</b> <b>melting</b> temperatures with the corresponding crystallization temperatures, an equilibrium melting point of 209 degreesC was obtained for beta-iPP. The equilibrium melting point estimated through the non-linear Hoffman-Weeks analysis is about 30 degreesC higher than that (T-m(o) = 177 degreesC) obtained on the basis of the linear extrapolation. These results are consistent with earlier claims that a linear extrapolation of T-m-T-c data leads to an underestimation of the equilibrium melting point. The results obtained for beta-iPP exemplify the importance of accounting for both the isothermal lamellar thickening effects and the non-linearity in the T-m-T-c correlation, when the determination of an equilibrium melting point is carried out using a procedure based on the predictions of the Lauritzen-Hoffman secondary nucleation theory...|$|R
40|$|SRNL was tasked {{to provide}} an {{assessment}} of the downstream impacts (or lack thereof) to DWPF of decisions regarding the implementation of Al-dissolution to support sludge mass reduction and processing. Based on future sludge batch compositional projections, assessments have been made with respect to the ability to maintain comparable projected operating windows for sludges with high temperature Al-dissolution and without Al-dissolution. In general, paper study assessments indicated that most of the future sludge batches (twelve with and fourteen without high temperature Al-dissolution) had multiple frits available that yielded relatively large operating windows. The projected operating windows were defined by the waste loading (WL) interval over which glasses were classified as acceptable based on current process control models and their related constraints. Although multiple frits were identified, using a 17 -point width as a general guide for a reasonable operating window (e. g., 25 - 41 % WL), there generally appeared to be more flexibility in frit selection for the without Al-dissolution flowsheets. This larger frit compositional platform could allow frit development efforts to make more significant adjustments to melt rate. However, based on the general observations of the paper study, there is essentially no clear distinction between the two options with which to drive a decision to implement Al-dissolution. That is, comparable operating windows can be achieved through the frit development and selection process for either process. One could interpret this general summary statement to indicate: given frit development efforts can compensate for the different pretreatment strategies yielding equivalent operating windows or maximum WL targets, the lower sludge mass as a result of Al-dissolution would obviously result in reducing the number of cans produced at DWPF. Although the basic mathematics is technically sound, other factors need to be considered including facility operating times or mission life for the Tank Farm, DWPF and Saltstone. To address some of these questions, candidate frit compositions have been selected to assess melt rate as a function of waste loading for the glass systems representing future sludge batches with and without Al dissolution. The frit selection process was driven by reviewing compositional trends that have historically influenced melt rate as well as identifying systems with relatively large operating windows. With respect to the identification of sludge batches to support the melt rate testing, average compositions representing with and without Al-dissolution 'clusters' were developed using a statistical grouping routine. Ultimately, five frits were identified for each average 'cluster' composition. Melt rate assessments will be performed as a function of waste loading for the five frits selected. The data obtained from the <b>experimental</b> <b>melt</b> rate program can be used in combination with actual DWPF processing data to provide valuable insight into the waste throughput potentials for both flowsheets...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePost collisional {{collapse}} commonly enhances crustal melting. Such melting typically produces peraluminous granitic magmas. In the French Massif Central, a mid-crustal {{segment of}} the western Variscan belt, two large granitic bodies were produced during {{the collapse of the}} Variscan Belt. The St Sylvestre Leucogranitic Complex (SSyL) {{in the western part of}} the Massif Central and the Velay Migmatitic Complex (VMC) in the Eastern part. Although these two complexes are formed in similar geodynamic context they present meaningful petrological and geochemical differences. The VMC (~ 305 Ma) is clearly intrusive in migmatitic terranes. The migmatitic host recorded two successive melting events M 3 (720 °C and 5 kb) dated between 335 and 315 Ma and M 4 (850 °C and 4 kb) dated at 305 Ma. The compositions of the VMC are strictly H 2 O-undersaturated and ranges from leucogranitic to granodioritic. Three main successive granite types have been distinguished (1) A heterogeneous banded biotite granite, (2) A main biotite-cordierite granite, where cordierite can be prismatic, as cockade or pseudomorphic (3) a late magmatic with large K-feldspar phenocryst and prismatic cordierite. The compositions of the VMC granites are quite similar to typical Australian S-type granites in the sense that they also show a positive correlation between ferromagnesian abundance and aluminosity. The SSyL (~ 320 Ma) is intrusive in upper greenschist facies to upper amphibolite migmatitic metasediment and orthogneiss (~ 3 kb). The compositional variety observed in the SSyL suggests a continuous trend from a moderately mafic, peraluminous magma (cd- and sill- granite) to a H 2 O saturated granite ("two-mica" granite) facies and finally to an extremely felsic, H 2 O-saturated magma. Three granitic units have been recognized in the SSyL: (1) the western "Brame Unit" composed of the less evolved cd- and sill- granite facies (2) the central "St Sylvestre Unit", composed mainly by U-rich two-mica granite, intruded by two synchronously emplaced fine grained granites to its western margin: "Fanay" (biotite dominant) and "Sagne" (Li-muscovite only) (3) the eastern "St Goussaud Unit" mostly composed of a muscovite-dominant leucogranite surrounded by Sn-W mineralization. The compositions in the SSyL have a weak ferromagnesian character, negatively correlated with aluminosity and are quite similar in composition to High Himalayan syn-collisionnal peraluminous granite (e. g. Manaslu) Compositional trend of the VMC granite can be easily mimicked by the addition of peritectic material (i. e. produced during incongruent biotite melting) to experimental melts produced through the melting of metasediments (Dirty). Compositions of the SSyL are similar to <b>experimental</b> <b>melt</b> only (Tidy). Such differences in composition could be the results of different processes: 1) Different melting reactions as a consequence of different conditions of melting (e. g. different source composition, temperature). 2) The peritectic phases remained "trapped" in the source during melt extraction due to the structuration of the source or a lower melt viscosity (e. g. higher F, Li, H 2 O contents). Interestingly, while within dirty granites, peritectic phase entrainment controls compositional variability, Tidy granites display original melt compositional variability as well as the potential effects of late magmatic processes...|$|E

We show that the potential at which half of the surface immobilised duplexes denature (the melting potential, E(m)) directly correlates with the calculated nearest neighbour and <b>experimental</b> <b>melting</b> temperatures; T(m), for a duplex is solution. The results demonstrate that the electrochemical melting potential measures {{the stability of the}} dsDNA, and therefore existing nearest neighbour melting models can be utilized to design DNA probes with predictable electrochemical melting potentials for future assay applications...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-calcic ankaramitic magmas or melt {{inclusions}} are {{ubiquitous in}} arc, ocean-island and mid-ocean ridge settings. They are primitive in character (XMg > 0 · 65) and have high CaO contents (> 14 [*]wt[*]%) and CaO/Al 2 O 3 (> 1 · 1). Experiments on an ankaramite from Epi, Vanuatu arc, demonstrate that its liquidus surface has only clinopyroxene at pressures of 15 and 20 [*]kbar, with XCO 2 in the volatile component from 0 to 0 · 86. The parental Epi ankaramite is thus not an unfractionated magma. However, forcing the ankaramite experimentally into saturation with olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel results in more magnesian, ultra-calcic melts with CaO/Al 2 O 3 of 1 · 21 - 1 · 58. The <b>experimental</b> <b>melts</b> are not extremely Ca-rich but high in CaO/Al 2 O 3 and in MgO (up to 18. 5 [*]wt[*]%), and would evolve to high-CaO melts through olivine fractionation. Fractionation models {{show that the}} Epi parent magma {{can be derived from}} such ultra-calcic <b>experimental</b> <b>melts</b> through mainly olivine fractionation. We show that the <b>experimental</b> ultra-calcic <b>melts</b> could form through low-degree melting of somewhat refractory mantle. The latter would have been depleted by previous melt extraction, which increases the CaO/Al 2 O 3 in the residue as long as some clinopyroxene remains residual. This finding corrects the common assumption that ultra-calcic magmas must come from a Ca-rich pyroxenite-type source. The temperatures necessary for the generation of ultra-calcic magmas are ≥ 1330 °C, and their presence would suggest melting regimes that are at the upper temperature end of previous interpretations {{made on the basis of}} picritic magma...|$|R
40|$|Melting {{process of}} perylene is {{investigated}} using molecular dynamics simulation. Some of thermodynamic properties such as potential energy and transition order parameter are calculated {{as a function}} of temperature in the range of 500 K- 600 K. These calculations are performed by two different methods in NPT and NVT ensembles. The selected interaction potential is Re-squared and the simulations are performed by LAMMPS (a classic molecular dynamics code). The results show that NPT ensemble is more appropraite for the study of melting process than NVT ensemble and shows a good agreement with <b>experimental</b> <b>melting</b> temperature...|$|R

Using {{a new set of}} potential parameters, we have found a good agreement with the room temperature equation of state at very high pressure obtained by diamond anvil cell experiments. Moreover, the melting line of the model has been estimated through the Lindemann criterion; the agreement with the low-pressure experiments is excellent, whereas at higher pressure, the model poorly reproduces the typical softening of the <b>experimental</b> <b>melting</b> curve...|$|R

An isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble is considered in a periodic {{system with a}} relatively small number of particles per unit cell to obtain the {{thermal expansion}} data over a range of temperatures, and it is found that the calculated thermal expansion coefficients and bond lengths agree well with experimental data. Also, the positions of discontinuities in the potential energy as a function of temperature are in good agreement with the <b>experimental</b> <b>melting</b> points...|$|R
