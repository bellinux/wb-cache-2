40|$|Abstract. A {{comparative}} {{case study}} is conducted on three <b>digital</b> city (<b>public</b> <b>networks)</b> projects of information infrastructure. The focus {{of the study is}} on the processes involved in the development of such networks and the consequences of such networks. This study looks at (1) two broadband network projects in Central New York, U. S. and (2) one Digital City project in Korea. For the U. S. cases, this study discusses problems in the development of <b>public</b> <b>network</b> projects in Central New York. The two broadband projects were funded under a state program to diffuse broadband technologies in economically depressed areas of the state. The Digital City project was sanctioned by the Seoul metropolitan government and is now being developed. This study investigates the initiation of such information infrastructure projects, their policy formulation processes, and the development of such projects. The new praxis of new information infrastructure is recommended. 1...|$|R

The technological features of the NGN as well as the business models that it facilitates are described. Gateways to the PSTN are described. Migration of the PSTN to the NGN and further evolution of the NGN are outlined. The role of the NGN in providing universal service and universal access is outlined. An example of the use of NGN technologies to create next generation Telecentres is presented. 1...|$|R

Focusing on creative practice, design and knowledge exchange, the CX PhD model is positioned in response to the effect of shifting government policies and global economic drivers on relationships between academic research, creative economy and business innovation. Drawing on a workshop involving CX doctoral researchers, supervisors and knowledge exchange associates the paper presents key components, experiences and practices that characterise the CX PhD. The paper concludes by summarising key findings that have emerged through the CX PhD programme. These include the development of new thinking in <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces, new <b>networks</b> for doctoral research and knowledge exchange, and new approaches to design-led innovation in commercial, social and community contexts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Digital Information Networks (DINs) {{refer to}} informa-tion {{networks}} supported by telecommunication infrastructures and terminated by microprocessors. In the recent past, {{there is a}} consol-idated recognition that the <b>public</b> <b>digital</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure is of high economic importance, being generally {{recognized as one of}} the pillars of the knowledge society. An economic agent uses DINs to increase his individual productivity and that of his organization. From a thorough literature review about work done on the relation between DINs and productivity, we found that the theoretical and empirical support for this relation is still inconclusive. This paper lays down a proposal for a qualitative causal model that scientifically underpins the relation between DINs and micro economic productivity. Hence, this model contributes to the establishment of a valid theoretical framework to identify the economic importance of DINs. Keywords—digital, information, network, telecommunication, pro-ductivity, impact...|$|R
30|$|Signals are {{delivered}} to the different elements of ITS {{with the help of}} the communications infrastructure. The communications infrastructure consists of an array of diverse systems, which may be classified into wired networks and wireless networks. These networks may be either public or private, such as <b>public</b> land mobile <b>networks,</b> personal communication <b>networks,</b> <b>public</b> land mobile communications systems, private networks, packet switched data networks, integrated services <b>digital</b> <b>networks,</b> <b>public</b> switched telephone <b>networks,</b> and broadcast networks. These network forms should have the following characteristics so as to be suitable for ITS [4]: (1) support communication services including: voice, data, image, video, and signaling; (2) accommodate a wide variety of terminals, for example, fixed, portable mobile, and in-vehicle mobile; (3) preserve upward/downward terminal compatibility; (4) allow mobile and fixed users to utilize the services without geographical barriers (i.e., seamless communication); (5) provide service flexibility so that any combination of services may be used; (6) make efficient and economical use of the spectrum; (7) provide user authentication and billing functions; (8) provide varied degrees of network security that preserve user privacy; (9) have modular structures that allow the systems to start from small and simple configurations and then grow as needed in size and complexity; (10) generally use open architectures that permit easy introduction of advanced technology and support new applications.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Modern <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> {{spaces are}} {{evolving}} from being mostly the provider of ICT and internet connection to institutions that provide complex {{range of services}} {{and support for the}} community. With this shift in their focus new challenges are emerging, among others their sustainability. Methodology/Approach: We build on and extend the methodology of Digital Cooperatives project. Within this project, survey on 59 <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces from 12 EU countries was conducted. These <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces were examined in 21 areas, some of them relating to their sustainability. We further analyse the sustainability issue of these <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces. Findings: We identified three main issues affecting sustainability of <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces – budgeting, services and community. <b>Digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces mostly rely on public funding and have limited diversification of their funds, which increases a risk when one source of funding drops out. They also have to build a strong community of users, supporters, which will make use of their capacities and helps co-create new services and thus strengthen and improve the community itself. Originality/Value of paper: Research in this paper is based on the collection of best practices from various EU countries in the field of <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces. Recommendations based on these practices could help the creation of new, and in current <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> spaces. </p...|$|R

This research analyzes note card confession videos found on the popular video site, YouTube. It looks at the many aspects of <b>digital</b> storytelling, <b>networked</b> <b>publics,</b> and social support that make this genre of videos so unique. These videos have many visual and narrative components that tie them together as a unique form of communication. Writing style, narrative cues, and physical gestures were all used as part of the digital storytelling process. It was found that there is a common discussion of intimate topics such as depression, abuse, bullying, self-harm, and suicide. Furthermore, the comments section of each of the videos seems to serve as a potential space for online social support. In response to these videos, a series of parody videos have also been created as an apparent critical response to these note card confessions. These findings potentially open up new paths of research regarding new media communication, prevention studies, and youth health...|$|R

In order to explore the design space concerning <b>digital</b> <b>public</b> displays for schools' contexts, six workshops with secondary school teachers in two different countries were conducted to elicit sensitivities towards possible features and interaction techniques as well as inquire about expectations and technology adoption.
