Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> years, the LPO {{recorded}} {{exclusively for}} Columbia, {{a division of}} EMI. The orchestra's first gramophone set was made before its debut concert; with Sargent and the Royal Choral Society the LPO recorded choruses from Messiah and The Creation at Kingsway Hall in September 1932. The first Abbey Road recording was in October, under Sir Henry Wood. Beecham's first discs with the orchestra were made in January 1933, with his ballet suite The Origin of Design, arranged from music by Handel. From then until his last LPO recording in December 1945 Beecham recorded ninety-nine 78-rpm sets with the orchestra. Other conductors {{who worked in the}} EMI studios with the orchestra <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>early</b> years included Elgar, Felix Weingartner, John Barbirolli, and Serge Koussevitzky. Soloists in concerto recordings included the pianists Artur Schnabel and Alfred Cortot and the violinists Fritz Kreisler and Jascha Heifetz.|$|E
