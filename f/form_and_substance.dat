More important, the resolution cannot be sufficient in substance because its careful assay shows that it is a mere charade of conclusions.|$|E

This was done without the consent of the two candidates, especially since Escudero, Binay, and Aquino all came from different political parties.

2500|$|A {{recent study}} {{has tried to}} show that both the <b>form</b> <b>and</b> <b>substance</b> of Achelous, as a god of water {{primarily}} depicted as a man-faced bull, have roots in Old Europe in the Bronze Age. After the disappearance of many Old European cultures, the traditions traveled to the Near East {{at the beginning of}} 4th millennium BC (Ubaid period), and finally migrated to Greece, Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia with itinerant sea-folk during the Late Bronze Age through the Orientalizing period. Although no single cult of Achelous persisted throughout all of these generations, the iconography and general mythos easily spread from one culture to another, and all examples of man-faced bulls are found around the area of the Mediterraneanan, suggesting some intercultural continuity. The leading exponents into the Greek and Etruscan worlds were seer-healers and mercenaries during the Iron Age, and Achelous as a man-faced bull becomes an emblem employed by mercenaries in the Greek world for centuries. These earlier figures probably adapted the mythological and iconographic traditions of Asallúhi (also Asarlúhi or Asaruludu), the [...] "princely bison" [...] of Near Eastern traditions that [...] "rises {{to the surface of the}} earth in springs and marshes, ultimately flowing as rivers." ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLord Dunsany's {{prolific}} namecraft {{provides a}} rich field for study, but poses difficulties for traditional approaches to names in literature, which typically {{seek out the}} hidden meanings or symbolisms of isolated names. An alternative approach {{is to look for}} trends in the <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> <b>substances</b> of the author's inventions as a whole. To this end, Émile Souriau's threefold typology of neologisms proves useful. In the first category, Dunsany camouflages pre-existing vocables of diverse origins. In the second, he employs anglicized versions of forms identified with foreign languages and nomenclatures, though he does not introduce actual foreign sounds. In the third, he constructs names from morphological building blocks. Whether English or foreign, Dunsany divests his source materials of their original referents, yet retains traces of their idiomatic provenance. Colorful and eclectic, his inventions resonate within a mythopoetic encyclopedia of diverse literary, historical, and cultural traditions...|$|R
