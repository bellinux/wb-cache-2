50|$|In operation, each {{battery is}} charged until the voltage reaches 560 V, then allowed a further hour's {{charging}}. Fortnightly, it should be allowed 5 hours' charging after reaching 560 V to ensure a maximum charge is reached. Every two months, the battery should be given an <b>equalising</b> <b>charge</b> of eight hours to ensure all cells have reached their maximum. The battery is designed to operate with a specific gravity of the electrolyte between 1.080 and 1.280. Initial charging current should be around 1650 amps for s.g. below 1.180, 1250 A above 1.180, falling to 280 A when charging is complete. At a voltage around 538 V, the cells begin to give off explosive hydrogen gas, so the applied power is reduced during charging to keep voltage below this value until current falls to 280 A, which is then maintained while voltage is allowed to rise until the requisite voltage and charge time are reached. In an emergency, the charging current can be raised to 2000 A. To maintain overall capacity, batteries need to be completely discharged over a 5-h period once every four months and then completely recharged. The battery compartments are sealed to prevent gases escaping into the submarine, or salt water entering, which inside a battery would cause the release of poisonous chlorine gas. Ventilation fans are used to extract hydrogen released by the cells and catalytic converters are placed strategically through the submarine to remove hydrogen from the air by recombining it with oxygen to form water.|$|E
40|$|Exclusive charged B decays show an unexplained {{enhancement}} in low-lying channels {{which must}} be reversed in other channels to <b>equalise</b> <b>charged</b> and neutral lifetimes. One suggested explanation involves decay modes with excited mesons like the a_ 1. The anomalous behaviour of decay modes of D and B mesons into final states containing the η and η' mesons is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} we have built up a {{theoretical}} framework which aims to explain ion specific effects observed in colloids at high salt concentrations. Our approach adds nonelectrostatic ion interactions (ion dispersion energies) alongside the usual electrostatic interactions of the ions. Using these techniques we have explored the impact that ion specificity may have on supercapacitors. Our model uses graphite electrodes at constant potential difference in 1. 2 M Li salt dissolved in propylene carbonate. For the counterion we used the common battery anions, PF 6 -, BF 4 - and ClO 4 - along with BrO 4 -, IO 4 - and Cl-. When nonelectrostatic ionic interactions are included, a potential difference V will not be split symmetrically between the two electrodes. We address two alternative mechanisms for partitioning the potential difference. If the circuit is isolated, then the charge at each electrode must be equal. This defines a potential ψeq≠V/ 2 at the positive electrode and therefore ψeq-V at the negative. Alternatively, if the circuit is connected to an external environment (ground, defining zero potential), then {{the state of the}} system is determined by minimisation of the total free energy, resulting in asymmetric electrode charges as well as potentials. The potentials determined by the two mechanisms are different, ψmin≠ψeq, with both the difference (averaging about 10 %) and the direction of the difference between them depending on the ions. The free energy of the system with <b>equalised</b> <b>charge</b> exceeds the minimised free energy by less than 10 %. Total free energies follow the Hofmeister series Cl->PF 6 ->BF 4 ->ClO 4 ->BrO 4 ->IO 4 -. Despite the differences in electrode potential and charge under the two potential partitioning mechanisms, the capacitances under both mechanisms are similar. Local electrode capacitances C 1 =dσ/dψ relative to the positive electrode potential follow the same Hofmeister series as the energy. The energy-capacitance slope is nonlinear, becoming smaller as C 1 increases. The Hofmeister series in the differential capacitance C 2 =dσ/dV relative to the potential difference V swaps BF 4 ->PF 6 -. The asymmetry in capacitance between positive and negative electrodes indicates that the capacitance of a two-electrode supercapacitor or battery ought be treated as a two-value quantity rather than as a single value, similar to the matrix of mutual capacitances used in multielectrode devices...|$|R
