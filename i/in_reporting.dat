In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy <b>in</b> <b>Reporting</b> (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing that Republicans were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E

The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people, and Diefenbaker called a snap election. On March 31, 1958, the Tories won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats, taking 208seats (including fifty in Quebec) to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning eight and none for Social Credit.|$|E

5|$|On December 1, 2011, {{following}} the death of Florida A University drum major Robert Champion, the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national fraternity. In January 2012, the Tallahassee Democrat reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010. According to the allegations, two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information. The fraternity's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation. The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion's death; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the fraternity. After the conclusion of both the police and fraternity investigations, the national council closed down the chapter because of its violations of fraternity policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program. As part of the chapter's termination, 28 members, including all active and prospective members in spring 2010, were expelled from the fraternity. Alumni members of the chapter who were present at the hazing were also expelled. Furthermore, the Delta Iota chapter may not return to FAMU before May 2017. Members who joined the fraternity after spring 2010 were transferred to alumni status but cannot participate in any fraternity events due to the shutdown of the chapter. No criminal charges were filed due to the delay <b>in</b> <b>reporting</b> and investigation.|$|E

40|$|Three {{thousand}} and fifty-two infections with opportunist mycobacteria {{were reported to}} the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre from 1982 to 1994. The commonest reported species was Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI), followed by M. kansasii and M. malmoense. The annual totals of opportunist mycobacteria increased steadily over this period, mostly, but not exclusively, due to an increase <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of MAI associated with HIV infection. There were also increases <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of MAI not associated with HIV infection, and <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of M. malmoense. The increase <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of opportunist mycobacteria was seen throughout England and Wales, but underreporting of MAI infection in the National Health Service Thames regions appears to have increased in recent years.

40|$|Data from a {{longitudinal}} study of adult health behavior (N = 1088) were {{used to test the}} 'fixed role' hypothesis as an explanation for sex differences <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of illness and disability. According to this hypothesis, the traditional female excess <b>in</b> <b>reported</b> mobility is due to females having more flexible role obligations than men [...] thus making it easier for women to adopt the sick role. In this analysis, regression techniques were used to examine sex differentials <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of both 'symptom episodes' and bed days, while controlling statistically for fixed roles such as employment status, head of household and % contribution to the total family income. Our findings showed that the three fixed role measures did not explain sex differences <b>in</b> <b>reports</b> of symptom episodes or total bed days (N = 1088). However, among people reporting at least one bed day (N = 503), such obligations did explain the female excess <b>in</b> <b>reported</b> bed days. These findings suggest that fixed role obligations may play a larger role in determining when to relinquish the sick role as opposed to its adoption. These analyses also suggest that role obligations associated with employment status have the major influence on such sick role behavior. ...|$|R
