60|$|They wait {{in silence}} and intense expectation. Hesione and Ellie hold each other's <b>hand</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|E
60|$|Neale quickened and warmed as he progressed, aware now of {{a little}} <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> in his, of an {{interest}} {{that would have made}} any story-telling a pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|Blanche {{clasped her}} papa's <b>hand</b> <b>tight,</b> and bounded {{five or six}} times. [...] "They are our presents, not yours," [...] said she. [...] "Yes, I see. I like them better now." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{clasped her}} <b>hands</b> <b>tighter</b> around his arm. Her eyes sought his anxiously.|$|R
60|$|Helen, with a move as swift, put {{her arms}} round his neck and clasped her <b>hands</b> <b>tight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|You have {{fastened}} {{both your}} <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> on 'I' and 'we': all this ruin {{is caused by}} dualism.|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Muriel cried, still {{clasping}} his <b>hand</b> <b>tight,</b> {{and letting}} the tears now trickle slowly down her pale white cheeks, [...] "we can talk it all over some day with M. Peyron." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was evident}} to Wyllard, and he closed one <b>hand</b> <b>tight.</b> He wanted {{to stand on}} as long as {{possible}} before the ice closed in, but he realised that to do so would put the schooner ashore.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's bumming around, regular tramps, {{and to the}} bad generally." [...] Belding {{spread wide}} his big arms, and {{when one of them}} dropped round Nell, who sat beside him, she {{squeezed}} his <b>hand</b> <b>tight.</b> [...] "Sure, it's the regular thing," [...] he concluded, cheerfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Damage!" [...] cried Henri, {{holding his}} <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> over his face. [...] "Oh! oui, great damage--moche damage, me two eyes be blowed out of dere holes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly, {{out of its}} stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves, Like {{lightning}} it leaped forth, half startled at itself, Its feet {{upon the}} ashes and the rags--its <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> to the throats of [...] kings.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, as, {{with her head}} thrown back, and her <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> clenched together, she uttered these words in an agony of appeal. Then, {{starting}} to his feet as she had done, he advanced towards her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Some of them indeed, madam, {{but more}} {{are poor and}} miserable; and as to the faces, they are so scowling and sombre, truly were we not on horseback I should keep my <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> upon my pouch, though in truth {{there is nothing in}} it worth stealing." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{knew her}} cousin at her entrance, clasped her <b>hand</b> <b>tight,</b> {{and seemed to}} welcome her native tongue, and {{understand}} her assurance that Sir Patrick was gone to seek her sisters; but she wandered off into, 'Don't let him ask Jamet. Ah, Katie Douglas, keep the door! They are coming.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sir,' exclaimed Berenger, who on {{the other}} side held his friend's <b>hand</b> <b>tight,</b> 'this is a noble gentleman--the brother of the Duke de Mericour. He has come at great risk to bring me tidings of my dear and true wife. And not one word will these demented rascals let me hear with their {{senseless}} clamour.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly {{out of its}} stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves, [...] Like {{lightning}} it le'pt forth half startled at itself, [...] Its feet {{upon the}} ashes and the rags, its <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> to the throats [...] of kings.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can you guess,' said Little Dorrit, folding {{her small}} <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> in one another, {{and looking at}} him with all the earnestness of her soul looking {{steadily}} out of her eyes, 'what I am {{going to ask you}} not to do?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{your real}} father come here, I made your true father go away." [...] Now {{she turned and}} faced her son, keeping his <b>hand</b> <b>tighter</b> in hers. [...] "Joey, I want to have you go {{and tell him to}} come back." ...|$|R
60|$|Rudi {{stood against}} the wall, his face white and gleaming. His mouth {{opened and closed}} but no sounds came. Klaus {{stood in front of}} him, the muzzle of his pistol in Rudi's stomach. Neither of them moved. Klaus, his <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> around his gun, his {{features}} set. Rudi, pale and silent, spread-eagled against the wall.|$|E
60|$|I {{held his}} <b>hand</b> <b>tight.</b> It was so {{pleasant}} to know I could love him {{now with a}} clear conscience, even if I had to give myself up to the police to-morrow. And indeed, being a woman, I didn't really much care whether they took me or not, if only I could love Jack, and know Jack loved me.|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth closed one <b>hand</b> <b>tight.</b> Waynefleet, who {{had found}} the {{constant}} wetting too much for him, had left the ca√±on {{a week or two}} before this morning, on which it was evident a crisis of some sort was near. He had complained of severe pains in his back and joints, and had sent them no word after his departure.|$|E
6000|$|Then Mohammed {{returned}} to his master; {{and on the way}} he took a stone and beat his own head with it till it bled, and bound his <b>hands</b> <b>tight,</b> and began to scream. The master came running and asked, 'What is the matter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{are quite}} {{sure you have}} told me all Dr. Lee said?' she demanded, holding his <b>hands</b> <b>tight,</b> and gazing into the face, which certainly, with the still {{heightened}} colour, looked both delicate and weary. 'You have been so much worse than you told!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you wouldn't {{expect me}} to go all through my life without ever feeling love--you who've felt it so many times?" [...] Then, {{clasping}} her <b>hands</b> <b>tight,</b> {{with a sort of}} wonder at herself, she murmured: [...] "I AM in love. I've given myself." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{left them}} there, and Maxwell heard him below in parley, {{apparently}} with the actress at her door. Louise lay {{with her head}} on her husband's arm, and held his other <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> in hers, while he knelt by the bed. The bliss of repentance and mutual forgiveness filled both their hearts, while she told him how she had hurt herself.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Watch the hand," [...] said Mulvaney; [...] "av she shuts her <b>hand</b> <b>tight,</b> thumb {{down over}} the knuckle, take up your hat an' go. You'll only make a fool av yoursilf av you shtay. But av the hand lies opin on the lap, or av you see her thryin' to shut ut, an' she can't,--go on! She's not past reasonin' wid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, good-bye. I shall {{stand back}} there till the train starts, {{but do not}} you notice me. God bless you, Phineas." [...] She held his <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> within her own for some seconds, and looked into his face with an unutterable love. Then she drew down her veil, and went and stood apart till the train had left the platform.|$|E
60|$|Jane--her lithe, young form {{flattened}} {{against the}} trunk of a great tree, her <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> pressed against her rising and falling bosom, and her eyes wide with mingled horror, fascination, fear, and admiration--watched the primordial ape battle with the primeval man for possession of a woman--for her.|$|R
2500|$|Most poker authors {{recommend}} a tight-aggressive approach to playing Texas hold 'em. This strategy involves playing relatively few <b>hands</b> (<b>tight),</b> but betting and raising often {{with those that}} one does play (aggressive). [...] Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well.|$|R
6000|$|One thing must be told, however, {{and that}} is, that when Annie told all the {{wonderful}} story of the post-office order and the Chinese pig, Bessie grew redder and redder in the face, and Susan squeezed both her <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> together, and said [...] "May I tell, Bessie!" ...|$|R
60|$|Somehow he {{kept pace}} with Lewson, but he closed one <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> as he neared {{the top of the}} promontory. When he reached the summit he stopped suddenly, and his face set hard as he looked down. Beneath him lay a strip of dim, green water, with a fringe of soft white surf, while beyond the beach there {{stretched}} away an empty expanse of slowly heaving sea. There was no schooner in the inlet, no boat upon the beach.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--practically sure," [...] said I, and I {{think he}} tried to squeeze my hand. And there I sat, holding his <b>hand</b> <b>tight,</b> and trying to think what seeds of {{immortality}} {{could be found in}} all his being, what sort of ghost there was in him to wander out into the bleak immensities. Queer fancies came to me.... He lay still for a long time, save for a brief struggle or so for breath and ever and again I wiped his mouth and lips.|$|E
60|$|Somehow he {{kept pace}} with Lewson, but he closed one <b>hand</b> <b>tight</b> as he neared the top. When he reached it he stopped suddenly, and his face set hard as he looked down, {{standing}} very still. Beneath him lay a strip of dim, green water, with a fringe of soft, white surf {{at the foot of}} the promontory, while beyond the latter there stretched away an empty expanse of slowly heaving sea. There was nothing else, however; no schooner in the inlet, no boat upon the beach.|$|E
60|$|Then none of {{them seemed}} to know quite what to say, or where to look, till Frances Freeland, her face all pleased and anxious, came in. When she had kissed them they all sat down. And Nedda, at the window, {{squeezed}} her <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> together in her lap.|$|R
60|$|She {{had turned}} and looked at the strange {{spectacle}} of that dauntless man, erect, his foot upon Marius's neck, like some fantastic figure of a contemporary Saint George and a contemporary dragon. She pressed her <b>hands</b> <b>tighter</b> upon her bosom; her eyes sparkled with an odd approval of that brisk deed.|$|R
6000|$|Averil drew in her breath, and {{squeezed}} both <b>hands</b> <b>tight</b> on her chest, {{as she spoke}} very low: 'They sent me away from mamma--they told me papa wanted me: then they sent me from him; they said I was better with Leonard; and--and I said to myself, nothing should make me leave Leonard.' ...|$|R
