ESB promotes agility and flexibility with regard to high-level protocol communication between applications. The primary goal of the high-level protocol communication is enterprise application integration (EAI) of heterogeneous and complex service or application landscapes (a view from the network level).|$|R

With the presented mechanism a transaction runs under several concurrency control mechanisms and the appropriate one is chosen based on the accessed data.

Class O (the optimistic class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> first-committer-wins strategy, class R (the reconciliation class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> first-n-committers-win strategy, class P (the pessimistic class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> first reader-wins strategy, and class E (the escrow class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> firsnreaderswin strategy.
