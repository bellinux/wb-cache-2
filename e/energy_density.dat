5|$|After these annihilations, the {{remaining}} protons, neutrons and electrons {{were no longer}} moving relativistically and the <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of the universe was dominated by photons (with a minor contribution from neutrinos).|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E
5|$|Two {{proposed}} {{forms for}} dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> filling space homogeneously, and scalar {{fields such as}} quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> can vary in time and space. Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually {{also included in the}} cosmological constant. The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a cosmological constant.|$|E

The silver cathode was found to yield superior <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> in all cases considered.

5|$|Estimates put {{the average}} <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of the Universe at the {{equivalent}} of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, dark matter, and baryonic matter (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> or a density of one proton per four cubic meters. The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and black holes—to conditions in vast voids that have much lower density, {{at least in terms}} of visible matter. Unlike the matter and dark matter, the dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 orders of magnitude smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{vanadium}} oxide {{has been proposed}} {{for use as a}} high <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> anode for lithium ion batteries, at 745Wh/L when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. Vanadium phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the Lithium Vanadium Phosphate Battery, another type of lithium ion battery.|$|E
5|$|The {{flatness}} problem (also {{known as}} the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial curvature depending on its total <b>energy</b> <b>density.</b> Curvature is negative, if its density {{is less than the}} critical density; positive, if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be flat.|$|E

Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the dominant power sources for these applications owing to their superior <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> and cycle lives compared to other secondary batteries, but their <b>energy</b> <b>densities</b> are still unsatisfactory for quickly developing society [7, 8, 9, 10, 11].|$|R

5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Independent {{lines of}} {{evidence}} from Type Ia supernovae and the CMB {{imply that the}} universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as dark energy, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused {{the expansion of the}} universe to slowly begin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 20th century, lithium {{became an}} {{important}} component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high electrode potential. Because of its low atomic mass, it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical lithium-ion battery can generate approximately 3 volts per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for lead-acid or 1.5 volts for zinc-carbon cells. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high <b>energy</b> <b>density,</b> {{should not be confused with}} lithium batteries, which are disposable (primary) batteries with lithium or its compounds as the anode. Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the lithium-ion polymer battery, lithium iron phosphate battery, and the nanowire battery.|$|E

5|$|The largest use {{of lead in}} {{the early}} 21st century is in lead–acid batteries. The {{reactions}} in the battery between lead, lead dioxide, and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage. The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans, so there are fewer toxicity concerns. Supercapacitors incorporating lead–acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia, Japan, and the United States in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing, and other applications. These batteries have lower <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> and charge-discharge efficiency than lithium-ion batteries, but are significantly cheaper.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnitude}} of the energy of cosmic ray flux in interstellar space is very {{comparable to that of}} other deep space energies: cosmic ray <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> averages about one electron-volt per cubic centimeter of interstellar space, or ~1eV/cm3, which is comparable to the <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of visible starlight at 0.3eV/cm3, the galactic magnetic field <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> (assumed 3 microgauss) which is ~0.25eV/cm3, or the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> at ~ 0.25eV/cm3.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} (if any) {{between the}} Higgs {{field and the}} presently observed vacuum <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of the universe has also come under scientific study. As observed, the present vacuum <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> is extremely close to zero, but the <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> expected from the Higgs field, supersymmetry, and other current theories are typically many orders of magnitude larger. It is unclear how these should be reconciled. This cosmological constant problem remains a further major unanswered problem in physics.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} terms, {{on either side}} of the equal sign are {{respectively}} the pressure, the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> of the fluid and the potential <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> due to gravity. As can be seen, pressure acts effectively as a form of potential energy.|$|E
25|$|In {{standard}} cosmology, {{matter is}} anything whose <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> scales with the inverse cube {{of the scale}} factor, i.e. ρ ∝ a−3. This {{is in contrast to}} radiation, which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor ρ ∝ a−4, and dark energy, which is unaffected ρ ∝ a0. This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a square box, doubling the length of the sides of the box decreases the density (and hence <b>energy</b> <b>density)</b> by a factor of eight (23). For radiation, the decrease in <b>energy</b> <b>density</b> is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.
