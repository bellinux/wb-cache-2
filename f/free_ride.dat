5|$|A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> {{was first}} shown to its target {{audience}} in 1915. At that time, {{it was not}} possible to screen stag films in public theaters due to the Victorian moral views of contemporary society. Like other pornographic films of that era, A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> was released and circulated underground to avoid censorship. It was likely shown in brothels, gentlemen's clubs, illegal gatherings of men in public places, stag parties, and other all-male venues: the film was kept hidden from society at large and the government.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride,</b> {{also known}} as A Grass Sandwich, is a stag film of the silent era that is {{considered}} to be the earliest extant American hardcore pornographic movie. It depicts a motorist who picks up two women from the roadside and later engages in several sex acts with them. Although most scholars consider A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> a 1915 film, some sources claim that it was produced later. The film's director used a pseudonym and the cast remained anonymous. The filming location is not known, although it may have been produced in New Jersey. Two contradictory theories have emerged regarding the identities of the cast: some sources suggest they were people with low social status, but others assert the opposite. The Kinsey Institute has a print of the film in its collection. A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> was screened at the inauguration of the Museum of Sex. In 2004, Lisa Oppenheim, a New York-based artist, remade the film.|$|E

More recently, experimental economists have turned their attention to the conditions under which <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> would be expected to occur. A model of <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> is provided here which demonstrates that existing experimental approaches fail to explore a potentially important real-world dimension of <b>free</b> <b>riding.</b> In a cash-in-advance economy, <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> becomes a two-stage problem, while existing experiments only address the second stage. That is, one would expect households with high demands for public goods relative to private goods to generate less income than households preferring ordinary private goods, because the former are unable to individually increment the public good and leisure is valuable. Existing experiments start with a given number of “tokens” for each decision-maker, effectively only addressing the second stage of the <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> problem, namely, under what conditions <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> becomes a problem out of a given income. A recommended solution to this problem is to incorporate the potential to generate income prior to (or simultaneously with) the decision of how to allocate that income between private and public goods. decision making, choice behavior, public goods, experimental economics, altruism, fairness, conditional reciprocity...|$|R

40|$|The free-riding problem occurs if the presales {{activities}} {{needed to}} sell a product can be conducted separately from the actual sale of the product. Intuitively, <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> should hurt the retailer that provides that service, but the author shows analytically that <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> benefits not only the free-riding retailer, but also the retailer that provides the service when customers are heterogeneous {{in terms of their}} opportunity costs for shopping. The service-providing retailer has a postservice advantage, because customers who have resolved their matching uncertainty through sales service incur zero marginal shopping cost if they purchase from the service-providing retailer rather than the free-riding retailer. Moreover, allowing <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> gives the <b>free</b> rider less incentive to compete with the service provider on price, because many customers eventually will switch to it due to their own <b>free</b> <b>riding.</b> In turn, this induced soft strategic response enables the service provider to charge a higher price and enjoy the strictly positive profit that otherwise would have been wiped away by head-to-head price competition. Therefore, allowing <b>free</b> <b>riding</b> can be regarded as a necessary mechanism that prevents an aggressive response from another retailer and reduces the intensity of price competition. <b>free</b> <b>riding,</b> sales service, selling cost, channel conflict, retail competition, competitive strategy, game theory...|$|R

25|$|While {{the third}} {{generation}} of tubes were fundamentally {{the same as the}} second generation, they possessed two significant differences. Firstly, they used a GaAs—CsO—AlGaAs photocathode, which is more sensitive in the 800nm-900nm range than second-generation photocathodes. Secondly, the photocathode exhibits negative electron affinity (NEA), which provides photoelectrons that are excited to the conduction band a <b>free</b> <b>ride</b> to the vacuum band as the Cesium Oxide layer {{at the edge of the}} photocathode causes sufficient band-bending. This makes the photocathode very efficient at creating photoelectrons from photons. The Achilles heel of third generation photocathodes, however, is that they are seriously degraded by positive ion poisoning. Due to the high electrostatic field stresses in the tube, and the operation of the MicroChannel Plate, this led to the failure of the photocathode within a short period - as little as 100 hours before photocathode sensitivity dropped below Gen2 levels. To protect the photocathode from positive ions and gases produced by the MCP, they introduced a thin film of sintered aluminium oxide attached to the MCP. The high sensitivity of this photocathode, greater than 900 µA/lm, allows more effective low light response, though this was offset by the thin film, which typically blocked up to 50% of electrons.|$|E
500|$|According to Williams, A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> is a typological {{representative}} of a genre of early pornographic movies that included voyeurism. The film also shows sexual intercourse, fellatio, troilism, and urolagnia. Like the Argentinian film El Satario (c. 1907–15) and the German film Am Abend (c. 1910), A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> begins with simple narrative frames, then shows signs of more conventional cinema for a short period, and finally shows hardcore scenes in a fragmented manner. Author Laurence O'Toole has described early stag films such as A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> as [...] "a muddle of jerky camerawork and slipshod editing". However, like other stag films from the 1910s, this film is of superior quality to the non-commercial pornography which preceded it.|$|E

500|$|Journalist Luke Ford {{writes that}} sex is given {{emphasis}} over story in A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride.</b> The film uses humor in its opening credits through false cast and crew names, such as A.

Williams describes this as [...] "crude humor" [...] and asserts it was common in American stag films produced from this time. Professor Frank A. Hoffman of University at Buffalo writes that the film's production standard indicates {{that there had been}} previous experimentation with stag films.

500|$|A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> {{was shot}} outdoors. According to {{cultural}} historian Joseph W. Slade, {{there is a}} legend that it was shot in New Jersey. Most scholars, including Al Di Lauro, Gerald Rabkin and Jonathon Ross, believe that the film was produced in 1915 and is the earliest surviving American hardcore pornographic film. Los Angeles Times columnist Jay Jones notes A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> {{is believed to be}} the first pornographic film made for commercial purposes. The 1915 production date is disputed by some sources. According to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, the film was made between 1917 and 1919. Film scholar Linda Williams also writes that the assertion that A <b>Free</b> <b>Ride</b> is the earliest surviving American stag film is [...] "doubtful". Kevin Brownlow writes in his book Behind the Mask of Innocence that, [...] "judging by the fashions, the film was actually made around 1923". Thompson says that the evidence presented to support the later production date is shoddy, but notes that some other experts agree with Brownlow's assertion. Evidence cited in support of a 1923 production date includes the similarity of one of the women's hairstyle to that of Mary Pickford, an actress who dominated American film industry during the 1920s. Proponents of the later date claim that the woman wore a Pickford-style wig. However, Thompson indicates that the curly Pickford-style hair became popular in the 1910s, citing a 1914 interview in Photoplay magazine in which Pickford said that she felt exhausted by incoming letters that inquired about her hair. Thompson further disputes the claim that the woman in the film was actually wearing a wig.|$|E
