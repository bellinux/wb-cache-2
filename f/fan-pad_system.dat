40|$|In {{this paper}} {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out in a cascade greenhouse with inner thermal curtain to see the effect of thermal curtain. A thermal model has also been developed to predict the air temperature in a cascade greenhouse. The <b>fan-pad</b> <b>system</b> has been used for evaporative cooling and an inner thermal curtain has been used to divide the greenhouse in two zones. Experiments have been conducted in hot summer conditions at Solar Energy Park, IIT Delhi, New Delhi, India for empty greenhouse. Statistical analysis {{has been carried out}} to validate the agreement of experimental observations with predicted values. The values of the root mean square percent deviation and coefficient of correlation has been found out 9. 0 %, 0. 90; 5. 0 %, 0. 95 and 7. 0 %, 0. 97 for April, May and June in case of evaporative cooling without curtain in greenhouse- 2. The degree of freedom for the experimental work is 10. 0. It is found that the use of evaporative cooling with a thermal curtain reduces the temperature of greenhouse by 5 °C and 8 °C in the second zone of greenhouse- 1 and 2 in comparison to greenhouse without curtain in May...|$|E
40|$|A CFD {{model was}} {{presented}} to simulate the distribution of air velocity and temperature in a greenhouse adopting the <b>fan-pad</b> cooling <b>system</b> in summer. The Boussinesq hypothesis was applied for the simulation of gravitation; the k-ε turbulent model and discrete ordinates model were selected to predict the distribution of air velocity and temperature inside greenhouse using the commercial software Fluent. The differences between simulated and measured air temperature varied from 0. 9 to 4 °C and the differences of air velocity were less than 0. 15 m/s, which proved that the CFD method can estimate the distribution of air velocity and temperature in the greenhouse rationally and effectively. The validated CFD model was then {{used to evaluate the}} cooling effect and design the installment of fan and pad in terms of the crop size. The results implied that Case 3 and Case 5 should be chosen when the height of crop canopy varies from 2 m to 3 m. When it varies from 1 m to 2 m, all the cases can be effective except Case 1. When the canopy height is below 1 m, all the cases can be selected. This paper suggested that the CFD model can be used as an optimal tool for <b>fan-pad</b> evaporative cooling <b>system</b> in the greenhouse...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a <b>fan-pad</b> evaporative cooling <b>system</b> for a photo voltaic powered greenhouse was investigated under extreme summer conditions of Saudi Arabia. Greenhouse air temperature, relative humidity and electricity consumed for cooling were studied in a Quonset greenhouse covered with corrugated fiberglass¬reinforced plastic sheets and producing cucumbers. Clogging pads due to salt buildup reduced the cooling performance and caused the cooling system to operate at forfor longer duration, which causing moreincreased power to be drawn consumption from the photo voltaic system. As a result, the system tripped three times during the summer period of for one to three days. During daytime, the average inside air temperatures with clogged pads was between 30 °C and 51 "C, and the relative humidity was between 8 % and 30 %. This adversely affected plant growth, leading to wilting of plants, especially when accompanied by high solar radiation levels (from 10 : 00 h to 16 : 00 h). Shade reduced the stress on plants, but air temperatures and relative humidity were far from the suitable ranges for good production practice. The average stemperatures with shade ranged from 40 "C to 47. 5 "C, and relative humidity ranged from 8 % to 12 %. Replacing pads clearly improved the greenhouse environment. Air temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouse during daytime ranged from 28 "C to 32 "C, and from 39. 3 % to 44 % respectively. The cooling efficiency for new pads was an average of 71 %, with 8 "C to 17. 3 "C reductions in ambient temperature. Electricity consumption with new pads {{was found to be}} around 22 % less than that with old pads. Results also showed that electricity consumption increased non-linearly as the ambient temperature increased. The cooling system consumed the maximum electrical power (2. 7 kW and 3 kW) at ambient temperature of 37 "C or higher suggesting that the cooling system was in full operation. Shade had only a very minimal effect on the electricity consumption for the greenhouse cooling system...|$|R
