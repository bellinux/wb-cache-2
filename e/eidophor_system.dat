50|$|After leaving academia, Thiemann was {{instrumental}} in industrializing and commercializing Eidophor while working for GRETAG, the successor company to Edgar Gretener AG. The new video projection system was demonstrated in the US. A potential application in cinemas was evaluated. After a lecture explaining the physics underlying the <b>Eidophor</b> <b>system,</b> Robert Oppenheimer offered him a position at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, NJ.|$|E
50|$|When World War II started, the Swiss {{authorities}} asked Gretener {{to develop}} an encryption device for teleprinters. For this purpose the Dr. Edgar Gretener AG was set up as a company in 1943. Gretener got absorbed by this new challenge. As his replacement, Hugo Thiemann continued {{the development of the}} <b>Eidophor</b> <b>system</b> at the ETH. When Fischer died unexpectely in 1947, Thiemann and the Eidophor project were transferred to Gretener's company. It now had two lines of R&D: encryption devices and Eidophor, which still needed development to make it a viable product. Finally, the marketing effort led to first contracts for this new wide-screen video projection system.|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to a robust and efficient projection display uses phase-modulating screens that reduce computer overhead. The first device based on a phase screen for projection display was the <b>Eidophor</b> <b>system,</b> initially developed in the 1940 s. 1 An oil film is deformed by a cathode ray beam to produce the phase profile, while a so-called Schlieren system is used to convert the phase image into an amplitude image. Schlieren optics result in light loss because the light diffracted from the beam path is de-posited on the bars of a mirror bar system. In a more efficient phase structure, light is redirected from the dark to the illumi-nated parts of the image. Today, more complex phase screens than the ones used in the <b>Eidophor</b> <b>system</b> perform this opera-tion. At a meeting with contractors in December 2000, two of us (NC and BC) raised the prospect of using phase-modulatin...|$|E
50|$|Examples of the {{reflective}} LV type are the Digital Micromirror Device (DMD), <b>Eidophor's</b> oil-film based <b>system,</b> and the Grating Light Valve.|$|R
50|$|Between his {{undergraduate}} degree and beginning his graduate studies, {{he worked for}} one year in the Department of Industrial Research at ETH on the <b>Eidophor</b> large-scale display <b>system.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gretener was {{the twelfth}} of 14 siblings. He studied {{electrical}} engineering at Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), {{where he received}} his Ph.D. in 1929. He then became head of development at the Albiswerk factory in Zurich. In 1930, he worked {{as head of the}} telegraph laboratory of Siemens & Halske in Berlin. There he got in contact with Fritz Fischer (physicist), another Swiss engineer, working as a manager at the central research labs of Siemens. When Fritz Fischer got the call to become professor at the ETH Zurich in 1932, he made Gretener his chief assistant a few years later. Fischer invented the <b>Eidophor</b> video projection <b>system.</b> Gretener was in charge of its implementation.|$|R
