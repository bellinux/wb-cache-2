40|$|Abstract Background Growing {{evidence}} in the literature shows that oxytocin (OT) has a strong spinal anti-nociceptive action. Oxytocinergic axons originating from a subpopulation of paraventricular hypothalamic neurons establish synaptic contacts with lamina II interneurons but {{little is known about}} the functional role of OT with respect to neuronal firing and excitability. Results Using the patch-clamp technique, we have recorded lamina II interneurons in acute transverse lumbar spinal cord slices of rats (15 to 30 days old) and analyzed the OT effects on action potential firing ability. In the current clamp mode, we found that bath application of a selective OT-receptor agonist (TGOT) reduced firing in the majority of lamina II interneurons exhibiting a bursting <b>firing</b> <b>profile,</b> but never in those exhibiting a single spike discharge upon depolarization. Interestingly, OT-induced reduction in spike frequency and increase of firing threshold were often observed, leading to a conversion of the <b>firing</b> <b>profile</b> from repetitive and delayed profiles into phasic ones and sometimes further into single spike profile. The observed effects following OT-receptor activation were completely abolished when the OT-receptor agonist was co-applied with a selective OT-receptor antagonist. In current and voltage clamp modes, we show that these changes in firing are strongly controlled by voltage-gated potassium currents. More precisely, transient I A currents and delayed-rectifier currents were reduced in amplitude and transient I A current was predominantly inactivated after OT bath application. Conclusion This effect of OT on the <b>firing</b> <b>profile</b> of lamina II neurons is in good agreement with the antinociceptive and analgesic properties of OT described in vivo. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to compare the ability of several {{mathematical}} models to predict the firing characteristics of muscle spindle primary afferents recorded chronically during normal stepping in cats. Ensemble <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> of nine hamstring spindle primary (presumed group Ia) afferents were compiled from stored data from 132 step cycles. Three sets of profiles corresponding to slow, medium and fast steps were generated by averaging groups of step cycles aligned to peak muscle length in each cycle. Five models obtained from the literature were compared. Each of these models was used to predict the spindle <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> from the averaged muscle length signals. The models were also used in the reverse direction, namely to predict muscle length from the <b>firing</b> <b>profiles.</b> A sixth model incorporating some key aspects of the other models was {{also included in the}} comparisons. Five of the models predicted spindle firing well, with root mean square (r. m. s.) errors lower than 14 % of the modulation depth of the target profiles. The key variable in achieving good predictions was muscle velocity, the best fits being obtained with power-law functions of velocity, with an exponent of 0. 5 or 0. 6 (i. e. spindle firing rate is approximately proportional to the square root of muscle velocity). The fits were slightly improved by adding small components of EMG signal to mimic fusimotor action linked to muscle activation. The modest relative size of EMG-linked fusimotor action {{may be related to the}} fact that hamstring muscles are not strongly recruited in stepping. Length was predicted very accurately from <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> with the inverse of the above models, indicating that the nervous system could in principle process spindle firing in a relatively simple way to give accurate information on muscle length. The responses of the models to standard ramp-and-hold displacements at 10 mm s− 1 were also studied (i. e. velocities that were an order of magnitude lower than that during stepping). In these cases components of spindle primary response related to length as well as velocity were needed for good fits. Because these length-related components detracted from rather than improved predictions of the step cycle data, an attenuation of length dependence at high muscle velocities emerged as a possibility. We conclude that in this study we have identified models and parameters that may be used to predict spindle afferent firing from the time course of muscle length in the cat step cycle...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to collate {{population}} data on the firing characteristics of muscle afferents recorded chronically during normal stepping in cats. Ensemble <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> of forty-seven muscle spindle and tendon organ afferents were compiled from stored data. The relationships between the <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> and the displacement and force signals were analysed with the help of mathematical models of the response characteristics of spindle primary and secondary afferents and tendon organs. Whereas the firing of hamstring spindle afferents could be predicted with reasonable accuracy from the length and velocity signals alone, the <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> of triceps surae spindle afferents deviated from the predicted profiles, particularly during electromyogram (EMG) activity. This indicated that the components of fusimotor action linked to extrafusal muscle activity were significant in triceps surae, possibly because this muscle is more strongly recruited in the cat step cycle. From the limited data available, it was not possible to identify the ‘best’ or most general mathematical function to predict spindle secondary firing. In the two triceps surae spindle secondary units studied, firing was well predicted by using the simplest possible model, rate proportional to displacement, whereas in the hamstring spindle secondary data, a more complex linear transfer function was needed. The results of modelling the spindle secondary data were consistent with a modest amount of phasic, static fusimotor action linked to EMG activity. The averaged ensemble of tendon organ afferent activity from the triceps surae gave predictions of whole-muscle force that agreed well with separate triceps force measurements in normal cat locomotion. This supports the idea that ensembles of tendon organ afferents signal whole-muscle force. Our overall conclusion is that to a first approximation, large muscle afferents in the cat hindlimb signal muscle velocity, muscle length and muscle force, at least in movements of the speed and amplitude seen in locomotion...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was first to study the Wildland-Urban Interface and Wildland-Urban Intermix (WUI) fire problem, and then to design, develop and implement improved fire assessment and fire protection features for structures in the these interface fire-prone areas. The findings included that several areas of the world are prone to devastating fires that claim lives and destroy property, and their fire problems continue to exacerbate. None of these compare to the property loss experienced in Southern California due to its vast development in fire prone areas. It is because of the continuing huge property loss and frequency of major WUI fires that Southern California was selected as the concentration for research and the case studies used in this paper. However, the results of the research are applicable to other interface fire-prone areas in the world. The author is motivated by a need to dramatically improve our ability to effectively deal with what is no longer a fire “threat,” but the reality that people have chosen to live in an area {{of the world in which}} wildland fires are part of natural forest dynamics. To reduce the economic and social impacts of these inevitable fires, we need to understand the causes of fire damage, and establish methods to minimize damage when fires occur. This thesis proposes several fire protection strategies for increased fire resiliency and safety of individuals. Following a search of fire history and analysis, three related fire assessment matrixes were synthesized (see Chapter Five). The <b>Fire</b> <b>Profile</b> Index is the principal fire assessment matrix. It was developed empirically and applied to historical fire spreads for a sense of accuracy. The intended users of the <b>Fire</b> <b>Profile</b> Index are design professionals, public agencies charged with oversight for development in the WUI, insurance agencies, building and landscape contractors, homeowners, potential homeowners, residents and fire service professionals. From the <b>Fire</b> <b>Profile</b> Index two derivative special-use matrixes were established for use by diverse groups. The first of these matrixes, the Developers Guide, is intended for design professionals, public agencies, insurance agencies, and building and landscape contractors. The second matrix is the WUI Fire Assessment Guide, whose intended users are those concerned with development in high fire hazard areas, who should have a fundamental knowledge of fire behavior. This group includes fire agencies, developers, homeowners, potential homeowners and insurance companies.

We brought together technologies from the packaging, silicon and ceramics industries to develop a photolithographic technique for LTCC tapes. To that end, it was necessary to investigate and define an appropriate heat preprocess that we called partially sintering. Jet Vapor Etching is another patterning technique developed during this research effort. It has the advantage of being more directional than wet etching and therefore vias with high aspect ratio can be patterned. A jet of atomized solvent impinges {{on the surface of the}} LTCC tape dissolving the organic binder of the tape and mechanically removing the alumina and glass grains. When the vertical dimension is introduced, sagging problems appear; however, we solved these problems by using sacrificial materials and the appropriate atmosphere and <b>firing</b> <b>profile.</b> We also experimentally found the processing parameters for the photoformables LTCC tapes and showed that the diffusion model is a good candidate to model transport of light in the ceramic.

Multiple mechanisms {{are involved in}} switching between cortical states including various neuromodulatory systems. Locus Coeruleus (LC) {{is one of the}} major neuromodulatory nuclei in the brainstem with widespread projections throughout the brain and modulates the activity of cells and networks. Here, we quantified the link between the LC spontaneous activity, cortical state and sensory processing in the rat vibrissal somatosensory barrel cortex (BC). We simultaneously recorded unit activity from LC and BC along with prefrontal EEG while presenting brief whisker deflections under urethane anesthesia. The ratio of low to high frequency components of EEG (referred to as the L/H ratio) was employed to identify cortical state. We found that the spontaneous activity of LC units exhibited a negative correlation with the L/H ratio. Cross-correlation analysis revealed that changes in LC firing preceded changes in the cortical state: the correlation of the LC <b>firing</b> <b>profile</b> with the L/H ratio was maximal at an average lag of - 1. 2 s. We further quantified BC neuronal responses to whisker stimulation during the synchronized and desynchronized states. In the desynchronized state, BC neurons showed lower stimulus detection threshold, higher response fidelity, and shorter response latency. The most prominent change was observed in the late phase of BC evoked activity (100 - 400 ms post stimulus onset) : almost every BC unit exhibited a greater late response during the desynchronized state. Categorization of the BC evoked responses based on LC activity (into high and low LC discharge rates) resulted in highly similar response profiles compared to categorization based on the cortical state (low and high L/H ratios). These findings provide evidence for the involvement of the LC neuromodulatory system in desynchronization of cortical state and the consequent enhancement of sensory coding efficiency...|$|E

Recent work in Aβ-overexpressing transgenic mice indicates that elevated brain Aβ levels {{can be associated with}} aberrant epileptiform activity. In line with this, such mice can also exhibit altered intrinsic excitability (IE) of cortical and hippocampal neurons: these observations may relate to the increased prevalence of seizures in AD patients. In this study we examined what changes in IE are produced in hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal cells following 2 - 5 hours treatment with an oligomeric preparation of synthetic human Aβ 1 - 42 peptide. Whole cell current clamp recordings were compared between Aβ-(500 nM) and vehicle-(DMSO 0. 05 %) treated hippocampal slices obtained from mice. The soluble Aβ treatment did not produce alterations in sub-threshold intrinsic properties including membrane potential, input resistance and hyperpolarization activated "sag". Similarly, no changes were noted in the <b>firing</b> <b>profile</b> evoked by 500 ms square current supra-threshold stimuli. However, Aβ 500 nM treatment resulted in the hyperpolarization of the action potential (AP) threshold. In addition, treatment with Aβ at 500 nM depressed the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) that followed both a 1 single AP or 50 Hz trains of between 5 and 25 APs. These data suggest that acute exposure to soluble Aβ oligomers affects IE properties of CA 1 pyramidal neurons differently from outcomes seen in transgenic models of amyloidopathy. However, in both chronic and acute models the IE changes are towards hyper-excitability, reinforcing the idea that amyloidopathy and increased incidence in seizures might be causally related in AD patients.

We sinusoidally modulated (4 Hz) the pulse rate of random background stimulation (RBS) and found that cultures were more active, burst less frequently, and expressed oscillatory activity. Next, we studied the effect of phase-locked tetani (four pulses, 200 s− 1) on network activity. Tetani were applied to one electrode at the peak or trough of mRBS stimulation. We found that when tetani were applied {{at the peak of}} modulated RBS (mRBS), a significant potentiation of poststimulus histograms (PSTHs) occurred. Conversely, tetani applied at the trough resulted in a small but insignificant depression of PSTHs. In addition to PSTHs, electrode-specific <b>firing</b> rate <b>profiles</b> within spontaneous bursts before and after mRBS were analyzed.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{analyzes}} the {{spatial distribution of}} 881 forest fires recorded during four recent years (2009 - 2012) in 59 municipalities of a Mediterranean region (Attica, Greece) characterized by high fire risk and relevant human pressure due to uneven urban expansion. The hypothesis that a defined <b>fire</b> <b>profile</b> (in terms of density, severity and land-use selectivity) at the local scale was associated to {{a specific set of}} socioeconomic and territorial variables, was tested explicitly using six fires' indicators and eight contextual indicators under a multivariate analysis framework. Analysis identified two main dimensions for both forest fires (dimension and selectivity) and the socioeconomic context (demographic variables associated to the urban-rural gradient and average income). Fire density and forest/pastures burnt areas did not correlated to any socioeconomic variable. At the same time, average declared income and elevation of each municipality did not correlated to any fires' variable. To the contrary, the average fire size, the percentage of burnt area per municipality and the proportion of cropland affected by fires correlated positively with the distance from the inner city and the total surface area of each municipality and negatively with the proportion of compact settlements, population density and growth. These results confirm the impact of the urban-to-rural gradient in the spatial distribution of forest fires in Attica while pointing out the negligible influence of variables such as the socioeconomic status of resident populatio...|$|R
40|$|Typically, {{hermetic}} feedthroughs for implantable devices, such as pacemakers, use a alumina ceramic insulator brazed to a {{platinum wire}} pin. This combination of material {{has a long}} history in implantable devices and has been approved by the FDA for implantable hermetic feedthroughs. The growing demand for increased input/output (I/O) hermetic feedthroughs for implantable neural stimulator applications could be addressed by developing a new, cofired platinum/alumina multilayer ceramic technology in a configuration that supports 300 plus I/Os, which is not commercially available. ^ Seven platinum powders with different particle sizes were used to develop different conductive cofire inks to control the densification mismatch between platinum and alumina. <b>Firing</b> <b>profile</b> (ramp rate, burn- out and holding times) and firing atmosphere and concentrations (hydrogen (wet/dry), air, neutral, vacuum) were also optimized. Platinum and alumina exhibit the alloy formation reaction in a reduced atmosphere. Formation of any compound can increase the bonding of the metal/ceramic interface, resulting in enhanced hermeticity. The feedthrough fabricated in a reduced atmosphere demonstrated significantly superior performance than that of other atmospheres. A composite structure of tungsten/platinum ratios graded thru the via structure (pure W, 50 / 50 W/Pt, 80 / 20 Pt/W and pure Pt) exhibited the best performance in comparison to the performance of other materials used for ink metallization. ^ Studies on the high temperature reaction of platinum and alumina, previously unreported, showed that, at low temperatures in reduced atmosphere, Pt 3 Al or Pt 8 Al 21 with a tetragonal structure would be formed. Cubic Pt 3 Al is formed upon heating the sample to temperatures above 1350 °C. This cubic structure is the equilibrium state of Pt-Al alloy at high temperatures. The alumina dissolves into the platinum ink and is redeposited as a surface coating. This was observed on both cofired samples and pure platinum thin films coated on a 99. 6 Wt% alumina and fired at 1550 °C. Different mechanisms are proposed to describe this behavior based {{on the size of the}} platinum particle...|$|E
40|$|During {{postnatal}} development, {{profound changes}} {{take place in}} the excitability of nerve cells, including modification in the distribution and properties of receptor-operated channels and changes in the density and nature of voltage-gated channels. We studied here the firing properties of abducens motoneurons (aMns) in transverse brainstem slices from postnatal day (P) 1 – 13 rats. Recordings were made from aMNs in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Two main types of aMn could be distinguished according to their <b>firing</b> <b>profile</b> during prolonged depolarizations. Both types were identified as aMns by their fluorescence following retrograde labelling with the lipophilic carbocyanine DiI in the rectus lateralis muscle. The first type (BaMns) exhibited a burst of action potentials (APs) followed by an adaptation of discharge and were encountered in ∼ 70 % of aMns. Their discharge profile resembled that of adult aMns and was encountered in all aMns after P 9. BaMns exhibited a hyperpolarization-induced rebound potential that was blocked by low concentrations of Ni 2 + or by Ca 2 +-free external solution. This current had the properties of the T-type current. Action potentials of BaMns showed a complex afterhyperpolarization (AHP). An inward rectification was evidenced following hyperpolarization and was blocked by external application of caesium or ZD 7288, indicating the presence of the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (IH). Blocking the IH current almost doubled the input resistance of BaMns. The second class of aMns (DaMns) displayed a delayed excitation that was mediated by A-type K+ currents and was observed only between P 4 and P 9. DaMns exhibited immature characteristics: an action potential with a simple AHP, a linear current-voltage relation and a large input resistance. The number of aMns remained unchanged when both types were present (P 5 –P 6) and later in development when only BaMns were encountered (P 19), suggesting that DaMns mature into BaMns during postnatal development. We conclude that aMns display profound reorganization in their intrinsic excitability during postnatal development...|$|E
40|$|A report {{discusses}} a cryogenic {{reaction control}} system (RCS) that integrates a Joule-Thompson (JT) device (expansion valve) and thermodynamic vent system (TVS) with a cryogenic distribution system to allow fine {{control of the}} propellant quality (subcooled liquid) during operation of the device. It enables zero-venting when coupled with an RCS engine. The proper attachment locations and sizing of the orifice are required with the propellant distribution line to facilitate line conditioning. During operations, system instrumentation was strategically installed along the distribution/TVS line assembly, and temperature control bands were identified. A sub-scale run tank, full-scale distribution line, open-loop TVS, and a combination of procured and custom-fabricated cryogenic components {{were used in the}} cryogenic RCS build-up. Simulated on-orbit activation and thruster <b>firing</b> <b>profiles</b> were performed to quantify system heat gain and evaluate the TVS s capability to maintain the required propellant conditions at the inlet to the engine valves. Test data determined that a small control valve, such as a piezoelectric, is optimal to provide continuously the required thermal control. The data obtained from testing has also assisted with the development of fluid and thermal models of an RCS to refine integrated cryogenic propulsion system designs. This system allows a liquid oxygenbased main propulsion and reaction control system for a spacecraft, which improves performance, safety, and cost over conventional hypergolic systems due to higher performance, use of nontoxic propellants, potential for integration with life support and power subsystems, and compatibility with in-situ produced propellants...|$|R

30|$|From the {{beginning}} of the report several high <b>profile</b> <b>fires</b> with adverse environmental effects were described. For those fires, some information was able to be tracked down, but it was surprising how difficult it was. For most other fires, where concern for the environment was not considered there is little information. A reporting mechanism for fire departments to provide any feedback regarding the risk management of the fire during the event should be explored.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} connections in fire is {{largely based on}} material strength degradation and the interactions between the various components of the connection. In order to predict connection performance in <b>fire,</b> temperature <b>profiles</b> must initially be established in order to evaluate the material strength degradation over time. This paper examines two current methods for predicting connection temperatures: The percentage method, where connection temperatures are calculated {{as a percentage of}} the adjacent beam lower-flange, mid-span temperatures; and the lumped capacitance method, based on the lumped mass of the connection. Results from the percentage method do not correlate well with experimental results, whereas the lumped capacitance method shows much better agreement with average connection temperatures. A 3 D finite element heat transfer model was also created in Abaqus, and showed good correlation with experimental results. ...|$|R
