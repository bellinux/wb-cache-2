5|$|Upon {{striking}} the Philippines, the typhoon produced high winds and heavy rainfall to Luzon. Noul knocked down trees and damaged houses, resulting in power outages to seven communities; the power was restored within one day. The storm's rains were beneficial to local farmers after an extended <b>dry</b> <b>spell.</b> In Santa Ana where the storm moved ashore, the storm caused minor damage to seven schools. Across Cagayan, the storm damaged ₱2.7million (US$60,000) worth {{of corn and}} rice crops, as well as minor damage to fisheries. There was minor infrastructure damage in neighboring Ilocos Norte. Overall, Noul caused ₱16.3million (US$362,000) in damage.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>spells</b> on the Romanian Black Sea coast. The {{main goal}} {{of this paper was}} to {{identify}} and analyse the <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> in the <b>driest</b> region in Romania: the Black Sea coast. Daily precipitation data sets from 3 weather stations (Constanta, Sulina and Tulcea) for a period of 49 years were used. A dedicated software was employed to identify <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> and to calculate their main parameters. Then, Mann-Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimation were used to detect trends in those parameters. Two of the three weather stations (Constanta and Tulcea) show a similar behaviour with higher numbers of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> and lower duration values. Sulina shows different results: the lowest number of <b>dry</b> <b>spells,</b> the highest values of cumulated and average duration and the multi-annual maximum duration of <b>dry</b> <b>spells.</b> The Tulcea inland station has the highest number of <b>dry</b> <b>spells.</b> Duration parameters at Constanta follow those identified at Sulina. All <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> parameters show statistically significant trends for Sulina data sets: decreasing in the annual number of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> and increasing in all duration-related parameters. The short and very short <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> are most frequent in the area, while considering multi-annual cumulated duration; very short, short and medium <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> have similar frequency values (24 - 30 %). Long and very long <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> have the highest frequency both as case number and for cumulated duration at Sulina...|$|R
40|$|A {{deficit in}} {{precipitation}} may impact greatly on soil moisture, snowpack, stream flow, groundwater, and reservoir storage. Among the several approaches available to analyze this phenomenon, {{one of the}} most applied is the analysis of <b>dry</b> <b>spells.</b> In this paper, an investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of <b>dry</b> <b>spells,</b> in a region of southern Italy, has been carried out on a daily precipitation dataset. First, the frequency distributions of the sequences of dry days have been analyzed. Then, the regional areas most affected by dry events have been evaluated at annual and seasonal scale. Finally, the long-term trend of the <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> has been estimated at annual and seasonal scale. Results show that the lower probabilities of long <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> occur in the main reliefs of the region, while the highest values have been detected in the Ionian side. The spatial distribution of the mean and maximum length values of the <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> evidenced a west–east gradient. The trend analysis mainly revealed a negative behavior in the duration of the <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> at annual scale and a positive trend in the winter period...|$|R
40|$|This is {{an attempt}} to measure the {{frequency}} of summer <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> over the Canadian Prairies and to discover their possible causes. Statistical and synoptic climatological techniques are used as tools in the analysis and discussion of the occurrence and causes of <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> and, in addition, make possible the delineation of areas characterized by low or high frequency of <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells.</b> The analysis reveals a higher frequency of <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> and a greater variability of precipitation in the summer months in a zone extending along the Saskatchewan-Alberta boundary. A very significant factor related to <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> is the position of an upper level stationary or quasi-stationary ridge (north-south axis) over the Prairies. The position of the upper level ridge affects the dry conditions in two ways: firstly, because of the blocking action, the upper level ridge dislocates the jet stream, tracks of cyclones and associated moist air masses, so that they lie north of the Prairies; secondly, the anticyclonic circulation under this ridge of high pressure induces divergence and subsidence of air accompanied by inversion of temperature at lower levels. Other significant factors which contribute to <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> are associated with surface synoptic conditions. These latter include: an apparent eastward migration of high and low pressure systems (Aleutian Low, North Pacific High, Hudson Bay Low and North Atlantic High); and the position of the migratory anticyclones over the southern and southeastern Prairies. The dry mPs air mass originating from the Pacific inversion layer also has some influence on the occurrence of <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells.</b> The upper level and surface atmospheric flow patterns (i. e., from surface to 500 millibar levels) are classified into five synoptic Weather Types and is demonstrated that Weather Type WA (ridge dominant over British Columbia), Weather Type WB (ridge dominant over central Prairies) and Weather Type We (ridge dominant over eastern Prairies) correlate with a high probability of dry conditions over the Prairies. When the preceding flow patterns are persistent with a quasi-stationary upper level ridge (north-south axis) over the Prairies, <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> occur. These synoptic and dynamic atmospheric conditions are summarized in three models explaining possible relationships pertaining to the probability of dry conditions and <b>Dry</b> <b>Spells</b> over the Prairies...|$|R
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a <b>dry</b> <b>spell,</b> damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough to tear down metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E
5|$|While Nicole was intensifying offshore, {{its outer}} bands {{produced}} heavy downpours over drought-stricken Cuba. Rain quantities were particularly high along the southeastern coast; a 48-hour total of 9.22inches (235mm) fell at Cape Cruz, in the mountainous Granma Province. The region also briefly observed gale-force winds, with gusts to 53mph (85km/h) at Guantánamo Bay. Throughout eastern Cuba, nearly 300people sought {{refuge from the}} storm. As the rivers in Granma overflowed, eighthouses collapsed and more than 300others were inundated in the coastal town of Pilón. The flooding obstructed several roads, with sections of the highway between Granma and Santiago de Cuba destroyed. The storm resulted in 5,000lbs (2.5tons) of lost crops and livestock. These effects were nevertheless considered to be minor when viewed against the alleviation of a persistent <b>dry</b> <b>spell</b> provided by the rains.|$|E
5|$|With Malmö FF back in Allsvenskan {{from the}} start of the 1936–37 season, the club once more {{employed}} a manager: Václav Simon from Czechoslovakia became the club's first foreign-born manager. After Simon coached the team for a year, he was replaced by Harry Lundahl, who remained until 1941. Carl Ahlberg coached the team from 1942 to 1944. Following his initial tenure between April and November 1944, Sven Nilsson managed the club for two more periods during that decade. During this time he became the club's first Allsvenskan title winning manager, when the team won the league championship at the end of the 1943–44 season. Two Hungarian managers, István Wampetits and Kálmán Konrád, managed Malmö FF between Nilsson's periods in charge. Konrád secured the club's second league title during the 1948–49 season. The team won its third league title in 1950, with Nilsson in charge. Malmö FF continued to be successful during the 1950s: Welshman Bert Turner managed Malmö FF between 1951 and 1954, and led the club to two league championships and two cup titles during this time. He was replaced in 1955 by another foreign-born manager, Austrian Pepi Stroh. Neither Stroh or his successor, former Malmö FF player Nils-Åke Sandell, won any honours. This <b>dry</b> <b>spell</b> ended following the appointment in 1964 of Spaniard Antonio Durán, who coached the club until 1971. During this time Malmö FF won Allsvenskan four times, lifted the cup in 1967, and entered European competitions with limited success.|$|E

40|$|Recurring {{droughts}} {{and decreased}} agricultural productivity {{during the last}} two decades in West Africa point to the need for a clearer understanding of the length of <b>dry</b> <b>spells,</b> their frequencies and their probabilities. The simplest calculations of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> for general applications involve computation of the probabilities of maximum and conditional <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> exceeding a user-specified threshold value from a given calendar date. For more precise applications in agriculture, {{it is important to consider}} the different periods after sowing a crop, since sowing dates in the semiarid West African regions vary from year to year. Using the specific definition of onset of rains in each year as the sowing date, the length of dry cells was calculated from the historical rainfall data. Probability distribution of time to the next wet day and the percentage frequencies of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> were computed for successive days after sowing (DAS) a crop. Dry-spell analysis showed a pronounced drop in the drought risk for cereal crops from the panicle initiation phase (20 DAS) to the following phase (60 DAS). The relationships between mean annual rainfall and average frequency of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> for the selected locations in West Africa showed distinct patterns and permit the prediction of the frequency of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> from annual rainfall totals. Applications of the dry-spell analysis for the choice of a crop/variety, supplements irrigation, and crop water requirements have been described with examples...|$|R
40|$|Climate is {{the major}} factor {{affecting}} crop production; therefore, various agro-meteorological indicators have been frequently {{used to evaluate the}} impact of climate on crop production. In this study, we examined the temporal variations of agrometeorological indicators (growing degree days, total precipitation, <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> and drought indices) during 1960 - 2014 and their impact on soybean yields in East Arkansas. Results show an increasing trend in growing degree days (GDDs) and <b>dry</b> <b>spells,</b> though the total precipitation during the soybean growing season remained nearly unchanged during the study period. Generally, GDDs and <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> show a strong correlation with yields. We also evaluated drought variability based on different drought indices, including the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The drought indices are all negatively correlated to soybean yields. Overall, the one month SPEI showed the strongest impact on yields. After regression analysis, <b>Dry</b> <b>spells</b> and Total precipitation were the only significant factors in the General Linear Model (GLM) ...|$|R

40|$|Durations of monthly {{precipitation}} wet and <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> {{are calculated}} using historical records and regional climate model (RCM) simulations for the Wadi Al-Lith basin in western Saudi Arabia. The characteristics of durations of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> {{are based on}} the 50 % risk level corresponding to the monthly records for average regional precipitation. The duration of wet spells in the model data is compared with observations for the base period 1971 – 2000. The impact of climate change on the durations of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> is obtained using three global climate models projections with RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5 scenarios downscaled by RCM. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the climate model scenarios and the precipitation records for the base period prove that climate change has a clear impact on the durations of wet and <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> over the study area. There is an increase in wet spells frequency in the far future (2070 – 2099) compared to the near future (2020 – 2049). The increase in wet spells can be partly explained by the increase in extreme rainfall events and by the decrease in <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> expected to occur over the study area towards the end of 21 st century...|$|R
40|$|The {{rainfall}} {{in southern}} Africa {{has a large}} inter-annual variability, which can cause rain-fed agriculture to fail. The staple crop maize is especially sensitive to <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> during the early growing season. An early prediction of the probability of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> and below normal precipitation can potentially mitigate damages through water management. This paper investigates how well ECMWF's seasonal forecasts predict <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> over the Limpopo basin {{during the rainy season}} December–February (DJF) with lead times from 0 to 4 months. The seasonal forecasts were evaluated against ERA-Interim reanalysis data, which in turn were corrected with GPCP (EGPCP) to match monthly precipitation totals. The seasonal forecasts were also bias-corrected with the EGPCP using quantile mapping as well as post-processed using a precipitation threshold to define a dry day. The results indicate that the forecasts show skill in predicting <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> in comparison with a climatological ensemble based on previous years. Quantile mapping in combination with a precipitation threshold improved the skill of the forecast. The skill in prediction of <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> was largest over the most drought-sensitive region. Seasonal forecasts have the potential to be used in a probabilistic forecast system for drought-sensitive crops, though these should be used with caution given the large uncertainties...|$|R

(2009) indicated that some incidences of increase in termite attack on people’s assets {{have been associated with}} climate change-induced <b>dry</b> <b>spells.</b> Prolonged <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> was also considered the major driver to increased wildfires which affect forests and grasslands. Wildfires were reported (Table  4) to be a serious threat in Njage village forest {{as well as in the}} grasslands in Miwangani and Mpofu village. For example, it was reported that Iyondo Forest Reserved has been much susceptible to wildfires especially in dry seasons (Table  4). Livestock (mainly cattle and poultry) were reported to be vulnerable to both prolonged <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> and flooding, due to scarcity of pastures and feeds. Similar observations were noted by the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC 2007) where extended warm periods and increased droughts led to increase in water stress in forests and grasslands and increased frequency and intensity of wildfires. According to Khandlhela and May (2006), poor quality of pastures due to floods and <b>dry</b> <b>spells</b> increased vulnerability of cattle and goats to pests and diseases, causing deaths in Limpopo Province, South Africa.|$|R
