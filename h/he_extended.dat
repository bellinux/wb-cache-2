5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. <b>He</b> <b>extended</b> this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1907, Baden-Powell went on an {{extensive}} speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his forthcoming book, Scouting for Boys.

He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which <b>he</b> <b>extended</b> the attractive game to a personal mental education.|$|E

5|$|Kepler {{began by}} {{exploring}} regular polygons and regular solids, including the figures {{that would come}} to be known as Kepler's solids. From there, <b>he</b> <b>extended</b> his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between orbital velocity and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.|$|E
