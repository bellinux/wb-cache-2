40|$|Local governments often set up inter-municipal consortia {{to provide}} public {{services}} jointly, rather than individually. The main benefits of joint provision include {{the potential for}} improved cost-effectiveness arising from gains from economies of scale and the <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> and/or benefits of provision, which could otherwise spill over inter-municipal borders and discourage provision. To shed further light on this issue, this paper tests {{for the presence of}} scale and spillover effects in local government provision and estimates the determinants of the probability of local government participation in inter-municipal consortia in Brazil and Spain. Empirical evidence suggests that in some cases smaller jurisdictions operate at sub-optimal scale and are indeed more likely than their larger counterparts to participate in inter-municipal consortia. In the case of Brazil, governance arrangements between the municipalities and the state governments and/or private-sector providers, but not the federal government, are also associated with a higher probability of participation in inter-municipal consortia, suggesting the presence of “participation spillovers” among governance arrangements...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the capacity of}} current demand side policies to change unsustainable consumption patterns, with a special focus on the market-based tools used to develop 'informed choice' by consumers. It is argued that the trend to increased private consumption in industrialised countries is undermining eco-efficiency gains on the supply side. A widening gap between consumer attitudes and actions has led to weaker demand for environmentally responsible products. It is argued that mainstream consumers are reluctant to change behaviour due to complex internal and external inhibitors. The ability to make informed choices is particularly restricted by poor access to, understanding of and utilisation of environmental product information. Both the barriers and success factors in transforming the market towards sustainable consumption are clarified by analysing trends in Norway, with particular emphasis on 'clean, green food'. The roles of actors {{in the flow of}} environmental information along the product chain are analysed to test the assumptions behind 'informed choice'. Evidence from the Norwegian situation confirms that current marketing and eco-labelling are failing to overcome two crucial barriers needed to change the market: <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> in prices and internalisation of responsibility by all actors, especially end consumers. The solution is sharper, knowledge-based tools that support 'seamless learning' along the product chain. Both government and business need to invest in conditions that build the competency of mainstream consumers. The lessons learned from Norway suggest contradictions and paradoxes in pursuing 'informed choice'. The thesis concludes that without adequate monitoring and balanced investment, 'informed choice' is likely to fail and thus jeopardise the demand side of sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Prepared for {{presentation}} at the Congress of the International Institute of Public Finance (IIPF) in Seville, Spain, 28 – 31 August 2000, for the session on the opportunity-equalising effects of fiscal systems. University education is nowadays provided as public goods in the Czech Republic. Due to economic pressure on public finance the trend of the 90 s became the <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> associated with university education. The generally accepted hypothesis is that nowadays the returns from the costs of university education are achieved in a shorter time than before economic transition. Additionally, {{it is thought that}} the return on university education is differentiated by professions. We aim to test these hypotheses. That is why the cornerstone of our study is the deeper analysis of the differentiation of selected professions in the current state in comparison to the period before transition. After 1989, due to the economic transition and development of the market economy, wage differentiation accelerated in the Czech Republic. An important factor in differentiation seems to be the level of human capital, represented above all by university education. Education significantly increased the chance of finding a job, as another analysis has proven. However, these positive effects of education have been paid for by considerable monetary and non-monetary costs. The paper provides an economic analysis at the level of an individual and his point of return between costs and revenues from university education. To achieve an exact but still simple analysis we take into account only quantifiable monetary costs and revenues. The calculation of the point of return is done {{with the use of the}} construction of a cumulated whole-life income and its interpolation. The analysis uses data for the Czech Republic in 1988 and 1997.

40|$|To {{improve the}} actual urban water system in la Vall de Boí {{in order to}} achieve a more {{sustainable}} model. By analysing a selected material and energy flows as well as a selected environmental impacts associated with the metabolism of the urban water system, a study of the current sustainability level will be done with a MFA-LCA approach. Then, certain interventions based on sustainable development will be studied and compared with specific KPIs for each intervention and in relation with the current situation. The upcoming sustainability challenges in the urban water systems are driving management and planning focus towards sustainability in a more holistic and integrated view. In this work, the Dynamic Metabolism Model (DMM), based on the LCA and MFA approach, has been used to analyse the inputs and outputs from the urban water system (UWS) metabolism to give sustainability assessment. It constitutes the first step to achieve a full <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> of the UWS. This model has been carried out in a real case study in the Vall de Boí, Pyrenees, Spain. The present analysis, as well as future interventions and scenarios, are developed after consulting stakeholders involved. The impact assessment has shown that the greatest impact is the in-house and the WWTPs energy demand, so the interventions have been designed to overcome them reducing them, designing green infrastructure and using ICTs to improve the efficiency of the current assets. In this work, an integral solution has been also designed modelling water policies to understand their impacts on the UWS thanks to specific calculated KPIs. The DMM has been demonstrated as a powerful tool to comprehensively understand the impacts of specific interventions strategies that can usefully help stakeholders into the decision-making process.

40|$|Problem: A {{strategic}} {{issue is}} to consider future threats and changes that can generate new or higher costs for the company. A strategic operational issue could be to consider if there are costs today that the company {{are not aware of}} the size of, because costs are hidden in overhead accounts or in accounts not expected and not accounted for in a structured way. If costs are made visible they can be managed with cost savings and other benefits resulting. Regarding environmental costs, future <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> for external effects is expected through increasing governmental and consumer pressure. Costs associated with environment as for example costs for electricity, like the electricity bill when recorded and periodized, are also likely to accumulate in overhead accounts. What research exists today that includes environmental management or environmental accounting within management accounting or financial accounting that could support decision making in companies towards better environmental performance? How could this eventual knowledge support decision making in companies towards better environmental performance today? Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to search for results from eventual research that include environmental management or environmental accounting within management accounting or financial accounting that could support decision making in companies towards better environmental performance. Research results found, according to the purpose, will be reviewed. Approach/Method: Review of articles in academic journals. Findings: A UN promoted Environmental Management Accounting (EMA) methodology was found that uses an environmental cost assessment scheme that gathers environmental costs in a structured way for decision making. The method reveals that existing, regulated, corporate environmental costs today could be twice as high as the environmental costs companies disclose in their annual reports. This gives potentials for large cost savings for, and strategy reconsiderations in, companies. The largest cost category often turns out to be, according to the EMA method: Material purchase value of non product output. Conclusion: Environmental Management Accounting, EMA, can likely support decision making in companies towards better environmental performance today, through structured cost assessment that support effective decision making, better environmental performance, more effective and future-proofed product mixes, strategies and investments.

In this context, its aim is to quantify the external <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gases (specifically carbon dioxide) generated during electricity production in the thermal power plants in Greece and to estimate the impact on the electricity production cost and on the electricity prices <b>of</b> a possible <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> this external <b>cost</b> by the producers. For this purpose, this paper applies the EcoSenseLE online tool to quantify the examined externalities. This research finds that the calculated external cost is significantly high (compared to the corresponding production cost) mainly in lignite-fired power plants. Specifically, a possible <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> this external <b>cost</b> would increase the production cost by more than 52 % (on average), which, in turn, would affect similarly the electricity prices.

40|$|The Resource Management Act 1991 {{represents}} a significant {{shift away from}} the direction and control approach of the Town and Country Planning Act 1977 towards an effects-based, outcome-orientated, integrated approach with one single substantive purpose "to promote the sustainable management of natural and physical resources. " • S 5 (2) (c), or the duty to 'avoid, remedy, or mitigate adverse effects on the environment' (ARM) 'escaped' much of the theoretical debate in the Resource Management Law Reform process (RMLR) as it was included within the definition of 'sustainable management' late in the reform process. This has meant {{that there has been}} little debate and direction on application and interpretation of s 5 (2) (c) or the concept of ARM. • In examining its application and interpretation, ARM makes more sense interpreted in a two-level hierarchy with a balancing approach between 'remedy' and 'mitigate'. Under this proposition, 'avoid' requires adverse effects to be escaped or evaded 'Remedy' is something that is done after the damage has been caused, requiring adverse effects to be rectified, or corrected. 'Mitigate' involves something ongoing and requires adverse effects to be reduced in severity, or moderated. The way the Act reads, application of anyone of these is sufficient to achieve the purpose of the Act. • ARM contains several implications for sustainable management. Firstly, ARM provides a simplified, standardised and integrated effects-based approach allowing the community, or the resource users, to have more control over the direction of their well-being; secondly, ARM allows for the <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> to those that benefit from the resource use; thirdly, through the definition of 'environment', S 5 (2) (c) has an inherent balancing function where both the biophysical and the human aspects are considered concurrently; and fourthly, the tangible and encompassing nature of s 5 (2) (c) means that {{it has the potential to}} include s 5 (2) (a) and s 5 (2) (b) and even to act as a surrogate ethic for the Act. • Because of these implications, ARM is extremely important for the functioning of the Act. Anything that compromises ARM therefore will compromise the achievement of sustainable management. ARM relies heavily on effects assessment. Problems with this process include interpretational concerns over what constitutes an adverse effect, and institutional concerns such as information gathering and costs, the importance of the Assessment of Environmental Effects, the skills of resource consents officers, monitoring and enforcement, policy statements and plans and condition setting - fortunately there has been much guidance provided on these matters. • What has not been addressed by ARM is the problem of cumulative effects arising from many un-ARMed minor adverse effects. Mitigation banking is an approach that can deal with this problem by allowing many small effects to be dealt with in one go. The offsetting benefits are provided for before consent for the resource use is given. • ARM is a critical provision within section 5 and the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA). It is a key means through which sustainability under the Act will be achieved. Those who work with natural and physical resources need to recognise this...|$|E
40|$|Focusing on {{greening}} {{of electricity}} industry (GEI), this report explores the positions and outlook of various units within the EU system with mandates in the greening of electricity industry process. The study takes a knowledge-based perspective on administrative decision-making, where administrative units {{are seen as}} carriers of cognitive models and as specialized competency networks. Embedded in the EU’s administrative management of GEI, the study finds positions that {{can be referred to}} as four underlying conceptual models: 1) The market efficiency model, which is typically found in units handling internal market policy, competition policy and de-regulation policy of the EU. The core focus of this model is on efficient allocation of economic resources between alternative deployments in an economy where both economic resources and technologies are given and scarce. 2) The innovation/exploration model, which relates to the innovation policy dimension of GEI. Environmental reorientation of the energy system is here seen as a question not only of efficiency, but also of technological change. The core focus of this model is new industrial development and growth as a function of innovation. 3) The eco-efficiency model, which relates specifically to the environmental policy dimension of GEI. The greening challenge is here transformed into economic incentives. The core focus of this model is on <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> of environmental damage and negative external effects into the business model and into the regulatory market design. 4) As a major input factor in the economy GEI also raises important industrial policy concerns. The core focus of the industrial policy model is on building up and maintaining industrial capabilities within the territorial domain in focus, in this case the EU. The final part of the report develops an outlook on future European GEI policy, drawing on each of the perspectives and relating the policy alternatives also to the interests of the European Parliament and member countries. It is argued that the market efficiency model, with its eco-efficiency extension, is hard to defend politically when seen {{from the perspective of the}} EU Parliament or when related to the distributive interests of member countries. In comparison, the innovation/exploration approach has many strong sides as far as EU policy-making is concerned. With a niche market strategy, and/or project based financing, the innovation perspective creates the possibility for partnerships rather than confrontation with existing member state and industrial interests. The flexible tools in the innovation approach also allow for tradeoffs between different fractions in Parliamentary decision-making. A disputed weakness of the innovation model, if applied as a dominant strategy for greening of electricity, however, is its debateable efficiency and high costs. The outlook on greening of electricity industry coming out of the industrial policy model is ambiguous in so far as this model can be applied at different levels - from the individual nation state to the EU level. With a dominant focus on low input energy prices as part of a European industrial competitiveness strategy, this model has a credibility problem as far as GEI is concerned. While in a static perspective the policy outlooks derived from the different cognitive frameworks may conflict, a dynamic perspective could show them to be more complementary. As a final point, the report notes that irrespective of the production side solution to GEI in Europe, European energy policy is conspicuously under-developed when it comes to initiatives to reduce energy consumption...|$|E

Estimation <b>of</b> <b>costs</b> such as those of pollution and congestion is a primary element in any strategy involving policies for use in the <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> these <b>costs.</b> The objective <b>of</b> the TRENEN II STRAN project, funded by the EU, was to develop a methodology for estimation of the marginal external <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> transport. The model developed during the project was used in a series of case studies. One of the case studies, that conducted for Dublin, is reported in this paper. A brief summary of the TRENEN approach is presented followed by the results for Dublin produced from policies such as Do Nothing, Uniform pricing (internalising external <b>costs</b> by means <b>of</b> fuel taxation), Congestion Pricing (cordon pricing) and a first-best policy, the Full Optimum where one assumes that the policy maker has perfect pricing instruments available. As one would expect, the model shows that the greatest reduction in traffic level and external costs would occur if it were possible to introduce a highly differentiated and sophisticated pricing system.

40|$|The world {{currently}} stands {{witness to}} increasing energy demand {{mainly because of}} population growth and improvements in the standard of living. This causes highly negative environmental constraints since energy production, especially from conventional energy sources, is a very intense polluter. Therefore, any new energy infrastructure, especially new energy production facilities, must be carefully planned and designed and their cost competitiveness must be studied in details. Along with more traditional studies, considering mainly investment and production costs, external costs {{must be taken into}} account when making a feasibility study of a new power plant on a new country energy mix. Consideration <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> is also crucial for efficient long term re-evaluation of different energy sources and technologies used in energy industry. The <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> shows us the way to evaluate energy systems with inclusion of all environmental and social costs generated in the energy industry. In this paper we attempt to show which renewable energy sources are competitive with conventional energy sources if we internalize external costs. The study is made on the basis <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> data for the European States which are interesting for the States of former Yugoslavia as well. The results have shown that competitiveness of renewables would change dramatically if all costs are taken into account...|$|R
30|$|The UBA sees a {{need for}} a {{systematic}} review of and a political discussion about both the external <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> chemical plant protection in Germany and the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>costs</b> within society. UBA commissioned a study drawing on the work of Waibel and Fleischer [67] to provide scientific clarity. In a second step, it is necessary to discuss the scope for political actions concerning the “societal dimension” of chemical plant protection. This should also address the potential options for political action to compensate for the effects of market distortions and to internalise external costs. Political influence could be exerted by means of reforms to the EU and national farm payments (e.g., increased payments for farms with low PPP use) or a levy on PPPs (which is common practice in some EU Member States, e.g., in Denmark). A study on the introduction of a levy or tax on PPPs in Germany carried out on behalf of the Federal States Schleswig-Holstein, Baden-Wurttemberg, and Rhineland-Palatinate recently reignited a discussion on this topic [70]. The UBA expressly welcomes the discussion about the prospects and the limits of this instrument—both with regard to the <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> and to providing incentives to minimise the use of chemical plant protection products.|$|R
40|$|Sweden has {{historically}} had strict emission control by implementation {{of economic policy}} instruments {{with the aim of}} internalising the external <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> air pollution. This study aims to evaluate how well current Swedish policy instruments reflect the environmental costs associated with heat generation in several district-heating (DH) plants in the DH system of Goteborg. Furthermore, it aims to simulate and evaluate the operation of the DH system based on its social cost-effectiveness which takes into account the DH system's private and external costs (non-internalised environmental costs). The study shows that the economic policy instruments do not fully internalise all external costs whereas for certain technologies, the <b>costs</b> in terms <b>of</b> taxes, emission permits, environmental fees, etc. are higher than the environmental costs caused by the pollutants, given the environmental cost estimates used in the study. The simulation results show that the deviating <b>internalisation</b> <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> affects the economic ranking of the different plants within the studied DH system. The estimated loss in social-cost effectiveness of the operation of the DH system of Goteborg is noticable but relatively small if compared to the variable heat generation <b>costs</b> for most <b>of</b> the studied DH plants.

40|$|The {{additional}} freight movement {{generated by}} the growth of world trade carries a significant environmental penalty. This paper examines the nature and scale of this penalty and assesses the opportunities for reducing it. It focuses on the various ways of cutting carbon emissions from international freight movement by sea and air. Assuming that {{the total value of}} trade continues to expand, efforts could be made to reduce the ratios of trade value to freight tonne-kms and tonne-kms to emissions. There is currently greater potential to depress the second of these ratios by deploying new transport technologies and operating practices. Many of the ‘decarbonisation’ measures will cut costs as well as carbon and be self-financing in the short- to medium-term. <b>Internalisation</b> <b>of</b> the environmental <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> international freight transport and / or the application of emissions trading would reinforce the adoption of these measures though the prospects of this happening in the foreseeable future seem limited...|$|R
