40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of {{efficiently}} allocating incoming independent tasks onto the resources of a Grid system. Typically, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> compute each task on every machine is known. We are making the same assumption in this work, but we allow the existence of inaccuracies in these values. Our schedule will be robust versus such inaccuracies, ensuring that even when the <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> compute all the tasks is increased by a given percentage, the makespan of the schedule (i. e., the time when the last machine finishes its tasks) will not grow behind that percentage. We propose a new multi-objective definition of the problem, optimizing {{at the same time the}} makespan of the schedule and its robustness. Four well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are used to find competitive results to the new problem. Finally, a new population initialization method for scheduling problems is proposed, leading to more efficient and accurate algorithms. I...|$|R
60|$|In {{concluding}} this chapter, we will add, that notwithstanding {{his victory}} over Guthrum, and Guthrum's subsequent good faith, Alfred never enjoyed an absolute peace, {{but during the}} whole remainder of his reign {{was more or less}} molested with parties of Northmen, who came, from <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on English shores, and who met sometimes with partial and temporary success in their depredations. The most serious of these attempts occurred near the close of Alfred's life, and will be hereafter described.|$|R

40|$|AbstractTimely {{warning of}} the public during large scale {{emergencies}} is essential to ensure safety and save lives. This ongoing study proposes an agent-based simulation model to simulate the warning message dissemination among the public considering both official channels and unofficial channels The proposed model was developed in NetLogo software for a hypothetical area, and requires input parameters such as effectiveness of each official source (%), <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> begin informing others, <b>estimated</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> inform others and estimated percentage of people (who do not relay the message). This paper demonstrates a means of factoring the behaviour of the public as informants into estimating the effectiveness of warning dissemination during large scale emergencies. The model provides a tool for the practitioner to test {{the potential impact of}} the informal channels on the overall warning time and sensitivity of the modelling parameters. The tool would help the practitioners to persuade evacuees to disseminate the warning message informing others similar to the ’Run to thy neighbour campaign conducted by the Red cross...|$|R
