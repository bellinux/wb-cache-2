50|$|In {{medieval and}} early modern medicine, the {{medicinal}} leech (Hirudo medicinalis and its congeners <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> <b>Hirudo</b> troctina, and Hirudo orientalis) {{was used to}} remove blood from a patient as part of a process to balance the humors that, according to Galen, must be kept in balance for the human body to function properly. (The four humors of ancient medical philosophy were blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile.) Any sickness that caused the subject's skin to become red (e.g. fever and inflammation), so the theory went, must have arisen from too much blood in the body. Similarly, any person whose behavior was strident and sanguine was thought to be suffering from an excess of blood. Leeches were often gathered by leech collectors and were eventually farmed in large numbers.

40|$|After a short {{introduction}} to the classification of medicinal leeches, their historical use in phlebotomy (blood-letting) and contemporary use in neurobiology and medicine are summarised. Over-collecting of wild Hirudo medicinalis in Europe led to reduced populations {{and the need to}} import other species, especially the closely related <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana</b> from Turkey and, more recently, the Caribbean and Asian leech, Hirudinaria manillensis. The limited information on the quantitative ecology of European medicinal leeches is summarised next. They require warm-water ponds with a range of suitable hosts, especially amphibians, to survive and prosper. Medicinal leeches can persist with a low minimum viable population size, which may be typical of rare freshwater invertebrates in isolated habitats, especially species limited by high temperature requirements and specialised food sources. Phylogenetic relationships, using molecular methodology, show that {{there are at least two}} independent lineages of medicinal leeches with <b>Hirudo</b> medicinalis, H. <b>verbana</b> and Hirudinaria manillensis being closely related.

40|$|Animals {{frequently}} {{switch from}} one behavior to another, often {{to meet the}} demands of their changing environment or internal state. What factors control these behavioral switches and the selection of what to do or what not to do? To address these issues, we will focus on the locomotor behaviors of two distantly related ‘worms’, the medicinal leech <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana</b> (clade Lophotrochozoa) and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (clade Ecdysozoa). Although the neural architecture and body morphology of these organisms are quite distinct, they appear to switch between different forms of locomotion by using similar strategies of decision-making. For example, information that distinguishes between liquid and more solid environments dictates whether an animal swims or crawls. In the leech, dopamine biases locomotor neural networks so that crawling is turned on and swimming is turned off. In C. elegans, dopamine may also promote crawling, a form of locomotion that has gained new attention...|$|R

This review outlines current knowledge about the dynamics of the H. verbana microbiome. We discuss in depth the factors required for A. veronii colonization and proliferation in the leech crop and summarize the current understanding of interactions between A. veronii and its annelid host.

This paper presents a method to control the brightness of a high-power light emitting diode (LED) light source to an unprecedented level of stability. By continuously monitoring the actual light output of the LED with a photodiode and feeding the result back to the LED’s driver by way of a proportional-integral controller, drift was reduced to as little as 0. 007 % per hour over a 12 -h period, and short-term fluctuations to 0. 005 % root-mean-square over 10 seconds. The LED can be switched on and off completely within 100 ms, a feature that is crucial when visual stimuli and light for optical recording need to be interleaved to obtain artifact-free recordings.

In the medicinal leech, exogenous homologs of vasopressin, such as conopressin and annetocin, and the endogenous Hirudo homolog, hirudotocin (Salzet, 2007), initiate stereotyped courtship behavior in the medicinal leech <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana.</b> <b>Hirudo</b> sp. is a valuable model organism for investigating pattern generator networks due to its readily accessible central nervous system, relatively small number of neurons, many of which are well characterized, and similarities between mid-body ganglia (Macagno, 1980; Muller et al., 1981; Pearce and Friesen, 1984). Vasopressin analogs interact with a central pattern generator in the medicinal leech that initiates and maintains a variety of behaviors that play a role in reproduction (Wagenaar et al., 2010). Using immunohistochemistry, we determined that a vasopressin-like molecule was reliably present in specific identified neurons within the leech nervous system. Most of those cells are as yet uncharacterized, but one pair of large, well-known neurosecretory cells, the Leydig cells, showed a positive reaction in every ganglion. In addition, to look for potential targets of this vasopressin-like molecule, we probed ganglia with antibodies that recognize receptors for mammalian vasopressin. We discovered a set of neurons that labeled positively for vasopressin receptor 1 B. In future work, we will use the results to further study the neurohormonal basis of reproductive behavio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Host-associated {{microbial}} {{communities are}} widespread {{in nature and}} vital {{to the health and}} fitness of the host. Deciphering the physiology of the microbiome in vivo is critical to understanding the molecular basis of the sym-biosis. Recently, the development and application of high-throughput sequencing techniques, particularly RNA-seq, for studying microbial communities has enabled researchers to address not only which microbes are present in a given community but also how the community functions. For microbes that can also be cultivated in the laboratory, RNA-seq provides the opportunity to identify genes that are differentially expressed during symbiosis by comparing in vitro to in vivo transcriptomes. In the current study, we used RNA-seq to identify genes expressed by the digestive-tract microbiome of the medicinal leech, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> and by one of the two dominant symbionts, Aeromonas veronii, in a rich medium. We used a comparative approach to identify genes differentially expressed during symbiosis and gain insight into the symbiont’s physiology in vivo.

40|$|The “local bend {{response}} ” of themedicinal leech (<b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana)</b> is a stimulus–response pathway {{that enables}} the animal to bend away from a pressure stimulus applied anywhere along its body. The neuronal circuitry that supports this behavior has been well described, and its responses to individual stimuli are understood in quantitative detail. We probed the local bend system with pairs of electrical stimuli to sensory neurons that could not logically {{be interpreted as a}} single touch to the body wall and usedmultiple suction electrodes to record simultaneously the responses in large numbers of motor neurons. In all cases, responses lasted much longer than the stimuli that triggered them, implying the presence of some form of positive feedback loop to sustain the response. When stimuli were delivered simultaneously, the resulting motor neuron output could be described as an evenly weighted linear combination of the responses to the constituent stimuli. However, when stimuli were delivered sequentially, the second stimulus had greater impact on the motor neuron output, implying that the positive feedback in the system is not strong enough to render it immune to further input.

40|$|We {{characterized}} the behavioral responses of two leech species, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana</b> and Erpobdella obscura, to mechanical skin stimulation {{and examined the}} interactions between the pressure mechanosensory neurons (P cells) that innervate the skin. To quantify behavioral responses, we stimulated both intact leeches and isolated body wall preparations from the two species. In response to mechanical stimulation, Hirudo showed local bending behavior, in which the body wall shortened only {{on the side of}} the stimulation. Erpobdella, in contrast, contracted both sides of the body in response to touch. To investigate the neuronal basis for this behavioral difference, we studied the interactions between P cells. Each midbody ganglion has four P cells; each cell innervates a different quadrant of the body wall. Consistent with local bending, activating any one P cell in Hirudo elicited polysynaptic inhibitory potentials in the other P cells. In contrast, the P cells in Erpobdella had excitatory polysynaptic connections, consistent with the segment-wide contraction observed in this species. In addition, activating individual P cells caused asymmetrical body wall contractions in Hirudo and symmetrical body wall contractions in Erpobdella. These results suggest that the different behavioral responses in Erpobdella and Hirudo are partly mediated by interactions among mechanosensory cells...|$|R

High-throughput sequencing of RNA transcripts (RNA-seq) allows the investigation of the diverse physiologies from uncultured microorganisms in their natural habitat. Here, we report the use of RNA-seq for characterizing the metatranscriptome of the simple gut microbiome from the medicinal leech <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana</b> and for utilizing this information to design a medium for cultivating members of the microbiome. Expression data suggested that a Rikenella-like bacterium, the most abundant but uncultured symbiont, forages on sulfated- and sialated-mucin glycans that are fermented, leading to the secretion of acetate. Histological stains were consistent with the presence of sulfated and sialated mucins along the crop epithelium.

Metatranscriptomes shed light on microbial metabolism in situ and provide critical clues for directing the culturing of uncultured microorganisms.

40|$|The {{medicinal}} leech, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> is an aquatic predator that utilizes water {{waves to}} locate its prey. However, {{to reach their}} prey, the leeches must move within the same water that they are using to sense prey. This requires that they either move ballistically towards a pre-determined prey location or that they account for their self-movement and continually track prey. We found that leeches do not localize prey ballistically. Instead, they require continual sensory information to track their prey. Indeed, {{in the event that}} the prey moves, leeches will approach the prey's new location. While leeches need to continually sense water disturbances to update their percept of prey location, their own behavior is discontinuous – approaching prey involves switching between swimming, crawling and non-locomoting. Each of these behaviors may allow for different sensory capabilities and may require different sensory filters. Here, we examined the sensory capabilities of leeches during each of these behaviors. We found that while one could expect the non-locomoting phases to direct subsequent behaviors, crawling phases were more effective than non-locomotor phases for providing direction. During crawling bouts, leeches adjusted their heading so as to become more directed towards the stimulus. This was not observed during swimming. Furthermore, in the presence of prey-like stimuli, leeches crawled more often and for longer periods of time...|$|R

40|$|Hemolysin and {{the type}} II {{secretion}} system (T 2 SS) {{have been shown to}} be important for virulence in many pathogens, but very few studies have shown their importance in beneficial microbes. Here, we investigated the importance of the type II secretion pathway in the beneficial digestive-tract association of Aeromonas veronii and the medicinal leech <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana</b> and revealed a critical role for the hemolysis of erythrocytes. A mutant with a miniTn 5 insertion in exeM, which is involved in forming the inner membrane platform in the T 2 SS, was isolated by screening mutants for loss of hemolysis on blood agar plates. A hemolysis assay was used to quantify the mutant's deficiency in lysing sheep erythrocytes and revealed a 99. 9 % decrease compared to the parent strain. The importance of the T 2 SS in the colonization of the symbiotic host was assessed. Colonization assays revealed that the T 2 SS is critical for initial colonization of the leech gut. The defect was tied to the loss of hemolysin production by performing a colonization assay with blood containing lysed erythrocytes. This restored the colonization defect in the mutant. Complementation of the mutant using the promoter region and exeMN revealed that the T 2 SS is responsible for secreting hemolysin into the extracellular space and that both the T 2 SS and hemolysin export by the T 2 SS are critical for initial establishment of A. veronii in the leech gut...|$|R
40|$|The {{medicinal}} leech, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> {{is one of}} {{the simplest}} naturally occurring models for digestive-tract symbioses, where only two bacterial species, Aeromonas veronii bv. sobria (γ-Proteobacteria) and a Rikenella-like bacterium (Bacteroidetes), colonize the crop, the largest compartment of the leech digestive tract. In this study, we investigated spatial and temporal changes of the localization and microcolony structure of the native symbionts in the crop, after ingestion of a sterile blood meal, by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The population dynamics differed between the two symbiotic bacteria. A. veronii was detected mainly as individual cells inside the intraluminal fluid (ILF) during 14 days after feeding (daf) unless it was found in association with Rikenella microcolonies. The Rikenella-like bacteria were observed not only inside the ILF but also in association with the luminal surface of the crop epithelium. The sizes of Rikenella microcolonies changed dynamically through the 14 -day period. From 3 daf onward, mixed microcolonies containing both species were frequently observed, with cells of both species tightly associating with each other. The sizes of the mixed microcolonies were consistently larger than the size of either single-species microcolony, suggesting a synergistic interaction of the symbionts. Lectin staining with succinylated wheat germ agglutinin revealed that the planktonic microcolonies present in the ILF were embedded in a polysaccharide matrix containing N-acetylglucosamine.

The digestive tract of <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> the medicinal leech, {{is an ideal}} model system because it harbors a simple microbial community in the crop, comprising the genetically amenable Aeromonas veronii and a Rikenella-like bacterium. Signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) was used to identify genes required for digestive tract colonization. Of 3, 850 transposon (Tn) mutants screened, 46 were identified as colonization mutants. Previously we determined that the complement system of the ingested blood remained active inside the crop and prevented serum-sensitive mutants from colonizing. The identification of 26 serum-sensitive mutants indicated a successful screen. The remaining 20 serum-resistant mutants are described {{in this study and}} revealed new insights into symbiont-host interactions. An in vivo competition assay compared the colonization levels of the mutants to that of a wild-type competitor. Attenuated colonization mutants were grouped into five classes: surface modification, regulatory, nutritional, host interaction, and unknown function. One STM mutant, JG 736, with a Tn insertion in lpp, encoding Braun's lipoprotein, was characterized in detail. This mutant had a > 25, 000 -fold colonization defect relative to colonization by the wild-type strain at 72 h and, in vitro, an increased sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting the presence of an additional antimicrobial property in the crop.

For example, in the leech, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> GABA {{has been shown to}} mediate inhibitory neuronal connections shape many behaviors. In contrast to vertebrates, leeches [...] like many other invertebrates [...] also have GABAergic motor neurons that produce direct peripheral inhibition, in addition to producing central inhibition.

To test this hypothesis, we transplanted pieces of body wall into ectopic locations to ask if the central connections of motor neurons change when they contact the "wrong" peripheral target. We used embryos at 47 - 50 % of development, a stage at which neurons {{are just beginning to}} form their central electrical connections.

This colonization defect was linked to ascU by complementing JG 752 with the operon containing ascU. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis revealed that at 42 h 38 % of JG 752 cells were phagocytosed by leech macrophage-like cells compared with < 0. 1 % of the parental strain. Using mammalian macrophages, a lactate dehydrogenase release assay revealed that cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in macrophages exposed to JG 752. In a mouse septicemia model, JG 752 killed only 30 % of mice, whereas the parent strain killed 100 %, showing the importance of T 3 SS for both pathogenesis and mutualism. Phagocytic immune cells are important not only in defending against pathogens but also in maintaining the mutualistic symbiont community inside the leech, demonstrating that animals use similar, conserved mechanisms to control bacterial populations, even when the outcomes differ dramatically...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviors}} {{generated by}} neural circuits are {{constrained by the}} connectivity pattern among the neurons involved. Determining this connectivity pattern for circuits involving {{more than a handful}} of neurons becomes infeasible for physiological approaches that measure how the membrane potential of one neuron is affected by currents elicited in another. On the other hand, determining connectivity by anatomically discovering synapses is difficult due to the complicated and intertwining arbors that neurons possess. One approach to unravel this knotty problem is to image serial thin sections of neural tissue with an electron microscope. In this thesis, I describe the first application of large scale serial electron microscopy to the ganglion of the medicinal leech, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana.</b> The leech ganglion is an ideal preparation for this experiment as it is compact enough in size that it is feasible to collect images spanning an entire ganglion. Here, I discuss results we collected from two image volumes of leech tissue. One spans a small region of adult ganglion neuropil, while the other includes an entire ganglion belonging to a juvenile leech. In these volumes, I reconstruct three-dimensional representations of neuronal arbors and locate the synapses between them. In Chapter 2, I show that we can differentiate neurons on the basis of where synaptic input and output sites are distributed throughout their arbors. In Chapter 3, I show that we can locate the synapses between pairs of neurons previously known to be connected, and that we can discover new synapses anatomically that are then recovered physiologically. Together, these results demonstrate the potential that this “connectomics” approach has when applied to the already physiologically accessible leech ganglion...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{transmission}} through mucosal-mediated mechanisms {{is widespread}} throughout the animal kingdom. One {{example of this}} occurs with <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> the medicinal leech, where host attraction to shed conspecific mucus facilitates horizontal transmission of a predominant gut symbiont, the Gammaproteobacterium Aeromonas veronii. However, whether this mucus may harbor other bacteria has not been examined. Here, we characterize the microbiota of shed leech mucus through Illumina deep sequencing of the V 3 -V 4 hypervariable region of the 16 S rRNA gene. Additionally, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) typing with subsequent Sanger Sequencing of a 16 S rRNA gene clone library provided qualitative confirmation of the microbial composition. Phylogenetic analyses of full-length 16 S rRNA sequences were performed to examine microbial taxonomic distribution. Analyses using both technologies indicate {{the dominance of the}} Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla within the mucus microbiota. We determined the presence of other previously described leech symbionts, in addition to a number of putative novel leech-associated bacteria. A second predominant gut symbiont, the Rikenella -like bacteria, was also identified within mucus and exhibited similar population dynamics to A. veronii, suggesting persistence in syntrophy beyond the gut. Interestingly, the most abundant bacterial genus belonged to Pedobacter, which includes members capable of producing heparinase, an enzyme that degrades the anticoagulant, heparin. Additionally, bacteria associated with denitrification and sulfate cycling were observed, indicating an abundance of these anions within mucus, likely originating from the leech excretory system. A diverse microbiota harbored within shed mucus has significant potential implications for the evolution of microbiomes, including opportunities for gene transfer and utility in host capture of a diverse group of symbionts...|$|R
40|$|Gap {{junctions}} (GJs) are membrane {{channels that}} form between apposed cells and mediate electrical communication {{as well as}} the transfer of small molecules. GJ hemichannels are hexamers comprised of subunits called innexins (Inxs) in invertebrates and pannexins (Pnxs) or connexins (Cxs) in vertebrates. In addition to some of their shared structural motifs, Inxs, Pnxs, and Cxs also possess a highly conserved Proline residue in their second transmembrane domain (TM 2). Studies with Cxs describe this Proline as introducing a kink into the protein's three- dimensional structure, which has been implicated in mediating conformational changes in the hemichannel in response to voltage. To study the role of the Proline residue in TM 2 of Inxs in the developing CNS of the leech <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana,</b> it was mutated to a Leucine in pan- neuronally expressed Hve-inx 1 (Hve-inx 1 PL). Through a series of experiments involving the expression of this mutant inx 1 PL¹ construct in developing neurons of the intact embryo, it became evident that mutant expression conferred a dominant negative effect on INX 1 ² GJs as witnessed by the loss of GJ plaques in neuronal arbors and the decoupling of expressing neurons from their normal cellular networks. Furthermore, coexpression studies using this mutant inx 1 PL along with wild-type (WT) inx 1 and other leech Inxs has revealed that normal punctal expression of WT Inx transgenes could also be abolished for some pairs of transgenes (inx 1 PL with WT inx 1 or inx 14), but not for others (inx 1 PL with inx 6). Such results suggest that the dominant negative effects of INX 1 PL expression can be useful for not only studying INX 1 function in the CNS, but also for revealing heteromeric composition of hemichannels in individual neuron...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that many {{pathogens}} produce high-affinity iron uptake systems like siderophores and/or genes for utilizing iron bound to heme-containing molecules, which facilitate iron-acquisition inside a host. In mutualistic digestive-tract associations, iron uptake systems have not been as well studied. We investigated the importance of two iron utilization systems within the beneficial digestive-tract association Aeromonas veronii and the medicinal leech, <b>Hirudo</b> <b>verbana.</b> Siderophores were detected in A. veronii using chrome azurol S. Using a mTn 5, a transposon insertion in viuB generated a mutant unable to acquire iron using siderophores. The A. veronii genome was then searched for genes potentially involved in iron utilization bound to heme-containing molecules. A putative outer membrane heme receptor (hgpB) was identified with a transcriptional activator, termed hgpR, downstream. The hgpB gene was interrupted in both the parent strain and the viuB mutant with an antibiotic resistance cassette, yielding a hgpB mutant and a mutant with both iron uptake systems inactivated. In vitro assays indicated that hgpB is involved in utilizing iron bound to heme and that both iron utilization systems are important for A. veronii to grow in blood. In vivo colonization assays revealed {{that the ability to}} acquire iron from heme-containing molecules is critical for A. veronii to colonize the leech gut. Since iron and specifically heme utilization is important in this mutualistic relationship and has a role as a possible virulence factor in other organisms, genomes from different Aeromonas strains (both clinical and environmental) were queried with iron utilization genes of A. veronii. This analysis revealed the heme utilization genes are widely distributed among aeromonads. In addition, aeromonads posses a suite of genes involved in iron acquisition. These data further confirm symbiotic and pathogenic relationships possess similar mechanisms for interacting with animal hosts...|$|R
