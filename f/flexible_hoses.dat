5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and oil is transferred manifold to manifold via <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses.</b> Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|E
25|$|Gas-tight {{connections}} between the <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> and rigid fittings are made by using crimped hose clips or ferrules, {{often referred to as}} 'O' clips, over barbed spigots. The use of worm-drive hose clips or Jubilee clips is specifically forbidden in the UK and other countries.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{gas welding}} consists basically of an oxygen source and a fuel gas source (usually contained in cylinders), two pressure regulators and two <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses</b> (one for each cylinder), and a torch. This sort of torch {{can also be}} used for soldering and brazing. The cylinders are often carried in a special wheeled trolley.|$|E
50|$|An {{resistance}} temperature detector (RTD) is used to acquire temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A pressure transducer is used to account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the rigidity of the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Changes in rigidity affect {{the way that the}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> deflects. The <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more deflection in the <b>flexible</b> rubber <b>hose.</b> The <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> must be repeatable, accurate, and precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.|$|R

25|$|The O-320 uses a {{conventional}} wet sump system for lubrication. The main bearings, connecting rods, camshaft bearings, tappets and pushrods are all pressure lubricated, while the piston pins, cylinder walls and gears are all lubricated by spray. The oil system is pressurized by an accessory-drive mounted oil pump. A remotely mounted oil cooler is used, {{connected to the}} engine by <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, General Curtis LeMay, {{commander}} of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), asked Boeing to develop a refueling system that could transfer fuel {{at a higher rate}} than had been possible with earlier systems using <b>flexible</b> <b>hoses,</b> resulting in the flying boom system. [...] The B-29 was the first to employ the boom, and between 1950 and 1951, 116 original B-29s, designated KB-29Ps, were converted at the Boeing plant at Renton, Washington. Boeing went on to develop the world’s first production aerial tanker, the KC-97 Stratofreighter, a piston-engined Boeing Stratocruiser (USAF designation C-97 Stratofreighter) with a Boeing-developed flying boom and extra kerosene (jet fuel) tanks feeding the boom. [...] The Stratocruiser airliner itself was developed from the B-29 bomber after World War II. In the KC-97, the mixed gasoline/kerosene fuel system was clearly not desirable and it was obvious that a jet-powered tanker aircraft would be the next development, having a single type of fuel for both its own engines and for passing to receiver aircraft. The 230mph (370km/h) cruise speed of the slower, piston-engined KC-97 was also a serious issue, as using it as an aerial tanker forced the newer jet-powered military aircraft to slow down to mate with the tanker's boom, a highly serious issue with the newer supersonic aircraft coming into service at that time, which could force such receiving aircraft in some situations to slow down enough to approach their stall speed during the approach to the tanker. It was no surprise that, after the KC-97, Boeing began receiving contracts from the USAF to build jet tankers based on the Boeing 367-80 (Dash-80) airframe. [...] The result was the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, of which 732 were built.|$|E

50|$|A barb (or hose barb), which connects <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> or tubing to pipes, {{typically}} has a male-threaded end which {{mates with}} female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|R
40|$|<b>Flexible</b> water <b>hoses</b> (or <b>flexible</b> <b>hose</b> connectors) {{have become}} commonplace {{in recent years}} and provide a {{low-cost}} and convenient alternative to rigid pipe. Unfortunately, inadequate designs, particularly with regard to the selection of materials and material parameters, have made some hoses prone to failure. Such failures are often initiated by incidental exposure to corrosive substances commonly found in homes (including chlorides in tap water) that attack and corrode the stainless steel metal braid. A failure of the braid then leads to a rupture of the water-carrying tube. We evaluate the design considerations pertinent to <b>flexible</b> water <b>hose</b> failures and consider a recent failure scenario that illustrates some key points...|$|R

[...] The shower that had a cylindrical curtain that went from the floor to ceiling, and inside water was dispensed at {{the push of a}} button from a nozzle {{at the end of a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> In addition there was a vacuum system to suck away water. The floor of the shower (in the usual orientation of this module) had foot restraints. The user had to bring a bottle of pressurized water, which was dispensed through the <b>flexible</b> <b>hose.</b> Liquid soap was used with this shower, and the use of both this soap and the water for showers were carefully planned out as with most items on the station. The first astronaut to use the space shower was Paul J. Weitz (On Skylab 2, the first manned mission [...] ) The system was designed for up to 6 pints (3/4 of a gallon or about 2.84 liters) of water per shower.
