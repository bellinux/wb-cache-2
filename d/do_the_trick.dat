Norman had taken over the role twelve months earlier after leaving Huddersfield Town. A fitness fanatic, Norman organised strict training routines in an attempt to make his footballers achieve the highest possible level of fitness. It seemed to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> as Blackpool finished fourth in Division Two, their highest finish yet, and won the Central League Championship; however, their progress in the FA Cup ended in the second round.|$|E

[...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "The new edition doesn't quite catch that inspired spark." [...] Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger gave the film three out four stars, saying [...] "Not only a fun cartoon but– that rare thing– a sequel which actually improves on the original." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Armed with masses of minions and an excess of adorability, Despicable Me 2 is guaranteed to charm anyone who's out of school and already bored." [...] Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film {{two and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "It's fun. It's cheerful. It's lollipop colorful. Best of all, it features lots of minion mischief, which guarantees plenty of laughs. But what it doesn't have is an edge." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "It feels at times as if Despicable Me 2 actually is The Minions Movie. Coffin and Renaud and returning screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio haven't managed to come up with a dastardly plot to rival the shrinking and stealing of the moon from the previous film." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Banach–Tarski paradox {{can be put}} {{in context}} by {{pointing}} out that for two sets in the strong form of the paradox, there is always a bijective function that can map the points in one shape into the other in a one-to-one fashion. In the language of Georg Cantor's set theory, these two sets have equal cardinality. Thus, if one enlarges the group to allow arbitrary bijections of [...] then all sets with non-empty interior become congruent. Likewise, one ball can be made into a larger or smaller ball by stretching, in other words, by applying similarity transformations. Hence if the group [...] is large enough, -equidecomposable sets may be found whose [...] "size" [...] varies. Moreover, since a countable set can be made into two copies of itself, one might expect that somehow, using countably many pieces could <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Bowen and his {{counterpart}} at the Admiralty Signals Establishment (ASE), Canadian polymath Charles Wright, met at Bawdsey {{in the spring}} or summer of 1939 and considered {{the issue of a}} microwave airborne radar. Bowen agreed that the main problem with the range limits of the AI sets was the floodlight-like transmissions and that the easy way to fix this would be to narrow the beam, focussing the power into a smaller area. He concluded that a 10degree beamwidth would <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> Considering that the nose of an aircraft could hold a radar antenna about [...] across, an antenna with poles shorter than 15cm was desirable, and if that antenna had to be moved within the nose, 10cm (~3GHz) would be ideal. This strongly agreed with Wright's requirements for a shipboard system able to detect U-Boats while having an antenna small enough to be mounted on small escort vessels.|$|E
2500|$|The Irish began {{arriving}} in Miramichi in numbers after 1815 {{at the end}} of the Napoleonic War and with a few exceptions ceased coming to the area before the great Irish famine of 1847. They came to the area voluntarily to better their lives. Contrary to prevailing belief, not all of them were Catholic though very few Protestants among them identified openly as Irish and most of their descendants in Miramichi do not do so even to this day. Most arrived form the ports of Belfast and Cork each of which had strong commercial ties with Miramichi. Like the Scots they came on timber ships as individuals or in small family groups and the average age upon arrival was twenty-four. There was some chain emigration whereby additional family members joined the emigrant later but this was minimal. The Miramichi River valley was not settled by large transplantations of Scottish clans or large scale movements of starving and evicted Irish. Though there are one or two interesting exceptions. In 1815 after trade had developed with Newfoundland, Miramichi was surprised and shaken by the arrival of the so-called [...] "Two Boaters", perhaps as many as 2000. These were the Irish who had taken advantage of cheap fares to St.Johns in the spring and summer of 1815. They were mostly poor laborers and farmers and it seems that initially they settled mainly in the Chatham/Douglastown area. With no prospect of obtaining a land grant jobs in the woods or in the mills were the only means of getting established. Most of them were able to get at least temporary employment upon arrival, but it was short lived. In 1819 a sharp decline in timber prices resulted in massive layoffs in Miramichi including most of the [...] "Two Boat" [...] Irish of the Chatham area. Following their grueling experience in St. Johns and now unemployed they became disenchanted by their new found misery so many miles from home. They began to create disturbances in the village of Chatham. Violent outrages were committed in broad daylight, property was stolen and in the worst cases houses and barns were burned to the ground. The people of the area soon dubbed then [...] "those uncivilized immigrants from Ireland", whom local magistrates were powerless to control. But the Irish were not the only troublemakers along the river at that time. They were often mistakenly blamed for outrageous disturbances caused by unruly sailors idling about the port during the spring and summer months. These idle sailors whooped it up at Miramichi particularly on Sundays when the taverns were closed but often the Irish got the blame. In 1822 a detachment of the 78th regiment stationed in Fredericton was temporarily sent to Chatham to keep the peace. But it was not the soldiers of 78th regiment who quieted the Irish. It took an improved economy, jobs and new found opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b>|$|E
