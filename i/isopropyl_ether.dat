A similar pressure dependence characterizes the isomeric composition of products from the alkylation of PhOMe, which passes from 85 %ortho, 5 %meta, 10 %para in C 3 H 8 at 720 Torr to 64 %ortho, 21 %meta, and 15 %para at 20 Torr.

40|$|Commercial {{and home}} {{prepared}} TiO 2 samples impregnated with tungstophosphoric acid (H 3 PW 12 O 40) {{were used for}} the photo-assisted degradation of 2 -propanol in gas–solid regime. The characterization results evidenced a good coverage of the polyoxometalate (POM) onto the surface of TiO 2 along with a marginal effect of the presence of the POM on the specific surface area, morphology and cristallinity of the samples. Propene was the main intermediate product revealed in 2 -propanol photocatalytic degradation by using as photocatalysts the samples containing the POM, whereas propanone wasmainly obtained when the photocatalysts was bare TiO 2, both commercial or home prepared. Acetaldehyde was also found as an intermediate product along with traces of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>ether,</b> mesityl oxide and isobutylmethyl- ketone that were also detected as gaseous products in all the runs. Carbon dioxide and water were the ultimate oxidation product...|$|E
