The study reported here investigated five well-documented evaluation methods (DIALECTE, Ecological Footprint, Environmental Management for Agriculture, FarmSmart, Life Cycle Assessment) by applying them to a case study of three pig farm scenarios. These methods differ with respect to their global objective (evaluation of impact versus evaluation of adherence to good practice), the number and type of environmental issues they consider, the way they define the system to be analysed, the mode <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> (for the farm as a whole, per unit area or per unit product) and the type of indicators used (pressure, state or impact indicators). The pig farm scenarios compared were conventional good agricultural practice (GAP), a quality label scenario called red label (RL) and organic agriculture (OA). We used the methods to rank the three scenarios according to their environmental impacts. The relative ranking of the three scenarios varied considerably depending on characteristics of the evaluation method used and on the mode <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> We recommend the use of evaluation methods that express results both per unit area and per unit product.

40|$|Microscopic {{techniques}} for analysing asbestos fibres in lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage have provided major {{information in the}} understanding of asbestos-related diseases. These analyses are increasingly applied for clinical work and medicolegal problems. Differences in sampling, preparation and counting techniques, definitions of reference populations and <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> have caused major difficulties in comparing results from different laboratories. Therefore it appeared necessary to set a goal to harmonize these analyses between the European laboratories active in this field. This article summarizes the work of a European Respiratory Society working group with participation from nine European laboratories. The five main issues touched upon are: 1) definitions of control populations and reference levels; 2) sampling, preparation and analytical techniques; 3) asbestos fibres in lung tissues in different pathologies; 4) asbestos bodies in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum; and 5) basis for the interpretation of fibres and asbestos bodies in biological samples. These guidelines indicate the crucial importance of several factors for the interpretation of the results; namely, adequate sampling, comparable analytical procedures and <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> the <b>results,</b> the use <b>of</b> well-defined reference populations, and a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting the fibre retention and the dose-responses associated with the different asbestos-related diseases.

To address these problems, this study proposes a role mining model called network-clique-finding (NCF) model, which is based on cliques finding of network. By this model, the role mining problem can be mapped onto the classic problems of graph theory and can be solved by using many well-known algorithms and tools.
