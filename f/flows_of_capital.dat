There {{are a variety}} of sports fisheries that represent a minor flow of carbon, but significant <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> to local economies around the estuary. Most of the recreational fisheries surround striped bass, sturgeon, and introduced fresh water basses in the freshwater Delta. This paucity of fisheries makes the San Francisco Estuary unique. Nearly all estuaries worldwide support at least remnants of significant fisheries. The San Francisco Estuary at one time supported major fisheries for salmon, anchovies, and Dungeness crabs until the 1950s. The demise of these fisheries was probably due more to habitat loss than overharvesting.|$|E

In the aggregation <b>of</b> net <b>capital</b> stock, we have combined four categories, i. e., nonresidential structures, nonresidential producers' durable equipment, residential structures and equipment, and business inventories. Following Jorgenson et. al. (1987), we then constructed aggregate capital input by using the Tornqvist aggregation index over these four categories. Finally, the composite cost <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is obtained by dividing the revenue <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> by the aggregate capital input. ...|$|R

Saving rates of fast-growing emerging economies have been rising over time, leading to surprising “upstream” <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> from developing to rich countries. Carroll and Jeanne (2009) developed a model to test the relationship between economic development, the stock of savings and capital flows.

50|$|According to Segbers, {{globalization}} and global <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> trades and services, information {{and people are}} dramatically altering the nature of politics and the opportunities for nation-states to control or influence events. “Politics can no more be masterminded, engineered, implemented, executed, organized and controlled.

Another proposal is to shift decision-making processes from the nation-state to the local and suprantional level.|$|E

50|$|In {{his major}} work Late Capitalism, Mandel argues for three periods in the {{development}} of the capitalist mode of production. The first is freely competitive capitalism, which occurred from 1700 to 1850 and is characterized largely by the growth of industrial capital in domestic markets. Secondly there is the phase of monopoly capitalism, which lasted until approximately 1940, and is characterized by the imperialistic development of international markets as well as the exploitation of colonial territories. Finally there is the epoch of late capitalism emerging out of the Second World War, which has as its dominant features the multinational corporation, globalized markets and labor, mass consumption, and the space of liquid multinational <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|E
5000|$|As {{evident from}} the theory of deindustrialization, {{political}} economists and demographers both place huge importance on the global <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and investment in relation to population stability.

[...] With the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in addition to the United States’ economic aid programs (i.e., Marshall Plan and Lend-Lease), many academics highlight Bretton Woods as a turning point in world economic relations. Under a new academic stratification of developed and developing nations, trends in capital investment flows and urban population densities were theorized following post-World War II global financial reorganization.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the nineteenth century British capital played a major part in Australian {{economic}} development. The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> to the Australian colonies comprised government borrowing on the one hand, and private borrowing by companies on the other. The present study concerns the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> to the private sector of the Australian economy, most which reached the colonies through the medium of finance companies from the mid 'seventies to 1891. The crux of the study are the new estimates <b>of</b> the annual <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> British <b>capital</b> to the private sector of the Australian economy, excluding mining activity (for which estimates are available), in the 'seventies, 'eighties and 'nineties. Capital reached the colonies through a group of powerful finance companies which employed British capital in the Australian pastoral industry. These companies raised most of their funds in Britain in two ways: first, by issuing short-term debenture bonds, and second, by raising deposits. Debentures were issued by pastoral mortgage and investment companies, and deposits were collected by Australian banks. As the available estimates <b>of</b> this <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> are wholly inadequate, the present study contributes a new annual series of Australian company borrowing which was calculated directly from balance-sheets and other data, and not by taking a residual of the balance of payments. In addition, a calculation was made, from 1881 to 1891, on an annual basis, of the total burden of indebtedness of the Australian colonies accruing from government borrowing and this form of company borrowing. </p...|$|R
