40|$|At low temperatures, {{in strong}} {{magnetic}} fields, {{the formation of}} a non-uniform magnetisation is possible in a single-crystal metal sample whose <b>demagnetising</b> <b>factor</b> along the field is close to unity. Namely, so-called Condon diamagnetic domain structure arises and disappears periodically with magnetic field. In this paper, the diamagnetic domain structure in beryllium single crystalis analysed. Directly, existence of diamagnetic domains in that sample was observed earlier by the muon spin precession (mSR) resonance peak splitting. A method is described that allows to calculate quantitative characteristics of the interdomain boundary using the muon histograms. The technique is based on the Marquardt minimisation procedure that has been modified {{in order to reduce the}} influence of noise on iterations convergence. Boundary volume fraction was calculated.

40|$|Both {{analytical}} and computational methods have been, {{for the first}} time, employed to study the demagnetising factors for bonded magnets. The demagnetising factors for bonded NdFeB magnets are dependent on the external shape of the bonded magnet, the shapes of magnetic particles, the magnetic loading percentage and the distributions of magnetic particles. Particularly, {{it has been shown}} that the <b>demagnetising</b> <b>factor</b> along the length of an infinitely long bonded magnet is not equal to zero but that it also depends on the shapes of the magnetic particles, magnetic loading percentage and the distribution of magnetic particles. However, the sum of the demagnetising factors along the x, y and z directions is, as expected, unity for all bonded magnets. The <b>demagnetising</b> <b>factor</b> for a fully dense magnet, which is dependent only on the external shape of the magnet, can be considered as a special case of bonded magnets in which the magnetic loading is 100 %. Simplified formulae for calculating the demagnetising factors for simple shaped magnets such as cuboid, cylindroid and ellipsoid shapes were obtained and the values are in reasonable agreement with precise analytical solutions. A Lorentz ''sphere'' concept has, for the first time, been employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for hollow magnets and bonded NdFeB magnets. The simplified formulae for hollow magnets and bonded magnets were derived. Computer programmes based on the basic energy method were developed and employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for bonded magnet models, such as a one-dimensional NdFeB ribbon array, two-dimensional bonded magnets and three-dimensional bonded magnets. A finite difference method and a finite element method have been, for the first time, employed to calculate the demagnetising factors for two-dimensional bonded magnet models and the results are comparable with those obtained using the basic energy method. Procedures for calculating demagnetising curves (J vs H) for bonded magnets were developed. The calculated demagnetising curves for bonded magnets, based on these procedures, are in reasonable agreement with experimental results.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} {{calculation of the}} velocity of a single 180 degree domain wall in a magnetic structure with reduced thickness and/or lateral dimension under the combined action of an external applied magnetic field and an electrical current. As for the case of field-induced domain wall propagation in thick films, two motion regimes with different mobilities are obtained, below and far above the so-called Walker field. Additionally, for the case of current induced motion, a Walker-like current density threshold can be defined. When {{the dimensions of the}} system become comparable to the domain wall width, the threshold field and current density, stating the wall's internal structure stability, are reduced by the same geometrical <b>demagnetising</b> <b>factor</b> which accounts for the confinement. This points out the fact that the velocity dependence over an extended field/current range and the knowledge of the Walker breakdown are mandatory to draw conclusions about the phenomenological Gilbert damping parameter tuning the magnetisation dynamics.

For self-a$ne roughness, the demagnetizing factor is in#uenced by the roughness exponent H, and is proportional to w/m 2 with w being the RMS roughness amplitude and m being the lateral correlation length.

40|$|Data {{storage in}} current hard disk drives {{is limited by}} three factors. These are thermal {{stability}} of recorded data, the ability to store data, {{and the ability to}} read back the stored data. An attempt to alleviate one factor can affect others. This ultimately limits magnetic recording densities that can be achieved using traditional forms of data storage. In order to advance magnetic recording and postpone these inhibiting factors, new approaches are required. One approach is recording on Bit Patterned Media (BPM) where the medium is patterned into nanometer-sized magnetic islands where each stores a binary digit. This thesis presents a statistical model of write errors in BPM composed of single domain islands. The model includes thermal activation in a calculation of write errors without resorting to time consuming micromagnetic simulations of huge populations of islands. The model incorporates distributions of position, magnetic and geometric properties of islands. In order to study the impact of island geometry variations on the recording performance of BPM systems, the magnetometric <b>demagnetising</b> <b>factors</b> for a truncated elliptic cone, a generalised geometry that reasonably describe most proposed island shapes, were derived analytically. The inclusion of thermal activation was enabled by an analytic derivation of the energy barrier for a single domain island. The energy barrier is used in a calculation of transition rates that enable the calculation of error rates. The model has been used to study write-error performance of BPM systems having distributions of position, geometric and magnetic property variations. Results showed that island intrinsic anisotropy and position variations have a larger impact on write-error performance than geometric variations. The model was also used to study thermally activated Adjacent Track Erasure (ATE) for a specific write head. The write head had a rectangular main pole of 13 by 40 nm (cross-track x down-track) with pole trailing shield gap of 5 nm and pole side shield gap of 10 nm. The distance from the pole to the top surface of the medium was 5 nm, the medium was 10 nm thick and there was a 2 nm interlayer between the soft underlayer (SUL) and the medium, making a total SUL to pole spacing of 17 nm. The results showed that ATE would be a major problem and that cross-track head field gradients need to be more tightly controlled than down-track. With the write head used, recording at 1 Tb/in² would be possible on single domain islands. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceEPSRCSchool of Computer ScienceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Naval {{submarines}} {{and surface}} ships are regularly {{subjected to a}} treatment called 'deperming' that seeks to design the vessel's permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate {{various aspects of the}} deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and <b>demagnetising</b> fields as <b>factors</b> in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A laboratory MTF was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU 200 T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ± 5 %) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU 200 T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ± 0. 1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0. 94 ± 0. 09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA 2 S-E and CU 200 T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU 200 T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5. 97 ´ 10 - 3 and 0. 0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D) : redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel 'anhysteretic deperm' method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin's equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. 'Sympathetic deperming' occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (> 0. 1 m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0. 5 mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{identify}} topologically protected states in the materials SnTe and Fe 3 Sn 2. Such states are currently receiving {{a large amount of}} interest due to their applications for spintronic devices. Recently SnTe was discovered to be a crystalline topological insulator, a state of matter where its surface is highly conducting while the bulk remains insulating. However detection of these surface states is difficult using transport measurements, since the bulk is not totally insulating but still contains a large number of free carriers. SnTe undergoes a rhombohedral structural distortion on cooling caused by a soft transverse optic phonon, with the exact Tc strongly dependent on the carrier concentration. The distortion acts to lower crystal symmetry removing some of the symmetries that protect the surface state. Single crystal samples displaying the structural transition were grown and investigated using inelastic X-ray scattering to measure the phonon softening previously reported by other authors. The soft phonon was seen to recover again after distortion indicative of a 2 nd order ferroelectric transition. This is the first reported discovery of the recovery showing the distortion is ferroelectric in nature. Shubnikov de Haas quantum oscillations were measured to study the Fermi surface under ambient and high hydrostatic pressure conditions. A distortion of the Fermi surface caused by the structural transition was evident, resulting in 4 distinct oscillation frequencies. However at applied pressures above 6 kbar, the transition was suppressed and only 1 oscillation measured. A two component Hall response also becomes apparent under high pressure. The possible origin of this and its relation to possible surface states is discussed. The anomalous Hall effect was also measured in the ferromagnet Fe 3 Sn 2 which has a bilayer Kagome structure. Previous measurements on polycrystalline Fe 3 Sn 2 suggested a non-collinear spin rotation from the spins pointing along the c-axis at high temperature to lying in the a-b plane below 80 K. A spin glass phase is then expected below 80 K. Single crystal magnetisation measurements carried out in this thesis show the spins are in the a-b plane at high temperatures and begin to display a ferromagnetic component along the c-axis approaching 80 K. The difference is accounted for by considering the <b>demagnetising</b> <b>factor</b> in the plate shaped single crystals. For this temperature range an applied field along the c-direction however rotates the moments towards c. At intermediate fields there are strong features evident in both the anomalous Hall effect and magnetoresistance. These features may be due to a topological Hall effect caused by a non-collinear spin structure. The possible existence of Skyrmion excitations was also recently discussed theoretically in Fe 3 Sn 2. Our data is more suggestive of static Skyrmions known to cause topological Hall effects in MnSi...|$|E
