Despite Lobengula's retrospective attempts to disavow it, it proved the foundation for the royal charter granted by the United Kingdom to Rhodes's British South Africa Company in October 1889, and thereafter for the Pioneer Column's occupation of Mashonaland in 1890, which marked the beginning of white settlement, administration and development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> eventually became Rhodesia, named after Rhodes, in 1895.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{turnaround}} from a 281 {{season in}} 1992 {{was the largest}} single-season turnaround in school history and was the second-best <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> year.

5|$|In December 1964, Kenya {{was officially}} proclaimed a republic. Kenyatta became its {{executive}} President, a role combining {{the head of}} state and head of government. Over the course of 1965 and 1966, various constitutional amendments were made that enhanced the President's power. For instance, a May 1966 amendment gave the president the ability to order the detention of individuals without trial if the security of the state was regarded as threatened. Kenyatta sought to attain the support of Kenya's second largest tribal group, the Luo, thus appointing the Luo activist Odinga as his Vice President. However, the Kikuyu—who made up around 20 percent of the Kenyan population—still held most of the important government and administrative positions in the country. This contributed to a perception among many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> independence had simply seen the dominance of a European elite replaced by the dominance of a Kikuyu elite.|$|E

The Netherlands is the second country, after Norway, where plug-in electric cars have topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. The strong increase of plug-in car sles during the last months of 2013 was due {{to the end of the}} total exemption of the registration fee for corporate cars, which is valid for 5 years.

Her mother remarried, and when her new step-father became manager of a hotel in Guildford, the family returned to England. Along with her sister, Christina, she was educated at StSwithun's School, Winchester, and after displaying a talent for art she went on to study at an art college in Bournemouth. The two sisters later shared a flat in London, where Veronica worked as a model and later as a secretary. Christina's marriage to the wealthy William Shand-Kydd introduced her to London high society, and it was at a golf-club function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> Veronica and Lucan first met.|$|E

On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor has won one international cup, as Maribor was one of the winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor have the best top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once.

DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.

Other teams are equally successful as both the U17 and U15 teams holds the record for most titles (six) in their category.

40|$|ADInternational audienceThe {{question}} {{examined in}} this paper is the following. Assuming that money played a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prediction of inflation, which of the nominal money gap or real money gap did <b>the</b> best job <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European <b>countries?</b> Answering this ques- tion helps us to compare the different strategies undertaken by <b>the</b> central banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> were members of <b>the</b> EMU. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>that</b> participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and then adopted the Euro, the policy preferences have been dominated by tacking monetary aggregates, while some non-euro countries preferred {{to focus on the}} direct effects of real money growth. The authors use panel data econometrics allowing for heterogeneous short-run and long-run dynamics among <b>the</b> <b>countries.</b> An important result is that the real money gap may be equally informative about future inflation.

5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came {{at the cost of}} tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Linfa caused {{flooding}} and four separate landslides. The storm's heavy rainfall caused water levels to rise in reservoirs, prompting officials to drain some excess waters from the Binga Dam in Benguet province. Schools were closed in Metro Manila for three days due to flooding and landslides. The storm damaged 18sections of roads, {{as well as two}} bridges and an irrigation canal in San Gabriel, La Union. Slick roads and a fallen tree caused a bus accident in Quezon City, injuring ten people. Portions of Luzon lost power during the storm, including the entirety of La Union province, and Bacnotan briefly lost water access. In the Ilocos region, a Chinese fishing vessel docked at Currimao port ran aground after being battered by huge waves. Three days of high waves washed 30tons of mussels ashore Valladolid, Negros Occidental, prompting officials to use trucks to bury the rotting shells {{to prevent the spread of}} disease. Rough waves also disrupted rescue efforts for an unrelated ferry disaster <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>that</b> killed 54. The storm interacted with the monsoon to spawn two tornadoes in Negros Occidental, as well as strong winds that knocked down trees and billboards. Across Luzon, Linfa damaged 198houses and destroyed another seven. The storm damaged ₱34million ($71,000 USD) worth of crops, and total damage reached ₱214.6 million ($4.8 million USD). Most of the power outages were repaired within a few days of Linfa's passage. After the storm, officials distributed meals to affected residents.|$|E
