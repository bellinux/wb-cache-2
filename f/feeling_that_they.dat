5|$|Various {{commentators}} {{noted that}} there was a renewed sense of pride among the country's indigenous population following Morales' election. Conversely, the opposition accused Morales' administration of aggravating racial tensions between indigenous, white, and mestizo populations, with some non-indigenous Bolivians <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were now experiencing racism.|$|E
5|$|Between 1905 and 1907, Taft came {{to terms}} with the {{likelihood}} he would be the next Republican nominee for president, though he did not plan to actively campaign for it. When Justice Henry B. Brown resigned in 1905, Taft would not accept the seat although Roosevelt offered it, a position Taft held to when another seat opened in 1906. Edith Roosevelt, the First Lady, disliked the growing closeness between the two men, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were too much alike and that the president did not gain much from the advice of someone who rarely contradicted him.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Davidson had {{no doubts}} about Henson's doctrinal soundness, and {{persuaded him to}} issue a {{statement}} of faith to silence his critics. Davidson stated publicly that no fair-minded man could read consecutively a series of Henson's sermons without <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had in him a brilliant and powerful teacher of the Christian faith. Gore and his followers were obliged to call off their protests. Against Davidson's advice for caution, Lloyd George appointed Henson to the vacant see of Hereford in 1917. Gore and others, including Cosmo Lang, now the Archbishop of York, failed to attend the consecration service. Their attitude hurt Henson, offended lay opinion in the Church, and was sharply criticised in The Times. Henson was consecrated bishop in Westminster Abbey on 4 February 1918 by Davidson, assisted by twelve supporting bishops. He was enthroned at Hereford Cathedral eight days later.|$|E

5000|$|Series co-creators Scott Wilson (Host) and Andre Dupuis (Director and Videographer) {{have said}} that he and Wilson worked on another show, but that it seemed [...] "kind of dry", and that it was not {{carrying}} across the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had, thinking he and Wilson [...] "could probably do a better job".|$|R
5|$|Some of the {{problems}} that have affected the F-FDTL throughout its existence were caused by the process used to establish the force. A key flaw in this process was that FALINTIL's high command was allowed to select candidates for the military from members of FALINTIL without external oversight. As a result, the selection was conducted, to a large degree, on the basis of applicants' political allegiance. This led to many FALINTIL veterans <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been unfairly excluded from the military and reduced the force's public standing. Furthermore, UNTAET failed to establish adequate foundations for the East Timorese security sector by developing legislative and planning documents, administrative support arrangements and mechanisms for the democratic control of the military. These omissions remained uncorrected after East Timor achieved independence on 20 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, Adam is {{revealed}} to be recovering from multiple facial reconstruction surgeries, {{and is in the}} care of Sage Warner (Kelly Sullivan). When Adam is told of Chelsea and Billy's new relationship, he attempts to leave his current dwelling, with Sage assuring him that he is not ready and that any attempt to leave would only compromise the progress of the surgeries he'd recently had. Adam eventually recovers enough to have the bandages removed from his face; after the bandages are removed it {{is revealed}} that his face had been replaced by Gabriel Bingham; the man who died saving Adam's life, he returns to Genoa City with Sage, he comes across the people he knows, but none of them recognize Adam or get the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> know him somehow. Adam, under the alias of Gabriel, would pose as being married to Sage, in a ruse to claim Gabe's inheritance from Constance, however, they would later divorce in April 2015. He would reconnect with Chelsea, whom he confessed his true identity, and would slowly begin to piece their life back together, with plans to relocate to Paris, until Victor stepped in to sue for custody of Connor, keeping them in Genoa City. In October 2015, Adam's true identity was revealed and would help Sage deliver his nephew in Chancellor Park, following a heated confrontation between the two. Adam would stand trial for his role in Delia's death. He was sentenced for ten years, and upon leaving the courthouse, was run over by an unknown assailant. Christine found out that the car is found at the south lake motel. The car was found out to be a rental and Kevin found a surveillance picture that showed that Chloe was behind the pedal to the metal. Adam regains consciousness after the surgery, and expresses no ill will towards Chloe.|$|E

50|$|Replicas {{work well}} in museum {{settings}} {{because they have the}} ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel the authentic <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are supposed to get from the originals. Through the context and experience that a replica can provide in a museum setting, people can be fooled into seeing it as ‘original’.|$|R

Disgusted with her actions, Ryan tells her that she succeeded with killing {{whatever}} <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had left. Greenlee is very upset about this but refuses to admit it, so she sleeps with David to prove that she doesn't love Ryan.|$|R
25|$|Miss Tibbs and Miss Gatsby, {{played by}} Gilly Flower and Renee Roberts, {{are the other}} two {{permanent}} residents. Seemingly inseparable, these sweet-natured, dotty spinsters appear to have taken a fancy to Basil, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{need to take care}} of him. In response, Basil vacillates between superficial charm and blunt rudeness during his conversations with them.|$|E
25|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the yeshiva again {{evacuated}} to synagogues in the Katamon, Geula and Bucharim neighborhoods. This time, {{however, the}} main yeshiva {{building in the}} Old City was {{burned to the ground}} by Jordanian troops, and thousands of Attiya's unpublished writings were burned along with it. He refused to rewrite them, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not meant for publication. Instead, his students would be his lifetime achievement.|$|E
25|$|Initial {{treatment}} {{is similar to}} atrophic rhinitis, namely keeping the nasal mucosa moist with saline or oil-based lubricants and treating pain and infection as they arise; adding menthol to lubricants may be helpful in ENS, as may be use of a cool mist humidifer at home. For people with anxiety, depression, or who are obsessed with the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can't breathe, psychiatric or psychological care may be helpful.|$|E
50|$|Many mothers, {{often the}} primary caregivers, {{are more likely}} than fathers to {{experience}} empty nest syndrome.

50|$|This vector {{consists}} {{of learning to}} understand, accept, and express emotions. Individuals learn how to appropriately act on <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are experiencing. In his more recent work, Chickering's theory was broad and covered emotions including anxiety, depression, guilt, anger, shame along with positive emotions such as inspiration and optimism. In his original work, he focused primarily on aggression and sexual desires.|$|R
25|$|As Glyn Uzzell noted, “Zahawi {{rejects the}} use of glazes, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can {{disguise}} the artist’s intention with a superficially enhancing gloss. All of his works are stained in the natural colors of earth or atmosphere, and {{in a manner that}} shows the direct presence of the artist’s hand.” Al-Zahawi overtime concocted his own recipe of wax, turpentine, and powder from various minerals to achieve the right composition to stain his sculptures and reliefs.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{the first}} {{election}} after independence, the opposition won {{and the official}} language was declared to be Sinhala. The Tamil people were unhappy, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were greatly disadvantaged. Because Sinhala was now the official language, it {{made it easier for}} the people whose mother tongue was Sinhala to enter into government sector and also provided them with an unfair advantage in the education system. Tamils who also did not understand Sinhala felt greatly inconvenienced as they had to depend on others to translate official documents for them.|$|E
25|$|In August, {{the first}} meeting between 12 victims of the {{conflict}} and the negotiators took place in Havana, an event hailed as a highly symbolic solemn exchange between the victims face-to-face with their victimizers. In a joint communiqué for the occasion, both sides reiterated that victims were {{at the core of}} the agreement. The second victims' delegation was received in September. Notwithstanding these encounters, victims of the FARC <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not been sufficiently taken into account organized a forum to have their voices taken into account. The forum brought together both opponents and supporters of the peace process.|$|E

50|$|Art therapy {{can be an}} {{effective}} way for children to develop and connect with their emotions. Some children with autism have found that drawing can help them to express <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have difficulty expressing otherwise. Similarly children who have faced horrors such as war can find it difficult to talk about what they have experienced directly. Art can help children come to terms with their emotions in these situations.|$|R
25|$|Expansion of borders through {{annexation}} {{suits against}} neighboring counties and incorporated towns {{has long been}} a method available to the independent cities to grow, with incorporated towns also able to take such actions against counties. Since the years of the Byrd Organization, state funding formulas have tended to favor rural areas, and growth through annexation was seen as a counter-measure financially by many cities and towns. However, such actions are often controversial and in some cases, have resulted in protracted and costly legal proceedings. They also often leave residents of an annexed area <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had no say in the process.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{leadership}} of an adventurer called Andriscus, Macedon rebelled against Roman rule in 149 BC: as a result it was directly annexed the following year and became a Roman province, {{the first of the}} Greek states to suffer this fate. Rome now demanded that the Achaean League, the last stronghold of Greek independence, be dissolved. The Achaeans refused and, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might as well die fighting, declared war on Rome. Most of the Greek cities rallied to the Achaeans' side, even slaves were freed to fight for Greek independence. The Roman consul Lucius Mummius advanced from Macedonia and defeated the Greeks at Corinth, which was razed to the ground.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1975, {{the band}} had become disillusioned with {{their lack of}} success in America. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were {{becoming}} stale and had achieved all they could in Europe, Slade decided to a make a permanent move to the States and try to build a solid reputation from live performances; {{just as they had}} previously done in the UK. According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately £45,000 at the time. Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top and Black Sabbath, only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.|$|E
2500|$|The lyrics were {{described}} by Yamaguchi {{as being the}} first love song that he had written. The lyrics are a person believing <b>that</b> the <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are experiencing are being created by listening to a Bach melody at night time. The melody reminds him of {{the face of a}} woman and her [...] "whimsical color", while he wonders why he is fascinated by the moon. He believes that he will soon forget these feelings.|$|R
50|$|In {{his search}} for a more intense rhythmic experience, Dalcroze posed some questions. First, he {{questioned}} why music theory and notation were taught as abstractions, dissociated from sound, movements and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represented. Moreover, by taking the pianist as an example, he asked how the finger technique taught by professors {{could be considered a}} complete musical education. Finally, he was intrigued that the qualities that characterize a real musician were rarely experienced in a music class.|$|R

I think some highly secret government UFO investigations are going on that we don't know about—and probably never will unless the Air Force discloses them.|$|R
25|$|Over {{a two-week}} {{treatment}} of healthy volunteers, sertraline slightly improved verbal fluency {{but did not}} affect word learning, short-term memory, vigilance, flicker fusion time, choice reaction time, memory span, or psychomotor coordination. In spite of lower subjective rating, that is, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> performed worse, no clinically relevant differences were observed in the objective cognitive performance {{in a group of}} people treated for depression with sertraline for 1.5years as compared to healthy controls. In children and adolescents taking sertraline for six weeks for anxiety disorders, 18 out of 20measures of memory, attention and alertness stayed unchanged. Divided attention was improved and verbal memory under interference conditions decreased marginally. Because of the large number of measures taken, it is possible that these changes were still due to chance. The unique effect of sertraline on dopaminergic neurotransmission may be related to these effects on cognition and vigilance.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} three years, Core Design was {{committed}} to delivering a Tomb Raider game annually, putting considerable strain on staff. For this reason, and the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had exhausted the series' potential, the developers tried to kill the character off. This did not work, and while a fifth game was created, the team stated {{that they were not}} fully invested in its development. During development on the fifth game, the team split into two divisions, with one division working on the next-generation sequel The Angel of Darkness. During this period, multiple handheld titles were also developed by both Core Design and third-party developers. The production of The Angel of Darkness was beset by problems from an early stage, with the team wanting to create a grander game to compete with contemporary action-adventure games. Under pressure from Eidos, key sections of the game needed to be cut, and it was released before the team felt it was ready. The game received negative reactions from both fans and critics, and was cited by Paramount as the reason for the second Tomb Raider film underperforming.|$|E
25|$|Takahashi {{created the}} {{majority}} of the main scenario himself. Takahashi worked on the script alongside Yuichiro Takeda, a writer who had previously worked on Xenoblade Chronicles; and Kazuho Hyodo, who had written episodes for multiple Gundam series. The story of Xenoblade Chronicle X was substantially larger than Xenoblade Chronicles, with Takahashi and Takeda <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not handle the entire scenario themselves. On advice from Takeda, he brought in Hyodo. Due to Hyodo's extensive involvement in science fiction stories, Takahashi felt confident leaving much of the work to him. The choice of a science fiction setting was influenced by Takahashi's wish to do something different from the fantasy setting of Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles X was the first time Hyodo had worked on a video game. One of the main goals for Takahashi was having humans and the robot Skells coexisting and functioning in the world. Due to the scale and experimental nature of the game, the Monolith Soft team made an effort {{to move away from the}} philosophical storylines their company had become known for with previous titles. Speaking about his goals for the game, Takahashi felt that he had finally created what he had wanted to since first founding Monolith Soft in 1999.|$|E
