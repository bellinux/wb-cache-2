Furthermore, even exotic sports, such as parachuting or martial arts, are offered. Students may attend courses either for free or at reduced rates. The sports department is located close to the Wilhelmstraße area of university buildings and is served by a number of frequent bus routes.|$|E

Although death is a risk that a living donor {{must be willing to}} accept prior to the surgery, the mortality rate of living donors in the United States is low. The LDLT donor's immune system does diminish {{as a result of the}} liver regenerating, so certain foods which would normally cause an upset stomach could cause serious illness.|$|E

25|$|For Francis, {{work is a}} {{gift and}} to work is a grace. Daily work {{is not only the}} means of livelihood, but the {{opportunity}} to serve God and neighbor as well as a way to develop one's own personality. In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that every form of occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E
25|$|Under the rules, {{investors who}} do not sue Madoff or other parties will be allowed a theft-loss {{deduction}} for the 2008 tax year, equal to 95 percent of their total investment, including all fictitious earnings credited to their accounts on which they were taxed, but less any withdrawals, or actual or potential recoveries from SIPC or their own insurance. Victims who decide to sue Madoff or third parties, believing they might <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of some recovery, may still deduct 75 percent of their investment. The deduction will {{not be subject to}} the limitations on deduction of itemized deductions. Any loss exceeding current income may result in a net operating loss, which can be carried back, at the taxpayer's election, 3, 4, or 5 years, with any loss still remaining carrying forward 20 years. These rules apply to all Ponzi schemes where there has been a federal or state indictment of the lead promoter.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} light weight, PEMFCs are most suited for {{transportation}} applications. PEMFCs for buses, which use compressed hydrogen for fuel, can operate {{at up to}} 40% efficiency. Generally PEMFCs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel. Technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of PEMs into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems. Full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels; however, they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids. There is potential for PEMFCs {{to be used for}} stationary power generation, where they provide 5kW at 30% efficiency; however, they run into competition with other types of fuel cells, mainly SOFCs and MCFCs. Whereas PEMFCs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation, other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems. Therefore, PEMFCs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available. Furthermore, PEMFCs <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of replacing batteries for portable electronics, though integration of the hydrogen supply is a technical challenge particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device.|$|E

25|$|On 15 June, the joined Polish forces reached Połonne. After a meeting, the Polish commanders {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} {{because they did}} not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of defending a town that did not have fortifications. On 17 June, Polish commander Prince Józef Poniatowski received information in Szepietówka that the Lubomirski division was now camped in Zasław. He ordered the Lubomirski division to join his forces near Zieleńce. Lubomirski had about 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, including units of general Józef Zajączek and Ludwik Trokin. His formation secured a hill situated on the north of the road from Połonne to Zasław which dominated the area. Infantry taking position in centre wings were secured by cavalry. In the early morning of 18 June, a Russian group under command of General Irakly Morkov was observed. This group was front watch of larger corps of General Mikhail Golenishchev-Kutuzov. The order of this group was to attack the Polish army left wing and destroy the rest of train. With a force about 10,500.-11,500s soldiers and 24 cannons (2 infantry regiments of about 6,000 soldiers, three regiments of line cavalry of 2,500 soldiers, and a Cossack brigade under command of Orlov), the Russian formations took positions in a valley below a hill. Their order of battle was the same as Polish, except that one battalion was a reserve and the second to secure the train. Meanwhile, General Zajączek contacted Poniatowski for help.|$|E
25|$|A {{protocol}} {{suggested by}} Saunders et al. assigns research reports to six categories, {{on the basis}} of research design, theoretical background, evidence of possible harm, and general acceptance. To be classified under this protocol, there must be descriptive publications, including a manual or similar description of the intervention. This protocol does not consider the nature of any comparison group, the effect of confounding variables, the nature of the statistical analysis, or a number of other criteria. Interventions are assessed as belonging to Category 1, well-supported, efficacious treatments, if there are two or more randomized controlled outcome studies comparing the target treatment to an appropriate alternative treatment and showing a significant advantage to the target treatment. Interventions are assigned to Category 2, supported and probably efficacious treatment, based on positive outcomes of nonrandomized designs with some form of control, which may involve a non-treatment group. Category 3, supported and acceptable treatment, includes interventions supported by one controlled or uncontrolled study, or by a series of single-subject studies, or by work with a different population than the one of interest. Category 4, promising and acceptable treatment, includes interventions that have no support except general acceptance and clinical anecdotal literature; however, any evidence of possible harm excludes treatments from this category. Category 5, innovative and novel treatment, includes interventions that are not thought to be harmful, but are not widely used or discussed in the literature. Category 6, concerning treatment, is the classification for treatments that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of doing harm, as well as having unknown or inappropriate theoretical foundations.|$|E

After Ichiro's wife, Chitose Hibiya, noticed that Freya—the first Chobit who was created to be the {{daughter}} {{she and her husband}} could never have—was becoming increasingly depressed as time went by, Elda was created to be her younger sister to cheer her up. Freya, however, {{had fallen in love with}} Ichiro, and the emotional pain of her unrequited love and her wish to not disturb her parents' happiness eventually caused her to severely malfunction. Elda took Freya's program, which included her mind and memories, into herself to preserve her memory. Before losing her own memories as a result of her actions, Elda requested to be left alone outside, away from her family, so that she would not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> of suffering the same fate as her sister.
