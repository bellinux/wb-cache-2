50|$|Liquidity is {{a crucial}} aspect of {{securities}} that are traded in secondary markets. Liquidity refers to {{the ease with which}} a security can be sold without a loss of value. Securities with an active secondary market mean that there are many buyers and sellers at a given point in time. Investors benefit from liquid securities because they can sell their assets whenever they want; an <b>illiquid</b> <b>security</b> may force the seller to get rid of their asset at a large discount.|$|E
40|$|We study a {{financial}} {{model with a}} non-trivial price impact effect. In this model we consider the interaction of a large investor trading in an <b>illiquid</b> <b>security,</b> and a market maker who is quoting prices for this security. We assume that the market maker quotes the prices such that by taking {{the other side of}} the investor's demand, the market maker will arrive at maturity with maximal expected wealth. Within this model we concentrate on the issue of contingent claims' hedging. ...|$|E
40|$|We study an {{equilibrium}} {{in which}} agents face surprise liquidity shocks {{and invest in}} liquid and illiquid riskless assets. The random holding horizon from liquidity shocks makes {{the return of the}} <b>illiquid</b> <b>security</b> risky. The equilibrium premium for such risk depends on the constraint that agents face when borrowing against future income; it is insignificant without borrowing constraint, but can be very high with borrowing constraint. Illiquidity, therefore, can have large effects on asset returns when agents face liquidity shocks and borrowing constraints. This result can help us understand why some securities have high liquidity premia, despite low turnover frequency...|$|E

40|$|We find {{evidence}} of a systematic link between monetary conditions and inter-temporal variation {{in the price of}} liquidity. Specifically, following an expansive monetary policy shift, funding conditions improve and market-wide liquidity increases, which is especially beneficial for <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities.</b> The improved liquidity and funding conditions reduce the returns required for holding <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities.</b> Consequently, <b>illiquid</b> stocks experience relatively large price increases when monetary conditions become expansive, and thus, the measured return spread between illiquid and liquid stocks expands substantially. Overall, our evidence supports the claim that the price of asset liquidity is dependent on monetary conditions. Illiquidity Liquidity Asset pricing Funding conditions Monetary conditions...|$|R

40|$|In early 2009, {{the supply}} of credit in {{industrial}} countries appeared to be tightening substantially. Was this because credit quality had deteriorated tremendously outside or inside the financial system? Or was it because bank balance sheets were “clogged ” with <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities?</b> If the latter, why did banks not attempt to sell these securities? We argue in this paper {{that the existence of}} an “overhang ” of impaired banks may itself reduce the price of potentially <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities</b> sufficiently that banks have no interest in selling them. In turn, this creates high expected returns to holding cash or liquid securities across the financial system and an aversion to locking up money in term loans.

50|$|Mini-tenders {{often provide}} {{a market for}} investors to sell <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities.</b> Some have argued that this {{assertion}} is invalid because the bidder would have more difficulty selling the shares than individual investors, since they have a larger block of accumulated shares.

40|$|Market {{liquidity}} profoundly impacts hedge funds. Funds trading <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities</b> earns {{significant risk}} premium, report smoother returns, can better leverage on information asymmetries, and grapple with stronger capacity constraints.

50|$|The {{bias ratio}} {{measures}} {{how far the}} returns from an investment portfolio - e.g. one managed by a hedge fund - are from an unbiased distribution. Thus the bias ratio of a pure equity index will usually be close to 1. However, if a fund smooths its returns using subjective pricing of illiquid assets the bias ratio will be higher. As such, it can help identify the presence of <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities</b> where they are not expected.|$|R

A recent accounting pronouncement, Financial Accounting Standard No. 157 (FAS 157): Fair Value Measurements, has mandated the quarterly and annual reporting of fair value for companies and investment firms. The three-tiered {{fair value hierarchy}} is composed of the following observable inputs: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.

We find that funds holding level 3 assets have higher value when funds trade at a premium, but lower value when funds trade at a discount. Both of these effects are magnified for funds {{with higher levels of}} unrealized appreciation.

40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} liquidity on market efficiency using data from short-horizon binary outcome securities traded on an online exchange. I show that the most liquid securities markets exhibit significant pricing anomalies, such as overpricing low probability events and underpricing high probability events, whereas less liquid markets do not exhibit these anomalies. I also find that the prices of <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities</b> converge more quickly toward their terminal cash flows. These {{results are consistent with}} the idea that liquidity is a proxy for non-informational or noise trading, which can impede market efficiency; but they are inconsistent with models in which increases in liquidity have no impact or a favorable impact on efficiency. ...|$|R

This over performance cannot be explained by fund age, leverage, serial correlation, backfill bias, or incubation bias. The capacity constraints are {{not confined to the}} smallest funds, and manifest across various investment styles and regions. In particular, they are strongest for funds managed by multiple principals that trade small, <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities,</b> suggesting that the observed diseconomies can be traced to price impact and hierarchy costs (Stein, 2002).

40|$|Although {{the prices}} in {{financial}} markets {{play an important}} role in improving allocative efficiency in the real economy, few models of securities markets explicitly incorporate resource allocation decisions. In this paper, we study the equilibrium in a securities market when the market price provides valuable information that can improve allocative efficiency. We show that a decision maker will subsidize liquidity in an <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities</b> market to gather valuable information about her decision payoffs. We also show that a decision maker's liquidity subsidy improves expected social welfare by enhancing allocative efficiency, but does not induce the socially optimal level of information acquisition. Finally, we demonstrate that the mere act of linking the allocation decision to the market price will typically enhance liquidity in the securities market. Overall, our results highlight the potential of using securities markets for information to improve decisions. ...|$|R
50|$|The Korn-Kreer-Lenssen model (KKL model) is a {{discrete}} trinomial model proposed in 1998 by Ralf Korn, Markus Kreer and Mark Lenssen to model <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities</b> and to value financial derivatives on these.

In contrast to Black-Scholes or Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model the market consisting of stock and cash is not complete yet. To value and replicate a financial derivative an additional traded security related to the original security needs to be added. This might be a Low Exercise Price Option (or short LEPO).

40|$|When {{faced with}} {{current and future}} {{liquidity}} needs, investors may behave myopically by liquidating the liquid securities, leaving the remaining portfolio vulnerable to future liquidity shocks; investors may also behave strategically by holding liquidity due to precautionary or speculative motives. Using a sample of U. S. insurers from 2001 through 2009, I directly test the theory by disentangling actuarial estimated expected liquidity need from current realized liquidity need. Empirical examination involves endogenity challenge because liquidity and trading of insurers are determined simultaneously. To address this issue, I implement the analysis in an event study (e. g. around Hurricane Katrina) framework. Controlling for regulatory constraints, insurer-level, securities-level characteristics, the analysis shows that the average insurers with large realized liquidity needs behave myopically by deleveraging the liquid securities; average insurers with large expected liquidity need behave strategically by holding and/or increasing liquid <b>securities,</b> and reducing <b>illiquid</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R
