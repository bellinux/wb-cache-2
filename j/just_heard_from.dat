2500|$|Nixon asked Anna Chennault {{to be his}} [...] "channel to Mr. Thieu" [...] {{in order}} to advise him to refuse {{participation}} in the talks. Thieu was promised a better deal under a Nixon administration. Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu {{had no intention of}} attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: [...] "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [...] is going to win. And you tell your boss [...] to hold on a while longer." [...] In 1997, Chennault admitted that [...] "I was constantly in touch with Nixon and Mitchell." [...] The effort also involved Texas Senator John Tower and Kissinger, who traveled to Paris on behalf of the Nixon campaign. William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained [...] "no useful inside information" [...] from his trip to Paris, and [...] "almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion". While Kissinger may have [...] "hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation," [...] this sort of [...] "self-promotion....is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets." ...|$|E

40|$|I {{agree with}} many of the points made by the {{previous}} speakers. In such cases, one has two choices: sit down, or synthesize and expand upon the prior observations. Being a law professor disposes me not to relinquish my time entirely, and so I suggest a synthesis of what you <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> particularly <b>from</b> the panelists on my far left-Mr. Romero, Mrs. Schlafly, and Dr. Murray...|$|R

60|$|He made no answer. The landlady, {{drawing the}} {{inevitable}} inference from {{the words that}} she had <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> looked <b>from</b> me to my mother-in-law {{in a state of}} amazement, which paralyzed even her tongue. I waited with my eyes on my husband, to see what he would do. If he had delayed acknowledging me another moment, the whole future course of my life might have been altered--I should have despised him.|$|R
60|$|That {{beautiful}} cottage {{which stands}} {{in the midst of}} most exquisite scenery, about two miles from Stanley's villa, is inhabited by Frank Morton and his family. That crow which you have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> proceed <b>from</b> the nursery was uttered by the youngest of five; and yonder little boy with broad shoulders, who thrusts his hands into his pockets in a decided manner, and whistles vociferously as he swaggers down the avenue, is Master George F. Morton, on his way to school.|$|R
5000|$|... "'If ever I {{heard an}} oversimplified fairy {{tale of the}} last years in Vietnam, I <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> one <b>from</b> you,' Mr. Kilpatrick said in one exchange. They {{peppered}} their remarks with 'Oh, come on, Jack' and 'Now see here, Shana' and helped make possible even-more combative talk shows, including Crossfire." [...] The debates between Kilpatrick and Alexander were such a feature of contemporary American culture that they were satirized on Saturday Night Live, with Jane Curtin taking Alexander's role on [...] "Weekend Update" [...] opposite Dan Aykroyd's version of Kilpatrick.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mother," [...] he said, earnestly, [...] "do, do give {{me leave}} to recall your proclamation. I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> of it <b>from</b> Rainiharo. Believe me, {{many of the}} nobles are not so good--I mean so guilty!--as you think. And the poor Christians--why should they not pray and sing? It is all that you have left to them, for they no longer dare to worship {{together}} in the churches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can hardly}} disbelieve this, sir, as I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> the story <b>from</b> Sergeant Malcolm. There were {{six in the}} house, and five {{have been carried out}} dead. One has been taken to Cong, and he is as good as dead. Their names are Kelly. An old man and an old woman, and another woman and three children. The old woman was very old, and the man appears to have been her son." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> {{the same}} <b>from</b> the other side; {{there is one}} attack on each side and two behind; Jean Bouvard has posted himself there. I am going round myself now; I do not {{think there will be}} any attack made in front. I have sent the archers here to the rear, where they will be more useful; the fellows in the outwork across there have enough to do to shelter themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything {{you like}} to ask and that I can give," [...] she {{answered}} {{in a tone of}} earnestness which struck him as peculiar, for of course he did not know the news that she had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Mr. Quest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad to see you. Get {{down and}} come in. <b>Just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> an Indian {{that you were}} coming. I'm the trader Withers," [...] he said to Shefford. His voice was {{welcoming}} and the grip of his hand made Shefford's ache.|$|E

6000|$|He was at {{this point}} when Lord Ormersfield entered, and after his daily civil ceremonious {{inquiries}} of the ladies whether they had walked or driven out, he turned to his son, saying, 'I met Mr. Calcott <b>just</b> now, and <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him that he had been sorry to convict a person in whom you took interest, a lad from Marksedge. What did you know of him?' ...|$|R
60|$|They {{went out}} on the quarter-deck, where the admiral {{repeated}} to his officers the story that he had <b>just</b> <b>heard,</b> and <b>from</b> them it soon circulated round the ship. Some of the crew had just cleaned the guns with which they had returned the salute fired by the Isis as she entered the port on arriving {{for the first time on}} the station, but they were scarcely surprised when, as the brigantine approached, the first lieutenant gave the order for ten more blank cartridges to be brought up, and for the crew to prepare to man the yards. But the surprise of those on board the other ships of war and the merchantmen was great when they saw the sailors swarming up the ratlines and running out on the yards.|$|R
40|$|Sounds of idling Diesel engines {{were rated}} {{according}} to their Dieselness with two different psychoacoustic methods. On the one hand, a yes/no procedure was used. Subjects were presented sounds of 1 500 ms duration and had to answer by “yes ” or “no ” to the following question: “Does the sound which you <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> stem <b>from</b> a Diesel engine? ” Histograms were calculated and a hypothesis was put forward as follows: The more positive answers are given to a specific sound, the larger is the Dieselness of this sound. On the other hand, the method of paired comparison was used, applying a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) procedure. Both procedures yield rather similar results with an advantage of the yes/no-procedure in efficiency. Comparisons of psychoacoustic evaluations with predictions of Dieselness by four different algorithms show much room for improvement of the instrumental evaluations. ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Next term," [...] said Mr. Jackson. [...] "I've <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Mr. Wain," [...] {{he added}} {{across the table}} to Mrs. Jackson. [...] "The house is full, but he is turning a small room into an extra dormitory, so he can take Mike after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very bad}} news indeed," [...] Mr. Hebblethwaite answered, raising his voice a little, so that every one at the table might hear him. [...] "I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the War Office that Germany has {{declared}} war against Russia. You will perhaps, under the circumstances, excuse me." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Humphreys now went to {{the door}} and gave a loud shout, and Dick, who had been waiting the signal agreed on at a short {{distance}} from the house, ran up and was soon in his parents' arms. A minute or two later his younger brother ran in, having <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> the news <b>from</b> Harrison, and it was indeed a happy party which that night assembled in the sitting-room of the farmhouse, and listened to Dick's account of the adventures he had gone through. Not a little proud were the father and mother, as they read Colonel Wood's testimony to the gallant conduct of their son.|$|R
6000|$|If Will Ladislaw {{could have}} overheard {{some of the}} talk at Freshitt that morning, he would have felt all his suppositions {{confirmed}} as to the readiness of certain people to sneer at his lingering in the neighborhood. Sir James, indeed, though much relieved concerning Dorothea, {{had been on the}} watch to learn Ladislaw's movements, and had an instructed informant in Mr. Standish, who was necessarily in his confidence on this matter. That Ladislaw had stayed in Middlemarch nearly two months after he had declared that he was going immediately, was a fact to embitter Sir James's suspicions, or at least to justify his aversion to a [...] "young fellow" [...] whom he represented to himself as slight, volatile, and likely enough to show such recklessness as naturally went along with a position unriveted by family ties or a strict profession. But he had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> something <b>from</b> Standish which, while it justified these surmises about Will, offered a means of nullifying all danger with regard to Dorothea.|$|R
50|$|Daisy {{takes the}} lodger to a pub {{and gives him}} brandy to warm him, hiding his {{handcuffs}} with a cloak. The locals, suspicious of the pair, pursue them, quickly gathering numbers until they are a veritable lynch mob. The lodger is surrounded and beaten, while Daisy and Joe, who have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> the news <b>from</b> headquarters that the real Avenger has been caught, try in vain to defend him. When all seems lost, a paperboy interrupts {{with the news that}} the real Avenger has been arrested. The mob releases the lodger, who falls into Daisy's waiting arms. Some time later the lodger is shown to have fully recovered from his injuries and he and Daisy are happily living together as a couple.|$|R

6000|$|... "There is no mistake," [...] Horace rejoined. [...] "I am repeating what I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the lodge-keeper himself.

Of course he refused to give it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] he cried. [...] "Why, this is gay. Who {{would ever}} have thought of a {{domestic}} couple like you going on such a lark as this. We <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> about it <b>from</b> old John, and we came down {{to see what you}} are up to. You've got everything very nice. I think I'd like this myself. Why, you might have a rifle-range out here. You could cut down those bushes {{on the other side of}} the creek, and put up your target over there on that hill. Then you could lie down here on the grass and bang away all day. If you'll do that, I'll come down and practice with you. How long are you going to keep it up?" ...|$|R
60|$|Among the savages, a frightful stillness succeeded the explosion, {{which had}} <b>just</b> been <b>heard</b> {{bursting}} <b>from</b> {{the bowels of}} the rock. But when Le Renard raised his voice in a long and intelligible whoop, it was answered by a spontaneous yell from the mouth of every Indian within hearing of the sound. The clamorous noises again rushed down the island; and before Duncan had time to recover from the shock, his feeble barrier of brush was scattered to the winds, the cavern was entered at both its extremities, and he and his companions were dragged from their shelter and borne into the day, where they stood surrounded by the whole band of the triumphant Hurons.|$|R
40|$|ExComm) Meeting at AsMA Headquarters in Alexandria, VA. I <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> the {{announcement}} <b>from</b> {{the flight deck}} that due to security regulations, for the next 30 minutes of flight all passengers cannot leave our seats. I will remember it this time, because during my previous flight departing Washington, DC, I forgot the warning and left my seat {{in a hurry to}} go to the lavatory 28 minutes after take off. Next thing that I re-member is attempting to sit down on the toilet and hearing loud banging on the door and somebody yelling at me to open the door and get back to my seat immediately. I pulled up my pants in record time, opened the door, and while apologizing to the flight at-tendant for my transgression I noticed the many pas-sengers who were looking at me in disbelief (at least i...|$|R
