5|$|This covers {{most of the}} reserve. Silver birch is dominant, with a few crack willow, <b>goat</b> <b>willow,</b> {{some wild}} cherry and {{sycamore}} in the canopy. Shrubs include hawthorn, elder, holly, yew and rowan, with garden escapes like buddleia, Oregon grape, cotoneaster, privet. There are some saplings of pedunculate oak, mostly around the edge, and holm oak. The field layer is mainly thick bramble, with ivy in denser shade. Ferns include male fern, broad buckler fern and the less common lady fern.|$|E
5|$|Ciomadul {{is covered}} by beech and spruce forests. Around St. Ana lake, the {{vegetation}} is mostly formed by Fagus sylvatica (common beech) and Picea abies (Norway spruce) woods. Other trees include Acer platanoides (Norway maple), Betula pendula (silver birch), Carpinus betulus (common hornbeam), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Salix caprea (<b>goat</b> <b>willow)</b> and Salix cinerea (grey willow). A fen contains Carex lasiocarpa (slender sedge), Carex rostrata (bottle sedge), Lysimachia thyrsiflora (tufted loosestrife) and Sphagnum angustifolium (fine bogmoss). At Mohos, vegetation consists of Alnus glutinosa (common alder), Betula pendula and Salix. The peat bog contains trees (Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens (downy birch)) and Ericaceae.|$|E
5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, <b>goat</b> <b>willow,</b> aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. The barren soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E

40|$|Leucostoma niveum, a fungus, {{causes a}} canker and dieback disease on aspen (Populus spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) {{as well as}} several other {{hardwood}} trees and shrub species. Susceptible hosts of this pathogen often are previously stressed by competition with neighboring vegetation, drought, nutritional deficiency, winter injury, and/or wounding. Therefore, L. niveum (hereafter referred to as Leucostoma) is considered an opportunistic pathogen, capable of colonizing stems or twigs either injured or weakened by other causes. Leucostoma canker occurs throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. The pathogen, L. niveum, causes disease on a broad range of hosts including alder (Alnus spp.), birch (Betula spp.), ironwood (Carpinus spp.), mountain ash (Sorbus spp.), aspen, and willow. Although the disease has been reported to affect 10 Salix species, descriptions depicting the disease cycle or damage of Leucostoma on susceptible willows in North America are limited to weeping (S. babylonica), black (S. nigra), and pussy (S. discolor) willows. However, in a 2009 survey of three coppice plantations in NY State, fantail (S. sachalinensis) and <b>goat</b> (S. caprea) <b>willows,</b> two Eurasian species, were the only shrubs affected by this pathogen. Fantail willow also was found to be susceptible to at least one related species, Valsa sordida. Host(s) and Distributio...|$|R

50|$|The {{scientific}} name, and {{the common}} name <b>goat</b> <b>willow,</b> probably derive from the first known illustration of the species in Hieronymus Bock's 1546 Herbal, where the plant is shown being browsed by a goat.
