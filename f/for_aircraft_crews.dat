40|$|This report {{describes}} a conceptual design for automation of the scheduling of airlift activities {{as part of}} the current upgrade of the MAC C 2 System. It defines the airlift scheduling problem in generic terms before reviewing the current procedures used by MAC; and then a new scheduling system aimed at handling a very busy and dynamic wartime scenario, is introduced. The new system proposes "Airlift Scheduling Workstations" where MAC Airlift Schedulers would be able to manipulate symbolic information on a computer display to create and quickly modify schedules <b>for</b> <b>aircraft,</b> <b>crews,</b> and stations. For certain sub-problems in generating schedules, automated decision support algorithms would be used interactively to speed the search for feasible and efficient solutions. Airlift Scheduling Workstations are proposed to exist at each "Scheduling Cell", a conceptual organizational unit which has been given sole and complete responsibility for developing the schedule of activities for a specific set of airlift resources-aircraft by tail number, aircrew by name, and stations by location. A Mission Scheduling Database is located at each cell to support the Airlift Scheduling Workstation, and requires information communicated by Airlift Task Planners, and, Airlift Operators at many other locations. These locations would have smaller workstations with local databases, and database management software to assist Task Planners and Operators in viewing current committed and planned schedule information of particular interest to them, and to allow them to send information to the Mission Scheduling Database. The Command and Control processes for Airlift have been structured into a three level hierarchy in this report: Task Planning, Mission Scheduling, and Schedule Execution. Task Planners deal with Airlift Users and Mission Schedulers, but not Airlift Operators. Task Planning has three sub-processes: Processing User Requests; Assigning Requirements and Resources; and Monitoring Task Status. Task planning does not create missions, schedule the missions, or route aircraft. Mission Schedulers deal with Task Planners and Airlift Operators, but not Airlift Users. Mission Scheduling combines several sub-processes to allow efficient schedules to be quickly generated at the ASW (Airlift Scheduling Workstation). These sub-processes are: Mission Generation, Schedule Map Generation (for each type of aircraft), Crew Mission Sequence Generation, Station Schedule Generation, Management of Schedule Status, and Monitoring Schedule Execution and Resource Status. It is important that all these processes be co-located and processed by the Airlift Scheduling Cell. Schedule Execution is performed by Airlift Operators assigned by the scheduling process. It has three sub-processes: Monitor Assigned Schedules, Report Resources Assigned to Schedule, Report Local Capability Status. The assignment of local resources such as aircraft by tail, and crew by name is actually another scheduling process, but has not been studied in this report. Airlift Operators do not deal with Task Planners, but may deal with Airlift Users to finalize details of the scheduled operations. This three level hierarchy is compatible with the current organizational structures of MAC Command and Control. However, it is clear that both the current organizational structures and procedures of MAC Command and Control for both tactical and strategic airlift will be significantly affected by the introduction of the automated scheduling systems envisioned here. These changes will occur in an evolutionary manner after the upgraded MAC C 2 system is introduced.

40|$|AbstractAircraft {{passengers}} {{are more and}} demanding in terms of thermal comfort. But {{it is not yet}} easy <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>crew</b> to control the environment control system (ECS) that satisfies the thermal comfort for most passengers due to a number of causes. This paper adopts a corrected predicted mean vote (PMV) model and an adaptive model to assess the thermal comfort conditions for 31 investigated flights and draws the conclusion that there does exist an uncomfortable thermal phenomenon in civil aircraft cabins, especially in some short-haul continental flights. It is necessary to develop an easy way to predict the thermal sensation of passengers and to direct the crew to control ECS. Due to the assessment consistency of the corrected PMV model and the adaptive model, the adaptive model of thermal neutrality temperature {{can be used as a}} method to predict the cabin optimal operative temperature. Because only the mean outdoor effective temperature ET∗ of a departure city is an input variable for the adaptive model, this method can be easily understood and implemented by the crew and can satisfy 80 – 90 % of the thermal acceptability levels of passengers...|$|R

40|$|For {{reasons of}} tractability, the airline {{scheduling}} problem {{has traditionally been}} sequentially decomposed into various stages (e. g., schedule generation, fleet assignment, <b>aircraft</b> routing, and <b>crew</b> pairing), with the decisions from one stage imposed upon the decision making process in subsequent stages. Although this approach greatly simplifies the solution process, it unfortunately fails to capture the many dependencies between the various stages, most notably between those of <b>aircraft</b> routing and <b>crew</b> pairing, and how these dependencies affect the propagation of delays through the flight network. Because delays are commonly transferred between late running <b>aircraft</b> and <b>crew,</b> {{it is important that}} <b>aircraft</b> routing and <b>crew</b> pairing decisions are made together. The propagated delay may then be accurately estimated to minimize the overall propagated delay for the network and produce a robust solution <b>for</b> both <b>aircraft</b> and <b>crew.</b> In this paper we introduce a new approach to accurately calculate and minimize the cost of propagated delay in a framework that integrates <b>aircraft</b> routing and <b>crew</b> pairing...|$|R

40|$|The airline {{industry}} {{has a long}} history of developing and applying optimization approaches to their myriad of scheduling problems. These problems have several challenging characteristics, the two most challenging of which include: 1) they span long- and short-term horizons, from strategic planning of flight schedules operated several months into the future, to real-time operations in which strategies must be developed and implemented immediately to recover scheduled operations from disruptions; and 2) they include multiple resources that must be coordinated, such as <b>aircraft,</b> <b>crews,</b> and passengers. While optimization approaches have been essential to the {{airline industry}} and effective in developing <b>aircraft</b> and <b>crew</b> schedules, historical models and approaches often fail to capture the complexity of airline operations. For example, approaches, often by necessity, involve a sequential, rather than an integrated process to develop schedules <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> and <b>crews,</b> and moreover, the process involves simplifying assumptions, including that future demands are known and deterministic, and that schedules are operated as planned. In more recent research on airline schedule optimization, advances have led to new schedule optimization models and approaches that more accurately reflect reality. As described in this presentation, the most notable contributions to these advances include: 1. 	Integrated <b>Aircraft</b> and <b>Crew</b> Schedule Optimization Approaches in which some of the <b>aircraft</b> and <b>crew</b> schedule decisions previously taken sequentially are integrated, moving closer to producing globally optimal schedules; 2. 	Dynamic Scheduling Approaches in which schedules are adjusted during the passenger booking period to reflect increased knowledge of booking patterns and to increase the schedules associated total revenue; and 3. 	Robust Optimization Approaches in which the stochastic nature of airline operations is modeled and realized schedule performance is optimized...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the controversy surrounding}} aircraft cabin air contaminated with oil. The {{focus is on the}} British Aerospace BAe 146 aircraft in Australia and the Australian Senate Inquiry which examined this aircraft. The aim is to examine bias in assessment and decision making processes surrounding health and safety by key stakeholders. The methodology utilises an interests-based approach drawing on two broad research disciplines, science and technology studies and the sociology of medicine. A number of stakeholders are scrutinised in order to better understand the health and safety implications <b>for</b> <b>aircraft</b> <b>crew</b> and passengers. Aviation industry deregulation is evaluated to provide a historical context to the often competing interests in aviation. The roles of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau are assessed both in terms of their obligations and claims. The hazard posed by Mobil Jet Oil II, the key cabin contaminant, is examined via research, publications such as Material Safety Data Sheets and government classification. British Aerospace assertions of aircraft safety are examined via its interpretation of a number of studies. The findings of the Australian Senate Inquiry are compared to the UK House of Lords Inquiry into cabin air quality and the US National Research Council study into cabin air quality. Finally the debates surrounding long term health implications such as Multiple Chemical Sensitivity are examined and research undertaken by pilots associations and other researchers asserting health problems is assessed. This thesis argues that key industry, government and regulatory stakeholders have shown significant bias in recognising and responding to the health and safety issues of cabin contamination. The consequences of such neglect, particularly when numerous other aircraft have been found to have similar problems, are increased risks to <b>crew,</b> passengers and <b>aircraft.</b> The risks of cabin fume exposure include short term health problems and long term illness, disease and disability...|$|R

Unmanned or so-called Remote Operated Vehicles (ROV) surveys are not bound by these limitations. The new unmanned generation of small and maneuvering vehicles can fly at levels of a few (even one) meters above the Earth’s surface, and thus follow the relief, while simultaneously making geophysical measurements. In addition, ROV geophysical investigations have extremely low exploitation costs. Finally, measurements of geophysical fields at different observation levels can provide new, unique geological-geophysical information. This chapter discusses future geophysical integration into ROV of measurements of magnetic and VLF electromagnetic fields. The use of GPS with improved wide-band Kalman filtering will be able to provide exact geodetic coordinates. A novel interpreting system for complex environments is presented that includes non-conventional methods for localizing targets in noisy backgrounds, filtering temporary variations from magnetic and VLF fields, eliminating terrain relief influence, quantitative analysis of the observed anomalies and their integrated examination. This system can be successfully applied at various scales for analysis of geophysical data obtained by ROVs to search for useful minerals, geological mapping, the resolution of many environmental problems, and geophysical monitoring of dangerous geological phenomena...|$|R
