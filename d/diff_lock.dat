50|$|The Summit VXL 1/16 was {{released}} on November 1, 2010. It is a smaller version of the 1/10 scale Summit without <b>locking</b> <b>diffs,</b> LED lights and dual steering servos. It {{is powered by a}} Velineon 380 4000kv brushless motor and a VXL-3m brushless ESC. Almost all of the major components are shared with the E-Revo VXL 1/16 {{with the exception of a}} few suspension parts, wheels, tires, body and bumpers. The claimed top speed is 25-40 mph depending on whether one or two battery packs are used. Optional front and rear LED lights are available, pre-drilled holes are located in the front and rear bumpers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Heuristic Diff Acquiring (HDA) protocol in Lazy Release Consistency (LRC) based distributed shared memory (DSM) systems. Based on the run-time detection of associations between locks and data, the HDA can selectively piggy-back useful page <b>diffs</b> in a <b>lock</b> grant message. By adopting the novel HDA protocol, an improved LRC {{model has been}} implemented, and the experimental results have been collected and analyzed. First, we introduce the Lazy Diff Acquiring (LDA) and Eager Diff Acquiring (EDA) protocols in the LRC based DSM systems. Second, we discuss the impact of LDA and EDA {{on the performance of}} the LRC-based DSM systems. Third, we propose the idea and implementation of the HDA protocol. Finally, we present and analyze the experimental results. From the experimental results, we conclude the HDA protocol can significantly improve the performance of LRC model.

50|$|The {{original}} design of utility ATVs was offered from 1996 to 2004 and featured single cylinder {{liquid or air}} cooled motors from 250 to 500cc's, {{and all of a}} common design. This Arctic Cat-designed motor was manufactured by Suzuki and featured a 2V SOHC design with hemispherical combustion chambers. Manual and CVT automatic transmissions were offered. A 650V2 V-twin engine option borrowed from the Kawasaki Prairie was also offered starting in 2003. A major redesign of the platform was launched in 2005. With the new redesign came new body work, electronics, rear mounted gas tank and a standard front <b>locking</b> <b>diff,</b> though the chassis in general remained largely unchanged. A new high performance engine platform also debuted in the 650H1. This H1 platform was a direct evolution of the previous suzuki manufactured engines with many parts being interchangeable, but was now manufactured by Arctic Cat in the US. A 700EFI model was also offered which used an engine and transmission combo borrowed from the Suzuki king quad model. This is a 4V dohc design with no relation to the H1 engine platform. This was replaced with the 700H1 which was a higher displacement version of the 650H1 with fuel injection added. A 1000cc H2 V-twin engine, was also made available. Arctic Cat utility ATV's are primarily designed and marketed toward utilitarian uses such as farm work and hunting. Compared to other ATVs, they offer very high ground clearance, low gear ratios for towing, and large steel racks for hauling large loads, and large fuel tanks for extended range. The high ground clearance and locking differentials make them particularly adept off road. They also offer 2 up models, and the TBX model which features a large dump box and high payload capacity, and a Mud Pro model which features factory air snorkels to allow it to drive nearly submerged, larger mud tires, and stronger driveline components.|$|R
5000|$|A locking {{differential}}, differential lock, <b>diff</b> <b>lock</b> or locker is {{a variation}} on the standard automotive differential. A locking differential may provide increased traction compared to a standard, or [...] "open" [...] differential by restricting each of the two wheels on an axle to the same rotational speed without regard to available traction or differences in resistance seen at each wheel.|$|E
50|$|A {{six-speed}} {{manual gearbox}} (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: CRB) (gear ratios - 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.711) {{was the only}} transmission choice. Audi's Torsen-based 'trademark' quattro permanent four-wheel drive system was standard. Front and rear final drive units contained a conventional 'open' differential, and have a ratio of 4.111, although the rear (parts code prefix: 01H, identification code: AZE) also has an electro-mechanical <b>diff</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|Beyond the engine, {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the Grizzly 600 (offered in the US from 1998 to 2001) and the Grizzly 660 (introduced in 2002), is the rear suspension. The older Grizzly has a rigid rear axle with a single shock. The newer Grizzly has independent rear suspension with dual shocks. This {{is reported to have}} significantly improved the handling characteristics of the newer model.The Grizzly includes push button 4 wheel drive and <b>diff</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Both five- and {{six-speed}} manual transmissions (parts code prefix: 01E, identification codes: five-speed: CBD, CET, six-speed: CBL, CMG) {{were offered}} to European customers, but a five-speed manual {{was the only}} transmission available in North America; a four-speed automatic transmission (parts code prefix: 01F, identification code: CBF) was available as an option worldwide. [...] Front and rear axle final drive ratio is either 4.111 or 3.889 (dependent on transmission type), and the rear axle (parts code prefix: 017, identification codes: AAT, AET) uses a driver-selectable electro-pneumatic-mechanical switchable <b>diff</b> <b>lock.</b>|$|E
50|$|The locking centre {{differential}} {{was still}} fitted until early 2001, although the linkage to operate {{it was not}} attached, as Land Rover believed that the traction control and newly developed Hill Descent Control would render it redundant. The actual locking mechanism was removed in early 2001, before being fully reinstated (with linkage) with the facelifted 2003 model. Whilst the traction control system worked very effectively, it did not offer {{the same level of}} control and smooth operation as the vehicles fitted with the differential lock. Customer demand saw the <b>diff</b> <b>lock</b> controls fully reinstated as a cost option only (standard on top of range HSE/SE vehicles) on UK/Irish models, and aftermarket kits are offered by several vendors for those vehicles which were produced with the lock, but not the linkage.|$|E
50|$|For all manual {{transmission}} models except Previa, and the 1988 and newer Celica, {{there is a}} small button inside the vehicle labelled Center <b>Diff.</b> <b>Lock</b> and when activated, the transfer case locks, resulting in the power distribution to be 50/50 between the front and rear of the vehicle. The wheels themselves are not always going the same speed because there are still the open front and open rear differentials allowing for differences in wheels speed from left to right. The final result of this is that if the vehicle is in a situation where traction is uneven or poor (i.e. muddy or snowy), all four wheels will have power transmitted to them, allowing the vehicle to use the wheels that still have traction to move the car. However, due to the open rear and front differentials, if the road conditions are very slick the wheels with the least amount of traction will still spin at a faster rate then those that do have traction.|$|E
50|$|Quattro car {{production}} was 11,452 vehicles {{over the period}} 1980-1991, and through this 11 year production span, despite some touch-ups, there were no {{major changes in the}} visual design of the vehicle. For the 1983 model year, the dash was switched from an analogue instrument cluster, to a green digital liquid crystal display (LCD) electronic instrument cluster. This was later changed in 1988 to an orange LCD electronic instrument cluster. The interior was redesigned in 1984, and featured a whole new dash layout, new steering wheel design, and new centre console design, the switches around the instrument panel were also redesigned at this time. In 1985 the dash changed slightly with harder foam and lost a diagonal stripe, the dash switches were varied slightly and the <b>diff</b> <b>lock</b> pull knob gave way to a two-position turning knob with volt and oil temp digital readouts.External styling received very little modification during its production run. Originally, the car had a flat fronted grille featuring four separate headlamplenses, one for each of the low and high beam units. This was altered for the 1983 model year, and replaced with combined units featuring a single lens, but housing twin reflectors. This was changed again, for the 1985 model year, in what has become known as the 'facelift model' and included such alterations as a new sloping front grille, headlights, and trim and badging changes. Max speed was 124 mph. The RR 20v Quattro also featured a new three spoke steering wheel design, leather covering for door arm rests, gloveboxes, centre console and door pockets. There was also a full length leather-wrapped centre console running {{all the way to the}} rear seats. The 20v was also the first Ur-Q to have 'quattro' script interior with partial leather seats. The floor on the driver's side had a bulge due to dual catalytic exhaust setup. The different models may be distinguished by the emblems on their boot lids: the WR had a vinyl 'quattro' decal or a brushed aluminium effect plastic emblem, the MB had chrome plated 'Audi', 'Audi rings' and 'quattro' emblems, whilst the RR had only chrome plated 'Audi rings'.|$|E
