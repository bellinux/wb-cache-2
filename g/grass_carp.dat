To better understand the epidemiology and ecology of the bacterium, we carried out a surveillance study to investigate possible seasonal variation in the recovery of L. hongkongensis and its distribution in various organs in retail freshwater fish in Hong Kong. Forty whole freshwater fish of two species (20 <b>grass</b> <b>carps</b> and 20 bighead carps), and intestines from 120 <b>grass</b> <b>carps</b> were sampled during a one-year period. L. hongkongensis was isolated from 11 (55 %) of the 20 <b>grass</b> <b>carps</b> and 6 (30 %) of the 20 bighead carps; and the intestines of 49 (41 %) of 120 <b>grass</b> <b>carps.</b> Seasonal variation in the recovery of L. hongkongensis from both whole fish and intestines was observed, with higher isolation rates in spring and summer than in fall and winter. There was also positive correlation between temperature and the isolation rates. When L. hongkongensis was cultured in vitro at different temperatures, shorter lag time and higher growth rate were observed at higher temperatures, with 37  °C being optimal among the tested temperatures. L. hongkongensis was commonly found in the gills, stomachs and intestines in both <b>grass</b> <b>carps</b> and bighead carps, and on the skin surface of one fish, but not in other organs. Proper handling of freshwater fish for cooking, especially the gills and gut, is recommended to prevent acquisition of L. hongkongensis, and other freshwater fish related infections. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Laribacter hongkongensis is a gram-negative {{emerging}} bacterium {{that has}} been isolated from patients with underlying liver diseases and is associated with gastroenteritis and traveler’s diarrhea. Freshwater fish are postulated to be the reservoir of this bacterium and a possible source for human infections. Previous study showed that the bacterium targets liver and causes histopathological changes in adult zebrafish. The {{first part of the}} present study therefore aims to evaluate the histopathological effect of the bacterium in liver of <b>grass</b> <b>carps</b> and to investigate the association between recovery of L. hongkongensis and liver histopathological changes. The livers of the <b>grass</b> <b>carps</b> were grossly unremarkable and they were categorized into either necrosis, steatosis, or no abnormality detected upon professional examinations of the tissue sections. Statistical analysis indicated that there was no association between the recovery of L. hongkongensis from the intestines and the histopathological changes in the livers of <b>grass</b> <b>carps.</b> The second part of the study aims to study the extended-spectrum ß- lactamase (ESBL) phenotype and ESBL genes in L. hongkongensis fish isolates. Using the ESBL phenotypic test recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), 8 out of 14 fish isolates were shown to be ESBL-positive. However, further PCR tests could not detect the presence of any ESBL genes (TEM, SHV, OXA- 1 or CTX-M). Among these 8 isolates, ampC gene was detected in 6 of 8 isolates using PCR. The inconsistent phenotypic and genotypic results prompted the investigation of the role of AmpC on the ESBL phenotype. To examine the effect of AmpC on ESBL phenotype, boronic acid (BA), which was shown to be an effective AmpC inhibitor, was included in the ESBL phenotypic test. Addition of BA diminished the ESBL phenotype in all the 8 isolates. The absence of AmpC amplification in 2 of 8 isolates with ESBL phenotype may be due to primer mismatch and deserves further follow-up to confirm its presence. Altogether, these results suggested that the CLSI ESBL phenotypes previously identified were possibly due to the presence of AmpC β-lactamase. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R

As well, amino acid analysis of available fish HIF-α and -β sequences reveals that they contain all functional domains shown to be important for mammalian HIF function, including the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain, Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain, and the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), which render the HIF-α subunit sensitive to oxygen levels. The evolutionary similarity between HIF sequences in fish, tetrapods and birds, as well as the conservation of important functional domains suggests that HIF function and regulation is similar between fish and mammalian species. There is also evidence of novel HIF mechanisms present in fish not found in mammals.

40|$|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations {{predicts that}} {{worldwide}} harvest output of aquatic products will be stagnant or decreased whereas {{the consumption of}} aquatic products will be increased {{at the speed of}} 1. 0 % to 2. 9 %. The increase of aquatic product output will mainly be attributed to the development of aquaculture. For a developing country, especially for a country with a large population and fast developing pace as China, aquaculture in the 21 st century will not only face favorable developing opportunities but severe challenges as well. 1. A brief introduction to the development of Chinese aquaculture. China has a very long history in aquaculture. Chinese aquaculture industry has witnessed the growth rates of more than 10 percent every year. Since 1989, China's aquatic product output has been in the first place of the world. At present, it accounts for 40 % of the world's aquatic product output, among which the aquaculture output accounts for 70 % of that of the world. China thus becomes the only fishery country that aquaculture output exceeds fishing yield, with 9 billion US dollars of export volume which accounts for 30 % of the total export volume of agricultural products. Export of aquatic products has enhanced China's international competitiveness in the field of fishery, thus promoted the development of domestic aquaculture and aquatic processing. In 2006, the freshwater aquaculture area was 60, 200 hectares and the aquaculture output was 19. 5 million tons which accounted for 97 % of the total output of cultured fishes. Aquaculture is a vibrant industry in China, Chinese aquaculture producers are rapidly upgrading their technology to produce species such as black <b>carps,</b> <b>grass</b> <b>carps,</b> silver carps, bighead carps, tilapia, catfish, eel, shrimp, abalone, sea bass, turbot, sea bream, red drum, crab, flounder, trout, mussels, salmon and more. 2. A major challenge for Chinese aquaculture. China suffers from environmental pollution and a shortage of freshwater resources. The problems of shortage of water resources and water quality-induced water shortage become more and more prominent in China. The current fishery pattern costs a great deal of resources and we need to shift the fishery pattern to the resource saving and environmentally friendly orientation. This is not only a scientific issue but also a social issue. However, the current scientific development of fishery in China does not meet the transformation of fishery growth modes. 3. Aquaculture should be resource saving and environmentally friendly. How to make aquaculture be shifted to the resource saving and environmentally friendly orientation? Simply speaking, in order to realize the goal of shifting to the resource saving and environmentally friendly orientation, sustainable aquaculture mode will become the direction of China's aquaculture. Sustainable aquaculture must consider the ecological, social, and economic aspects of development. Recently, governments and industry have realized that the focus of aquaculture must evolve into the development of an industry that is both environmentally and socially sustainable in the long term. Positive changes are being made with this growing interest and awareness of improving the sustainability of aquaculture. With the expected expansion of aquaculture in the coming years it will be vital that sustainable practices be implemented and further developed to avoid environmental and social problems. There are a number of alternative ways forward in the development of aquaculture, which can offer more sustainable solutions. In some cases these methods have been around for centuries, but they have rarely been adopted in the modern aquaculture industry, and in other cases they are innovative practices that can be explored by aquaculture proponents. Alternatives include ecological aquaculture, organic aquaculture, polyculture, mollusc farming, and closed and low discharge systems. These alternative practices have been successfully implemented in different areas of the world; however, they must be examined for their application on a wider scale. Concerns for water conservation and reduced waste discharges have prompted the increased use of closed recirculating aquaculture systems. The systems are made up of three basic components: culture tank, settling tank, and biological filter. Recirculating systems have less of an impact upon the environment because of their closed nature - wastes and uneaten feed are not simply released into the ambient environment in the manner that they are with netpens and exotic species and diseases are not introduced into the environment. In recirculating systems, wastes are filtered out of the culture system and disposed of in a responsible manner. Recirculating systems can be built just about anywhere, including in urban settings where they can use existing structures and be placed close to markets, thereby reducing transportation costs. Recirculating systems can be used to grow a wide variety of fish species year-round in controlled environments. Species commonly grown in recirculating systems include hybrid striped bass and tilapia. Additionally, much research has been dedicated to developing recirculating systems for marine species of fish and this technology holds much promise. Ecological aquaculture has been defined as "an alternative model of aquaculture research and development that brings the technical aspects of ecological principles and ecosystems thinking to aquaculture". Ecological aquaculture focuses on the development of farming systems that preserve the environments in which they are situated and enhances the quality of these environments {{while at the same time}} maintaining a productive culture system. All aspects of the operation are interconnected in order to minimize negative impacts on the community, both natural and social. Ecological aquaculture can also be incorporated into sustainable fisheries management and coastal zone management. In 2007, Shanghai has launched the construction of standard ecological aquaculture bases, as a means to transform its traditional aquaculture model. The base will form an ecological system, with 20 ponds with distinct functions such as seedling raising, prawn-farming, a fish pond and artificial wetland. A 1200 hektares ecological aquaculture area will be completed during the 11 th five-year-plan period. Shanghai will explore a low-cost and highly efficient way to popularize the application of aquaculture model. 国連FAOによると，最近，水産物の消費量は増加する一方で，漁獲量は現状維持あるいは減少傾向を，養殖生産物は増加傾向を示している。発展途上国，とりわけ人口増加と産業発展の著しい中国では， 21 世紀に水産養殖の著しい発展が望まれる。中国における水産養殖は，歴史が古く，最近では年 10 ％以上の成長率を示しており，その生産量は 1989 年以降世界最大である。今日，世界に占める中国の割合は漁獲量で 40 ％，養殖生産量で 70 ％に達する。中国は水産国であり，養殖生産量は漁獲量を超え，その 30 ％にあたる 9000 億円を輸出している。淡水養殖は， 2006 年において面積 60, 200 ヘクタール，生産量 1950 万トン（全体の 97 ％）に及び，その養殖技術は著しく向上している。また一方では，中国は環境汚染と水資源不足に悩んでいる。最近の漁業パターンは膨大な資源を消費するため，資源保護と環境保護にシフトすることが，科学的にもまた社会課題としても重要である。しかし，最近の水産科学の発展は，必ずしも水産業の育成に活かされていない。今後，資源節約型で環境に優しい持続可能な水産養殖が重要であり，生態学的，社会的，かつ経済学的視点から発展させる必要がある。代替養殖として，生態学的養殖，有機養殖，多種養殖，貝養殖，閉鎖低排水型システムなどがあげられる。これらは，広大な規模で実証されることにより世界へ広めることが可能である。生態学的養殖は，「生態学的原理と生態系を考えた養殖の研究と発展の代替モデル」と定義できる。生態学的養殖は，生産量の増加と同時に環境の改善をも図ることに焦点を当てており，持続可能な資源管理と沿岸区域管理も含んでいる。上海は， 2007 年に，標準的な生態学的養殖基地を開始した。その基地は種苗生産，エビ養殖，養殖池や人工湿地帯などのように異なる機能からなる 20 の池をもつ生態学的システムからなる。第 11 期 5 カ年計画で 1200 ヘクタールの生態学的養殖域が完成した。上海は，水産養殖モデルの適用を広めるために，さらに低コストで高効率な手法を開発するだろう。Invited Lecture...|$|R
