It also eliminates the need to infer market timing based on the actions of corporate insiders or other indirect measures. We find a strong positive relation between {{the degree to which}} a firm is overvalued and the proportion of the firm's <b>financing</b> <b>deficit</b> that is funded with equity. This result is found cross-sectionally and through time and is robust to firm size, and other variables known to impact capital structure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{financing}} decisions adopted by firms in financial distress {{are very important}} {{because most of the}} strategy decisions such as investments, market entry, or product diversification are considerably affected by the financial constraints faced by them. However, these decisions are still not well known and empirical evidence about firms in financial distress is controversial. Previous studies do not find support for either the trade-off theory or the pecking order theory, which explain the financial decisions of healthy firms. Distressed firms frequently have to use all of their available financial resources to cover their <b>financing</b> <b>deficit.</b> This could give rise to a concave quadratic relationship between fi nancing defi cit and net debt issued, which might well explain the ambivalent results about the financial decisions of these firms. To analyze this quadratic relationship, which has not been studied previously, we perform an empirical analysis on a sample of 3, 337 listed firms from Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Our results show that the pecking order theory {{does not appear to have}} a higher explanatory power in healthy firms. Moreover, the hierarchy suggested by the pecking order theory is not totally applicable in firms in financial distress. Our results show that as <b>financing</b> <b>deficit</b> grows, these firms use debt decreasingly, which gives rise to a concave quadratic relationship between <b>financing</b> <b>deficit</b> and net debt issued. This suggests that firms in financial distress have diffi culty issuing new debt. Our results also show that firms in financial distress have a greater probability of issuing equity. Therefore, these fi rms can use equity financing as an alternative to debt issuance...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion that}} firms have debt ratio targets {{and that this}} is a primary {{determinant}} of financing behavior is influential in finance. Yet, how definitive is the available evidence? We examine this question by benchmarking the dynamics of actual debt ratios and the pattern of financing after major leverage-changing events against what is observed when samples are generated through simulations in which no target behavior is assumed. We find that the collective evidence that has been interpreted as indicative of target behavior is much weaker than is generally recognized. Specifically, the simulated data show similar reversal of the debt ratio and patterns of debt and equity issuance after major issuance activities or shocks to stock returns as in the actual data. We attribute the former to a mechanical reversal that exists on average, even with random financing, if the debt ratios are above or below a cut-off, and the latter to persistence of the <b>financing</b> <b>deficit</b> around major issuance activities. Some of the evidence in the actual data, however, can only be replicated if the simulation samples are modified to accommodate a specific type of “market timing ” behavior. Lemmon, Roberts, and Zender (2006) find that differences in initial leverage ratios persist over time; remarkably, the simulated data exhibits similar persistence.

This result is consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, our research confirms that the level of <b>financing</b> <b>deficit</b> has a positive influence on the employees ’ equity issues decision.

Furthermore, in joint tests, only the fitted values from the PO model equation continue to have additional explanatory power over fitted values from the TO model.

Our novel estimation approach is able to consistently estimate heterogeneous speeds of adjustment in different regimes {{as well as to}} properly test for the threshold effect. We consider several proxies for adjustment costs that affect the asymmetries in capital structure adjustments and find evidence that firms with large financing imbalance (or a deficit), large investment or low earnings volatility adjust faster than those with the opposite characteristics. Firms not only adjust at different rates but also seem to adjust toward heterogeneous leverage targets. Moreover, we document a consistent pattern that firms undertaking quick adjustment are over-levered with a <b>financing</b> <b>deficit</b> and rely heavily on equity issues to make such adjustment...|$|E
