40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{platooning}} of square-back vehicles {{on top of a}} road. When two or three bodies are following each other with a short distance between them, the presence of the preceding body changes significantly the pressure force in front of the following one as a weak flow is present in between. The preceding body plays the role of a buckler and so the following body has to face completely different flow conditions. Therefore the drag coefficient of the following bodies can be drastically reduced as shown on the results. But the reduction is strongly linked to the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> and the differences are significant.

40|$|So {{far there}} has been no {{reliable}} method to calculate the Casimir force at separations comparable to the root-mean square of the height fluctuations of the surfaces. Statistical analysis of rough gold samples has revealed the presence of peaks considerably higher than the root-mean-square roughness. These peaks redefine the minimum separation <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> and can be described by extreme value statistics. Here we show that the contribution of the high peaks to the Casimir force can be calculated with the proximity force approximation, while the contribution of asperities with normal height can be evaluated perturbatively. This method provides a reliable estimate of the Casimir force at short distances, and it solves the significant, so far unexplained discrepancy between measurements of the Casimir force between rough surfaces and the results of perturbation theory. Furthermore, we illustrate the importance of our results in a technologically relevant situation. ...|$|E

Phase averaging is exploited to resolve the mean time evolution of the flow and the signal from a single constant temperature hot wire probe is employed as phasing reference. The flow-field information obtained from visualizations agrees well with quantitative indications provided by measures, and the comparison allows to precisely understand what information can be extracted from simple visualizations. As a result, new insight in flow mechanism is obtained from {{the analysis of the}} flow data showing that, for the analyzed plate distance, the gap between the two plates behaves substantially as a cavity while the vortex formation process takes place in the wake region behind the aft plate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} {{and physical}} analysis of magnetoelastic phenomena {{is a topic}} of ongoing research. Dierent formulae have been proposed to describe the magnetic forces in macro-scopic systems. We discuss several of these formulae {{in the context of}} rigid magnetized bodies. In case the bodies are in contact, we consider formulae both in the framework of macroscopic electro-dynamics and via a multiscale approach, i. e., in a discrete setting of magnetic dipole moments. We give mathematically rigorous proofs for domains of polygonal shape (as well as for more general ge-ometries) in two and three space dimensions. In an accompanying second article, we investigate the formulae in a number of numerical experiments, where we focus on the dependence of the magnetic force on the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> and on the case when the two bodies are in contact.

40|$|Viscous {{flow past}} {{two or more}} spherical {{particles}} in direction parallel or perpendicular to the line connecting the body centers is studied numerically at Reynolds number up to 200. The FEM is used to simulate the flow structure for different arrangements and diameters of the spheres.

The results show the downstream spheres face a reduced drag compared to a single sphere and that the upstream one changes its drag coefficient according to the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies.</b> In the case of side by side arranged spheres, an effect of repulsion exists up to a certain separation distance and after that a weak pulling effect appears. A configuration of three (or more) spherical particles arranged in „V“ formation was examined where one body is set to be a leading and the others are located symmetrically up and down behind it. The flow characteristics are studied when the angle behind the leading sphere vary from 40 ° to 180 °.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the interaction of}} two identical disks freely falling {{side by side in}} a fluid at rest for Reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 300, corresponding to rectilinear and oscillatory paths. For the three aspect ratios of the disks investigated, we observed that the bodies always repel one another when the horizontal distance between their centres of gravity is less than 4. 5 diameters. They never come closer for distances spanning between 4. 5 and 6 diameters. Beyond the latter distance, the disks appear indifferent to each other. For both rectilinear and periodic paths, the repulsion effect is weak, leading to an overall horizontal drift lower than 3 % of the vertical displacement. We propose a model for the repulsion coefficient Cr, which decreases with the separation <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> and is inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the bodies, Cr thus being stronger for the thicker ones. Furthermore, {{in the case of the}} oscillatory paths, we show that the effect of the interaction reduces to the repulsion effect, since the characteristics of the oscillatory motion of each disk appear unaffected by the presence of the companion disk and no synchronization is observed between the paths, nor between the wakes, of the two disks...|$|E

40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{solution}} to the problem of two-dimensional separated flow around multiple-body circular cylindrical structures is presented. The method is applied to the case of two identical cylinders where the free-stream direction is perpendicular to the line joining the centers. The effect of the bodies and their wakes on the outer potential flow is modelled by surface source distributions over the front wetted surfaces. The flow in the wakes, generated by the source distributions, is ignored. The condition of the zero normal velocity is applied over the front surface to obtain an integral equation for the source strength. This equation is solved with the condition of finite velocities at the separation points to find the unknown source strength distribution and the positions of the separation points. The pressure distribution on the front wetted surface is then calculated through Bernoulli's equation. The pressure distribution on the rear surface exposed to the wake is assumed to be determined by the separation values. The effects of the <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> on the flow pattern, position of the separation points, wake under-pressure and the resultant forces are analysed. The most significant feature of the present flow model is that no empirical parameters are needed for the analysis.
