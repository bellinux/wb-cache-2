Students in early childhood and junior kindergarten have shared tablets available, and each kindergarten through the fourth group class has at least four. Students study in classrooms equipped with wireless overhead projectors, manipulate programs and presentations on touchscreen-equipped SMART board systems, and engage in self-paced classroom learning using ActiveExpression wireless response systems.

An <b>extranet</b> is similar to a DMZ in that it provides access to needed services for authorised parties, without granting access to an organization's entire network.

40|$|Project <b>extranets</b> {{are adopted}} to improve {{information}} management, communication and collaborative working in construction industry. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} their development, evolution and implementation. The benefits, barriers and success factors surrounding the use of project <b>extranets</b> are also documented. However, although the general functionalities of project <b>extranets</b> have been identified and described, {{there is still a}} lack of systematic way to analyze the functionalities provided by different systems and required by various users. To bridge this gap, this research develops a novel approach aiming to find the differences, major components and potential improvements from the integrated analysis to systems' provisions and user requirements. This approach, named, Provision & Requirement (P&R) approach starts with the reviews to the development and use of project <b>extranets</b> and outlines the characteristics of such systems. It has then listed and grouped the function and associated features into some categories, in order to set the criteria for the analysis from system provisions and user requirements. Afterwards, it conducts investigations by case study and questionnaire survey, aiming to gather functionalities provided by selected sample systems and to elicit user requirements to the listed functionalities. The results help the author to classify the functionalities hierarchically based on their availability in the products and users' preferences. The investigations have therefore established the fundament for proposing the P&R approach and conduct further analysis by comparing the provisions and requirements. Through the analysis, the author reaches research findings, by presenting the differences, major components and possible improvements of functionalities of project <b>extranets.</b> Later, the research findings are validated and proposed approach is consolidated by interviews, leading to the answers to the research questions and concluding research outcomes. The main contribution of this research is that it develops a novel approach to analyze functionalities in project <b>extranets.</b> This approach aims to integrate both systems provisions and user requirements into consideration. By doing so, this approach studies system vendors and users' perspectives to functionality issues, to reflect their respective attitude and make the comparison, in order that researchers can have wider knowledge from different research angles and achieve the balance on the issues of systems' provisions and user requirements. So, this research has established a holistic approach of analysing functionalities of project <b>extranets,</b> rather than focusing only on one part from either vendors or users, which in return has contributed to its uniqueness and distinctiveness. The result may be useful to system vendors, customers and researchers involved in {{the development and implementation of}} project <b>extranets</b> or other web-based information systems. The research has put forward to the ideas for other similar research, with more holistic consideration to all stakeholders involved in the studied topics. It can also be used to develop other methodologies that consider the adaptation of elements of one industry's practice to another, thus satisfying other research gaps...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reports {{published}} by Sir John Egan and Sir Michael Latham {{indicate that the}} construction industry must adopt new technologies to improve areas of construction management. The use of construction project <b>extranets</b> {{is one of these}} new technologies. This paper sets to identify the barriers that influence the imple-mentation of construction project <b>extranets</b> in the UK construction industry. A critical review of current litera-ture was conducted, and an in-depth questionnaire and supportive interview were then used to explore the implementation of <b>extranets,</b> identifying their main benefits and barriers. The main benefits identified are im-proved communication, document storage, and drawing management process. The main barriers identified are; Technical; insufficient technology infrastructure and low levels of usability. People; resistance to change, insufficient training, low utilisation of functions and a lack of understanding of the benefits. Managerial; low levels of management commitment, lack of client support, lack of a sufficient protocol document, lack of inte-gration meetings, and low usage levels. This paper highlights that there are still many barriers to CPE imple-mentation, however, following the proposed recommendations coupled with improved management of the implementation process, and a high commitment from the entire project team these barriers, that influence the successful implementation of CPEâ€™s, can be overcome...|$|R
