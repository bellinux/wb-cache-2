5000|$|The {{diversity}} factor {{is almost always}} greater than 1 since all components {{would have to be}} on simultaneously at full load for it to be one. The aggregate load [...] is time dependent as well as being dependent upon <b>equipment</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The {{diversity factor}} recognizes that the whole load does not equal {{the sum of its parts}} due to this time interdependence (i.e. diverseness). For example, we might have ten air conditioning units that are 20 tons each at a facility. In Florida we typically assume that the average full load equivalent operating hours for the units are 2000 hours per year. However, since the units are each thermostatically controlled, we do not know exactly when each unit turns on. If the ten units are substantially bigger than the facility's actual peak A/C load, then fewer than all ten units will likely come on at once. Thus, even though each unit runs a total of 2000 hours a year, they do not all come on at the same time to affect the facility's peak load. The diversity factor gives us a correction factor to use, which results in a lower total kW load for the ten A/C units. If the energy balance we do for this facility comes out within reason, but the demand balance shows far too many kW for the peak load, then we can use the diversity factor to bring the kW into line with the facility's true peak load. The diversity factor does not affect the kWh; it only affects the kW.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: According to {{the problem}} that the {{components}} of HVAC system have the strong coupling and the low energy efficiency, a kind of optimal model for HVAC based on system energy input ratio (SEIR) is proposed. Firstly, according to each <b>equipment</b> <b>characteristic,</b> the performance curve model of each equipment power is built. Based on these models, the performance curve model of system energy consumption is built too. Then, basing on energy conservation constraint, each equipment performance constraint and coupling constraint, the constraint equation is built. Finally, simplifying the model parameter, taking the least energy input ratio as an objective function, the optimal set point model of various equipments is built. The experimental results indicate that compared with the least energy consumption optimal method, the model has better energy saving effect...|$|R

30|$|Recycling gas {{drilling}} {{is a new}} drilling technology. This paper can {{be divided}} into three parts, with the purpose of introducing and analyzing the characteristics of this new technology. First, the major <b>equipment</b> <b>characteristic</b> of this technology was introduced. Secondly, compared with conventional gas drilling, Angel’s model was used to analyze the wellbore flow characteristics. Due to the closed loop and the effect of back pressure caused by the equipment, the gas ow rate decreases dramatically during drilling. Apart from this, it is also found that the kinetic energy at the casing shoe is always smaller than that {{at the top of the}} collar. The proposing of the drilling limit concept points out the basic difference between the two gas drilling technologies. Lastly, according to the results of the theoretical analysis, gas supplement operations for the wellbore must be conducted. Thus, two gas supplement schemes are presented in this paper, to provide some guidance for field operations.|$|R
