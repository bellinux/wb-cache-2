40|$|The Internet 2 {{consortium}} {{members from}} California Institute of Technology and CERN developed effective fiber optic network, sending data upto 11, 000 kilometers between Caltech's LA laboratories and CERN's campus in Geneva {{at a rate}} of 6. 25 Gb/s. The 68, 431 terabit- meters per second data transfer was accomplished using the IPv 4 protocols that power the public Internet. Network run by Internet 2, called Abilene maintains the highest capacities in the world, connecting dozens of <b>GigaPOP's</b> with OC- 192 c 10 Gb/s Ip backbone. The member institutions of Internet 2 keep Abilene 10 % to 15 % full, but the researchers also use the network as a base for the latest Internet technologies and experiments, which include development of IPv 6.

50|$|BiSON {{utilizes}} optical Wave division multiplexing (WDM) {{equipment to}} deliver multiple lambdas to each member institution. Each lambda provides a capability for multiple Gigabit Ethernet links, {{which are used}} for transport to member institutions and WAN services provided by the Front Range <b>GigaPoP</b> (FRGP). BiSON uses a ring configuration design to provide redundancy {{in the event of}} a fiber cut or equipment failure.|$|E
50|$|CENIC also {{engages in}} {{networking}} peering relationships, in particular Pacific Wave (a joint project between CENIC and the Pacific Northwest <b>Gigapop,</b> the University of Southern California, and the University of Washington), which provides peering facilities along the Pacific {{coast of the}} United States. Pacific Wave participants include networks in Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Qatar, Taiwan, Singapore, and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Given the n-way {{nature of}} multi-party conferencing, the {{platform}} is optimised for use on multicast networks, generally supported by academic, government and research networks like Internet2 rather than the commodity Internet. However, Reflector Services accommodate unicast clients in ConferenceXP multicast sessions. The only publicly available reflectors current reside on the Pacific Northwest <b>Gigapop</b> (University of Washington) and at the Northern Illinois University School of Music.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Lights Local Exchange Point (NLLXP) {{is a free}} Internet Exchange Point (IXP) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the United States. The NLLXP public peering {{exchange}} is closely linked with the Northern Lights <b>GigaPoP</b> (NLG), an Internet2 project of the University of Minnesota Office of Information and Technology: the NLG is the regional Internet2 access point for research and educational institutions, and the NLLXP is the regional peering exchange between those institutions and commercial networks, and among commercial networks.|$|E
50|$|The Spokane Symphony in {{conjunction}} with the Welty Family Learning Center at the Martin Woldson Theater at the Fox offers Master Classes with Guest Artists which are free and open to the public. The Fox is equipped with an Internet2 capacity of 1 gigabyte per second speed through Pacific Northwest <b>Gigapop,</b> allowing the unique opportunity for selected classes to be conducted interactively over the Internet2 with educational institutions in other locations, and local audiences and participants viewing from the beautiful venue at the theater.|$|E
50|$|As of October 2009, the CNGI effort {{comprises}} six nationwide backbone {{networks and}} 39 GigaPOPs (<b>Gigapop</b> {{is short for}} gigabit point-of-presence, an access point to Internet2), which extends the next generation footprint to over 20 major cities and over 300 academic, industrial, and government research campuses within China. Five backbones are commercial (operated by China Telecom, China Unicom, China Netcom/CSTNET, China Mobile, and China Railcom), with an additional academic research network operated by CERNET, which is known as CNGI-CERNET2. CNGI also encompasses two exchange points (IX) in Beijing (named CNGI-6IX) and Shanghai for interconnecting these backbones and for international links to APAN (Asia Pacific Advanced Network), GEANT, and Internet2.|$|E
50|$|The {{university}} has 150 laboratories, one computer center, {{a number of}} computerized language labs, and an Analysis and Technology Consulting Center which cooperates with local industries on their manufacturing and production. In 2006, the university also established an Incubator Center, which assists local industries in research and development. In addition to the aforementioned facilities and resources, NIU also has a library that occupies nearly 1.7 ha and holds over 200,000 books, including nearly 1000 periodicals relating to various research fields. In early 2006, NIU was granted the capacity {{to serve as the}} <b>GigaPoP</b> ("gigabit point-of-presence") for Taiwan Advanced Research & Education Network (TWAREN). As a result, NIU is in charge of providing a high-bandwidth network connection to research and academic institutes within Ilan county.|$|E

40|$|The University of Pennsylvania in the United States and its {{affiliated}} <b>GigaPoP,</b> MAGPI, {{together with}} the University of Grenoble in France are {{in the planning stages}} of a collaborative effort to demonstrate the educational potential of utilizing the new, high performance research networks, Renater 2 and Internet 2. Through the creative use of interactive video, video archived material, and web tools such as "Blackboard," this project will open new areas of opportunity for distance education by combining the elements of networking and video technology with multimedia teaching skills. A pilot demonstration is proposed initially to bring two classes of students together to negotiate a business transaction. This will require a proficiency in the foreign language and the ability to transact business across time zones and cultural obstacles. Both aspects of the lesson are very real requirements in the commercial world we live in today. The use of live, high quality video, and the reference to hypothetical archived video clips and web material will make the experience even more meaningful for the students. Faculty from both Universities will contribute to the structure and content of the material under the premise that any technological enhancements will be made available to them. Upon a successful completion of the demonstration, funding will be sought for a full term course that may include multiple sites and multiple age groups...|$|E
40|$|After the World Wide Web {{and other}} great inventions of the {{academic}} world, comes Internet 2. The new Inter-University project is rapidly evolving into a powerful consortium. 181 universities, 60 American companies and a few dozen international institutions are collaborating to create the communications technologies of the future. Their main focus is to rid themselves of the terrible congestion that exemplifies the Internet and create a new fast multimedia connection between research institutions. They promise that all this will be done far from the intrusion of the private market, a market that, according to the four fathers of Internet 2, "stifles creativity". The foundations of Internet 2 are comprised of two main technological notions. The first is the <b>Gigapop,</b> which is a regional network's interconnection point to the new Internet 2 cutting edge services. Some types of Gigapops are being constructed so that Internet 2 members can connect solely to Internet 2 services, while other Gigapops are being constructed to connect non Internet 2 members to various other services, such as the old Internet (a. k. a. the commodity Internet or Internet 1). The second technological notion is QoS, which stands for Quality of Services and is a new method of sending information around more efficiently. The basis of QoS is to create priorities for the information sent. In this way crucial medical information will have priority when compared to chess game simulations. The implementation of these two notions, together with other innovative technologies, requires {{a vast amount of}} funding, which is partly private but mainly governmental. The methods discussed here for budgeting and funding of institutions for the Internet 2 project are interesting and are a main force in the shaping of Internet 2. Moreover, they will also influence important infrastructure and technical decisions yet to be made, such as routing methods, protocols and speeds that will shape and mold I 2. The following research deals with both the technology and infrastructure needs and the advantages to be gained by the Internet 2 project worldwide. This {{is the first time that}} readers are exposed to a comprehensive survey of the financial and technological aspects gained from the implementation of the project...|$|E
