5|$|During {{his time}} as an All-Star, McGrady was {{frequently}} criticized <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> led any team beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. Some analysts have defended McGrady, feeling that he was the victim of bad rosters and unfortunate circumstances. His effort level, leadership, and toughness were also questioned at times. In response to these criticisms, former Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy described McGrady as a poor practice player but praised his coachability, unselfishness, and ability to perform well in big games.|$|E

5|$|In North America and elsewhere, some Heathen {{communities}} have formalized such values into an ethical code, the Nine Noble Virtues (NNV), {{which is based}} largely on the Hávamál from the Poetic Edda. There are different forms of the NNV, with the number nine having symbolic associations in Norse mythology. Opinion is divided on the NNV; some practitioners deem them too dogmatic, while others eschew them <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> authentic roots in historical Germanic culture, negatively viewing them {{as an attempt to}} imitate the Judeo-Christian Ten Commandments. The NNV are not universal among Heathens, and it has for instance been noted that they are rare among Swedish practitioners.|$|E

Media attention focused {{on the quality of the}} bowl selection, as both teams were criticized <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> strong schedules. Attention also focused on how Virginia Tech's defense would contain Michigan QB Denard Robinson.|$|E

Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> had a single visitor.|$|E

5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} where the Ning-Po unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed {{autogyro}} created by Q. Near a volcano, Bond is attacked by helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon {{turns out that the}} true mastermind behind this is SPECTRE, whose mysterious leader is revealed to be Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who has been hired by the People's Republic of China to start a Soviet-American war. Blofeld summons Osato <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> killed Bond, who immediately blames his assistant, Helga Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her into a pool filled of piranhas. Brandt is forced to pay for her failure with her life by being devoured alive, and Blofeld instructs Osato to kill Bond.|$|E

5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E
5|$|Born in Birmingham, Alabama, {{he moved}} {{with his family to}} Decatur, Illinois at age11. Prior to his senior year in high school, his family moved to Detroit. In 1945, {{following}} Fonville's lone track season at Detroit's Miller High School, he was named Michigan High School Track & Field Athlete of the Year for his first-place performance at the Detroit City League Meet. Fonville's winning effort in the shot put was five feet better than that of the state champion. Later that summer, Charlie Fonville and Jessie Nimmons competed in the Detroit YMCA Track Championship as a two-man team for the St. Antoine YMCA; Fonville won the 100m, 200m, high jump, and shot put. Fonville and Nimmons won the 440yard relay, with each of them running 220yard legs. They were later disqualified <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> four runners. They finished in second place at the meet; their disqualification in the 440 preventing them from winning.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to conservative pressure to constrain Röhm, Hitler left for Neudeck {{to meet with}} Hindenburg. Blomberg, who had been meeting with the President, uncharacteristically reproached Hitler <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> moved against Röhm earlier. He then told Hitler that Hindenburg was close to declaring martial law and turning the government over to the Reichswehr if Hitler did not take immediate steps against Röhm and his brownshirts. Hitler had hesitated for months in moving against Röhm, {{in part due to}} Röhm's visibility as the leader of a national militia with millions of members. However, the threat of a declaration of martial law from Hindenburg, the only person in Germany with the authority to potentially depose the Nazi regime, put Hitler under pressure to act. He left Neudeck with the intention of both destroying Röhm and settling scores with old enemies. Both Himmler and Göring welcomed Hitler's decision, since both had much to gain by Röhm's downfall– the independence of the SS for Himmler, and the removal of a rival for the future command of the army for Göring.|$|E

5|$|Initial plans {{called for}} {{operations}} to commence on 1January 2000, but this soon proved difficult. In November, NSB paid {{out the other}} major shareholders, and were left with an 89% ownership of the company. The company needed dispensation from the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority to allow temporary employments of engineers. When the company had announced the positions, only one engineer had applied for the twelve jobs. Instead an agreement was made with NSB to rent personnel, thus delaying the start until 3September. But because the engineers needed to be recertified, the start was delayed again, to 5November. In the end, Timetoget was forced to recruit and train new drivers. It received criticism <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> as extensive training as NSB, but the company stated that this would not affect safety. The labor union recommended its members not to apply for jobs with Timetoget, since they did not provide a pension agreement, collective bargaining or guarantees to return to NSB, should the concept fail.|$|E
5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. James has appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E
5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered a mixed bag, both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E
