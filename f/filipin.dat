40|$|<b>Filipin,</b> {{a widely}} used {{fluorescent}} sterol marker {{is also a}} potent antibiotic. In this study we address the reliability of <b>filipin</b> as a monitor of ergosterol in fungal cells. A revised staining protocol was developed to minimize any biological effect of the compound. Germinating conidia of Penicillium discolor stained with <b>filipin,</b> displayed a fluorescent cap {{at the location of}} germ tube appearance and formation. During germ tube emergence, the fluorescent intensity of the cap increased. This was confirmed by HPLC as an increase of the net cellular ergosterol content. <b>Filipin</b> staining is absent during early germination, while FM dyes, similar molecules, stain the plasma membrane after 1 h. This indicates that the conidial cell wall is no barrier for <b>filipin.</b> To evaluate if <b>filipin</b> does bind ergosterol in situ, natamycin, more specific to ergosterol, was added before <b>filipin</b> staining. This resulted in a marked decrease in fluorescence indicating high ergosterol levels. This was characterized further in ergDelta-mutant cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing altered sterols.

Exposure of virions to <b>filipin</b> resulted {{in a series of}} depressions and ridges in the envelope of VS virions, with a periodicity of 15 to 20 nm perpendicular to the long axis of the particle; similar morphological alterations were observed in negatively stained preparations, in thin-sectioned virions, and in protease-treated virions that lack surface glycoproteins. This morphological effect was specific for <b>filipin,</b> since the envelopes of VS virions that had been treated with another polyene antibiotic, amphotericin B, exhibited markedly different morphology. Morphological alterations induced by <b>filipin</b> in influenza and Rauscher leukemia virions differed from those seen in VS virions. The infectivity of filipin-treated VS virions was reduced up to 500 -fold, whereas influenza virions were resistant to <b>filipin</b> treatment.

40|$|Background: Streptomyces filipinensis is the {{industrial}} producer of <b>filipin,</b> a pentaene macrolide, archetype of non-glycosylated polyenes, and widely {{used for the}} detection and the quantitation of cholesterol in biological membranes and {{as a tool for}} the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick type C disease. Genetic manipulations of polyene biosynthetic pathways have proven useful for the discovery of products with improved properties. Here, we describe the late biosynthetic steps for <b>filipin</b> III biosynthesis and strategies for the generation of bioactive <b>filipin</b> III derivatives at high yield. Results: A region of 13, 778 base pairs of DNA from the S. filipinensis genome was isolated, sequenced, and characterized. Nine complete genes and two truncated ORFs were located. Disruption of genes proved that this genomic region is part of the biosynthetic cluster for the 28 -membered ring of the polyene macrolide <b>filipin.</b> This set of genes includes two cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase encoding genes, filC and filD, which are proposed to catalyse specific hydroxylations of the macrolide ring at C 26 and C 1 ' respectively. Gene deletion and complementation experiments provided evidence for their role during <b>filipin</b> III biosynthesis. <b>Filipin</b> III derivatives were accumulated by the recombinant mutants at high yield. These have been characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance following high-performance liquid chromatography purification thus revealing the post-polyketide steps during polyene biosynthesis. Two alternative routes lead to the formation of <b>filipin</b> III from the initial product of polyketide synthase chain assembly and cyclization <b>filipin</b> I, one trough <b>filipin</b> II, and the other one trough 1 '-hydroxyfilipin I, all <b>filipin</b> III intermediates being biologically active.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the polyene antibiotic, <b>filipin,</b> on the {{morphology}} of erythrocyte membranes and lipid dispersions has been investigated with the electron microscope using negative staining (phosphotungstate). <b>Filipin</b> induces pit formation in rat and human erythrocytes; similar pits are also produced by the antibiotic in lecithin cholesterol dispersions. Pit formation requires the presence of cholesterol. Evidence is presented {{which suggests that the}} light ring surrounding each pit may consist predominately, if not exclusively, of sterol which had interacted with the antibiotic. Pits are not produced in lecithin-cholesterol dispersions by derivatives of the antibiotic which have little (perhydrofilipin) or no (irradiated <b>filipin)</b> hemolytic activity.

The relevance of these observations to current concepts regarding the mode of <b>filipin</b> action is discussed.

40|$|AbstractFilipin, a {{macrolide}} polyene antibiotic, {{is known}} to interact selectively with ergosterol, a constituent of fungi membranes. In this work, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluorescent analog of ergosterol, dehydroergosterol (DHE), and <b>filipin</b> was measured in small unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at 25 °C. The time-resolved FRET results were rationalized {{in the framework of}} the mean concentration model, and were complemented with steady-state fluorescence intensity, anisotropy and absorption measurements. The results point to the formation of both DHE–filipin aggregates (evidence from static quenching of DHE fluorescence by <b>filipin)</b> and filipin–filipin aggregates (evidence from: (i) the FRET acceptor concentration distributions; (ii) spectral changes of <b>filipin</b> absorption in the vesicles, the excitonic interaction suggesting a stack arrangement; (iii) <b>filipin</b> fluorescence self-quenching), even in presence of DHE and low antibiotic mole fractions (< 1 mol%). These results point out that apparently contradictory biochemical models for the action of <b>filipin</b> (some based on the presence of sterols, others not) can be equally valid. Moreover, since results (ii) and (iii) are also observed when a sterol is present, both models of action can actually coexist in membranes with a low sterol content...|$|E

40|$|The {{organization}} of the polyene antibiotic <b>filipin</b> in membranes containing cholesterol is a controversial matter of debate.

Filipin's orientation is determined by the presence/absence of cholesterol when it is inserted in gel crystalline phase model membranes. When cholesterol (33 %) is present in DPPC bilayers, <b>filipin</b> stands perpendicular to the membrane surface as expected in "pore-forming" models. At variance, absence of cholesterol leaves <b>filipin</b> in an essentially random organization in the lipidic matrix.
