2500|$|A New Russian {{and an old}} man lie injured {{side-by-side}} in {{an emergency}} room: [...] "How did you get here, old fella?" [...] / [...] "I had an old Zaporozhets car, and I installed my war trophy Messerschmitt jet engine in it. While driving on a highway, I saw a Ferrari ahead and tried to overtake it. My speed was too high, I lost control, and crashed into a tree... And {{how did you get}} here?" [...] / [...] "I was driving my Ferrari when I saw a Zaporozhets overtaking me. I thought that my car might have broken down again, and had coasted to a stop. So <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> stepped out..." ...|$|E
60|$|My mother spoke {{over the}} banisters, and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> let in McPherson.|$|E
60|$|She nodded, and I {{led the way}} upstairs. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{closed it}} again softly, leaving them alone....|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to Catriona {{and stopped}} {{her on the}} threshold.|$|R
60|$|WHEN I {{arrived at}} my rooms, my {{colleague}} hurried {{to meet me}} <b>the</b> moment <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{must try}} also. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Pouf! It shut with a bang. We all exclaimed with joy.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{was alone}} when I entered. She looked up quickly as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> turned away {{disappointed}} when she recognized me.|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} the boarder was yelling and {{pounding}} at the door. When Euphemia was ready <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> took her out.|$|E
60|$|Grieved that I had unintentionally roused her fear, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called Dumps. My doggie rose, {{with his}} three {{indicators}} erect and expectant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardieu!" [...] quoth <b>I,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> [...] "it seems, Lieutenant, that I {{must have}} fallen asleep over those musty documents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} no second opportunity, Miss Gracedieu, of {{insulting}} me." [...] With that foolish reply, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> violently and went out.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for him, and, {{taking up}} his brick again, he entered, and I {{followed}} him in. There was a deal of talk.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> as Ganymede obediently {{slipped past}} me and {{vanished}} down the passage [...] "Monsieur l'Hote," [...] I called. [...] "Ho, there, Gilles!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> a {{storm of}} sleet and spray stung our faces. Old Pegg, who had been there to sell and collect tickets, shouted to us.|$|E
6000|$|Then, {{with all}} the blood in my body {{seemingly}} surging into my head, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> on the instant heard Hiram say in an exceedingly friendly tone: ...|$|E
60|$|The hostess was all ears, {{struck by}} the respectful manner in which this very evidently noble lady {{addressed}} a Fool. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for her.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} writing. The {{air of the}} room was thick with {{cigarette}} smoke. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gently, and Lady Dennisford glided past me. I myself hastened downstairs.|$|R
60|$|I {{had not yet}} sat down, and I {{went first}} to see who it was. When <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> Madame Fosco confronted me with my {{handkerchief}} in her hand.|$|R
60|$|No answer. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> went in. The {{room was}} empty. What's more, the bunk hadn't been slept in. I don't know when I've been more surprised. I went on deck.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> {{there in}} fact stood a girl {{dressed in a}} neat-fitting dark calico, with a straw bonnet, simply tied with some dark ribbon, and a veil which {{concealed}} her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame Gravois, in the Rue Bienville," [...] she repeated. [...] "I shall remember. A demain, Monsieur." [...] She courtesied {{and went}} swiftly into Mrs. Temple's room. Seizing my hat, <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{found myself in}} the dark street.|$|E
6000|$|... "'The boy 'ad got it,' he ses. 'Now shall <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and {{let your}} missis in, or would you rather {{stay where you are}} in peace and quietness?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Easy," [...] commented Billy, relieved. [...] "Get {{ready to}} beat it when <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>I</b> got a pony south o' town that'll {{have to carry}} double for a little way tonight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn' make nobody hear {{at all by}} knocking," [...] apologized Jonathan Kail, for it was he at last; [...] "and as't {{was raining}} out <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> I've brought <b>the</b> things, sir." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> admitted, {{not only}} Mr. Wickfield, but Uriah Heep. I {{had not seen}} Mr. Wickfield for some time. I was {{prepared}} for a great change in him, after what I had heard from Agnes, but his appearance shocked me.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} I heard the nurse {{going down the}} passage and with her my daughter, whom she was taking for her morning walk. <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> called Jane in, a {{beautiful}} little being with dark eyes and golden hair.|$|E
6000|$|Just {{here there}} was an eager {{footstep}} on the stair; <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> my aunt Mary burst into the room. It was a joyful meeting and a cheery bombardment of questions and answers concerning family matters ensued. By and by my aunt said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Minna left us, {{with her}} {{pretty little head}} carried high in the air. [...] "Mrs. Wagner is a person entirely without sentiment!" [...] she indignantly whispered to me in passing, when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless my soul!' thought Tom at last. 'Perhaps {{he lives}} here, and is calling to me. I {{never thought of}} that. Can <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> from <b>the</b> outside, I wonder. Yes, to be sure I can.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hah! I am of a fair size, {{but could}} not have the honour of {{presenting}} myself in that room without a ladder. Now, madam, frankly--frankness {{is a part of}} my character--shall <b>I</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{students}} {{all left}} on the night train; and the town sounded as quiet as the campus of a correspondence school at midnight. When I went to the hotel I saw a light in Andy's room, and <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> walked in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, ma'am, quite sure," [...] she returned, indignant {{at having}} her sacred word doubted. [...] "He {{was with her}} on the steps when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> shook hands with her just like an old friend when he went away; and she was quite dry." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Bundercombe rather precipitately preceded me. If he had {{contemplated}} escape, however, he {{was doomed}} to disappointment. Mrs. Bundercombe followed us in. She reminded us of her presence by a hard cough as Eve saluted me {{in a somewhat}} light-hearted fashion.|$|E
60|$|I {{think it}} did good. Anyhow, after {{that he used to}} grin when <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> instead of {{greeting}} me as formerly with a face the picture of despair. But to return to our inexperienced friend.|$|R
6000|$|She was not mistaken, {{for when}} <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> a {{neighbor}} said, [...] "I've brought you Mrs. Fletcher. Met her walking to Fairmead across the prairie. No; I guess I'm in a hurry, and won't get down." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{scarcely}} had <b>I</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> when <b>I</b> {{heard voices}} in the sitting-room, and scarcely had I entered the sitting-room when I found that these proceeded from Jeeves and what appeared at first sight to be the Devil.|$|R
