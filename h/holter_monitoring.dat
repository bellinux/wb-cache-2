50|$|In addition, an {{isolated}} incident of a non-sustained 14-beat ventricular tachycardia (Figure 1), with a maximum heart rate of 215 beats per minute, was recorded using in-flight <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> aboard the Mir.

50|$|Another {{interesting}} {{innovation is}} the presence of a triaxial movement sensor, which records the patient physical activity, and later shows in the software three different statuses: sleeping, standing up, or walking. This helps the cardiologist to better analyze the recorded events belonging to the patient activity and diary. <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> is a very useful part of an ECG.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} no {{definitive}} data showing that long-duration space flight is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, there are observational data that have been documented over many years that are suggestive of cardiac electrical changes during long flights. For example, during Skylab, all 9 American crewmembers exhibited some form of rhythm disturbance. Most of these rhythm disturbances consisted of single PVCs and were clinically insignificant. However, one crewmember experienced a 5-beat run of ventricular tachycardia during a lower-body negative pressure protocol, and another had periods of “wandering supraventricular pacemaker” during rest and following exercise. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the corrected QT interval (QTc), a marker of ventricular repolarization, was prolonged slightly in a small number of astronauts after long-duration space flight. In-flight <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> was not performed during these space flights. Thus, it is not known whether this prolongation was associated with any known arrhythmias. In-flight <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> was undertaken in the early Space Shuttle era.|$|E

50|$|ERT, {{formerly}} known as Cardio Data Systems, was founded in 1972 and analyzed ambulatory Holter electrocardiograms and conducted its first research study in 1975. By {{the end of that}} year the company expanded into the largest U.S. <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> research provider of evaluating cardiovascular drugs for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 1979, the company analyzed 4,500 Holter readings for the National Institutes of Health’s Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial. The study resulted in the recommendation to use the drug propranolol {{for at least three years}} in patients who have had a recent heart attack and who need to have their heart rate slowed down.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory {{diagnosis}} for AV blocks include electrolyte, {{drug level}} and cardiac enzyme level tests.

In order to properly diagnose {{a patient with}} AV block, an electrocardiographic recording must be completed (ECG). Based on the P waves and QRS complexes that can be evaluated from these readings, that relationship will be the standardized test if an AV block is present or not. In order to identify this block based on the readings the following must occur: multiple ECG recordings, 24-hour <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring,</b> and implant loop recordings. Other examinations {{for the detection of}} an AV block include electrophysiologic testing, echocardiography, and exercise.|$|E

40|$|Diseases of the {{cardiovascular}} system {{rank among the}} most frequent causes of death. This thesis called ``The role of the nurse taking care of patients with the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor</b> when they are discharged home`` deals with this non-invasive examination of {{the cardiovascular}} system. Timely diagnostics is of high importance to show a number of diseases. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with diseases of the cardiovascular system. The diseases mentioned include: the syncope, arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease and hypertension. Further, it deals with the non-invasive examination {{by means of the}} <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor,</b> which is connected with the diseases mentioned before. This is followed by informing the patient in connection with this examination, communication skills of the medical staff with the patient and the education in this non-invasive examination. The practical part of the thesis lays down three objectives. The first objective was to find out whether patients with the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor,</b> when being discharged home, have sufficient information on this examination. The second objective focused on nurses, and finding out the way nurses view their role as the educator of the patients with the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor.</b> The third objective was to find out whether patients were afraid of this examination. Next, three hypotheses were set up. The first hypothesis supposed that nurses working in outpatient and inpatient cardiac care facilities had enough information on the electrocardiograph monitoring and blood pressure by means of the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor.</b> The second hypothesis supposed patients with the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor,</b> when being discharged home had sufficient information on this examination. The third hypothesis supposed that nurses educated patients with the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor</b> on discharging them home. All objectives were fulfilled and hypotheses confirmed. To fulfil the objectives and confirm the hypotheses, I used the quantitative method. To collect data I used a questionnaire for patients and another one for nurses. The research set consisted of nurses working in selected outpatient facilities of the Kardiologie Medipont s. r. o. and Kardioecho s. r. o. in České Budějovice and in selected inpatient cardiac care facilities. Further, a questionnaire investigation with patients with the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor</b> from the same health care facilities as the nurses. 80 questionnaires were handed out to patients and 80 questionnaires to the nurses. 53 questionnaires were given back by the patients and 39 questionnaires by the nurses. This thesis could acquaint the public and medical staffs with the prevention and symptoms of cardiovascular diseases, thus attracting their attention to the importance of timely diagnostics and treatment. Further, it could be of beneficial to inform the health care facilities the survey was conducted in, with the results. Nurses have a lot of roles during their work. Their role as the educator, which undoubtedly ranks among them, is essential in the diagnostics by the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitor...</b>|$|R
50|$|Premature atrial contractions (PACs), {{also known}} as atrial {{premature}} complexes (APC) or atrial premature beats (APB), are a common cardiac dysrhythmia characterized by premature heartbeats originating in the atria. While the sinoatrial node typically regulates the heartbeat during normal sinus rhythm, PACs occur when another region of the atria depolarizes before the sinoatrial node and thus triggers a premature heartbeat. The exact cause of PACs is unclear; while several predisposing conditions exist, PACs commonly occur in healthy young and elderly people. Elderly people that get PACs usually don't need any further attention besides follow ups due to unclear evidence. PACs are often completely asymptomatic and may be noted only with <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring,</b> but occasionally they can {{be perceived as a}} skipped beat or a jolt in the chest. In most cases, no treatment other than reassurance is needed for PACs, although medications such as beta blockers can reduce the frequency of symptomatic PACs.|$|E
50|$|Most of the Holters {{monitor the}} ECG just {{in two or}} three channels. Depending on the model (manufacturer), {{different}} counts of leads and lead systems are used. Today’s trend is to minimize the number of leads to ensure the patient’s comfort during recording. Although two/three channel recording has been used {{for a long time in}} the <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> history, recently 12 channel Holters have appeared. These systems use the classic Mason-Likar lead system, thus producing the signal in the same representation as during the common rest ECG and/or stress test measurement. These Holters then serve as a substitute stress test examination in cases the stress test is not possible for the current patient. They are also suitable when analyzing patients after myocardial infarction. Recordings from these 12-lead monitors are of a significantly lower resolution than those from a standard 12-lead ECG and in some cases have been shown to provide misleading ST segment representation, even though some devices allow setting the sampling frequency up to 1000 Hz for special-purpose exams like the late potential.|$|E
5000|$|Single PVC {{are common}} in healthy persons. The {{prevalence}} of PVCs has been estimated to be about 1% to 4% for the general population. Age has been seen {{to play a major}} role in the occurrence of PVCs throughout the population. The prevalence is seen to be under 1% for those under the age of 11 and ranges all the way up to 69% in subjects that are older than 75 years. [...] Older patients are more likely to experience PVCs and this may be due to its prevalence in patients with high blood pressure and heart disease, which are both commonly seen more in patients of older ages. In 101 people free of heart disease during 24 hours <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring,</b> 39 had at least 1 PVC, and 4 at least 100. Heart disease was excluded after physical examination, chest x-ray, ECG, echocardiography, maximal exercise stress test, right- and left-heart catheterization and coronary angiography. In 122,043 United States Air Force flyers and cadet applicants during approximately 48 seconds of ECG 0.78% (952 males) had PVC within all age groups, but with increased incidence with increasing age. Ventricular ectopy is more prevalent in men than in women of the same age data from large, population-based studies indicate that the prevalence ranges from less than 3% for young white women without heart disease to almost 20% for older African American individuals with hypertension.|$|E

50|$|A {{physical}} examination {{should be conducted}} after a full history has been taken. This is useful in determining any possible heart defects that might be causing the palpitations. For example, some cases of premature ventricular contraction have a mitral-valve prolapse which can be determined through the {{physical examination}}.The next step in diagnosis is a 12 lead ECG which can be performed in the doctors’ office over {{a short period of}} time; however this is often non-conclusive in diagnosis because it is not very sensitive and there is only a small chance of a premature ventricular contraction occurring in the short period of time. <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> is a far better method for diagnosis as it is continuous recording of the heart’s rhythm over a period of 24 hours, or event monitoring which records noncontinuously for 30 days or indefinitely. This increases the likelihood of a premature ventricular contraction occurring during the recording period and is therefore more useful in diagnosis.Another method of detection of PVCs is a portable electrocardiogram device known as an event recorder that can be carried around for home monitoring of the heart's activity. Both the Holter monitor and the event recorder can help to identify the pattern of a PVC. The significance of a patient's PVCs can be monitored and diagnosed through exercise stress electrocardiogram. If the premature beats go away during the exercise test then they are considered to be harmless, but if the exercise provokes the extra beats than it may indicate higher risk of serious heart rhythm problems.|$|E

40|$|Background: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), {{an important}} and treatable cause of ischaemic stroke, can occur as a sustained or a paroxysmal arrhythmia. Continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (<b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring)</b> is often performed in stroke patients to identify paroxysmal AF, which is an indication for warfarin anti­coagulation in this patient population. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the clinical utility of <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> in detecting occult AF in patients with possible cardioembolic stroke. Methods: The medical records of ischaemic stroke patients consecutively hospitalized at a single academic centre during a one-year period were reviewed. Data regarding patient demographics, stroke characteristics, electrocardiography and echocardiography results and duration and findings of <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> were abstracted. The primary outcome was yield of newly diagnosed AF on <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Results: Of 465 consecutive patients admitted with a diagnosis of new ischaemic stroke, 210 underwent <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring.</b> The mean duration of monitoring was 22. 8 ± 4. 0 h. Previously undiscovered AF was ­identified in five cases (2. 4 %), all of which represented non-rheumatic AF. In three cases, the Holter test was negative despite AF documented on an admission electro­cardiogram. Conclusions: <b>Holter</b> <b>monitoring</b> can identify occult ­paroxysmal AF, assisting targeted secondary prevention in patients with new ischaemic stroke. However, the standard 24 -h duration of monitoring probably under­estimates the prevalence of paroxysmal AF in this population.
