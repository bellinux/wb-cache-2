We investigated this GS regulatory mechanism in Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. In this strain the system operates {{with only one}} GS <b>inactivation</b> <b>factor</b> (<b>inactivation</b> <b>factor</b> 7 A [IF 7 A]), encoded by open reading frame (ORF) asl 2329 (gifA). Following addition of ammonium, expression of gifA is derepressed, leading to the synthesis of IF 7 A, and consequently, GS is inactivated. Upon ammonium removal, the GS activity returns to the initial level and IF 7 A becomes undetectable. The global nitrogen control protein NtcA binds to the gifA promoter. Constitutive high expression levels of gifA were found in an Anabaena ntcA mutant (CSE 2), indi-cating a repressor role for NtcA. In vitro studies demonstrate that Anabaena GS is not inactivated by Synecho-cystis IFs (IF 7 and IF 17), indicating the specificity of the system. We constructed an Anabaena strain expressing a second inactivating factor, containing the amino-terminal part of IF 17 from Synechocystis fused to IF 7 A. GS inactivation in this strain {{is more effective than}} that in the wild type (WT) and resembles that observed in Synechocystis.

40|$|In crude {{extracts}} of the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis, glutamine synthetase (GS) {{could be}} effectively inactivated {{by the addition}} of NADH. GS inactivation was completed within 30 min. Both the inactivated GS and the active enzyme were isolated. No difference between the two enzyme forms was seen in sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels, and only minor differences were detectable by UV spectra, which excludes modification by a nucleotide. Mass spectrometry revealed that the molecular masses of active and inactive GS are equal. While the Km values of the substrates were unchanged, the Vmax values of the inactive GS were lower, reflecting the <b>inactivation</b> <b>factor</b> in the crude extract. This result indicates that the active site was affected. From the crude extract, a fraction mediating GS inactivation could be enriched by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration. GS inactivation by this fraction required the presence of NAD(P) H, Fe 3 +, and oxygen. In the absence of the GS-inactivating fraction, GS could be inactivated by Fe 2 + and H 2 O 2. The GS-inactivating fraction produced Fe 2 + and H 2 O 2, using NADPH, Fe 3 +, and oxygen. Accordingly, the inactivating fraction was inhibited by catalase and EDTA. This GS-inactivating system of Anabaena is similar to that described for oxidative GS inactivation in Escherichia coli.

40|$|Introduction: Pistachio {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} crops in many regions of Iran with respect of production and export. There are more than 470000 ha of nonbearing and bearing pistachio trees mainly in Kerman province. Despite the economic importance of this crop, very little information is available on its nutritional requirements. Pistachio trees like other crops need to macro and micro nutrients. one of these elements is manganese (Mn). Manganese is an essential mineral nutrient, playing a key role in several physiological processes, particularly photosynthesis, respiration and nitrogen assimilation. This element is normally supplied to the plants by soil. Therefore, soil conditions affect its availability to plants. Soils with high pH, calcareous soils, especially those with poor drainage and high organic matter, are among the soils which produce Mn-deficient plants. Calcium carbonate is the major <b>inactivation</b> <b>factor</b> of Mn in calcareous soils. The soils of Iran are predominantly calcareous in which micronutrients deficiency, including Mn, is observed due to the high pH and nutrient fixation. The objective of this research was to examine the effect of manganese application on growth and chemical composition of pistachio seedlings in some calcareous soils with different chemical and physical properties. Materials and Methods: For this purpose a greenhouse experiment was carried out as factorial (two factors including soil type and Mn levels) experiment in completely randomized design with three replications. Treatments were consisted of three levels of Mn (0, 10 and 20 mg Mn Kg- 1 soil as Manganese sulfate) and 12 different soils from Rafsanjan region in Southern Iran. Soil samples were air dried and crushed to pass through a 2 -mm sieve, and some physical and chemical properties of soils such as texture, electrical conductivity, pH, organic matter content, calcium carbonate equivalent, cation exchange capacity and iron, manganese, copper and zinc availability were determined. Then plastic pots were filled with 5 kg of these soils. Pistachio seeds (cv Badami Zarand) were placed in muslin sacks and pretreated for 24 h with Benomyl solution. The germinated seeds were planted in each pot, and each pot was irrigated with distilled water. Nitrogen and phosphorous were applied uniformly to all pots at the rate of 50 mg kg− 1 soil as ammonium nitrate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate forms, respectively. Zinc, iron and copper also were added to treatments at level of 5 mg kg− 1 soil as zinc sulfate, iron sequestrine 138 and copper sulfate. After 24 weeks, the seedlings were cut at the soil surface, and the roots were washed free of soil. Leaves, stems and roots were dried at 70 oC for 48 h in an oven. The total leaf, stem, and root dry weights were recorded. The ground plant samples were dry- ashed at 550 oC, dissolved in 2 N HCl, and made to volume with hot distilled water. Plant Mn, Cu, Zn and Fe concentrations determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. All data were statistically analyzed according to the technique of analysis variance (ANOVA) by MSTATC. Results and Discussion: Results indicated that the application of manganese increased leaf, stem and root dry weight of pistachio seedlings so that the maximum amount of the dry weight of roots stems and leaves of pistachio seedlings were observed at 10 mg Mn kg- 1 soil. Application of 10 mg Mn kg- 1 soil increased leaf, stem and root dry weight by 19. 2...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of a family of novel water soluble Zinc(II) phthalocyanines (Pc) for the photodynamic inactivation of Gram-negative bacteria. Pc derivatives 1 a, 2 a and 3 a containing trimethylammonium groups with varied number and nature of the groups at peripheral positions were synthesized by cyclotetramerization of dimethyl amino substituted phthalonitriles in the presence of zinc powder, using 1 -chloronaphthalene as a solvent, followed by cationization using dimethyl sulfate. The solubility, singlet oxygen generation (1 O 2) and stability/photostability of each Pc were evaluated as well as the affinity to bacterial cells and their photosensitizing potential against a recombinant bioluminescent Escherichia coli strain, used as a biological model for Gram negative bacteria. The efficiency of photodynamic inactivation was assessed under white and red light at an irradiance of 150 mW cm− 2. All Pc were soluble in phosphate buffer saline and in dimethyl sulfoxide and demonstrated good stability/photostability. The photochemical parameters reveal that Pc 2 a and 3 a are more efficient singlet oxygen producers than Pc 1 a, for which singlet oxygen generation could not be demonstrated. Pc 2 a and 3 a caused photosensitization in E. coli. The <b>inactivation</b> <b>factors</b> attained with red light were, however, generally higher than those with white light. Under red light Pc 3 a and 2 a caused, respectively, 5. 6 and 4. 9 log reduction in the bioluminescence of the E. coli while, with white light, the corresponding <b>inactivation</b> <b>factors</b> were 2. 5 and 0. 5 log. The order of the PDI efficiency (3 a > 2 a⋙ 1 a) was determined by the combined effect of solubility, singlet oxygen generation ability and affinity to bacterial cells.

When purified Factor VIII was recombined with von Willebrand <b>factor,</b> the <b>inactivation</b> of <b>Factor</b> VIII by APC proceeded at a 10 - 20 -fold slower rate as compared with Factor VIII in the absence of von Willebrand factor. Protein S had no effect on the <b>inactivation</b> of the <b>Factor</b> VIII-von Willebrand factor complex by APC. After treatment of this complex with thrombin, however, the actions of APC and protein S towards Factor VIII were completely restored.

By mixing hemophilic plasma with plasma from a patient with severe von Willebrand's disease, we could vary the amount of von Willebrand factor. 1 U of von Willebrand factor was needed to provide protection of 1 U Factor VIII.

The ability of heparin {{to prolong the}} {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} and the factor Xa- one-stage clotting time of normal plasma was markedly enhanced by addition of purified APC to the assays. Experiments using purified clotting factors showed that heparin enhanced by fourfold the phospholipid-dependent <b>inactivation</b> of <b>factor</b> V by APC. In contrast to factor V, there was no effect of heparin on <b>inactivation</b> of thrombin-activated <b>factor</b> Va by APC. Based on SDS-PAGE analysis, heparin enhanced the rate of proteolysis of factor V but not factor Va by APC. Coagulation assays using immunodepleted plasmas showed that the enhancement of heparin action by APC was independent of antithrombin III, heparin cofactor II, and protein S. Experiments using purified proteins showed that heparin did not inhibit factor V activation by thrombin. In summary, heparin and APC showed significant anticoagulant synergy in plasma due to three mechanisms that simultaneously decreased thrombin generation by the prothrombinase complex. These mechanisms include: first, heparin enhancement of antithrombin III-dependent inhibition of factor V activation by thrombin; second, the inactivation of membrane-bound FVa by APC; and third, the proteolytic <b>inactivation</b> of membrane-bound <b>factor</b> V by APC, which is enhanced by heparin...|$|R

Inhibition of thrombin, Factor IXa and Factor XIa showed similarities in the dependence on the molecular weight of heparin and was found to decrease with decreasing molecular weight. <b>Inactivation</b> of <b>Factor</b> Xa, Factor XIIa and kallikrein was, however, less dependent {{on the size of the}} polysaccharide and, to a great extent, was potentiated even by low-molecular-weight heparin fractions that had virtually no effect on the inhibition of thrombin, Factor IXa and Factor XIa...|$|R
50|$|Protein C {{is a major}} {{component}} in anticoagulation in the human body. It acts as a serine protease zymogen: APC proteolyses peptide bonds in activated Factor V and Factor VIII (Factor Va and Factor VIIIa), {{and one of the}} amino acids in the bond is serine. These proteins that APC inactivates, Factor Va and Factor VIIIa, are highly procoagulant cofactors in the generation of thrombin, which is a crucial element in blood clotting; together {{they are part of the}} prothrombinase complex. Cofactors in the <b>inactivation</b> of <b>Factor</b> Va and Factor VIIIa include protein S, Factor V, high-density lipoprotein, anionic phospholipids and glycosphingolipids.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSimple {{and complex}} {{retroviral}} vectors derived from Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} (MLV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), respectively, are useful tools for gene transfer studies. However, factors affecting the stability of these vectors have not been carefully investigated. Here we studied the stability factors on vesicular stomatitis viral envelope glycoprotein (VSV-G) -pseudotyped MLV- and HIV- 1 -derived vectors. Analysis of the ratio of defective particles versus infectious units using electron microscopy and a functional transduction assay revealed that both vectors consisted of high numbers of defective particles (∼ 100 – 350 : 1), which could be reduced (∼ 10 – 20 : 1) by centrifugation. Frequent freeze-and-thaw rapidly decreased vector titer {{in the first three}} to five cycles and stabilized thereafter. Both viral vectors were sensitive to temperatures above 37 °C but more stable at temperatures below 37 °C, exhibiting a two-phase inactivation kinetic starting with a steep inactivation phase, followed by a more leveled phase. Interestingly, HIV- 1 -derived vectors were significantly more stable than MLV-derived vectors at higher temperatures (> 37 °C). Both vectors were rapidly destabilized at pH either below or above 7. 0. Incubation with human or mouse serum significantly inhibited VSV-G-pseudotyped vector activities. Preheated human serum still reduced vector half-lives to ∼ 50 % (150 min), suggesting that certain <b>inactivation</b> <b>factors</b> are not heat-labile. Analyses of these stability factors may improve future production and applications of retroviral and lentiviral vectors...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{inactivation}} of Coprinus cinereus peroxidase (CiP) {{during the}} oxidation of various phenolic compounds originating from lignin was investigated. The CiP was significantly inactivated during the oxidation of phenolic compounds, such as vaniline, p-coumaric acid, 2. 6 -dimethoxy phenol, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-cresol, m-cresol and phenol. Conversely, the CiP nearly maintained its initial activity for the oxidation of syringic acid, vanillic acid and ferulic acid. Hydrogen peroxide affected the CiP inactivation, while the polymerized reaction product hardly affected the CiP inactivation. The thermodynamic parameter (Delta Delta AG(f 298 K) (0)) and turnover capacity (Delta S/Delta E) were adapted {{to explain the}} CiP inactivation due to covalent bonding between the enzyme and phenolic compounds. In the cases of syringic acid, vanillic acid and ferulic acid. which maintained high residual CiP activities after reaction, the Delta Delta G(f 298 K) (0) were more negative and the turnover capacities were higher than the other values. This means that these compounds prefer to form a dimer rather than an enzyme-phenolics complex. Among the <b>inactivation</b> <b>factors,</b> the formation of covalent bonding between the enzyme and phenolic radicals was concluded {{to be the main}} mechanism for the inactivation of CiP. The new thermodynamic parameter (Delta Delta G(f 298 K) (0)) used in this study could help to quantitatively show the reaction tendency of phenolic compounds to form a dimer or covalent bonding with the enzyme, which could be used to predict the degree of CiP inactivation. clos...|$|R
