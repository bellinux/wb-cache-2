5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts. It delineates certain issues which fall beyond the purview of judicial review because those matters are unsuited for adjudication, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the litigation process and judicial expertise. The doctrine {{is based on an}} understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters of policy or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left {{in the hands of an}} elected body of persons.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in the conductor and magnetic field perpendicular to the current. This phenomenon arising <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the Hall effect, {{but it was not}} properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy farmers {{continue}} to use fire to clear out agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration.

5|$|On 12 December 1964, Barrel Roll was {{approved}} by Souvanna Phouma. The program originally consisted of only two U.S bombing sorties per week that were to be conducted {{by no more than}} four aircraft in each strike. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the American agreement with the Thai government (most U.S. strike aircraft flew from bases in Thailand), the aircraft had to first fly to South Vietnam, land, and then take off again for Laos. By 24 December, six armed reconnaissance missions were being conducted per day, but the hoped for reaction from Hanoi did not materialize.|$|E

5|$|While {{during the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{relations}} with the Soviet Union became normalized to a degree, from 1938 on, the Soviets, anxious that Finland {{could be used as}} a springboard for an invasion, started negotiations to conclude a military agreement. At the same time, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's desire to recover the territories of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War made Finland an obvious target. <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> Soviet demands, which included the installation of Soviet military facilities on Finnish soil, these negotiations went nowhere.|$|E

As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded as the ideal Roman long after his death. To the Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> his death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{thought the}} {{enhancements}} {{made to the}} gamepad control scheme were smart and welcomed additions like controls groups. However, in some cases reviewers still regarded the gamepad as a suboptimal control method, largely <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> analog sticks being imprecise in comparison to a mouse. This led to some frustration among several writers as {{they were unable to}} avoid enemy attacks because maneuvering units was slow with a gamepad. While the mouse and keyboard controls were seen as superior for performing precise actions quickly, some reviewers considered the control method to be unpolished and believed that concessions had been made for the gamepad. The unresponsive minimap, unintuitive default keybindings, and unfitting radial menus were highlighted as problems with the mouse and keyboard controls.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging {{because it was so}} physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> {{the coins}} (e.g. {{providing}} kings' names), they have proved essential in constructing a chronology of the Kings of Aksum. An estimated 98 {{percent of the}} city of Aksum remains unexcavated, and other areas even more so. Through analysis of the number of coins produced and the style of coins, archaeologists have been able to construct a rough chronology, generally agreed upon until the late 6th- and 7th-century kings. Of the 20 Aksumite Kings attested by their coins, inscriptions corroborate the existence of only two, who happen to be the most famous kings: Ezana and Kaleb, both of whose reigns were periods of exceptional prosperity {{during the height of the}} Aksumite kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats). In the 1995 presidential election, Le Pen rose slightly to 15% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|London was {{historically}} a centre {{for trade}} and arbitration, which Peter S. Smedresman, {{writing in the}} Journal of Maritime Law and Commerce divides into three categories of transaction. English commodities trading, through bodies such as the Baltic Exchange, specify that any conflicts are to be settled through arbitration in London, even when the goods being traded have {{no relation to the}} United Kingdom. London has also been a centre for arbitration on maritime issues, and insurance. However, it failed to significantly attract more modern forms of trade, such as major communications developments or high-technology projects, <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> its arbitration law. These contracts normally involve large amounts of money and are administered by the International Chamber of Commerce, which rarely sent arbitration cases to London due to the individual nature of English law on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Salah {{presented}} {{his plan to}} Maj. Gen. Khalid {{on the morning of}} October 13. Khalid authorized the attack and informed Second Army. The 103rd Sa'iqa Battalion spent the night of October 12/13 and October 14 preparing for the attack; reconnoitering the area around the fort by means of patrol groups and aerial photographs, as well as studying routes of approach through the marshes. The attacking forces began moving to their positions at 19:00 on October 14, taking advantage of the darkness. The secondary attack force took up position east of Port Fouad while the main force reached its position east of the fort through the marshes in four waves. The march was extremely difficult to cross <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the terrain and the high concentration of salt, which meant the soldiers had to traverse the marshes barefoot. Towards midnight, the Egyptians began harassing the fort's garrison with artillery fire using a range of calibers, along with Katyusha rockets launched from a naval vessel.|$|E
