50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, British {{cardiologist}} Sir Thomas Lewis researched mechanical abrasion to the skin. The skin demonstrated a triphasic response. First, a red spot develops and spreads outward {{due to the}} release of histamine from mast cells. Secondly, a brighter red color spread around the original spot due to arteriolar dilation. The last phase was the production of a wheal filled fluid over the original spot. Lewis believed that the skin’s response was due to the dilation of neighboring blood vessels that were triggered by the nervous system through the axon reflex. This triphasic response was named the triple response of Lewis. The dilation of arterioles in the effected area is due to vasodilation. Although Lewis observed vasodilation that could be explained by axon reflex, there was not yet direct evidence explaining the branching of nerves from the center of an axon rather than a cell body or which chemical agents were responsible for the goose bump, red line, and <b>dilated</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Diverticula of the {{duodenum}} {{occur in}} approximately 2 % to 5 % {{of individuals who}} have had upper gastrointestinal (GI) series; {{the majority of these}} patients are asymptomatic. These diverticula occasionally result in the obstruction of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, which leads to jaundice and pancreatitis. Other complications such as hemorrhage, perforation, sepsis, and death can occur. This article reports a case of upper GI bleeding in a patient who was found to have duodenal diverticula by upper GI series and endoscopy. Diverticulectomy was performed, and microscopic examination of the specimen showed <b>dilated</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> suggestive of angiodysplasia...|$|E
40|$|Recognition and {{detailed}} description of malformations and aberrations in domestic animals may be very useful in cognition {{of the problem and}} in creating breeding programs. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe a rare case of sternal (pectoral) ectopia cordis in a calf. A female calf of the Limousin breed born in Poland in 2011 was subjected to euthanasia because the heart was situated outside the chest. The carcass of the calf was subjected to anatomical examination in which alterations in cardiovascular system and in the structure of the sternum were observed. Cytogenetic studies were performed to find out if the karyotype of the calf was normal. Elongation of the ascending aorta was observed and the pattern of aortic branching was aberrant similarly to that found in dogs, not cattle. The systemic circulation was found to be linked to pulmonary circulation due to persisting large calibre arterial duct. Each of the ventricles had its own cardiac apex and walls of the ventricles manifested a similar width. The atria were slightly altered. A single, short and <b>dilated</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel</b> (pulmonary vein) evacuated its content to the left atrium. Pericardium formed no pericardial sac. Radiogram of the sternum demonstrated a ring-resembling shape and 12 (6 pairs) cartilaginous bars of the sternum (sternebrae). A normal female karytotype (60, XX) indicated that this malformatio...|$|E

40|$|Echotexture of {{testes and}} {{epididymides}} from 10 slaughtered male buffaloes was studied. Diameter of testis and mediastinum testis {{was measured by}} ultrasound and compared with respective values taken by calipers. Testes and epididymides of another 10 fertile and 10 infertile breeding bulls were examined in vivo through manual palpation and ultrasound imaging. Semen quality of these bulls was also monitored. There were significant (P< 0. 01) positive correlations between ultrasound and calipers values of all parameters. The testicular parenchyma of fertile bulls was uniformly homogeneous and moderately echogenic. Epididymal tail was more heterogeneous and less echogenic, while epididymal head was homogeneous and less echogenic, than the testicular parenchyma. The epididymal body appeared as hypoechoic structure with echogenic margin. Among 10 infertile bulls, nine had poor semen quality, while one bull failed to give any ejaculate. On ultrasonography, six bulls showed abnormalities in their scrotal echotexture. Among these, one had an abundance of hyperechoic areas scattered in the testicular parenchyma, some of these showed acoustic shadowing, showing testicular degenerations with mineralization. The second bull showed many anechoic areas in the testes and epididymal head, demarcated {{from the rest of}} the organ by well defined margins. In the third bull, three-fourth of the right testis showed hyperechoic areas, suspected of testicular degeneration with mineralization. The fourth bull had two anechoic areas in one testis assumed to represent <b>dilated</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessel.</b> The fifth bull showed small hyperechoic areas within the testicular parenchyma. The sixth bull showed an anechoic area with distinct hyperechogenic margin below the testicular tunics. The remaining four bulls had normal echogenicity of testes and epididymides in spite of poor semen quality. In conclusion, diagnostic ultrasound may be included in breeding soundness examination of breeding bulls...|$|E

50|$|Calcium {{channels}} are {{also present in}} the smooth muscle lining <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> By relaxing the tone of this smooth muscle, calcium channel blockers <b>dilate</b> the <b>blood</b> <b>vessels.</b> This has led to their use in treating {{high blood pressure and}} angina pectoris. The pain of angina is caused by a deficit in oxygen supply to the heart. Calcium channel blockers like verapamil <b>dilate</b> <b>blood</b> <b>vessels,</b> which increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. This controls chest pain, but only when used regularly. It does not stop chest pain once it starts. A more powerful vasodilator such as nitroglycerin may be needed to control pain once it starts.|$|R
