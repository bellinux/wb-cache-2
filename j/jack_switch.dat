50|$|Jack Grey-Spence was a {{brilliant}} winger for the Sydney University rugby league team. He played two seasons with them in 1933-1934, and Gray-Spence was the NSWRFL top try scorer in 1933. He moved to St George Dragons in 1935 before retiring from rugby league. <b>Jack</b> <b>switched</b> to rugby and played for St. George and Randwick rugby union clubs into the 1940s. He also represented New South Wales in Rugby.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jack</b> Bruce <b>switched</b> from a Fender Bass VI to an EB-3 {{before the}} {{recording}} of Cream's Disraeli Gears (1967). Apparently, Bruce's bass, which he played for a decade, had a non-standard neck.|$|R
5000|$|Soo finally {{earned his}} big break in 1958 {{when he was}} cast in the Broadway musical hit Flower Drum Song {{in the role of}} the show M.C. and comedian Frankie Wing ("Gliding through my memoree"). He was working in San Francisco at the Forbidden City, a Chinese nightclub and cabaret, which was portrayed in the musical and movie. He was offered the chance to go to Broadway on the {{condition}} that he change his name to something Chinese, as Flower Drum Song is set in San Francisco's Chinatown. At that time, he adopted the surname that he had used to leave the internment camp at Topaz, [...] "Soo." [...] <b>Jack</b> <b>switched</b> to the Sammy Fong role (Chinatown's [...] "Nathan Detroit") during the run and played the role when the film version (1961) of the musical was made.|$|R
50|$|Current {{flowed from}} the {{keyboard}} through the plugboard, {{and proceeded to}} the entry-rotor or Eintrittswalze. Each letter on the plugboard had two jacks. Inserting a plug disconnected the upper jack (from the keyboard) and the lower jack (to the entry-rotor) of that letter. The plug {{at the other end}} of the crosswired cable was inserted into another letter's <b>jacks,</b> thus <b>switching</b> the connections of the two letters.|$|R

5000|$|Initially, {{competitors}} primarily {{used some}} form of point shooting, a single-handed technique with the pistol fired from the hip, that was popular and {{believed to be the}} best-suited to the purpose. However, shooters would often discharge several rounds from the hip in rapid succession, but miss the 18-inch balloons seven yards away. One of the early champions, <b>Jack</b> Weaver, <b>switched</b> to an eye-level, two-handed, aimed technique. In his words, [...] "a pretty quick hit was better than a lightning-fast miss." ...|$|R

Along with the name change, Captain Jack changed the station's format to an edgier [...] "Rockin Country" [...] sound, playing some classic southern rock along with country music; similar southern rock/country [...] "hybrid" [...] formats were used unsuccessfully on various U.S. country outlets in the 1990s, most even used the same [...] "Thunder Country" [...] moniker also.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the vast}} {{majority}} of high-end, “boutique”-style guitar amplifiers, THD amplifiers are hand-built, but not hand-wired “point-to-point”. Instead, they utilize printed circuit boards (PCBs). There is some controversy in the guitar amplifier community about using PCBs as opposed to point-to-point wiring in tube amplifiers. THD escaped much of this criticism by using thick boards with large ground planes to reduce noise, as well as through-plating and use of Teflon wire for durability. THD also does not mount their electro-mechanical components like <b>jacks,</b> potentiometers, <b>switches</b> and tube sockets to the board.|$|R

50|$|STE succeeded STU-III in the 1990s. Similar to STU-III, an STE unit {{physically}} resembles {{an ordinary}} telephone. Besides connecting {{to a regular}} wall phone <b>jack</b> (Public <b>Switched</b> Telephone Network), the STE was originally designed {{to be connected to}} Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines. As a result, in addition to having secured voice conversations, users can also use an STE unit for classified data and fax transmissions. Transfer rate of an STE is also considerably higher (STU-III: up to 9 kbit/s; STE: up to 128 kbit/s). Lastly, an STE unit is backward compatible with an STU-III unit when both units are connected to the PSTN.|$|R
5000|$|In telecommunication, a {{technical}} control facility (TCF) is a telecommunications facility, or a designated and specially configured part thereof, that (a) contains the equipment necessary for ensuring fast, reliable, and secure exchange of information, (b) typically includes distribution frames and associated panels, <b>jacks,</b> and <b>switches</b> and monitoring, test, conditioning, and orderwire equipment, and (c) allows telecommunications systems control personnel to exercise operational {{control of communications}} paths and facilities, make quality analyses of communications and communications channels, [...] operations and maintenance functions, recognize and correct deteriorating conditions, restore disrupted communications, provide requested on-call circuits, and take or direct such actions as may be required and practical to provide effective telecommunications services.|$|R

500|$|Jimmy Smith {{began to}} play Hammond {{regularly}} in the 1950s, particularly in his sessions for the Blue Note label between 1956 and 1963. He eschewed a bass player, and played all the bass parts himself using the pedals, generally using a walking bassline on the pedals in combination with percussive left-hand chords. His trio format, composed of organ, guitar, and drums, became internationally famous following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1957. Medeski says musicians [...] "were inspired when they heard Jimmy Smith's records." [...] "Brother" [...] <b>Jack</b> McDuff <b>switched</b> from piano to Hammond in 1959, and toured regularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

50|$|There {{are many}} threat vectors {{to a modern}} SCADA system. One is the threat of {{unauthorized}} access to the control software, whether it is human access or changes induced intentionally or accidentally by virus infections and other software threats residing on the control host machine. Another is the threat of packet access to the network segments hosting SCADA devices. In many cases, the control protocol lacks any form of cryptographic security, allowing an attacker to control a SCADA device by sending commands over a network. In many cases SCADA users have assumed that having a VPN offered sufficient protection, unaware that security can be trivially bypassed with physical access to SCADA-related network <b>jacks</b> and <b>switches.</b> Industrial control vendors suggest approaching SCADA security like Information Security with a defense in depth strategy that leverages common IT practices.|$|R

500|$|He {{made his}} debut on 12 October 1946, taking over at centre-half from Alf Miller for a Second Division match away at Leicester City which Plymouth lost 4–1. In his first season, Boyd played 16 league matches, {{mainly in the}} inside left position, and scored four of his five Plymouth goals. He played {{regularly}} {{on the right side}} of the forward line in the following season, but failed to score, and was regarded as [...] "a promising but not exceptional inside-forward". When manager <b>Jack</b> Tresadern <b>switched</b> him to right half for the 1948–49 season, it became clear he was better suited to that position. After three consecutive seasons helping the Devon club avoid relegation from the Second Division, Boyd was sold to First Division club Birmingham City in January 1949 for a fee of £17,500, the first five-figure fee ever received by Plymouth for a player.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of Major League Baseball (MLB), substituting a player was not allowed except for {{sickness}} or injury. An ineffective pitcher would switch positions with another player on the field. The first relief appearance in the major leagues was in 1876 with Boston Red Caps outfielder <b>Jack</b> Manning <b>switching</b> positions with pitcher Joe Borden. In this early era, relief pitchers changing from a position role to the pitcher's box in this way were often called [...] "change" [...] pitchers. This strategy of switching players between the mound and the outfield is still occasionally employed in modern baseball, sometimes in long extra inning games where a team is running out of players. [...] In 1889, the first bullpen appearance occurred after rules were changed to allow a player substitution at any time. Early relief pitchers were normally starting pitchers pitching one or two innings in between starts. In 1903, during the second game of the inaugural World Series, Pittsburgh's Bucky Veil became the first relief pitcher in World Series history.|$|R

Bieber eventually becomes covered in animated paint, drawings and caricatures. Back in the gallery, Jack Ü fans are providing the illustrations that are appearing over or surrounding Bieber's body as he sings and dances to the track." [...] As noted by Emilee Lindner of MTV News, [...] "The video portrays his internal pain with soft lighting and close-shots, but also displays him as an 'object,' like <b>Jack</b> Ü said, <b>switching</b> to a time-lapse speed while people use him as a canvas for however they want to paint him as."

5000|$|As well as {{promoting}} its [...] "Analog Physical Modelling", Yamaha {{referred to}} the AN1x as a [...] "control synthesizer". The latter designation is shared with and gave the name to the company's CS range of keyboards, which, as noted above, bear visual similarities to the AN1x albeit with distinctly different voicing technologies. The designation of the AN1x as a control synthesiser is due to each patch in the AN1x having 20 [...] "control sets", which were assignments of the user-adjustable controls and MIDI control change messages {{to a number of}} numerical parameters of the sound engine. User controls includes keyboard pitch, velocity and channel aftertouch, modulation wheel, a pressure-sensitive ribbon controller, connectors for two expression pedals, a foot <b>switch</b> <b>jack,</b> and the 8 parameter-editing knobs when in Assign mode. The underlying philosophy of this arrangement is that the performer doesn't have to alter the actual sound editing parameters when performing; user assignable controls can be used instead, whose parameter range has been scaled properly, for more predictable action.|$|R
50|$|The play {{opens with}} the ominous ringing of an off-stage {{telephone}}. As the lights come up Ruth and Jack, {{a couple in}} their mid-thirties, are dancing in their apartment. The telephone rings again, the couple stops, the music backs up a few measures and they begin to dance. Ruth and Jack dance on and converse about what a good time they are having; after a few lines the telephone rings, the music backs up a few measures and the conversation also goes back a few lines and this time changes direction. A few lines go by and the phone rings again, and the conversation once more rewinds and restarts, yet again changing focus. This pattern of rewinding and restarting the conversation in a different vein continues throughout the play whenever the unseen telephone rings. This convention {{is similar to the}} bell ringing in Ives’s previous work Sure Thing (one of six plays in the collection All in the Timing). As the play progresses the audience learns that the couple is in a tenuous state in their relationship and the happiness seen as the play opens is not the prevalent mood. Ruth is Jewish; Jack is a former Catholic. Ruth believes in hard work and success; Jack is lazy and has no goals. Ruth desperately wants to be married; Jack hates the idea of marriage. With each ring of the phone, the love affair dissolves into a more intense argument about religion, the future or marriage; however, this does not prevent a build-up of hope with each ring that perhaps the couple may work out their differences and come to an agreement. At one point Ruth and <b>Jack</b> even <b>switch</b> positions: <b>Jack</b> argues for marriage, Ruth argues against it, and it is this final argument that leads to the dissolution of their relationship. After a slew of “fuck you’s” from Jack and “leave’s” from Ruth, the two realize they can no longer be together, but they also {{do not know how to}} function without one another. The play ends with a final phone ring and the couple beginning to dance as they did in the start of the play.|$|R
50|$|Milo is an {{independent}} technological contractor, brought in to CTU {{to work on a}} key card that was left by now dead agent Richard Walsh. The key card contains information regarding the assassination plot against Senator David Palmer. When first introduced, Milo joins CTU to break into the keycard, but before he can do so, Jack Bauer is forced to switch the key card with a fake one for villain Ira Gaines. Milo then figures out that he has been working with a different key card, and he suspects that <b>Jack</b> may have <b>switched</b> it when he came to his desk. After Jamey Farrell is revealed as a mole, agent Nina Myers has Milo research Gaines’ identity, putting Milo in charge of all Jamey’s projects. Although Milo has narrowed the missing Teri Bauer's location down, it is still too large of an area to pinpoint the exact spot. Agent Tony Almeida finds an encrypted email on Jamey's computer and has Milo decode it. Milo then looks to find the remaining shooters. At CTU, Milo briefs Jack about the three possible shooters he uncovered. One of them is Alexis, Victor Drazen's son who had been trained in Belgrade’s special forces. Milo forwards the photos of the suspected assassins to the Secret Service, and Agent Pierce shows them to the assembled Palmer campaign team. When Jack becomes suspicious of another mole being in CTU, he asks Milo to watch the servers for any classified information being leaked. Milo's last act for the day was notifying Jack that Robert Ellis (the connection between Bauer and Palmer to Operation Nightfall) was found murdered in New Orleans.|$|R
