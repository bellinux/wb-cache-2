50|$|The {{game port}} was {{originally}} {{mounted on a}} dedicated ISA card. Since the early 1990s, when the game port moved from dedicated expansion cards to PC I/O or sound cards, these connectors have usually doubled as connectors for MIDI instruments; two of the redundant +5 V and <b>GND</b> <b>pins</b> of the original standard were rededicated to MIDI input and output to make this possible. To use a game port with MIDI instruments a cable is required with a male and a female DA-15 and two male 5-pin DIN connectors. The drivers and hardware for the game port midi capabilities are based around the now standard Roland MPU-401 MIDI interface (in UART mode only).|$|R
50|$|The {{efficiency}} of the radiation depends on the height above the ground plane or power plane (at RF, one {{is as good as}} the other) and the length of the conductor in relation to the wavelength of the signal component (fundamental frequency, harmonic or transient such as overshoot, undershoot or ringing). At lower frequencies, such as 133 MHz, radiation is almost exclusively via I/O cables; RF noise gets onto the power planes and is coupled to the line drivers via the VCC and <b>GND</b> <b>pins.</b> The RF is then coupled to the cable through the line driver as common-mode noise. Since the noise is common-mode, shielding has very little effect, even with differential pairs. The RF energy is capacitively coupled from the signal pair to the shield and the shield itself does the radiating. One cure for this is to use a braid-breaker or choke to reduce the common-mode signal.|$|R
40|$|The ZXLD 1356 EV 1, Figure 1, is a PCB {{constructed}} {{using an}} FR 4 base {{for evaluating the}} ZXLD 1356 LED driver with internal switch in SOT 23 - 5 package. The evaluation board {{can be used to}} drive an external choice of LEDs; the total forward voltage across the LEDs depending on the number and type connected. [1] The operating voltage is nominally higher than 30 V for the external LEDs, and can be raised to 60 V maximum, which will reduce the supply current. Please refer to the Zetex ZXLD 1360 and ZXLD 1350 products for applications requiring input voltages lower than 30 V. The nominal current for the evaluation board is set at 550 mA with a 0. 36 Ω sense resistor, R 1 //R 3. The 150 uH inductor used in the circuit is based on a 30 V nominal supply, which should be connected across +VIN and <b>GND</b> <b>pins.</b> Test point ADJ provides a connection point for DC or PWM dimming and shutdown.

40|$|The 74 ALVCH 16373 is 16 -bit D-type {{transparent}} latch featuring separate D-type inputs for each latch and 3 -state outputs for bus oriented applications. Incorporates bus hold data inputs which {{eliminate the need}} for external pull-up or pull-down resistors to hold unused inputs. One latch enable (LE) input and one output enable (OE) are provided per 8 -bit section. The 74 ALVCH 16373 consists of 2 sections of eight D-type {{transparent latch}}es with 3 -state true outputs. When LE is HIGH, data at the nDn inputs enter the latches. In this condition the latches are transparent, therefore a latch output will change each time its corresponding D-input changes. When LE is LOW, the latches store the information that was present at the nDn inputs at a set-up time preceding the LOW-to-HIGH transition of LE. When OE is LOW, the contents of the eight latches are available at the outputs. When OE is HIGH, the outputs go to the high-impedance OFF-state. Operation of the OE input does not affect the state of the latches. 2.

40|$|The 74 AVCH 16245 is a 16 -bit {{transceiver}} featuring non-inverting 3 -state bus compatible outputs in both {{send and}} receive directions. The device features two output enable inputs (nOE) for easy cascading and two send/receive inputs (nDIR) for direction control. Inputs nOE control the outputs so that the buses are effectively isolated. This device {{can be used as}} two 8 -bit transceivers or one 16 -bit transceiver. The 74 AVCH 16245 is designed to have an extremely fast propagation delay and a minimum amount of power consumption. To ensure the high-impedance output state during power-up or power-down, tie pins nOE to VCC through a pull-up resistor (Live Insertion). A Dynamic Controlled Output (DCO) circuitry is implemented to support termination line drive during transient (see Figure 4 and Figure 5) The 74 AVCH 16245 has active bus-hold circuitry to hold unused or floating data inputs at a valid logic level. This feature eliminates the need for external pull-up or pull-down resistors. 2.
