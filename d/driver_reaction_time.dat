30|$|The {{objective}} {{function is to}} minimise the deviations among the observed and the simulated volume-occupancy curves, and the point-to-point travel time measurements, subject to the condition that the traffic counts, which have already been calibrated, do not change. But if the traffic counts do change, then they must satisfy the GEH calibration acceptance criteria. The point-to-point travel time match was performed only for one route between NTU and Boon Lay Interchange (BLI). The driver behaviour model can be calibrated by adjusting the car-following and lane-changing models. The global parameters for the car-following and lane-changing models are mean headway and <b>driver</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time,</b> which can drastically influence the simulated driver behaviour. These two parameters were fine-tuned by trial-and-error. The purpose was to reconstruct traffic variations and match the congestion pattern of the study network, so that the resulting simulated travel time measurement matched with the real life estimated travel time values. Five different combinations of mean headway and <b>driver</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time</b> were analysed. For each combination 5 simulation runs were performed and the median NV value was taken into consideration. It was observed that higher values of mean headway and reaction time resulted in lower travelling speeds and vice versa.|$|E

3000|$|For fitting and {{evaluating}} the traffic stream models, parameters observed {{from the field}} data are required. The empirical observations are also used as initial parameters in optimisation tool. Since the behaviour of heterogeneous traffic is different {{to that of the}} homogenous traffic, estimating some of the parameters mentioned in Table  1 is difficult. For instance, jam density (kj) is a function of vehicle headway maintenance, traffic composition and road width. Likewise, kinematic wave speed (Cj) is a function of vehicle length plus safety distance and <b>driver</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time.</b> There will be a wide variation in the above-mentioned parametric values due to the following reasons. Vehicles are positioned close {{to each other in the}} same lane, and the gaps between large vehicles will be filled by the smaller ones. In addition, urban traffic composition in India shows that there are at least ten classes of vehicles observed on the roads where vehicle lengths vary from 1.8  m (MTW) to 10.3  m (Bus) and the safety distances maintained by these vehicles are very small. Therefore, jam density is not constant (suitable value will be considered for the typical composition) for a given road section. Moreover, the estimation of Cj will also be challenging. Now the parameter estimation procedure will be discussed under this section. It is believed that the macroscopic relationship of traffic flow is strongly characterised by some of the important parameters such as kinematic wave speed at jam density (Cj) and saturation flow parameter ([...] λ). In microscopic scale, parameter λ is a function of relative speed and intervehicle distance. However, in macrolevel, it is a function of kinematic wave speed and jam density of vehicular flow. The parameter Cj is a disturbance propagation speed of the vehicles when density is approaching the jam density and it is a function of vehicle length plus safety distance and <b>driver</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>time.</b> It is a first attempt to estimate these parameters for Indian traffic condition. The detailed estimation procedure is given below.|$|E

These systems are built by taking the <b>driver</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>times</b> into account.

In this paper, we propose our solution to address the described problem; First, we briefly describe our method for estimating the distribution of brake response times for a particular driver using data from a Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) system. Then, we investigate how brake response times of individual drivers can be used in collision warning algorithms to reduce false alarm rates while still maintaining a high level of safety. This will yield a system that is overall more reliable and trustworthy for drivers, which could lead to wider adoption and applicability for V 2 V/V 2 I communication systems. Moreover, we show how false alarm rate varies with respect to probability of accident. Our simulation results show that by individualizing collision warnings the number of false alarms can be reduced more than 50 %.
