5|$|Rhenium and {{technetium}} form a {{range of}} oxyhalides from the <b>halogenation</b> of the oxide. The chlorination of the oxide forms the oxychlorides MO3Cl, so BhO3Cl should be formed in this reaction. Fluorination results in MO3F and MO2F3 for the heavier elements {{in addition to the}} rhenium compounds ReOF5 and ReF7. Therefore, oxyfluoride formation for bohrium may help to indicate eka-rhenium properties. Since the oxychlorides are asymmetrical, and they should have increasingly large dipole moments going down the group, they should become less volatile in the order TcO3Cl > ReO3Cl > BhO3Cl: this was experimentally confirmed in 2000 by measuring the enthalpies of adsorption of these three compounds. The values are for TcO3Cl and ReO3Cl are −51kJ/mol and −61kJ/mol respectively; the experimental value for BhO3Cl is −77.8kJ/mol, very close to the theoretically expected value of −78.5kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts <b>halogenation,</b> using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Brown algae {{represent}} {{a major component}} of littoral and sublittoral zones in temperate and subtropical ecosystems. An essential adaptive feature of this independent eukaryotic lineage is the ability to couple oxidative reactions resulting from exposure to sunlight and air with the <b>halogenations</b> of various substrates, thereby addressing various biotic and abiotic stresses i. e., defense against predators, tissue repair, holdfast adhesion, and protection against reactive species generated by oxidative processes. Whereas marine organisms mainly make use of bromine to increase the biological activity of secondary metabolites, some orders of brown algae such as Laminariales have also developed a striking capability to accumulate and to use iodine in physiological adaptations to stress. We review selected aspects of the halogenated metabolism of macrophytic brown algae {{in the light of the}} most recent results, which point toward novel functions for iodide accumulation in kelps and the importance of bromination in cell wall modifications and adhesion properties of brown algal propagules. The importance of halogen speciation processes ranges from microbiology to biogeochemistry, through enzymology, cellular biology and ecotoxicology...|$|R

40|$|The oxygen rebound mechanism, {{proposed}} {{four decades}} ago, is invoked {{in a wide}} range of oxygen and hetero-atom transfer reactions. In this process, a high-valent metal-oxo species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to generate a carbon-centered radical, which immediately recombines with the hydroxometal intermediate with very fast rate constants that can be in the ns to ps regime. In addition to catalyzing C-O bond formation, we found that manganese porphyrins can also directly catalyze C-H <b>halogenations</b> and pseudohalogenations, including chlorination, bromination and fluorination as well as C-H azidation. For these cases, we showed that long-lived substrate radicals are involved, indicating that radical rebound may involve a barrier in some cases. In this study, we show that axial ligands significantly affect the oxygen rebound rate. Fluoride, hydroxide and oxo ligands all slow down the oxygen rebound rate by factors of 10 - 40 fold. The oxidation of norcarane by a manganese porphyrin coordinated with fluoride or hydroxide leads to the formation of significant amounts of radical rearranged products. Cis-decalin oxidation afforded both cis- and trans-decalol. Xanthene afforded dioxygen trapped products and the radical dimer product, bixanthene, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively. DFT calculations probing the rebound step show that the rebound barrier increases significantly (by 3. 3, 5. 4 and 6. 0 kcal/mol, respectively) with fluoride, hydroxide and oxo as axial ligands...|$|R
5000|$|The enzyme has {{two main}} binding sites: one for FAD {{and one for}} tryptophan. Note that the FAD is {{supplied}} by a separate flavin reductase which may be a general enzyme recruited from metabolism or a specific enzyme encoded in the relevant biosynthetic gene cluster. The former site is also the site of reaction for the oxidation of FAD by O2. Connecting these two sites is a tunnel-like structure approximately 10 Å in length. The FAD binding site also binds a single chloride ion. A chlorinating agent is generated at the FAD-binding site, then channeled through this tunnel where it reacts with the substrate tryptophan. Tryptophan is bound {{by a number of}} interactions: other aromatic amino acid residues such as tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine seemingly [...] "sandwich" [...] the substrate, the N-H group of tryptophan forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the peptide backbone of the enzyme, and the amino acid moiety of tryptophan interacts with nearby tyrosine and glutamate residues.
