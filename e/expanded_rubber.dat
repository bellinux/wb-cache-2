50|$|EVA {{is one of}} the {{materials}} popularly known as <b>expanded</b> <b>rubber</b> or foam rubber. EVA foam is used as padding in equipment for various sports such as ski boots, bicycle saddles, hockey pads, boxing and mixed martial arts gloves and helmets, wakeboard boots, waterski boots, fishing rods and fishing reel handles. It is typically used as a shock absorber in sports shoes, for example. It is used for the manufacture of floats for commercial fishing gear such as purse seine (seine fishing) and gillnets. In addition, because of its buoyancy, EVA has made its way into non-traditional products such as floating eyewear. It is also used in the photovoltaics industry as an encapsulation material for crystalline silicon solar cells in the manufacture of photovoltaic modules. EVA slippers and sandals are popular, being lightweight, easy to form, odorless, glossy, and cheaper compared to natural rubber. In fishing rods, EVA is used to construct handles on the rod-butt end. EVA {{can be used as a}} substitute for cork in many applications.|$|E

40|$|Farmers in montane {{mainland}} Southeast Asia (MMSEA) {{have long}} practiced shifting cultivation with plots of land cultivated temporarily and then allowed {{to revert to}} secondary forest for a fallow period. In recent years, shifting cultivation {{has given way to}} more intensified forms of mono-cropped agriculture, including cultivated crops, orchards and, of increasing importance, rubber tree plantations. Today, more than one million hectares have been converted to rubber plantations. By 2050, the area under rubber trees in MMSEA is predicted to increase fourfold (Fox et al. 2012). This massive conversion of primary or secondary forests to rubber mono-cropping could threaten the resilience of both ecosystems and livelihoods. Despite environmental concerns and market fluctuations, both local farmers and outside entrepreneurs are likely to continue <b>expanding</b> <b>rubber</b> plantations because of their high economic returns. We argue that more diversified agroforestry systems that provide an optimal balance between economic returns and environmental sustainability are needed to improve the long-term outlook for the region in the face of climate change.

50|$|The {{critical}} {{capability of}} an Argo float {{is its ability}} to rise and descend in the ocean on a programmed schedule. The floats do this by changing their effective density. The density of any object is given by its mass divided by its volume. The Argo float keeps its mass constant, but by altering its volume, it changes its density. To do this, mineral oil is forced out of the float's pressure case and <b>expands</b> a <b>rubber</b> bladder at the bottom end of the float. As the bladder expands, the float becomes less dense than seawater and rises to the surface. Upon finishing its tasks at the surface, the float withdraws the oil and descends again.|$|R

40|$|The {{forest tree}} species Hevea brasiliensis is {{extensively}} {{planted in the}} humid tropics to meet the increasing demand for natural rubber. Huge quantities of planting stock are therefore needed. The seed option remains the easiest and cheapest way to establish plantations of rubber trees but those show a great variability for vigor and also for latex yield. The rationale of producing clones for overcoming this variability was already obvious in the early 1910 's but due to the difficulties encountered at that time for rooting shoots, grafting {{was used as an}} alternative cloning method. The striking increase in yield noticed from the graft-derived clonal plantations warranted their large scale development. Eventually, the budded clones by virtue of their much higher and uniform productivity supplanted the seedlings in most industrial plantations. However, grafting is also associated with drawbacks and for decades efforts aiming at mass producing selected rubber tree clones on their own roots by rooted cuttings have been pursued. However, this approach was progressively abandoned due to disappointing rooting results and, from the 70 's onwards, priority has been given to in vitro methods which were booming during this period. But despite 40 years of heavy investments, industrial H. brasiliensis clones could still not be mass micropropagated in vitro efficiently enough to meet the requirements of large scale production. The situation may change radically soon, however, due to the development of new nursery techniques adapted to the mass clonal production by rooted cuttings of any H. brasiliensis selected genotype. Efforts to improve the techniques as well as the establishment of new field trials are underway in order to determine if self-rooted rubber tree clones are more productive than grafted ones. This old issue is becoming of overriding importance considering the increasing pressure on land availability reducing thereby the prospects for <b>expanding</b> <b>rubber</b> tree plantations.

40|$|Rising {{global demand}} for natural <b>rubber</b> is <b>expanding</b> {{monoculture}} <b>rubber</b> (Hevea brasilensis) {{at the expense}} of natural forests in the Old World tropics. Conversion of forests into rubber plantations has a devastating impact on biodiversity and we have yet to identify management strategies that can mitigate this. We determined the life-history traits that best predict bird species occurrence in rubber plantations in SW China and investigated the effects of surrounding forest cover and distance to roads on bird diversity. Mistletoes provide nectar and fruit resources in rubber so we examined mistletoe densities and the relationship with forest cover and rubber tree diameter. In rubber plantations, we recorded less than half of all bird species extant in the surrounding area. Birds with wider habitat breadths and low conservation value had a higher probability of occurrence. Species richness and diversity increased logarithmically with surrounding forest cover, but roads had little effect. Mistletoe density increased exponentially with rubber tree diameters, but was unrelated to forest cover. To maximize bird diversity in rubber-dominated landscapes it is therefore necessary to preserve as much forest as possible, construct roads through plantations and not forest, and retain some large rubber trees with mistletoes during crop rotations.

40|$|The Ph. D. {{programme}} arose naturally {{from the}} fundamental questions remaining after completing MPhil research at UWR {{in a very}} similar subject area. which was in achieving effective proportional position control of a linear pneumatic actuator. There are many challenging reasons for using pneumatic systems for control in certain important potential application areas, i. e., their numerous and multiple applications in modern industry due to their extensive beneficial characteristics. The still-unsolved problem of robust long-term proportional control of pneumatic actuators keeps the continuous research interest of engineers high. It is believed that when the operation time increases, so does the temperature inside the cylinder body. Any increase in temperature affects the system performance. For example, one effect is that the piston <b>rubber</b> <b>expands</b> and the contact area becomes greater; hence the frictional forces are affected. The rubber seal, which is between the piston and the cylinder body, also deforms according to air pressure increase. These long-term effects were the major cause {{of the problems that}} existed during all of the author's MPhil experimentation, using any kind of control method; the result was that frequent retuning of the controller could not be avoided.

With the development of Xishuangbanna, landscape diversity increased along urban-rural gradients, but decreased in some key urban areas.
