60|$|Very much {{relieved}} by his disappearance, Kate was turning {{to speak to}} <b>her</b> <b>mama,</b> when the dirty hands again became visible, and were immediately followed by {{the figure of a}} coarse squat man, who ascended by the steps which had been recently occupied by their singular neighbour.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>Mama</b> had {{not come}} to her room that night, which was one cause of her having sat late out of her bed. In her general uneasiness, no less than in her ardent longing to have {{somebody}} to speak to, and to break the spell of gloom and silence, Florence directed her steps towards the chamber where she slept.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} episode of King of the Hill, when it's {{revealed}} that Luanne will be staying with the Hills, she is in tears claiming that <b>her</b> <b>mama's</b> arrest will be on RSHP.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!" [...] was <b>her</b> <b>mama's</b> cry; but {{she swept}} past her in stately silence, {{passed through the}} door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.|$|R

60|$|Kate laughingly {{replied that}} she was quite convinced; and as <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> still {{appeared}} undetermined whether it was not absolutely essential that the subject should be renewed, proposed that they should take their work into the summer-house, and enjoy {{the beauty of the}} afternoon. Mrs Nickleby readily assented, and to the summer-house they repaired, without further discussion.|$|E
60|$|She {{found and}} {{hopefully}} introduced to Mr. Wrenn a wallflower {{who came from}} Yonkers and {{had never heard of}} Tom Poppins or aeroplanes or Oxford or any other topic upon which Mr. Wrenn uneasily tried to discourse as he watched Nelly waltz and smile up at her partners. Presently the two sat silent. The wallflower excused herself and went back to <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> from Yonkers.|$|E
60|$|She {{was often}} alone now, {{for the old}} {{association}} between her and <b>her</b> <b>Mama</b> was greatly changed. At {{the time of her}} father's accident, and when he was lying in his room downstairs, Florence had first observed that Edith avoided her. Wounded and shocked, and yet unable to reconcile this with her affection when they did meet, she sought her in her own room at night, once more.|$|E

50|$|She won the Levstik Award in 1979 for <b>her</b> work <b>Mama</b> pravi, da v očkovi glavi (Mum Said that in Dad's Head).|$|R
60|$|Mrs Blimber, <b>her</b> <b>Mama,</b> was {{not learned}} herself, but she pretended to be, {{and that did}} quite as well. She said at evening parties, that {{if she could have}} known Cicero, she thought she could have died contented. It was the steady joy of her life to see the Doctor's young gentlemen go out walking, unlike all other young gentlemen, in the largest {{possible}} shirt-collars, and the stiffest possible cravats. It was so classical, she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very. She {{went up to}} London {{last winter}} with <b>her</b> <b>mama,</b> and there {{everybody}} admired her, and a young lord {{fell in love with}} her: but his relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped. It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{the dear}} {{creature}} hid {{her eyes in}} her handkerchief, and had hard work to prevent <b>her</b> <b>mama,</b> who came in, from seeing that she was crying. But my dear Mountain declares that, though she might have fancied, might have prayed in secret for such a thing (she owns to that now), she never imagined it for one moment. Nor, indeed, did my good mother, who supposed that Sam Lintot, the apothecary's lad at Richmond, was Fanny's flame--an absurd fellow that I near kicked into James River.|$|E

60|$|She hesitated {{and cast}} down her eyes; for <b>her</b> new <b>Mama</b> was very earnest in her look, {{and the look}} was intently and thoughtfully fixed upon her face.|$|R

60|$|Kate {{saw that}} for the ease and comfort of the {{visitors}} it was high time to stay this flood of recollection, so answered that she entertained of the Peltiroguses a most vivid and distinct remembrance; and then said that Mr Browdie had half promised, early in the evening, that he would sing a Yorkshire song, {{and that she was}} most impatient that he should redeem his promise, because she was sure it would afford <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> more amusement and pleasure than it was possible to express.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} not {{fastened}} within, and yielded smoothly to her hesitating hand. She {{was surprised to}} find a bright light burning; still more surprised, on looking in, to see that <b>her</b> <b>Mama,</b> but partially undressed, was sitting near the ashes of the fire, which had crumbled and dropped away. Her eyes were intently bent upon the air; and in their light, and in her face, and in her form, and in the grasp with which she held the elbows of her chair as if about to start up, Florence saw such fierce emotion that it terrified her.|$|E
60|$|The {{production}} of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable condition being quite {{out of the}} question at a week's notice, I proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on her marriage morning in the attic where they all slept, and should confine our greatest efforts to <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> and her mama's room, and a clean breakfast. In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of attention, the lattice-work up her back having widened considerably since I first knew her and her hair looking like the mane of a dustman's horse.|$|E
5000|$|Mama Cass covered [...] "One Way Ticket" [...] in 1970. Her {{version was}} {{included}} on <b>her</b> album, <b>Mamas</b> Big Ones. [...] It was released {{as a single}} in the UK in 1971 but failed to chart.|$|R
50|$|Tita de la Garza, the novel's main protagonist, is 15 at {{the start}} of the story. She lives on a ranch near the Mexico—US border with <b>her</b> mother, <b>Mamá</b> Elena, and <b>her</b> older sisters Gertrudis and Rosaura.|$|R
50|$|She was {{nominated}} for Best Newcomer at the UBCP/ACTRA Awards for <b>her</b> role in <b>Mama.</b>|$|R
60|$|Except when a {{constrained}} and singular reserve crept over her; {{and then}} she seemed (but Florence hardly understood this, though she could not choose but notice it, and think about it) {{as if she were}} humbled before Florence, and ill at ease. When she had said that she was not <b>her</b> <b>Mama</b> yet, and when Florence had called her the mistress of everything there, this change in her was quick and startling; and now, while the eyes of Florence rested on her face, she sat as though she would have shrunk and hidden from her, rather than as one about to love and cherish her, in right of such a near connexion.|$|E
60|$|Kate was {{too sick}} at heart, after the rough jostling {{she had already}} had with the world, and really cared too little at the moment what fate was {{reserved}} for her, to make any objection. Mr Ralph Nickleby offered none, but, on the contrary, highly approved of the suggestion; neither did he express any great surprise at Madame Mantalini's sudden failure, indeed {{it would have been}} strange if he had, inasmuch as it had been procured and brought about chiefly by himself. So, the name and address were obtained without loss of time, and Miss Nickleby and <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> went off in quest of Mrs Wititterly, of Cadogan Place, Sloane Street, that same forenoon.|$|E
60|$|Quite {{unconscious}} of {{the demonstrations}} of their amorous neighbour, or their effects upon the susceptible bosom of <b>her</b> <b>mama,</b> Kate Nickleby had, by this time, begun {{to enjoy a}} settled feeling of tranquillity and happiness, to which, even in occasional and transitory glimpses, she had long been a stranger. Living {{under the same roof}} with the beloved brother from whom she had been so suddenly and hardly separated: with a mind at ease, and free from any persecutions which could call a blush into her cheek, or a pang into her heart, she seemed to have passed into a new state of being. Her former cheerfulness was restored, her step regained its elasticity and lightness, the colour which had forsaken her cheek visited it once again, and Kate Nickleby looked more beautiful than ever.|$|E
5000|$|... “Mother/Land is {{restoring}} {{the world through}} the retelling of patterns passed woman to woman like songs to lips. In this familial place, where one haggles over Memere’s house dress, combs <b>her</b> <b>Mama’s</b> hair as if brushing a bird’s wing, employs mother-of-pearl to fill the black hole of her absence leaving buxom hills bare of trees. From this childhood where one might wear a dress of fall grass, cut ankles on witchgrass, and peer into a refrigerator to delineate a hummingbird from a moth; in the land of mothers, grandmothers, and their later lineal offspring, we come to terms with crossroads and swallows, rivers and oceans, and they lead us back home from which we began—the Motherland.” —Allison Hedge Coke ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Your {{decisions}} are perfectly judicious, madam," [...] returned Mr. Brocklehurst. [...] "Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly {{appropriate to the}} pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second daughter, Augusta, went with <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and mama's, {{as if they had}} never seen a silk gown before.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No offence," [...] said Dan; [...] "but `to resoom {{the thread}} o' the narrative,' {{as the story}} books say, Mrs Niven she opened the door, and the drippin' wet sailor he puts a little wet spalpeen in her arms, an' goes right off {{without so much as}} by your lave, an' that's all we know about it. An' Grumpy he goes ragin' about the house sayin' he'll have nothin' to do wi' the poor little thing--who's not so little naither, bein' a ten-year-old if she's an hour, an' a purty sweet face to boot--an' that he'll send her to the workus' or pris'n, or anywhere; but in his house she's not to stop another day. Well, not havin' the {{management}} o' the whole of this world's affairs, (fort'nately, else a scrubbily managed world it would be), Grumpy finds out that when he wants to send little Emmie, (as she calls herself), off, she's knocked down by a ragin' fever, an' the doctor he says it's as much as her life is worth to move her. So Grumpy has to grin and bear it, and there's little Emmie lyin' at this minit in our best bed, (where Mrs Niven put her the moment she was took bad), a-tossin' her purty arms in the air, an' makin' her yellow hair fly over the pillows, and kickin' off the close like a young angel in a passion, and callin' on <b>her</b> <b>mama</b> in a voice that would make a stone immage weep, all the while that Miss Penelope is snivellin' on one side o' the bed, an' Mrs Niven is snortin' on the other." ...|$|E
