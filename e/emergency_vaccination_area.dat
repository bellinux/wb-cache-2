40|$|In {{a recent}} update of the Dutch {{contingency}} plan for controlling outbreaks of {{classical swine fever}} (CSF), <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is preferred to large-scale pre-emptive culling. This policy change raised two questions: can <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{be as effective as}} pre-emptive culling, and what are the implications for showing freedom of infection? Here, we integrate quantitative information available on CSF virus transmission and vaccination effects into a stochastic mathematical model that describes the transmission dynamics at the level of animals, farms and livestock areas. This multilevel approach connects individual-level interventions to large-scale effects. Using this model, we compare the performance of five different control strategies applied to hypothetical CSF epidemics in The Netherlands and, for each of these strategies, we study the properties of three different screening scenarios to show freedom of infection. We find that vaccination in a ring of 2  km radius around a detected infection source is as effective as ring culling in a 1  km radius. Feasible screening scenarios, adapted to the use of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination,</b> can reduce the enhanced risks of (initially) undetected farm outbreaks by targeting vaccinated farms. Altogether, our results suggest that <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> against CSF can be equally effective and safe as pre-emptive culling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) {{may pose}} {{a major threat}} for the Belgium poultry sector, as an {{outbreak}} of HPAI results in tremendous economic losses. In {{order to reduce the}} economic damage for an outbreak, different strategies to control HPAI are evaluated. In a first stage the structure of the Belgium poultry sector is described and risks are analysed. The actual risks are dependent of the intensive character of poultry farming in Belgium, the large number of transport movements of living poultry, the presence of sensitive nature areas and the border with the Netherlands where the poultry density is even larger. In a second stage the possible intervention strategies are evaluated. Starting from the current regulation, two strategies are worked out: stamping out and <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination.</b> The success of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is associated with the correct identification of compartments at risk, prompt deployment of emergency vaccines, rapid enforcement of appropriate complementary control measures and also the level of being ready. In a third stage an economic analysis of control strategies for HPAI outbreaks is made.

40|$|AbstractTo {{eliminate}} incursions of {{foot-and-mouth disease}} (FMD) quickly, {{a combination of}} measures, including <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination,</b> can help block the spread of infection. For the earliest recovery of the FMD-free status for trade, without the slaughter of uninfected vaccinated animals, a serosurvey for antibodies to FMD virus non-structural proteins (NSP) must be used to substantiate absence of occult virus infections. Areas of doubt over requirements for post-vaccination serosurveillance and its feasibility include the required and achievable confidence, the amount of sampling necessary, and the appropriate responses to and consequences of different seropositive findings. This derives largely from uncertainty over the extent of localised pockets of virus infection that may remain within vaccinated populations and the circumstances that permit this. The question therefore remains whether tests are sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect and eliminate infected animals, without excessive culling of uninfected animals, before vaccinated animals mix with non-vaccinated livestock when movement restrictions are lifted. It is recommended to change the rationale for serosurveillance after <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Only when <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is used in limited outbreaks {{is it possible to}} test and cull comprehensively, an approach compatible with a three-month minimum period to recover the FMD-free status. In other situations, where <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> is used, such as dealing with large outbreaks in animal-dense regions and where the onset of vaccination has been delayed, post-vaccination serosurveys should be targeted and focus on providing an assurance to detect higher levels of infection, in case of inadequate control measures. As this provides less assurance of absence of infection, the approach would be compatible with a six-month waiting period for free-status recovery and should be complemented by other methods to provide evidence that vaccination and control measures have been effectively implemented, as these are the best guarantee against continuing virus transmission...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} of this poster paper is to {{evaluate}} the cost-effectiveness of alternative control strategies {{for a number of}} simulated outbreaks of Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD) in four agriculturally diverse Irish regions, examining for the first time, the potential role of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> in the country. With the increasing threat of transboundary animal diseases due to globalisation, wider market integration and increased animal movement it is important that such an evaluation of control and eradication strategies be undertaken and contingency plans be put in place. The new EU Directive (2003 / 85 /EC) on FMD control permits the use of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> as part of an FMD control strategy. The slaughter of infected animals and "dangerous contacts" (susceptible animals on epidemiologically linked holdings) remains the principal tool for tackling an outbreak, but the potential use of vaccination as an adjunct to the basic culling policy is now being considered. Using an integrated approach, combining an epidemiological model and an economic model, alternative control strategies are compared here during hypothetical outbreaks using a computer-simulation model and their cost-effectiveness assessed.

40|$|The 2001 {{epidemic}} of Foot- and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the Netherlands {{has been brought}} to a halt {{by a combination of}} pre-emptive culling, <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> and depopulation measures in a large area comprising about 1800 farms. After the large Dutch HPAI epidemic in poultry in 2003, public acceptance of intervention strategies based on massive culling has further eroded. Policy makers in the Netherlands are therefore interested in assessing the use of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> as a basis for intervention in the future.

Scientific-based preparedness about how to best control the disease in a previously FMD-free country is therefore essential for veterinary services. The present study used a spatial, stochastic epidemic simulation model to compare the effectiveness of <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> with conventional (non-vaccination) control measures in Switzerland, a low-livestock density country. Model results revealed that <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> with a radius of 3 km or 10 km around infected premises (IP) did not significantly reduce either the cumulative herd incidence or epidemic duration if started in a small epidemic situation where the number of IPs is still low. However, in a situation where the epidemic has become extensive, both the cumulative herd incidence and epidemic duration are reduced significantly if vaccination were implemented with a radius of 10 km around IPs. The effect of different levels of conventional strategy measures was also explored for the non-vaccination strategy. It was found that a lower compliance level of farmers for movement restrictions and delayed culling of IPs significantly increased both the cumulative IP incidence and epidemic duration. Contingency management should therefore focus mainly on improving conventional strategies, by increasing disease awareness and communication with stakeholders and preparedness of culling teams in countries with a livestock structure similar to Switzerland; however, <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> should be considered if there are reasons to believe that the epidemic may become extensive, such as when disease detection has been delayed and many IPs are discovered at the beginning of the epidemic...|$|R

A sector-level market and trade model and a spatial, stochastic, dynamic epidemiological simulation model for the Netherlands were used. Outbreaks in sparsely and densely populated areas were compared under four different control strategies and with two alternative trade assumptions. Results indicate that the control strategy required by current EU legislation is enough to eradicate an epidemic starting in an area with sparse pig population. By contrast, additional control measures are necessary if the outbreak begins in an area with high pig population density. The economic consequences of using preventive slaughter rather than <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> as an additional control measure depend strongly on the reactions of trading partners.

The study was based on data from the Finnish cattle and swine production sectors from 2006.

In one-third of the cases, the disease would remain a sporadic case and would not spread at all from the first infected farm. Even a larger outbreak would remain relatively small and short. In the worst case scenario, FMD virus would spread to 29 farms before the disease was eradicated. The mean economic consequences of a sporadic outbreak would be € 23 million.

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) can have devastating effects on animal welfare, economic revenues, the export position and {{society as a}} whole, as occurred during the 2001 FMD epidemic in the Netherlands. Following the preemptive culling of 260, 000 animals during this outbreak, the Dutch government adopted <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> as preferred control policy. However, a vaccination-to-live strategy has not been applied before, posing unprecedented challenges for effectively controlling the epidemic, regaining FMD-free status and minimizing economic losses. These three topics are covered in an interdisciplinary model analysis. In this first part we evaluate whether and how <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> can be effectively applied to control FMD epidemics in the Netherlands. For this purpose we develop a stochastic individual-based model that describes FMD virus transmission between animals and between herds, taking heterogeneity between host species (cattle, sheep and pigs) into account. Our results in a densely populated livestock area with > 4 farms/km 2 show that <b>emergency</b> ring <b>vaccination</b> can halt the epidemic as rapidly as preemptive ring culling, while {{the total number of}} farms to be culled is reduced by a factor of four. To achieve this reduction a larger control radius around detected farms and a corresponding adequate vaccination capacity is needed. Although sufficient for the majority of simulated epidemics with a 2 km vaccination zone, the vaccination capacity available in the Netherlands can be exhausted by pig farms that are on average ten times larger than cattle herds. Excluding pig farms from vaccination slightly increases the epidemic, but more than halves the number of animals to be vaccinated. Hobby flocks – modelled as small-sized sheep flocks – do not {{play a significant role in}} propagating the epidemic, and need not be targeted during the control phase.

40|$|Outbreaks {{of highly}} {{pathogenic}} avian influenza (HPAI) can cause large losses for the poultry sector and for animal disease controlling authorities, {{as well as}} risks for animal and human welfare. In the current simulation approach epidemiological and economic models are combined to compare different strategies to control highly pathogenic avian influenza in Dutch poultry flocks. Evaluated control strategies are the minimum EU strategy (i. e., culling of infected flocks, transport regulations, tracing and screening of contact flocks, establishment of protection and surveillance zones), and additional control strategies comprising pre-emptive culling of all susceptible poultry flocks in an area around infected flocks (1. km, 3. km and 10. km) and <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> of all flocks except broilers around infected flocks (3. km). Simulation {{results indicate that the}} EU strategy is not sufficient to eradicate an epidemic in high density poultry areas. From an epidemiological point of view, this strategy is the least effective, while pre-emptive culling in 10. km radius is the most effective of the studied strategies. But these two strategies incur the highest costs due to long duration (EU strategy) and large-scale culling (pre-emptive culling in 10. km radius). Other analysed pre-emptive culling strategies (i. e., in 1. km and 3. km radius) are more effective than the analysed <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategy (in 3. km radius) in terms of duration and size of the epidemics, despite the assumed optimistic vaccination capacity of 20 farms per day. However, the total costs of these strategies differ only marginally. Extending the capacity for culling substantially reduces the duration, size and costs of the epidemic.

The control strategies were: the basic EU and Danish strategy; pre-emptive depopulation; suppressive or protective vaccination; enlarging protection or surveillance zones, and a combination of pre-emptive depopulation or <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> with enlarged protection or surveillance zones. Herds are detected either based on basic detection through the appearance of clinical signs, or as a result of surveillance in the control zones. The economic analyses consisted of direct costs and export losses. Sensitivity analysis was performed on uncertain and potentially influential input parameters. Enlarging the surveillance zones from 10 km to 15 km, combined with pre-emptive depopulation over a 1 km radius around detected herds resulted in the lowest total costs. This was still the case even when the different input parameters were changed in the sensitivity analysis. Changing the resources for clinical surveillance did not affect the epidemic consequences. In conclusion, an FMD epidemic in Denmark would have a larger economic impact on the agricultural sector than previously anticipated.

We analyzed surveillance data from 2008 to 2013 to describe the measles epidemiology of the county. Measles-containing vaccine coverage was estimated using two methods: previously-reported administrative coverage and an estimation of coverage by clinic-kept vaccination records (n = 542). We conducted a rapid field coverage assessment in a migrant population village to evaluate coverage after <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination.</b> We conducted a review of hospital records of measles cases to address the role hospital transmission played during the early stage of this outbreak. There were 153 cases in the outbreak, primarily among children too young to vaccinate, unvaccinated children less than 3 years old, and adults. Measles-containing vaccine coverage by the field assessment showed that 20 % of children aged 8 - 17 months had zero doses, and 9 % of ≥ 2 years old children had fewer than two doses. The vaccination statuses of all adult cases were either zero doses or unknown. At least 61 % of cases had been hospitalized. The proportion of cases who had been hospital-exposed 7 to 21 days prior to rash onset decreased from 52 % to 22 % after hospitals strengthen their isolation measures. This outbreak {{was a result of}} measles vaccination coverage gaps among young children and adults, and insufficient hospital isolation of cases.

Hospitals were sites of transmission in the early stage of the outbreak. A strict hospital isolation policy could decrease spread of measles. <b>Emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> was associated with stopping measles transmission in low coverage areas...|$|R
40|$|Infectious {{diseases}} pose {{an important}} extinction {{risk for a}} number of endangered carnivore populations. Wild canids are particularly susceptible to generalist pathogens transmitted from domestic dogs - particularly rabies virus and canine distemper virus (CDV). Here we present a review of rabies as a threat to Ethiopian wolves, an endangered canid restricted to a few isolated Afro-alpine ranges in the Ethiopian highlands, and the impact of rabies on the largest population in the Bale Mountains. In the Bale Mountains, two confirmed rabies outbreaks among Ethiopian wolves in 1991 - 1992 and 2003 - 2004 were each responsible for over 70 % mortality among focal packs and a third rabies outbreak was suspected in 1990. This review also presents an integrated disease management strategy for Ethiopian wolves combining long-term population monitoring, disease surveillance, conventional and <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> programs, and advanced modelling techniques. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|International audienceThis study, {{carried out}} between September 2006 and January 2007, {{is the first}} {{cross-sectional}} serological investigation of peste-des-petits-ruminants (PPR) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Tunisia. The objective {{was to assess the}} potential need to develop a dual, recombinant PPR-RVF vaccine and how such a vaccine might be utilised in Tunisia. An overall PPR seroprevalence of 7. 45 % was determined, a finding supported by the high specificity (99. 4 %) and sensitivity (94. 5 %) of the ELISA used. On assessment of the diversity and density of mosquitoes in the sampling area, four species of RVF-vectors of the genus Aedes and Culex were identified. However, no serological evidence of RVF was found despite the use of a highly sensitive ELISA (99 - 100 %). Larger scale investigations are underway to confirm these findings and the continuation of the <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> program against these two diseases remains valid...|$|R
40|$|To capture {{lessons from}} the 2007 Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak, {{epidemiological}} {{studies were carried out}} in Kenya and Tanzania. Somali pastoralists proved to be adept at recognizing symptoms of RVF and risk factors such as heavy rainfall and mosquito swarms. Sandik, which means "bloody nose," was used by Somalis to denote disease consistent with RVF. Somalis reported that sandik was previously seen in 1997 / 98, the period of the last RVF epidemic. Pastoralists communicated valuable epidemiological information for surveillance and early warning systems that was observed before international warnings. The results indicate that an all or none approach to decision making contributed to the delay in response. In the future, a phased approach balancing actions against increasing risk of an outbreak would be more effective. Given the time required to mobilize large vaccine stocks, <b>emergency</b> <b>vaccination</b> did not contribute to the mitigation of explosive outbreaks of RVF...|$|R
30|$|The itching nodules appear remarkably late (months or even years) {{after the}} vaccination. Histopathological {{examination}} shows granuloma formations in which Al crystals {{can be demonstrated}} [10]. Clinically, pruritus is the dominating symptom with intense local itching in the <b>vaccination</b> <b>area</b> on the thigh, often causing skin alterations like eczema, hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation. Intensified itching and swelling of the nodules is often reported when the child has a cold or another infection. After a duration of ½– 12  years (median 3 – 4  years) the nodules eventually disappear and the pruritus ceases.|$|R
