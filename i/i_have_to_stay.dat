2500|$|Part of {{the reason}} Dewey ran such a cautious, vague {{campaign}} came from {{his experience as a}} presidential candidate in 1944. In that election, Dewey felt that he had allowed Roosevelt to draw him into a partisan, verbal [...] "mudslinging" [...] match, and he believed that this had cost him votes. As such, Dewey was convinced in 1948 to appear as non-partisan as possible, and to emphasize the positive aspects of his campaign while ignoring his opponent. This strategy proved to be a major mistake, as it allowed Truman to repeatedly criticize and ridicule Dewey, while Dewey never answered any of Truman's criticisms. Near the end of the campaign, Dewey considered adopting a more aggressive style and responding directly to Truman's criticisms, {{going so far as to}} tell his aides one evening that he wanted to [...] "tear to shreds" [...] a speech draft and make it more critical of the Democratic ticket. However, nearly all of his major advisors – including Edwin Jaeckle, Press Secretary James Hagerty, and aide Paul Lockwood – insisted that it would be a mistake to change tactics. Dewey's wife Frances strongly opposed her husband changing tactics, telling him, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> up all night to see that you don't tear up that speech , I will." [...] Dewey relented and continued to ignore Truman's attacks and to focus on positive generalities instead of issue specifics.|$|E

There are so many things I want to do, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here to look after Jeanne, because she is too foolish to be trusted with any one else. I want to go to America, and a very dear friend of mine has invited me to go with her and some delightful people on a yachting cruise around the world." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{good woman}} {{would have made}} him a reply, but he {{prevented}} her by telling her he {{had no time to}} hearken to unnecessary complaints or animadversions. I have a great many things in my mind, says he, that require a speedy and serious consideration. The time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> is but short, and I {{have a great deal of}} important business to do in it. Time and death are both in my view, and seem both to call aloud to me to make no delay. I beg of you, therefore, not to disquiet yourself or me. What must be, must be. The decrees of Providence are eternal and unalterable; why, then, should we torment ourselves about that which we cannot remedy? ...|$|E
6000|$|What, however, {{more than}} {{anything}} else gave him hope was the picture on the smoke. [...] "Everything else has come true," [...] he said to himself; [...] "why should not that? Wilson spoke of the Doctor as dead. I will not believe it; for if he is dead, the picture is false. Why should that thing of all others have been shown to me unless it had been true? What seemed impossible to me--that I should be fighting like a brave man--has been verified. Why should not this? I should have laughed at such superstition six months ago; now I cling to it as my one ground for hope. Well, I will wait if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here until tomorrow night." ...|$|E

"I {{have thought}} {{a great deal}} on the reason of your sudden {{departure}} from a house I had begun to hope you thought your own; and by calling to mind my own feelings when Lady Juliana became the heiress to her nephew's estate, take it for granted you have been governed by the same sentiments; which I know both by my own experience and that of the bearer, Peter Johnson, is a never-failing accompaniment of pure affection. Yes, my dear Denbigh, I honor your delicacy in not wishing to become indebted to a stranger, as it were, for the money on which you subsist, and that stranger your wife--who ought in reason to look up to you, instead of your looking up to her; which was the true cause Lord Gosford would not marry the countess--on account of her great wealth, as he assured me himself; notwithstanding, envious people said it was because her ladyship loved Mr Chaworth better: so in order to remove these impediments of delicacy, I have to make three propositions, namely, that I bring you into parliament the next election for my own borough--that you take possession of the lodge the day you marry Emmy, while I will live, for the little time <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> here, in the large cottage built by my uncle--and that I give you your legacy of ten thousand pounds down, to prevent trouble hereafter.|$|E

5000|$|According to NPR's program, All Songs Considered, {{the band}} says the album [...] "answers {{questions}} of lust and deception, greed and love, joy and regret and the {{rites of passage}} you weren't quite ready to pass through." [...] In another interview, Matthew Caws described the imagery in the song [...] "Your Legs Grow", saying: [...] "When a challenge presents itself to you, it {{is so easy to}} have a kind of panicky feeling where you think, 'Oh my god - if that happened to me, I would die. If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in this job I’ll die, or if I lose that person, I’ll die.' And once in a while, those things you think will kill you happen. You know, someone breaks up with you, or one of your parents gets really sick or something. But you make it through anything, really. And the image that was in my mind was that if you were out at sea, and you were freezing and {{thought you were going to}} drown - somehow we have the capacity to get over anything and the image that I had in mind was that your legs would just grow down to the bottom and you’d walk out. We are capable of rescuing ourselves. I was holding onto that thought or being hopeful about it, since I was going through a hard time in a relationship." ...|$|E

5000|$|In his {{freshman}} season with Arizona, Hollis-Jefferson {{became known as}} fierce scorer, rebounder, and shot-blocker despite his relatively small size. The start of his season was marked with 10 points, 5 rebounds, and 2 assists against Cal Poly off the bench. He posted his first double-double {{in a game against}} Oregon. He improved on his free throw shooting as {{his freshman}} year progressed. Throughout the season, Hollis-Jefferson mainly functioned as the team's sixth man, but became a starter after Brandon Ashley was lost for the season with a foot injury in the Wildcats' 60-58 upset loss to California on February 1. Hollis-Jefferson ended up starting 6 of 38 games played due to the roster that was dominated by the likes of Aaron Gordon, but still got his name on the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team. In his freshman year, Hollis-Jefferson averaged 9.1 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game. [...] "It's a lot different than just waking up, going to school and playing basketball for Chester," [...] said Hollis-Jefferson of his freshman year. [...] "In the beginning of the season, I was lost. But it's not about who's starting, it's about who finishes. It stuck with me for about a month or so, playing behind people.
