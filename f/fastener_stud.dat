5000|$|Treehouse {{attachment}} bolts or TABs are specialized bolts engineered for treehouse construction.Various models and trademarks exist, with {{names such as}} Garnier limbs (GLs); tree anchor bolts; artificial limbs; heavy limbs or hyper limbs (HLs); special tree <b>fastener</b> or <b>stud</b> tree <b>fastener</b> (STFs).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Bolted joints in an {{automobile}} wheel. Here the outer <b>fasteners</b> are four <b>studs</b> with {{three of the four}} nuts that secure the wheel. The central nut (with locking cover and cotter pin) secures the wheel bearing to the spindle.|$|R
50|$|Driving gloves feature open {{knuckles}} {{and back}} for maximum flexibility; ventilation to reduce {{stress on the}} soft, thin leather; holes punched in fingers and palms for ventilation; short cuffs {{so as not to}} restrict movement; and a <b>stud</b> <b>fastener</b> closure on the back for proper fit around the wrist and unobstructed view of the drivers chronograph.|$|R
50|$|The PLCE webbing {{system is}} {{produced}} from double-layered 1000 Denier internally rubberised Cordura Nylon, a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. Olive (OD/OG) webbing {{of the same}} material (1000 D) is being incorporated, along {{with a variety of}} hard wearing plastic fasteners (ITW Nexus), Hook and loop fasteners (Velcro) and anti-magnetic press <b>stud</b> <b>fasteners</b> (Pull the Dot).|$|R
50|$|The vest {{consists}} of a front and rear soft armour panel, which join {{with the aid of}} hook & loop <b>fasteners</b> and press <b>studs</b> at the shoulders and waist sides. The panels contain a ceramic trauma plate both front and rear, protected by a rubber surround intended to avoid wear and tear in routine use. Version 4 of the armour introduces additional side panels designed to contain further trauma plates.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic stud {{detectors}} use magnets {{to locate}} metal in the walling material because the magnet is {{attracted to the}} metal. The attraction grows stronger as the magnet gets closer to the metal in the walling. The strongest attraction point, if due to a metal fastener in the wall, should indicate {{the location of a}} stud, but careless wall construction can leave many metal <b>fasteners</b> off the <b>studs</b> or towards the edge, rendering the spot useless for anchoring objects. Magnetic stud detectors come in two types: stationary and moving.|$|R
40|$|The sound screen has a {{sound-absorbing}} construction (1, 4) {{and can be}} erected next to {{or around}} a source of noise. The construction is formed as an envelope that can be filled with a gaseous or liquid medium. The envelope is formed of a flexible material and when filled takes up a self-supporting shape, which has at least two walls that face one another. The envelope may be formed of transparent film or of fabric with an airtight coating, and {{have at least one}} inlet or outlet valve. Several envelope constructions can be connected together using hook and loop fastenings, a sliding clasp <b>fastener,</b> press <b>studs,</b> double-sided adhesive tape or positively fitting connections (3), to form a larger screen. ADVANTAGE - Flexible design can be arranged in desired form to fit geometry of noise source or room. Screen can be quickly erected and removed and can be emptied for ease of transport...|$|R
5000|$|Moving magnet stud {{detectors}} use {{a neodymium magnet}} that {{is suspended}} in an enclosure and free to move in response to hidden metal. The strength of this rare earth magnet and the easy movement of the magnet allow moving magnetic stud detectors {{to work on a}} broad range of construction types. The magnet is suspended {{in such a way that}} it always sits in its [...] "home" [...] position until it is moved directly over a metal <b>fastener</b> or metal <b>stud.</b> On walls with shallow fasteners, the magnet moves towards the wall with such velocity that it makes a distinct thud sound when it hits the wall. Because a moving magnet is not dependent on the operator to feel the attraction to the metal, fasteners buried more deeply under plaster or tile can be located with this detector. For deeper fasteners, the sound is softer since the speed of movement is slower.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide the stiffness and strength characteristics for cold-formed steel stud walls stabilized by sheathing. The primary stability resistance is provided by translational (lateral) stiffness supplied at the fastener locations to the cold-formed steel studs. This paper separates the source of this translational stiffness into two parts: local and diaphragm. To analyze the local stiffness an experimental study consisting of small-scale stud-fastener-sheathing assemblies is conducted. In these tests sheathing type, <b>stud</b> spacing, <b>fastener</b> spacing, edge distance, environmental conditions, and construction flaws are all varied. The results provide characterization of the local stiffness and strength that is supplied as the fasteners bear and rotate in a stud-sheathing assembly. Results are sensitive to the design variables (<b>stud,</b> <b>fastener,</b> sheathing, spacing) as well as the environmental and construction conditions. Diaphragm stiffness develops as the sheathing itself undergoes shear, which also translates into a lateral resistance at the fastener locations. A simple analytical model for the translational stiffness supplied by the sheathing diaphragm action is proposed and validated. The importance of including both local and diaphragm stiffness is illustrated with a test on a full-scale cold-formed steel stud wall. For the first time, this paper provides a comprehensive bracing model for sheathing-braced stud walls which include both local and diaphragm stiffness. ...|$|R
