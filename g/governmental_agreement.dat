40|$|Airline crew {{scheduling}} {{is concerned}} with finding a minimum cost assignment of crews to flights while satisfying a number of rules like minimum rest time and maximal duty periods specified by union and <b>governmental</b> <b>agreements.</b> In this paper we describe a strategy for solving the Airline Crew Scheduling Problem approximately. The problem is modeled as a set partitioning problem. We employ a dynamic column generation approach that adds columns to each node of the branch-and-bound tree and present computational results of our algorithm on problem instances of a major European airline. We investigate the influences of various strategies like branching rules and column selection on the solution time and quality. Additionally, our results are compared {{to the results of}} a local search implementation on the same instances, thus yielding one of the first direct comparisons of the two approaches. The main point of this paper is that our algorithm is capable of solving large real world instances with a size typical for major carriers (up to 1400 flights) in the order of minutes on a usual PC. This opens up {{for the first time the}} possibility to integrate this approach in an interactive decision support environment...|$|R

The current policy is outlined besides a new <b>governmental</b> <b>agreement</b> and standpoints put forward by health and welfare professionals. The analysis suggests that migration policy has primacy over health policy. Further, it suggests, that by claiming that their jurisdiction is independent from the state’s interest of control of migration the hierarchy is renegotiated.

40|$|The EU's {{founding}} fathers had {{the protection of}} the EU's constituent units as a key concern and set up serious hurdles to policy innovation in the absence of unanimous <b>governmental</b> <b>agreement.</b> These institutional design features, aptly characterised as "joint-decision trap" by Fritz W. Scharpf, were only softened but not erased over time. Nonetheless, {{the problem of how to}} innovate has, at times, been overcome through eclectic means. There are indeed some well known and quite visible practices as well as some less expected and more obscure strategies that have propelled the EU's policy system beyond what has for a long time been expected. This paper argues that there are two strategic moves the European Commission (and, at times, other supranational actors such as the European Court of Justice) can use to actively overcome member state opposition: first, sidelining some or even all national governments; and, second, manipulating relevant policy preferences. These two basic strategies can be seen to interconnect the diverging basic assumptions of intergovernmentalism and neofunctionalism as 'passerelles'. political science; joint decision making; unanimity; integration theory; intergovernmentalism; neo-functionalism...|$|E

40|$|In the <b>governmental</b> <b>agreement</b> of 2014 {{there was}} a special {{emphasis}} {{on the importance of}} information and communications technology (ICT) in primary education. Using ICT in the classroom would increase the efficiency and rate of student’s learning. In order to successfully integrate the use of ICT in primary schools it’s important that teachers hold a positive attitude towards the use of ICT. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether a relationship exists between personal factors and the educational use of ICT. Schools were contacted via e-mail to request their participation in the study. Using a self-administered questionnaire data was collected from 220 teachers. A total of 10 teachers were interviewed using a semistructured interview guide. The results show no significant difference between the ICT-use of younger and older teachers. The study supports the finding that male teachers use ICT more frequently than female teachers. Furthermore, attitudes towards ICT can be used to predict future educational ICT use. In particular, a positive attitude results in more educational ICT use. The average teacher holds a positive attitude towards ICT. Based on the findings, the advice for school boards is to look more into the ICT capabilities of teachers when hiring since the use of ICT can benefit the educational results of students. Because of the limitations in the research process more research is needed to confirm the findings in the present study...|$|E

Indeed, since then, cooperation in the frame of existing projects has been deepened, complementary and coordinating aspects have been observed, and new fields of materials research have been entered into. Materials sciences is a key discipline for supporting developments in technologically applied fields from the design of novel materials with ascribed or defined properties for new applications (f. i. in informatics) on the one hand, to the fruitful impetus in traditional fields of research and development, on the other hand.
