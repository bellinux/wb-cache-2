5|$|Behind the scenes, HIAG {{cultivated}} {{close relationships}} with the ruling Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (CDU) and the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), garnering attention by inflating its membership numbers and influence. In meetings with politicians in the early 1950s, HIAG claimed to represent 2 million potential voters, a vast exaggeration as only 250,000 Waffen-SS veterans were living in West Germany at that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} the electoral {{defeat of the}} government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs worsened.

40|$|This paper applies {{techniques}} from epidemiology to {{the study}} of unions. The model implies that industries with high turnover of firms will have low unionization rates; that <b>democratic</b> <b>unions</b> which maximize the welfare of current members will be displaced in evolutionary competition by less <b>democratic</b> <b>unions</b> with more moderate wage demands; that this tendency toward moderation will be weaker in European countries where multiple unions compete for the same workers within firms; that unionization levels will be subject to rapid spurts followed by gradual declines; and that there may be one equilibrium with high unionization and long-lived firms and another with low unionization and short-lived firms. These predictions seem broadly consistent with the data...|$|R
5|$|Since 1949, {{the party}} {{system has been}} {{dominated}} by the Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> and the Social Democratic Party of Germany.

However, the smaller liberal Free Democratic Party (in parliament from 1949 to 2013) and the Alliance '90/The Greens (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles. In the German federal election, 2017, Alternative for Germany gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.|$|E

5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began to assert their authority more strongly {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E

However, the political situation in the region, especially {{by the end of}} 1991, was marked with obstructions by the Serb Democratic Party (SDS) that established parallel authorities. Throughout 1991, the SDS established six autonomous regions (SAOs) in Serb-inhabited municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The SAO Northern Bosnia, proclaimed in Doboj in November, covered 17 municipalities, including Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odžak, Bosanski Šamac, Modriča, Gradačac and Orašje. These SAOs were joined into Republika Srpska on 9 January 1992.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia decided to tolerate political parties in response to growing demands to allow political activities outside the Communist party. The first political party founded in Croatia {{since the beginning of the}} Communist rule was the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS), established on 20 May 1989, followed by the Croatian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> on 17 June 1989. In December 1989, Ivica Račan became the head of the reformed Communist party. At the same time, the party cancelled political trials, released political prisoners and endorsed a multi-party political system. The Civil Organisations Act was formally amended to allow political parties on 11 January 1990, legalising the parties that were already founded.|$|E

The party eventually moved its main offices to Bucharest and fell into decline as its leadership joined the ideologically similar PRM. In 2008, the Institute for Research on National Minorities, subordinated to the Romanian Government, opened its official headquarters in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E
5|$|Walther Gottlieb Louis Leisler Kiep (5 January 1926 – 9 May 2016) was a German {{politician}} of the Christian <b>Democratic</b> <b>Union</b> (CDU).

From 1971 until 1992, he was treasurer of his party at the federal level. In this position, Kiep installed a system of unreported income accounts, leading to the CDU donations scandal in 1999.|$|E
