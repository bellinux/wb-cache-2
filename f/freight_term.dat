Recently, a Strategic Freight Network (SFN) has {{been put in place}} to benefit the British rail freight industry. This facilitates opinion gathering from stakeholder groups that include ports, shipping lines, manufacturing, logistics service providers, retailers, quarrying, construction and British rail freight service users. The SFN is a rolling programme of planned investment in infrastructure to allow the efficient operation of longer, larger and more freight trains, to meet the forecast growth in demand (Network Rail 2010 p. 35). The SFN consists of a series of linked schemes, with a rolling programme of investment in more productive locomotives, wagons and terminals, aimed to improve the performance, economic efficiency and capacity of freight on rail (Network Rail 2013 c).

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In {{the import}} and export business, once a buyer and a seller have {{agreed on the}} product and price, {{they also have to}} agree on special terms that will ensure that the parties’ {{different}} obligations are fulfilled. The seller has an interest in the payment he 1 receives for the goods and the buyer has an interest in the actual goods. Both parties therefore have to agree on an insurance policy that will protect the goods from harm, from the time they are at the seller’s warehouse to the time that they reach the buyer’s warehouse. Depending on the type of contract they agree on, the risk of loss, damage or destruction in respect of the goods will be transferred from the seller to the buyer at different crucial stages of the voyage. If the parties contract according to the cost insurance and <b>freight</b> 2 <b>terms,</b> then the seller has the responsibility to procure insurance for the goods. If the parties contract on the terms of the free on board 3 contract, then it is the buyer's responsibility to procure insurance for the goods from the time that the seller delivers them past the ship’s rail. Finally, if the parties trade according to the ex works 4 contractual terms, then the buyer’s obligation is more burdensome because he has to insure the goods already when they are on the premises of the seller, from where he has to collect such goods. In international sales contracts, all such issues are covered, some with great flexibility and others with great misunderstanding. All these matters are dealt with in the present research in an attempt to investigate which party to an international trade contract has an insurable interest in the goods and at what stage during the execution of each party’s duties in terms of the sales contract.

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the system as}} a whole, relevant data need to be collected. Usually this information is obtained through surveys that are carried out at different places. The movement of cargo in a region can be captured basically from three types of freight surveys that complement each other (1) establishment surveys that target the producers and consumers of goods to estimate freight production and attraction inside the urban area; (2) distributor surveys that capture information on goods movements through intermediaries but sometimes are difficult to conduct because of the confidentiality of the data; and (3) carrier surveys that quantify <b>freight</b> patterns in <b>terms</b> of commercial vehicle flows in the transportation network [2]. Considering the information that can be captured from different type of surveys, professionals in charge of estimating freight demand in urban regions must identify the commercial characteristics of the city in order to select the best type of freight surveys to be conducted. It {{is important to note that}} typically one survey type cannot capture all the freight information in a region. For example, origin-destination surveys—which are the most common method to obtain information of truck travel patterns in a city—do not allow to draw a complete picture of all the freight patterns in a city because they miss freight data (e.g., traffic counts, freight generation) to represent the freight traffic flows on the transportation network.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the {{liability}} of the freight forwarders according to national and international law. The liability of the freight forwarder is an extremely complex issue for theoretical examination. The latter is especially case considering the process of complete transformation of the freight forwarder position that freight forwarders experienced {{in the last decade}} of 21 -st century. Considering the fact that process of transformation of freight forwar-ders position imposed a new terminology determinant - logistic operators, in this paper we use the <b>term</b> <b>freight</b> forwarders, and emphasize that the subject of examination is conventional/classical freight forwarders. Theoretical examination of the freight forwarder status is vital for clarification of many practical dilemmas and disputes in logistic sector. The determination of the freight forwarders liability is aimed at reducing of judical and arbitral disputes in Macedonian practice, and analysis of the legal regime of the freight forwarder’s liability in the context of international shiiping, which present the main goal of this paper. The clarification of the freight forwarders liability is closely related to the determination of the freight forwarder position towards his principal and the third party in the obligation. For the purposes of the determination of freight forwarders liability, the position of freight forwarders in front of the customs services, insurance companies, warehouses, companies for control of {{the quality and quantity of}} the goods, will be a subject of consideration...|$|R
40|$|Decoupling {{road freight}} {{transport}} from economic growth has been acknowledged by the European Union {{to be a key}} means to improving sustainability. It is therefore important to identify the drivers that explain {{road freight transport}} demand {{in order to determine the}} most appropriate policy measures to reduce road transport without curbing economic development. This research uses an Input–Output (IO) structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to explain road <b>freight</b> transport in <b>terms</b> of a set of key variables that have strongly influenced road freight demand in recent decades in European countries. This methodological approach allows us to quantify the contribution of certain factors in each country —such as economic growth, economic structure and the evolution of road freight transport intensity (including improvements in both supply and transport systems) — to road freight transportation. The empirical basis for this analysis is a dataset of nine European countries which have IO tables and road transport data available from 2000 to 2007, comprising data on domestic production, imports and exports as well as tonne-kms for 11 types of commodity classes. The results show that aggregate road transport demand has grown – driven mainly by economic activity– but this growth has been strongly curbed in some countries by changes in road freight transport intensity and moderately by the dematerialization of the economy. As a result, different levels of decoupling can be seen across Europe...|$|R

Vhembe District Municipality’s economy is largely based on agriculture, agribusiness, mining and forestry, wholesale and retail. Improved freight transport can effectively enhance socio-economic development and job creation in the area. Consequently, in 2012, Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) commissioned a study {{for the development of}} the District Freight Logistics Strategy. The key objective of the study was to unpack freight logistics operations in the District and to inform the District of the <b>freight</b> situation in <b>terms</b> of type, origin and destination of freight products, condition and capacity of key corridors and intervention measures required to address any bottlenecks. The argument presented in this paper is that the District could, with a clear freight strategy and action plan, become the most important gateway of general cargo at Musina servicing Zimbabwe, Botswana in the West, Zambia and further countries in central, eastern and northern parts of Africa. The outcome of the study is the positioning of the district to manage in a sustainable manner current and future freight demand across all modes in support of the broad goals of social-economic development.

40|$|A growing {{imbalance}} between {{demand for}} <b>freight</b> mobility (in <b>terms</b> of ton and tkm) and {{the supply of}} transport (in terms of lanes of infrastructure) in and around seaports is jeopardising the sustainability of its future development. Given the ever growing globalisation of the maritime industry any shortage in (trans-port) capacity is negative. In addition to cost-effective pricing and management application of technological improvements {{in the field of}} transport and transhipment will make port development more sustainable. New (underground) modes of transport could help, the more because transport capacity extensions on the earth surface are more and more affected by limitations in speed and size as a function of density of population and the existence of biotopes, especially around (port) towns. Moreover improved surface transport systems such as lash, pushing convoys and double-stack trains are not applicable everywhere in the BNL. Of course expansion of trans-port capacity can be realised in various ways: by using bigger vehicles, by re-organising transportation spatially and timely, etc., but by creating new 9 ̆ 3 ways 9 ̆ 4 or modes of transportation a much greater extension in capacity will be achieved. The feasibility of any new transport mode however depends upon cost recovering. An in-depth study of the situation in Antwerp and Rotterdam has been performed in order to acquire correct understanding of technical, economical and commercial consequences. It includes travel time and reliability analyses and a cost analysis. UCM (Underground Container Movers) as a pilot project demonstrates that 9 ̆ 3 Underground Tubular Transport 9 ̆ 4 contains interesting features to avoid congestion and to increase the efficiency of terminal operations in seaports confronted with congestion due to constant growing truck volumes. The volume to be transported through the UCM-system must be high enough to cover all costs (more than 2 million TEU in the business case). Application in due time of the UCM-system in the port of Antwerp might also alleviate the congestion on certain hinterland connections, especially on high ways, which together with lifecycle considerations increases the degree of sustainability of this new way of transportation...|$|R
40|$|Although {{regulation}} for emissions, pollution, etc., {{is becoming}} stricter, the Australian rail freight industry is still locked in to using {{large numbers of}} existing rolling stock, e. g., locomotives and wagons. Much of this rolling stock is no longer efficient. Largely {{as a result of}} infrastructure constraints, it is not feasible for operators to dispense with their old technology at regular intervals, even though they will need to pay more to use older technology if a carbon price eventuates. This thesis seeks to ascertain the viability of promoting investment incentives for newly acquired locomotives, wagons and other equipment. It analyses the impact of an accelerated depreciation scheme on the investment behaviour of above-rail operators and offers a comparison with alternative incentives or mechanisms. These schemes, if their efficacy is demonstrated, could potentially provide tools to encourage re-equipment of the aging rail fleet and facilitate the provision of sustainable rail freight growth in Australia. A three-stage sequential mixed methods approach was designed to investigate the investment implications of accelerated depreciation in the rail freight sector. In the first stage, an in-depth interview technique was employed to contextualise the rolling stock replacement decisions among rail freight firms. In the second stage, an extended asset replacement model exclusively was developed to examine whether accelerated depreciation and other tax concessions could significantly reduce the optimal time to replace rolling stock in the Australian rail freight industry. In the final stage, a focus group technique was applied to examine the findings from the first two stages and provide in-depth expert assessments of their implications. This thesis concludes that accelerated depreciation alone is unlikely to be sufficient to assure a desired level of investment in cleaner technologies. The scheme should be part of a whole suite of initiatives to stimulate investment, and should not be the primary mechanism. The main obstacle is the incompatibility between the existing below-rail infrastructure in Australia and the modernised above-rail equipments. This implies that even though accelerated depreciation successfully offers them the incentive to replace their old fleets with newly acquired rolling stock, it is impossible, for example, to run the new train on the existing track. Improving the below-rail infrastructure therefore has been identified as the only way to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the rail <b>freight</b> sector in <b>terms</b> of overall energy efficiency. Nevertheless, upgrading the infrastructure is a difficult task. To encourage greater energy efficiency within the rail freight sector in the short term, some other instantaneous initiatives should be provided. A two-pronged approach to energy efficiency in the rail freight sector has been proposed. In particular, some incentives to buy new equipment combined with a ‘cash for clunkers’ scheme with a refurbishment option to make existing assets more energy efficient are needed to deliver appropriate outcomes in the short term. Incentives aimed at buying new equipment are particularly crucial for regions where the rail networks have already been upgraded to suit modern energy-efficient equipment, whereas programs targeting the refurbishing of older assets are necessary for track that is not suitable for modern equipment, which is generally heavier than the older equipment. Apart from its implications for managerial practices within the rail freight sector and implications for policies pertaining to rail freight operation, another major highlight of this thesis is the derivation of the extended asset replacement model under taxation, inflation, and technological progress environment. The novelty of this model is its comprehensiveness. The effects of technological advancement, taxes, and inflation have been analysed by previous replacement studies. The literature, however, indicates that these three factors have not been incorporated into the replacement model simultaneously. This thesis also makes a significant contribution to the research methodology in finance. Combining a qualitative method and a quantitative approach, or in other words, using mixed methods in finance has not proved to be very popular. This thesis shows that it is justifiable in instances where the likelihood of a policy being useful to stakeholders is being assessed, and where the context of the policy and the context of the area in which it is applied are important...|$|R
