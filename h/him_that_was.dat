5|$|Six {{months after}} the alien {{substance}} Terrigen was released into the ecosystem, Joey Gutierrez developed metal-melting abilities. Unable to control this power, Gutierrez is confronted in the streets by soldiers {{who are willing to}} use lethal force to detain him. Gutierrez is saved by S.H.I.E.L.D., and Inhuman agent Daisy Johnson attempts to explain to him that he is also an Inhuman, with a dormant gene within <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> activated by the Terrigen. Struggling to help Gutierrez accept what has happened to him, Johnson seeks the help of Lincoln Campbell, the Inhuman who helped her transition but has now renounced the ways of the Inhumans, wishing to live a normal life.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered {{by some of}} his successes, in 1940 Narayan {{tried his}} hand at a journal, Indian Thought. With {{the help of his}} uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a {{thousand}} subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan's inability to manage it, and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, Malgudi Days, was published in November 1942, followed by The English Teacher in 1945. In between, being cut off from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan's books started selling well and in 1948 he started building his own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the screenplay for the Gemini Studios film Miss Malini (1947), which remained the only screenplay by <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> successfully adapted into a feature film.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, he was {{inspired}} to write music again {{after the birth of}} his first child, Michael, with fellow R singer and then-girlfriend Angie Stone. He also traveled back to the South, spending time in South Carolina and in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, while reconnecting himself with the African-American musical history that had originally inspired him. Shortly after his son's birth and the release of his first live album Live at the Jazz Cafe (1998) through EMI Records, he began preparation for the recording of songs for Voodoo. In several interviews after its release, he cited his son's birth as an inspirational source and creative muse for him. A dedication to his son Michael and daughter Imani was included in the album's liner notes, which were co-written by D'Angelo and writer/musician Saul Williams. In a press video accompanying the release of Voodoo, D'Angelo suggested that he was attempting to create a new sound for <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> in transition.|$|E

25|$|The last contact Tobares {{had with}} someone was at 12:32p.m. on June 5, 2013, {{the day he}} disappeared. He was {{speaking}} to Verónica Román, a friend from Argentina.

25|$|In {{the same}} year, C. E. W.

The Dunsterville Mission had failed in its original purpose but managed to stop the agents of the Central powers getting into Iran. The obstruction of the Jungle Movement of Gilan (Jangali) was achieved by Bicherakov but this would have not occurred without the rapport with <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> established by Dunsterville.

500|$|The pastel {{drawing of}} Krusty was drawn entirely by Dominic Polcino, who {{revealed}} {{it was the}} only piece of original artwork created solely by <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> featured in an episode. He created the pastel drawing with this in mind. It was an easy episode for Polcino to direct {{due to the lack of}} crowds and being a [...] "grounded episode". This is the last episode in which Doris Grau has a speaking role as Lunchlady Doris, although this episode aired nearly two years after her death. It would also mark the final time the character would speak until Season 18's [...] "The Mook, the Chef, the Wife and Her Homer" [...] when she was voiced by Tress MacNeille.|$|E
500|$|Kunichika was {{described}} as having an open, friendly and sincere personality. He enjoyed partying with the geishas and prostitutes of the Yoshiwara district, while consuming abundant amounts of alcohol. [...] His greatest passion, however, {{was said to be}} the theater, where he was a backstage regular. His appearance said to be shabby. He was constantly in debt and often borrowed money from the kabuki actors he depicted so admiringly. [...] A contemporary said of him: [...] "Print designing, theater and drinking were his life and for <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> enough." [...] A contemporary actor, Matsusuke IV, said that when visiting actors backstage for the purpose of sketching them, Kunichika would not socialize but would concentrate intensely on his work.|$|E

500|$|Super Meat Boys soundtrack was {{composed}} by Danny Baranowsky, who previously composed the soundtracks for the indie video games Canabalt, Cortex Command, and Gravity Hook. He also composed {{the music for}} the original Meat Boy. McMillen knew of Baranowsky's other work, and approached him late in Meat Boys development, asking him to supply whatever tracks he had on hand. For the soundtrack of Super Meat Boy, Baranowsky incorporated the music he had provided for Meat Boy into an expanded soundtrack. He tried {{to ensure that the}} music would accompany the action on the screen without overpowering the sound effects. Baranowsky was given complete freedom for the game's music, and retained all of the rights to it; McMillen believed that being more invested in the game would let Baranowsky express the part of <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> [...] "manic, obsessive, complex, and full of life". McMillen feels that the soundtrack [...] "gets your heart rate up, complements every aspect of its gameplay, and stays with you for days".|$|E
500|$|... "Questions for the Angels" [...] {{includes}} {{a reference to}} American rapper Jay-Z, which {{was inspired by a}} billboard featuring <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> present over the Brooklyn Bridge for a time. Simon mentioned that he would pass it {{on his way to the}} Brooklyn Academy of Music when they were holding a month-long celebration of his music in April 2008. Simon included the line to create a sharp transition from angels in Heaven to a downtown Brooklyn street. [...] "So Beautiful or So What" [...] contains what Simon once admitted is [...] "one of [...] favorite Bo Diddley rhythms," [...] and the song’s title references Miles Davis's [...] "So What". The title is a question Simon envisioned when facing the enormity of the infinite. The song almost became a collaboration with Bob Dylan; Simon felt two verses might be nice for him and sent him a message through their mutual manager. Although Dylan said that he liked the song, Simon did not hear back in sufficient time, as the album was on a deadline.|$|E
500|$|In retrospect, Kishimoto says he felt Sasuke was a {{difficult}} character to write, requiring {{a great deal of}} forethought and planning. In early 2014, when asked whether Sasuke was good or evil, Kishimoto referred to him as a [...] "very pure person," [...] adding that while some of his actions, such as following his clan's ideals, are positive, his self-centered nature tends to cause problems for others. Before the series finale, Sasuke decides to leave on a solo journey. Kishimoto later explained that besides self-atonement, Sasuke also wanted to discover the origins of the series' final antagonist. However, Kishimoto decided not to explain this in the manga. For the spin-off focused on Sarada Uchiha, Sasuke and Sakura's daughter, Kishimoto wanted to explain how the couple was connected despite not being close as a result of Sasuke's mission which made him leave his village. The author also wanted to put effort in the final scene of Uchiha family as for <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the most important area of the spin-off.|$|E
