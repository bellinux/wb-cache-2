40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and etidronate (<b>etidronic</b> <b>acid),</b> a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (<b>etidronic</b> <b>acid),</b> has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (clodronic acid), pamidronate (pamidronic acid), alendronate (alendronic acid) and risedronate (risedronic acid). Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular steal syndromes.

40|$|The Enterobacteriaceae {{antibiotics}} resistance {{depends on}} a combination of several mechanisms, such as the beta-lactamases overproduction, the microbial cell reduction outer membrane permeability (usually associated with loss of protein porin), the presence of efflux systems. Particularly noteworthy are the metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) whose presence causes resistance of gram-negative microorganisms to all beta-lactam antibiotics (in some cases except aztreonam). Currently there are no MBL inhibitors permitted for use in the clinic. The effective inhibitors search for carbapenem-resistant bacteria’ MBL authorized for use in the clinic and reinforcing effects of carbapenems, served {{as the basis for the}} present study. The work was carried out in three stages: 1) creating a model system using a standard enzyme reagent metallo-beta-lactamase P. aeruginosa recombinant expressed in E. coli, to evaluate the increasing of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of carbapenems against previously sensitive Gram-negative microorganisms strains in vitro; 2) evaluation of MBL promising inhibitors in the presence of the same standard enzyme reagent; 3) evaluation of the ability of the identified inhibitors increase the carbapenems effects against clinical isolates of Gram-negative microorganisms producing MBL, in terms of the their MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FIC index).

SherwoodThis {{work is a}} {{detailed}} study {{of the interaction between}} two phosphorous-containing acids and the metals chromium and 316 L stainless steel. The objective of this work is to investigate the formation of unique thin films on the two metals and to probe the surface chemistry of these films through the use of core level and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Chromium forms a wide array of oxides and can exist at several valencies. Valence band XPS is used in conjunction with band structure and multiple scattered wave X[alpha] calculations to distinguish which states are present in the resultant films. Both 99. 99 % chromium and 316 L stainless steel foils were treated with orthophosphoric acid and 1 -hydroxyethylidene- 1, 1 -diphosphonic acid, otherwise known as <b>etidronic</b> <b>acid.</b> Two methods developed in the Sherwood research laboratory for forming oxide-free films on metal surfaces are utilized in this work. Core level XPS results did not provide sufficient information to draw conclusions regarding the products formed in the reactions.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Hard-tissue debris is {{accumulated}} during rotary instrumentation. This {{study investigated}} {{to what extent}} a calcium-complexing agent that has good short-term compatibility with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) could reduce debris accumulation when applied in an all-in-one irrigant during root canal instrumentation. METHODS: Sixty extracted mandibular molars with isthmuses in the mesial root canal system were selected based on prescans using a micro-computed tomography system. Thirty teeth each {{were randomly assigned to}} be instrumented with a rotary system and irrigated with either 2. 5 % NaOCl or 2. 5 % NaOCl containing 9 % (wt/vol) <b>etidronic</b> <b>acid</b> (HEBP). Using a side-vented irrigating tip, 2 mL of irrigant was applied by 1 blinded investigator to the mesial canals after each instrument. Five milliliters of irrigant was applied per canal as the final rinse. Mesial root canal systems were scanned at high resolution before and after treatment, and accumulated hard-tissue debris was calculated as vol% of the original canal anatomy. Values between groups were compared using the Student's t test (α <. 05). RESULTS: Irrigation with 2. 5 % NaOCl resulted in 5. 5 ± 3. 6 vol% accumulated hard-tissue debris compared with 3. 8 ± 1. 8 vol% when HEBP was contained in the irrigant (P <. 05).

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of nasal calcitonin (Miacalcin(R)) compared with no therapy, alendronate or etidronate {{in the treatment}} of postmenopausal women with previous osteoporotic fracture. Design and setting: Meta-analysis followed by economic analysis. Perspective: A Canadian provincial Ministry of Health. Methods: The meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials was based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Economic analysis was conducted within a Markov model using probabilities and costs derived from Canadian sources. Results: The meta-analysis found evidence of the positive effect of both nasal calcitonin and alendronate in reducing the risks of hip, wrist and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. However, {{there was a lack of}} evidence of the effect of etidronate on hip and wrist fractures. For a 65 -year-old woman, with 5 years' therapy, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for nasal calcitonin was 46 500 Canadian dollars ($Can) compared with no therapy and $Can 32 600 compared with etidronate (1998 values). Comparison with alendronate was highly sensitive to the inclusion of one specific trial. Conclusions: Given the results of the analysis, based on current evidence, nasal calcitonin can be considered at the margins of being cost effective when compared with no therapy. Compared with active therapy, nasal calcitonin can be considered more cost effective than etidronate, but its cost effectiveness versus alendronate is inconclusive.

Methodology Single-rooted teeth (n= 100) were divided into five groups (n= 20) based on the irrigation protocol and their root canals instrumented using a rotary Ni-Ti system: 2. 5 % NaOCl during instrumentation followed by bi-distilled water (G 1) or 17 % EDTA (G 2) as final rinse; 1 : 1 mixture of 5 % NaOCl and 18 % HEBP during instrumentation, and the same mixture (G 3), 17 % EDTA (G 4) or bi-distilled water (G 5) as final rinse. Canals were filled with AH Plus. Roots were sectioned, and push-out tests were performed in coronal, middle and apical root thirds. Results were analysed using analysis of variance (anova) and Bonferroni test for multiple comparisons. The alpha-type error was set at 0. 05 for all the analyses. Results Push-out bond strength was highest in coronal and lowest in apical root thirds (P< 0. 05). Groups that used NaOCl+HEBP irrigation during instrumentation had significantly higher bond strengths than groups following the NaOCl-EDTA irrigation in all root thirds (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to determine the}} interactions between root filling materials and root dentin and to investigate if root canal irrigating solutions had an impact on these interactions. The following outcomes were assessed in the studies encompassed in this thesis: (i) dislocation resistance of an epoxy resin based root canal sealer and tricalcium silicate based root canal sealers, (ii) the influence of irrigation protocols on the sealing ability and chemical interactions with dentin of an epoxy resin based sealer, (iii) retreatability of mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers, (iv) characterization of a mineral trioxide aggregate based sealer following exposure to irrigation regimens. The results showed that irrigation protocols diﬀerentially influenced the sealer materials. The use of continuous chelation (sodium hypochlorite + <b>etidronic</b> <b>acid)</b> enhanced the bond strength of epoxy resin as well as mineral trioxide aggregate based sealers. This irrigation regimen also positively influenced the hydration characteristics of the tricalcium silicate materials. The bond strength of tricalcium silicate sealers improved with time. The epoxy resin sealer AH Plus chemically bonds to root dentin and irrigation protocols employing a final rinse of a proteolytic irrigant reduced the bond strength. Use of a final rinse of EDTA after continuous chelation significantly improved the bond strength of the epoxy resin sealer.

Materials and Methods: The sample size for the study was 100. Each specimen consisted of a longitudinally sectioned half of a root of a single-rooted tooth which was embedded in acrylic resin. The prepared specimens were divided randomly into five groups of twenty specimens each. Each group was treated with the irrigants to be tested. Group I was the control - the specimens were treated with distilled water. The specimens in Group II were treated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) followed by EDTA. Specimens in Group III were treated with NaOCl followed by CHX. Specimens in Group IV were treated with NaOCl followed by HEBP, and specimens in Group V were treated with NaOCl followed by propolis. Following this, all the specimens were placed on the Vickers hardness tester and three readings were taken for each specimen. An average reading was obtained for each group. The results were tabulated and statistically analyzed to determine which of the irrigant solutions had the least effect on the microhardness of root dentin. Results: Eighteen percent HEBP had the least effect on the root dentin microhardness, followed by 4 % propolis and 2 % CHX. Seventeen percent EDTA showed maximum effect on the microhardness of the dentin. Conclusion: Under the limitations of this study, 18 % HEBP and 4 % propolis show promise for use as irrigants because of less detrimental effect on the hardness of root dentin.

Among the known bone diseases (osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, multiple myeloma, Paget’s disease and several others), the most challenging is osteoporosis, which burdens millions of people compromising patients’ quality of life. The recommended pharmaceutical treatment is the use of bis-phosphonates (BPs, a. k. a. “-dronates”). <b>Etidronic</b> <b>acid</b> (ETID) is the first osteoporosis treatment to enter the market (1977), while zoledronic acid is one of the treatments that followed (2007). Studies with N-containing BPs have shown that they are taken up by mature osteoclasts and inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphatase synthase, an enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Their success in mitigating osteoporosis notwithstanding, these “-dronate” drugs present a number of challenges including limited bioavailability, fast excretion, and numerous side-effects, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, hypocalcemia, esophageal cancer, ocular inflammation, atrial fibrillation, etc [...] It is, therefore, imperative to design and fabricate “smart” systems that allow controlled delivery of the active BP agent, which will depend on the patient’s needs and idiosyncrasies.

A number of phosphonates and carboxylates were tested here as potential crystallization modifiers for sodium carbonate crystallization. Precipitated phases during crystallization induced either by cooling or by evaporation tests were nahcolite (NaHCO 3), natron (Na 2 CO 3 ∙ 10 H 2 O) and thermonatrite (Na 2 CO 3 ∙H 2 O), identified using X-ray diffraction. By using the thermodynamic code PHREEQC and the calculation of the nucleation rate it was demonstrated that nahcolite had to be first phase formed during both tests. The formation of the other phases depended on the experimental conditions under which the two tests were conducted. Nahcolite nucleation is strongly inhibited {{in the presence of}} sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate (CA), polyacrylic acid 2100 MW (PA) and <b>etidronic</b> <b>acid</b> (HEDP), when the additives are dosed at appropriate concentrations and the pH range of the resulting solution is about 8. Electrostatic attraction generated between the deprotonated organic additives and the cations present in solution appears to be the principal mechanism of additive-nahcolite interaction. Salt weathering tests, in addition to mercury intrusion porosimetry tests allowed to quantify the damage induced by such salts. FESEM observation of both salts grown on calcite single crystals and in limestone blocks subjected to salt crystallization tests allowed to identify the effect of these additives on crystal growth and development.

All markers of bone metabolism urinary collagen type 1 cross-linked N-telopeptide, urinary free deoxypyridinoline, serum bone alkaline phosphatase, and serum osteocalcin were decreased. The incidence rate of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures was also decreased. Therefore, effectiveness in fracture prevention was confirmed. A form of minodronic acid (50 mg) requiring once-monthly administration has been developed and is currently being used clinically. A comparative study between this new formulation and once-daily minodronic acid (1 mg) showed {{no significant differences between}} the two formulations in terms of improvement rates in lumbar-spine and hip-joint bone density, changes in bone metabolism markers, or incidence of side effects. This indicates the noninferiority of the monthly formulation. Side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures were not reported with other bisphosphonates, although it is believed that these side effects may emerge as future studies continue to be conducted. On the basis of studies conducted to date, minodronic acid hydrate is considered effective for improving bone density and preventing fractures. We anticipate further investigations in the future.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{the most}} {{frequent}} metabolic condition experienced by elderly individuals. It is characterised by a low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue leading {{to an increase in}} bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. Osteoporosis constitutes a significant financial burden for health services as well as a source of pain and disability and a cause of a decrease in {{the quality of life for}} patients with the condition. Effective therapy for osteoporosis is, therefore, urgently needed. Currently, a number of different therapeutic approaches exist that have more or less proven positive effects on the incidence of fractures, for example estrogen replacement therapy, calcitonin, fluoride salts, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the first-generation bisphosphonate etidronate (<b>etidronic</b> <b>acid).</b> Alendronate (alendronic acid) is an alkylaminobisphosphonate with a very potent antiresorptive capability. In contrast to etidronate, alendronate possesses an excellent ratio between its potency for inhibiting bone resorption and its potency for impairing bone formation. In addition, no case of focal or generalised osteomalacia has so far been observed with alendronate. The bioavailability of oral alendronate is poor and the agent has to be taken in a fasting state, at least 30 minutes before breakfast, with a full glass of water. Alendronate has demonstrated its ability to increase bone mass significantly above the placebo values at any studied skeletal site in a wide variety of patient subgroups regardless of age, race, baseline rate of bone turnover or baseline bone mineral density. Alendronate is the only medication with a demonstrated positive effect on symptomatic and asymptomatic vertebral fracture rate, as well as on nonvertebral fracture rate. In clinical trials, alendronate was generally well tolerated and no significant clinical or biological adverse experiences were observed. However, postmarketing data have included reports of oesophageal lesions compatible with the diagnosis of alendronate-induced chemical oesophagitis, in around 1 % of patients taking the agent. However, in the vast majority of cases alendronate tablets had been taken incorrectly. Therefore, with proper use, that is, use complying with the manufacturers administration recommendations, this potentially dangerous complication should be minimised and should not outweigh the overall positive benefit of alendronate in the prevention of fractures...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new contrast agents such as iron oxide nanoparticles {{is very important for}} diagnostic imaging. Iron oxide nanoparticles are an important class of imaging probes. Sterically stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles are already used in different clinical applications of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the future, the early diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesions using MRI and iron oxide nanoparticles could prevent clinical complications such as myocardial infarction and stroke and serve to monitor the response to treatment. In this work several electrostatically stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles with different surface properties were synthesized by using different monomeric acids for coating. In addition to very small iron oxide nanoparticles (VSOP), which are stabilized by a negatively charged shell of citric acid, 4 further electrostatically stabilized nanoparticles could be synthesized out of 8 potential monomeric substances. Coatings with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), <b>etidronic</b> <b>acid,</b> malic acid, and tartaric acid resulted in stable nanoparticles. Verification of iron oxide nanoparticles using the Prussian blue staining method established in the literature failed in apoE-/ [...] mice due to the presence of endogenous iron within the atherosclerotic plaques. Hence, alternative methods were identified and developed to prove and quantify iron oxide nanoparticles in plaques. Using ex vivo MRI and the recently established technique of magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), a three-fold higher accumulation was found for VSOP compared with etidronic acid-, malic acid-, and tartaric acid-stabilized nanoparticles, while DMSA-coated nanoparticles did not target atherosclerotic plaques. Histologically, VSOP were mostly identified in endothelial cells and macrophages and occasionally outside cells using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, a very sensitive method based on Europium doping and the use of laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) was established for definitive histologic identification of iron oxide nanoparticles. Based on quantitative results, VSOP as the best nanoparticle, was demonstrated within atheroslerotic plaques of apoE-/ [...] mice in vivo. Imaging quality was very good, underlining the potential of VSOP for clinical use. In comparison to sterically stabilized iron oxide nanoparticles, all 4 particles had shorter blood half-lifes of less than one hour. This is an essential advantage for clinical use because it would allow use of the particles for T 1 -weighted MR angiography and subsequent T 2 *-weighted imaging in a single session...|$|E
40|$|Bone repair devices {{made from}} degradable polymers, such as poly lactic acid (PLA) have {{limitation}} {{in terms of}} matching the mechanical property requirements for bone repair, both initially and {{for the duration of}} repair. For this reason the use of totally degradable phosphate glass fibre (PGF) reinforced PLA composite has proved attractive. A crucial part of the success of such implants is maintenance of interfacial integrity between the polymer matrix and reinforcement phases of the composite. It is well known that most fibre reinforced composites loose 50 % or more of their strength due to interfacial integrity loss. In this study candidate chemical treatments for PGF reinforced PLA composite are being investigated in terms of their reactability, biocompatibility, effect on interfacial mechanical properties and degradation behaviour of these composites. As a crucial part of this project, phosphate based glass (PBG) formulations were devised and assessed for structural, thermal, degradation and cytocompatibility variations with varying P 2 O 5 or Fe 2 O 3 content. Selected formulations were drawn into fibres and tested for single fibre tensile strength. Finally, a glass formulation (P 45 Ca 16 Mg 24 Na 11 Fe 4, number indicates percentage molar concentration of oxides) was selected for surface modification and composite production. Chemical surface treatments were {{selected on the basis of}} potential to react with PBG and PLA. Mode of chemical interaction between PBG and surface treatments chemicals were analysed using surface analyses techniques (FTIR and XPS). It was found that aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APS), <b>etidronic</b> <b>acid</b> (EA) and hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) were linked through covalent bonds, other agents making hydrogen bonds with PBG. Chemical treatments were optimised and investigated for their effect on interfacial shear strength (IFSS) between polymer/glass, wettability and degradation behaviour. Chemically treated PBG was also assessed for cytocompatibility of elution products, short–term direct contact with MG 63 osteosarcoma and long term direct contact with primary human osteoblasts. All selected surface treatment chemicals except amino phosphonic acid (APA) improved the interfacial bond between PBG and PLA. However, the covalently linked agents (HDI, APS and EA) saw up to 4 –fold improvement in IFSS. SPLA also improved the IFSS significantly, which was attributed to the presence of several –OH groups. There was no significant effect on degradation rate of PBG. All agents demonstrated acceptable cytocompatibility for their elution products and in direct contact. Selected chemicals (APS, EA, SPLA and HDI) were investigated further in PGF reinforced PLA composite. PGF mats (UD or non–woven), treated with surface treatment chemical were sandwich–pressed between PLA sheets. Flexural mechanical properties with degradation, water–uptake, degradation rate and cytocompatibility were tested. It was found that surface chemical treatment improved the initial flexural properties (APS, SPLA) and/or delayed the mechanical integrity loss (HDI, APS), latter was attributed to the reduced water–uptake and maintenance of relatively strong interface. Human osteoblasts were found to perform normal functions when cultured on prepared composites...|$|E
