5|$|Non-aposematic {{species have}} often evolved {{to mimic the}} {{conspicuous}} markings of their aposematic counterparts. For example, the <b>hornet</b> <b>moth</b> is a mimic of the yellowjacket wasp; it resembles the wasp, but has no sting. A predator which avoids the wasp will to some degree also avoid the moth. This is known as Batesian mimicry, after Henry Walter Bates, a British naturalist who studied Amazonian butterflies {{in the second half}} of the 19th century. Batesian mimicry is frequency dependent: it is most effective when the ratio of mimic to model is low; otherwise, predators learn to recognise the impostors.|$|E
25|$|The novel Hornet Flight by Ken Follett is {{a thriller}} of the Resistance against the Nazi {{occupation}} of Denmark in World War II. In the novel a de Havilland <b>Hornet</b> <b>Moth</b> {{is used by}} the protagonists to fly from Denmark to the United Kingdom with information about a German radar system. The author drew inspiration from an actual flight that took place during World War II.|$|E
50|$|No. 528 Squadron {{was formed}} on 28 June 1943 at RAF Filton for radar {{calibration}} duties in the West Country, using Bristol Blenheims and de Havilland <b>Hornet</b> <b>Moths.</b> On 15 May 1944 the squadron moved north to RAF Digby, Lincolnshire for similar tasks, {{until it was}} disbanded on 1 September 1944 by being absorbed into No. 527 Squadron RAF.|$|R
50|$|The first Sikorsky {{helicopters}} {{used by the}} RAF {{were also}} assembled and tested at Hooton {{towards the end of}} the war. During the war years, Hooton assembled and repaired thousands of aircraft. The RAF operated a flight of Coastal Command Avro Ansons, de Havilland Tiger Moths and de Havilland <b>Hornet</b> <b>Moths</b> on anti-submarine patrols during 1939 and 1940. No. 11 Radio School and No. 3 General Reconnaissance School flew from the airfield.|$|R
50|$|When she was eighty {{she decided}} that {{the time had come}} to give up flying. In {{civilian}} life she flew <b>Hornet</b> <b>Moths,</b> of which only thirty were made. They were the precursor of the Tiger Moth. Her first had the then luxury of leather seats and a fully enclosed two-seat cabin. Her second she bought from a butcher in Aberdeen, and when she stopped flying it was sold to an Australian sheep farmer.|$|R
500|$|On 12 March 1938, Captain Davis, {{managing}} director of the Cinque Ports Flying Club, was killed in an accident shortly after take-off from Lympne.

500|$|Poulton gives {{examples}} of mimicry in other insect groups, remarking the [...] "very imperfect" [...] resemblance of bee hawk-moths to bees, which totally failed to [...] "impose on" [...] a lizard, but {{noting that the}} much more convincing mimicry of the <b>hornet</b> clearwing <b>moth</b> was treated with extreme caution by an inexperienced lizard.|$|R
50|$|No. 527 Squadron {{was formed}} from various {{calibration}} flights at RAF Castle Camps, Cambridgeshire on 15 June 1943 for radar calibration duties with Bristol Blenheims and Hawker Hurricanes. The squadron was engaged with the calibration of radar stations in southern England and East Anglia. The need for calibration units lessened considerably in 1944, so the squadron absorbed No. 528 Squadron RAF on 1 September 1944, extending its {{coverage in the}} process to Lincolnshire, and No. 526 Squadron RAF on 1 May 1945, adding the de Havilland <b>Hornet</b> <b>Moths,</b> Airspeed Oxfords and de Havilland Dominies of these units to its strength. The squadron standardised hereafter on Spitfires, Wellingtons, Oxfords and Dominies, the latter -old aircraft of 526 Squadron- still being based at RAF Longman, Inverness for communications flying. In November 1945, the squadron moved to RAF Watton, Norfolk where it disbanded on 15 April 1946.|$|R
2500|$|In February 1936, {{the site}} {{measured}} [...] Fuel and customs facilities had been provided and a temporary hangar erected.

The aircraft bore the inscription [...] "Flying Flea flies in England. I thank the Air Ministry". Following the race, Short Scion aircraft flew pleasure flights.
