5|$|The {{decision}} in Cambridge Water Co made an immediate {{change to the}} law, {{for the first time}} requiring <b>foreseeability</b> of harm to be considered in cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher and the general tort of nuisance. It was also significant in implying that Rylands was not an independent tort, something later concluded in the Transco case. Goff's judgment has been criticised on several points by academics, who highlight flaws in wording which leave parts of the judgment ambiguous and a selective assessment of Rylands that ignores outside influences.|$|E
5|$|For {{there to}} be a claim in private nuisance, the {{claimant}} must show that the defendant's actions caused damage. This can be physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, or discomfort and inconvenience. The test for remoteness of damage in nuisance is reasonable <b>foreseeability,</b> as established in Cambridge Water Co Ltd v Eastern Counties Leather plc; if the defendant was using their land unreasonably and causing a nuisance, the defendant is liable even if they used reasonable care to avoid creating a nuisance. The test {{is whether or not the}} nuisance was reasonably foreseeable; if it was, the defendant is expected to avoid it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Foreseeability</b> – {{there must}} be a close {{relationship}} of love and affection between the secondary victim and the primary victim.|$|E
500|$|Lord Goff's {{judgment}} was primarily {{based on whether}} or not <b>foreseeability</b> of damage should be a factor in Rylands cases, and was that the matter was [...] "open for consideration", saying that the need for <b>foreseeability</b> of damage to be a criterion was [...] "a matter of principle". He considered the case of Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co, in which the Privy Council concluded that <b>foreseeability</b> of damage was an essential part of determining liability in nuisance. The Council stated that [...] "It could not be right to discriminate between different cases of nuisance so as to make <b>foreseeability</b> a necessary element in determining damages in those cases where it is a necessary element in determining liability, but not in others". If, as Goff was stating, Rylands was an element of nuisance, this decision should apply to it. In the original judgment in Rylands, the judge had stated that it covered [...] "anything likely to do mischief if it escapes", and that liability should be to [...] "answer for the natural and anticipated consequences"; this wording implies that he intended for [...] "knowledge to be a prerequisite for liability".|$|E
500|$|Goff's {{judgment}} {{made several}} significant and immediate {{changes to the}} law. First, {{it was the first}} decision which imposed a requirement of <b>foreseeability</b> of harm to cases brought under Rylands v Fletcher; [...] "it must be shown that the defendant has done something which he recognised, or judged by the standards appropriate at the relevant place or time, or ought reasonably to have recognised, as giving rise to an exceptionally high risk of danger or mischief if there should be an escape, however unlikely an escape may have been thought to be". Secondly, it was the first decision to state that Rylands may be a sub-set of nuisance, and as such applied the same requirement of <b>foreseeability</b> of harm to nuisance, where previously such a requirement had not existed.|$|E
500|$|Academic Tom Clearwater criticises {{some of the}} {{language}} Lord Goff picked out of Rylands v Fletcher for his judgment. In particular, Goff's use of [...] "anything likely to do mischief if it escapes" [...] and [...] "answer for the natural and anticipated consequences" [...] to justify his argument that Rylands had always intended <b>foreseeability</b> {{to be a factor}} suggests Goff [...] " [...] an appropriate reach of interpretation in drawing his conclusion...most cases gloss silently over the ... three cases imply that <b>foreseeability</b> of damage is not a relevant consideration at all". The reliance on Newark's article was also criticised, since [...] "Neither he nor Goff attempted to justify their opinion with reference to anything external to [...] judgment". Clearwater points out that the original judgment in Rylands required modification [...] "the price paid for which was legal uncertainty" [...] to make it socially acceptable, which he sees as evidence that Rylands was, despite what Newark says, a significant change to the law.|$|E
500|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where Kennedy J {{dismissed}} claims under nuisance, negligence and Rylands v Fletcher because the harm was not foreseeable. His decision was reversed by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, who cited an [...] "obscure decision" [...] to justify doing so. The case {{then went to the}} House of Lords, where a decision was read by Lord Goff on 9 December 1993. Goff first countered the Court of Appeal decision, restoring Kennedy's dismissal of the case, before moving on to the deeper legal points. Based on the original decision in Rylands, Goff argued that it had always been intended for <b>foreseeability</b> of harm to be a factor, something not previously put into law by the English judiciary. He then stated that Rylands was arguably a sub-set of nuisance, not an independent tort, and as such the factors which led him to including a test of <b>foreseeability</b> of harm in Rylands cases also imposed such a test on all nuisance cases.|$|E
500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of state courts accept {{that there must be}} a duty of care for there to be liability: the courts of Wisconsin, though, have stated that they have adopted Andrews' approach, and impose liability when there was a duty to any person, whether or not that person is the plaintiff. The Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965) amended the earlier formulation only slightly, but the third Restatement (2009), takes an approach closer to that of Andrews in focusing on whether the defendant engaged in an activity that carried a risk of harm to another (not necessarily the plaintiff), and on whether the defendant exercised reasonable care. The new formulation makes <b>foreseeability,</b> or the scope of the risk, not a hurdle that must be overcome, as in Palsgraf, but a factor to be weighed with others when determining whether there was negligence. Thus, according to law professor David Owen in his 2009 article, [...] "the Restatement (Third) discards Judge Cardozo's elemental work in Palsgraf so long ago. And... also rejects Judge Andrew's [...] valuable insight that juries should be offered a wide range of fairness factors, beginning with <b>foreseeability,</b> in figuring how far responsibility should extend".|$|E
500|$|Palsgraf {{was soon}} adopted by some state courts, {{at times in}} {{different}} contexts: Though some state courts outside New York approved it, others did not, sometimes feeling that <b>foreseeability</b> was an issue for the jury to consider. According to Posner, writing in 1990, Cardozo's holding {{that there is no}} liability to a plaintiff who could not have been foreseen [...] "has been followed by a number of states besides New York, but it remains the minority rule. Most states continue to muddle along with the nebulous 'proximate cause' approach, which emphasizes the proximity in time and space of the defendant's careless act to the plaintiff's injury; that was the approach taken by Judge Andrews's dissent in Palsgraf." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2011, Cardi {{analyzed}} the present-day influence that Palsgraf {{has had on}} state courts. He found that neither Cardozo nor Andrews has won {{on the question of}} how duty of care is formulated, with courts applying policy analyses. [...] "As to the proper doctrinal home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo has undoubtedly prevailed. Although a clear majority of jurisdictions state that duty is the proper home for plaintiff-foreseeability, Cardozo's vision of <b>foreseeability</b> as a categorical determination has not been widely adopted." [...] But, he noted, [...] "Andrews may have found a back door to victory. Arguably the most important consequence of the Palsgraf decision, the resolution of the judge/jury question, appears to lean in Andrews' direction. A majority of courts prefer to leave foreseeability—even as a part of duty—to the jury." ...|$|E
500|$|Rylands v Fletcher {{contained}} {{the principle that}} [...] "the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril, and, {{if he does not}} do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape", with a requirement that this use of land be [...] "non-natural". On the Cambridge Water Company's third claim, Kennedy was forced to consider the meaning of [...] "non-natural" [...] in this setting. He held that the use of industrial chemicals was not [...] "non-natural", given that it was on an industrial site, and that for a claim to succeed under Rylands the use must be [...] "some special use bringing increased danger to others, and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such a use as is proper for the general benefit of the community"; Eastern Counties Leather created jobs in Sawston, and was thus providing a benefit for the community. As such, the Company's claim under Rylands was not valid. Kennedy also chose to consider <b>foreseeability</b> of harm a factor in cases brought under Rylands, and stated the fact that harm was not foreseeable was a factor in his decision.|$|E
2500|$|The Robinson's {{counterclaim}} and Justice Brennan's {{dissenting opinion}} {{were based on}} <b>foreseeability</b> [...] a car sold in New York is mobile, and therefore it was foreseeable by World-Wide and Seaway that a car sold by them could subsequently lead to an injury in Oklahoma. The majority opinion of the Supreme Court rejected this argument, saying that <b>foreseeability</b> alone could not {{provide the basis for}} personal jurisdiction over a defendant and the two petitioning companies had no other contacts with Oklahoma.|$|E
2500|$|This type of causal <b>foreseeability</b> {{is to be}} {{distinguished}} from <b>foreseeability</b> of extent or kind of injury, which {{is a question of}} remoteness of damage, not causation. [...] For example, if I conduct welding work on a dock that lights an oil slick that destroys a ship a long way down the river, {{it would be hard to}} construe my negligence as anything other than causal of the ship's damage. [...] There is no novus actus interveniens. [...] However, I may not be held liable if that damage is not of a type foreseeable as arising from my negligence: The Wagon Mound (No 1) [...] AC 388 (Privy Council). [...] That is a question of public policy, and not one of causation.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{causation}} {{in the law}} is {{a complex}} amalgam of fact and policy, other doctrines are also important, such as <b>foreseeability</b> and risk. [...] Particularly in the United States, where the doctrine of 'proximate cause' effectively amalgamates the two-stage factual then legal causation inquiry favoured in the English system, one must always be alert to these considerations in assessing the postulated relationship between two events.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, in Page v Smith [...] AC 155, it {{was held}} that Mr Smith was liable for causing Mr Page {{psychiatric}} injury (chronic fatigue syndrome) after a car crash, because Mr Smith could have reasonably foreseen that Mr Page would suffer physical injury for the crash. So liability for causing psychiatric injury depends on the <b>foreseeability</b> of the physical injury, {{as long as the}} psychiatric illness is medically recognised.|$|E
2500|$|Palsgraf v. LIRR (1928) {{is a major}} case in American Tort {{law which}} {{established}} the legal standard of [...] "proximate cause" [...] based on <b>foreseeability.</b> The case involved a passenger (Palsgraf) who was injured on the platform {{as the result of}} a chain of events (another passenger dropping a package on the tracks which turned out to be fireworks that exploded and indirectly caused the injury to Mrs. Palsgraf) which the court deemed unforeseeable on the part of the LIRR. It is a milestone decision in American law.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} how <b>foreseeability</b> {{does not apply to}} the extent of an injury is the eggshell skull rule. [...] If Neal punched Matt in the jaw, it is {{foreseeable}} that Matt will suffer a bodily injury that he will {{need to go to the}} hospital for. [...] However, if his jaw is very weak, and his jaw comes completely off from my punch, then the doctor bills, which would have been about $5,000 for wiring his jaw shut had now become $100,000 for a full-blown jaw re-attachment. [...] Neal would still be liable for the entire $100,000, even though $95,000 of those damages were not reasonably foreseeable.|$|E
2500|$|To recover damages, a {{claimant}} {{must show}} that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss. [...] Hadley v Baxendale established that the test of <b>foreseeability</b> is both objective or subjective. [...] In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge? [...] On {{the facts of this}} case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the [...] "reasonable man" [...] nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store.|$|E
2500|$|In {{words of}} Lord Atkin in Donoghue v Stevenson, [...] "You must take {{reasonable}} care to avoid acts or omissions {{which you can}} reasonably foresee {{would be likely to}} injure your neighbour." [...] Whether the defendant had a duty to the claimant to take precautions {{to take into account the}} <b>foreseeability</b> of the risk and the cost of measures to prevent the risk. [...] The risk in this case may have been foreseeable, but it was so highly improbable that a reasonable person could not have anticipated the harm to the claimant and would not have taken any action to avoid it. [...] In the words of Lord Normand, [...] "It is not the law that precautions must be taken against every peril that can be foreseen by the timorous." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights {{decided that}} [...] "the {{scope of the}} terms under Article 301 of the Criminal Code, as {{interpreted}} by the judiciary, is too wide and vague and thus the provision constitutes a continuing threat to the exercise {{of the right to}} freedom of expression" [...] and [...] "that Article 301 of the Criminal Code does not meet the “quality of law” required by the Court’s settled case-law, since its unacceptably broad terms result in a lack of <b>foreseeability</b> as to its effects", finding a violation of freedom of expression (Article 10 of ECHR) in the investigation against Mr Altuğ Taner Akçam, a historian writing about the Armenian genocide. Concerning the 2008 amendments, ECHR noted that [...] "despite the replacement of the term “Turkishness” by “the Turkish Nation”, {{there seems to be no}} change or major difference in the interpretation of these concepts because they have been understood in the same manner by the Court of Cassation" [...] (Para. 92).|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of liability may hang on a <b>foreseeability</b> test. The fact that the consumption of alcohol or the ingestion of drugs may cause a loss of control is well known. Thus, anyone who knowingly consumes is, at the very least, reckless as to the possibility of losing control. If they did not wish to lose control, they would not consume, so loss of control must be within the scope of their intention by continuing to consume. But, loss of control is not instantaneous and without symptoms. The issue of involuntary consumption is therefore contentious. In most legal systems, involuntary loss of control is limited to cases where there is no real loss of control with noticeable symptoms. Thus, for example, in many states, the blood alcohol level for the commission of the offence of driving under the influence is set sufficiently low that people might exceed the limit without realising that they had consumed enough alcohol to do so. Leaving aside the issue that, in some states, this is a strict liability offense excluding drunkenness as a defense, there is usually a requirement that the person who [...] "spiked" [...] the drinks be prosecuted in place of the driver. This reflects the fact that the commission of a crime has been procured by the actions of secretly adding the alcohol and the practical fact that without this rule, too many accused who are only marginally over the limit, might be encouraged to blame others for their intoxication.|$|E
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of a duty of care is usually broken up into a three-step test. The first case to establish a general duty of care was Donoghue v Stevenson. Famously, Mrs Donoghue claimed compensation for illness, after she consumed a ginger beer containing a decomposed snail, in a public house in Paisley, Scotland. The bottle was opaque so Mrs Donoghue, nor the shopkeeper, could see a snail, {{and at the time}} she could not sue the shopkeeper for breach of contract or consumer rights. The House of Lords, by a majority held that the manufacturer, Mr Stevenson, was liable in tort. Lord Atkin held liability was [...] "based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay" [...] and people [...] "must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour." [...] By contrast, Lord Macmillan suggested that the law should protect Mrs Donoghue by incremental analogy to previous cases. Nevertheless, Lord Atkin's speech was widely followed, and understood to contain three main points for establishing a duty of care. Firstly, the concept of reasonable <b>foreseeability</b> of harm; secondly, the claimant and the defendant being in a relationship of proximity; and thirdly, and more loosely, it being fair, just and reasonable to impose liability on the defendant for his careless actions. This three step scheme (also known as the tripartite or threefold test) [...] however, did not crystallise until the case of Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman. A company called Caparo took over another company, by buying up a majority of its shares. It did this because it sneakily obtained word from a company audit that the target was financially sound. The audit was prepared by a group of accountants (Dickman) and was intended for shareholders, not outsiders. Once Caparo owned the company it found that the finances were in fact pretty shoddy, and so it sued the accountants for being negligent in its audit preparation. The House of Lords found against Caparo, and established the current threefold test. Although it was [...] "reasonably foreseeable" [...] that outsiders might learn of the carelessly prepared information, it was not the case that Caparo and Dickman were in a relationship of [...] "proximity". This the court used as a term of art (note, this is different from the American use of the word), to say that it should not be the case that absolutely anyone hearing something said that was stupid and acted on it can sue. The court was reacting to its concern that to allow a claim here might open the floodgates of litigation. The third element, whether liability would be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] was an extra hurdle added, as a catch all discretionary measure for the judiciary to block further claims.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{element of}} the <b>foreseeability</b> {{criterion}} is {{that the possibility of}} harm to others must have been reasonably foreseeable: Was there, in other words, a recognisable risk of harm? The concept of reasonable <b>foreseeability</b> is not founded on statistical or mathematical calculations of the extent of the risk, but on a legal evaluation of the risk created in a particular situation. The guidelines for determining reasonable <b>foreseeability</b> were formulated in Lomagundi Sheetmetal and Engineering v Basson: ...|$|E

5000|$|The court {{relied on}} <b>foreseeability</b> {{in order to}} {{establish}} whether or not a negligent defendant owed a duty of care to a bystander. The court urged a case by case analysis of several factors to determine if <b>foreseeability</b> would create a duty to a bystander: ...|$|E
