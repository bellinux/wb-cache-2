40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Potential {{sources of}} {{inoculum}} of Phialophora malorum were investigated. P. malorum {{was found to}} be a soil-borne fungus whose role as a postharvest pathogen of pear is dependent upon passive dispersal with infested soil. P. malorum survived in soil under a wide range of conditions, with greatest survival in cool, moderately dry soil of nearneutral pH. P. malorum was not a primary colonizer of fallen fruit on orchard soil, but propagule numbers increased subsequent to fruit decay by other microorganisms. Cankers were induced when P. malorum was inoculated into injured bark of pear trees. However, cankers were nonperrenating, and P. malorum was not recovered from cankered tissue for more than one season. The fungus also survived saprophytically on the bark of pear trees, but dispersal of inoculum from infested bark to fruit or other areas of bark on the same trees was not observed. Inoculation of fruit and redistribution of inoculum from infested to previously uninfested fruit in packinghouse <b>immersion</b> dump <b>tank</b> solutions was demonstrated. Infection took place at fruit wounds. Spore penetration into wounds was influenced by wound diameter and hydrostatic pressure during immersion dumping. Infection via intact lenticels could not be induced.

The system involved chlorination of cooling water from compressorsand its successive reuse as feed water for the chiller, prechiller, washer and finally for makeup in the scalder. In all four units poultry carcasses are immersed in water. Process waters in the prechiller and washer were purified alternatively by a pressure leaf filter. Response-surface analysis demonstrated variable interacting effects of water rate, chlorine dosage and process time on the chemical and bacterial qualities of the processed carcasses, and water used in the immersion processes. Models were developed for prediction {{of the effect of}} operating conditions on poultry quality. Long-term studies at the plant indicated that successive utilization of prechlorinated water in a multiple system did not result in significant buildup of contaminants (total and coliform counts) and organic pollutants (grease, nitrogen compounds, BOD and COD) in the <b>immersion</b> <b>tanks.</b> The bacterial quality of the carcasses processed by the multiple reuse water was superior {{to the quality of the}} typical system which utilizes prodigious quantities of potable water in a once-through feed system without filtration and chlorination.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{researchers}} have been studying fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) materials and their advantages in retrofitting of existing structures. The externally bonded reinforcement (EBR) technique {{is the most common}} practice in improving existing reinforced concrete (RC) structures with carbon FRP (CFRP) materials. In this regard, several additional advantages have been reported to the use of prestressed CFRP materials, mainly strips. However, the experience with RC strengthening using prestressed EBR-CFRP materials is still limited. Some concerns regarding the efficiency of the technique still exist, especially the durability and the long-term behaviour. This work aims at contributing to the knowledge on durability of RC slabs strengthened with prestressed CFRP laminate strips according the EBR technique. The durability was studied by exposing strengthened RC specimens to the following environments for approximately 8 months: (i) reference environment – specimens kept in a climatic chamber at 20 ºC; (ii) water <b>immersion</b> in <b>tank</b> at 20 ºC of temperature; (iii) water <b>immersion</b> in <b>tank</b> with 3. 5 % of dissolved chlorides at 20 ºC of temperature; and (iv) wet/dry cycles in a tank with a water temperature of 20 ºC. Additionally, half of the specimens were subjected to sustained loading at a load level of 1 / 3 of the ultimate load, with the occurrence of cracking. After the exposure period the slabs were monotonically tested up to failure by using a four-point bending test configuration. The results showed that the environmental conditions and the sustained loading, separately or combined, led in general to slight losses of performance and ductility. Although these losses were subtle, considering that the tests were carried out for 8 months, clear indications are given towards the importance of conducting similar tests for longer periods. The results obtained showed that the procedures implemented to assess the durability of the strengthening systems were sensitive to the most relevant deterioration mechanisms and their impact on the mechanical properties of the specimens. Therefore, these procedures may well contribute for the future establishment of standardized test programmes for the assessment of the durability of prestressed CFRP strengthening systems.

40|$|Improved Columnaris {{vaccine that}} is stable at room {{temperature}} Overview Columnaris disease {{is one of the}} most serious bacterial infections affecting the aquaculture industry today. It can affect nearly all freshwater fish and causes millions of dollars in annual losses for U. S. catfish farmers alone. Current vaccines are only moderately effective. An improved vaccine has now been developed using bacteria derived from a highly virulent strain. The vaccine has been shown to give superior protection to catfish and tilapia, and has possible applications in salmon, trout, and other farmed fresh water fish. With the aquaculture industry booming, there is a need for products that can protect against infection by this pathogen. Advantages Reduces cumulative mortality two to four times better than the existing vaccine Protects against both moderately and highly virulent Columnaris disease strains • Stores conveniently {{at room temperature}} for up to a year • Administers easily using standard immersion methods Description Flavobacterium columnare is the causative agent of columnaris disease and exists as two genomovar, or groups, with group I being moderately virulent and group II being highly virulent. The current vaccine for columnaris disease is based on a less virulent group I isolate. To generate a more effective vaccine, a highly virulent group II isolate was serially passaged to disable virulence but not immunogenicity. In vaccine trials of Nile tilapia and catfish, this vaccine increased survival rates by 66 % and 17 %, respectively, over the group I-based vaccine. Fish are vaccinated by brief <b>immersion</b> in <b>tanks</b> containing the vaccine and then transferred to a standard tank or pond.

40|$|One {{objective}} of the present investigation was to compare Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery incidence from commercially processed turkeys immediately prior to and following pre-chill and immersion chiller intervention strategies being used in three distinct turkey processing facilities. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 100 carcass rinse samples prior to and following each post-evisceration, pre-chill intervention and following immersion chilling were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Two of three plants demonstrated a trend of decreased Salmonella on carcasses following the Inside Outside Bird Wash (IOBW), with reductions of 13 %, and 11 % being observed for Plants 1 and 2, respectively. Results for reductions of Campylobacter contamination were not as straightforward, with only Plant 3 showing decreased levels (11 % reduction) following the IOBW. Plant 2 used an additional pre-chill intervention, a low pressure, acetic acid final wash, which was not shown {{to be effective in}} causing an additional reduction in either Salmonella or Campylobacter on carcasses. In all three plants, properly managed immersion chilling systems were the most effective microbial intervention for achieving Salmonella andCampylobacter reduction on processed turkey carcasses. While not as effective, the IOBW present in each plant likely contributed to the effectiveness of immersion chiller interventions. If managed properly these intervention points have demonstrated themselves as a viable means to effectively reduce Salmonella and Campylobacter on processed turkeys. Another objective was to modify the scalder environment to an alkaline pH and determine the effects of thermal killing of Salmonella and Campylobacter. In each plant, on a single day of processing, 50 carcass rinse samples prior to and following scald <b>tank</b> <b>immersion</b> and following feather removal were obtained for Salmonella and Campylobacter recovery. Modification of the scald water to alkaline conditions (pH 9 - 10) did not result in increased thermal killing of Salmonella or Campylobacter on turkey carcasses, as hypothesized before the investigation.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a significant advancement {{in the understanding}} of the uptake of Cu 2 + by nanostructured calcium silicate (NCaSil) and to develop a strategy of using it in a continuous manner using packed columns. The NCaSil structure consists of micro-sized agglomeration of nanometre-sized platelets of calcium silicate. This arrangement grants the material a large surface area of 400 to 600 m 2 g- 1. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption of Cu 2 + onto NCaSil in batch were studied at temperatures ranging from 277 to 333 K. The reaction between Cu 2 + and NCaSil occurred rapidly, being endothermic and exhibiting an increase in the entropy meaning that the adsorption process became more spontaneous when the temperature was increased. Furthermore, the uptake resulted in the formation of copper sulfate hydroxide minerals in the form of Cu 4 (OH) 6 SO 4 ·nH 2 O, where n is equal to 2 for wroewolfeite, 1 for posnjakite and 0 for brochantite. Using powder X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy it was proven that at temperatures between 293 and 313 K wroewolfeite and posnjakite were intermediates in the formation of brochantite. Specifically at high temperatures of 333 K and Cu 2 + concentrations higher than 15. 7 mmol L- 1 the reaction proceeded directly to the formation of the thermodynamically stable compound brochantite. A kinetic study of the crystal growth was carried out using powder-XRD which showed that the rate determining step towards the formation of brochantite is the nucleation of SO 4 2 -. Additionally, a value for the activation energy of 42 kJ mol- 1 using powder-XRD data was obtained for the formation of the crystallographic plane 420 in the brochantite crystal. A sample of a real mining waste was collected and analysed. Based on this sample an emulated waste was generated. The NCaSil was tested for the uptake of Cu 2 + ions from this emulated mining waste, showing that the use of NCaSil is feasible at pH values greater than 3. The production and use of NCaSil may be coupled to existing mining waste treatment processes in order to remove dissolved copper from solution and produce a copper rich solid as the by-product. NCaSil was packed inside a conventional axial flow column and a radial flow column, which was developed as part of this project. The former proved to be impractical due to a large pressure drop through the column, while the latter was impractical due to short operational times before breakthrough. Nonetheless, the radial flow column was operated by <b>immersion</b> in a <b>tank</b> exhibiting similar kinetics of copper ions uptake to those observed in batch processes.

Very often it is convenient to exajnine the part in a water tank, locating the transmitting/receiving transducers in water. This paper is concerned with a theoretical study of a near surface flaw in an <b>immersion</b> <b>tank</b> experiment. The analytical problem to be studied is the scattering of ultrasound by an obstacle that is located near a solid-fluid (water) interface. The distance ‘d’ {{of the center of}} the flaw from the interface ranges from ‘a’ to ‘ 15 a’ where ‘a’ is a typical radius of the flaw...|$|E

We will present {{a study of the}} propagation of acoustic waves backscattered by two multilayer structures with a resonant plate "aluminum or glass" and a less resonant plate "plexiglas" separated by a water layer. The backscattering experiments have been performed in a water <b>immersion</b> <b>tank.</b> The wavelet transform and the spectrogram time-frequency representations are used in this work. The images obtained by these representations are compared to the frequency spectral method. The results obtained by the time-frequency analysis are interesting...|$|E
