2500|$|Aérotrain I80 was a {{full-size}} passenger-carrying car for intercity service. It was 25.6m long, 3.2m wide, 3.3m high, had {{a mass of}} 11.25t empty, and had 80 passenger seats. In its original configuration (as I80-250 for 250km/h), it was propelled by twin Turboméca TurmoIIIE3 turboshaft ( [...] each) powering a ducted propeller, 2.3m in diameter, with seven blades of variable pitch. A Turboméca Turmastazou14 turboshaft engine powered the air compressors (six horizontal for the support and six vertical for guidance). Braking was typically provided by reverse thrust of the propeller, and in emergencies by a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> on the central rail. External noise was 90-95 dBA at [...] I80-250 was later rebuilt for 350km/h and re-designated as the I-80HV (Haute Vitesse = high speed). The main change was the new propulsion system, a JT8D turbofan from Pratt & Whitney mounted on top. I-80HV established the world speed record for overland air cushion vehicles on 5 March 1974 with a mean speed of [...] and a peak speed of [...]|$|E
2500|$|From 1936 to 1945, PCC {{cars were}} 'Air-Electrics' with {{friction}} brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. [...] PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as standee windows, a sloped windshield to eliminate night time glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. [...] Dynamic brakes were the service brake on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park". [...] Dynamic brakes slowed the [...] "Air" [...] cars to 3.0-mph at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against {{each of the eight}} wheels. [...] On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. [...] Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums. [...] Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for emergency stopping where all brakes were generally employed.|$|E
5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used <b>friction</b> <b>brakes</b> as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the brakes, similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the <b>brakes,</b> <b>friction</b> is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, <b>friction</b> <b>brakes</b> have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{eddy current}} brake the {{magnetic}} field may be created by a permanent magnet, or an electromagnet so the braking force can be turned on and off or varied by varying the electric current in the electromagnet's windings. Another advantage is that since the brake does not work by friction, there are no brake shoe surfaces to wear out, necessitating replacement, as with friction brakes. A disadvantage is that since the braking force is proportional to velocity the brake has no holding force when the moving object is stationary, as is provided by static friction in a <b>friction</b> <b>brake,</b> so in vehicles it must be supplemented by a <b>friction</b> <b>brake.</b>|$|E
50|$|A DC {{injection}} {{brake system}} {{can be used as}} an alternative to a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> system. DC injection brakes only require a small module located with the other motor switchgear and/or drivers, mounted in a remote and convenient location, whereas a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> must be mounted somewhere on the rotating system. Friction brakes eventually wear out with use and require replacement of braking components. DC brake modules do not have consumable parts and should not require maintenance. Friction brakes also require a method of actuation, requiring either a human operator or system controlled actuator, adding to the complexity of the system. A DC brake is easily integrated into the motor control circuitry.|$|E
5000|$|Engine braking is a {{generally}} accepted practice {{and can help}} save wear on <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> It is even used in some motor sports {{to reduce the risk}} of the <b>friction</b> <b>brakes</b> overheating. Additionally, fuel injected engines generally don't use any fuel while engine braking. This is known as DFCO or Deceleration Fuel Cut-Off. It can be used as the coast part of Burn and Coast, though coasting in neutral is generally more efficient [...] and engine off coasting is always more efficient.|$|R
40|$|Road {{and rail}} {{vehicles}} and aircraft rely mainly or solely on <b>friction</b> <b>brakes.</b> These brakes pose several problems, especially in hybrid vehicles: significant wear, fading, complex and slow actuation, lack of fail-safe features, increased fuel consumption due to power assistance, and requirement for anti-lock controls. To solve these problems, a contactless magnetic brake has been developed. This concept includes a novel flux-shunting structure {{to control the}} excitation flux generated by permanent magnets. This brake is wear-free, less-sensitive to temperature than <b>friction</b> <b>brakes,</b> has fast and simple actuation, and has a reduced sensitivity to wheel-lock.

50|$|When {{the trains}} brake, the 3-phase motors act as {{generators}} and return electricity {{to the system}} rather than converting power to heat, as on a <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> system.

50|$|The {{hydraulic}} force generated by pressing the brake pedal is used {{only as a}} sensor input to the computer unless a catastrophic failure occurs including a loss of 12-volt electrical power. The brake actuator has an electric pump that provides the hydraulic pressure for the system, and valves to pressurize each wheel caliper to apply the <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> when required by the system.|$|E
50|$|Permanent and expeditionary {{land based}} systems usually consist of two arresting engines located {{on either side}} of the runway. The arresting engines apply braking force to reels holding the {{purchase}} tapes, which in turn slow the aircraft and bring it to a stop. The two most common methods used by land based arresting engines to apply the braking force are the rotary <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> and the rotary hydraulic (water twister) systems. The rotary <b>friction</b> <b>brake</b> is simply a hydraulic pump coupled to the reel which applies a graduated pressure to multi-disc brakes mounted on the reel. The rotary hydraulic system is a turbine inside a water/glycol filled housing coupled to the reel. The turbulence generated in the water/glycol mixture by the turbine during the arrestment provides the resistance to slow the reel and stop the aircraft. Once the aircraft is released from the cable, the tapes and cable are retracted by an internal combustion engine or electric motor installed on the arresting engine.|$|E
