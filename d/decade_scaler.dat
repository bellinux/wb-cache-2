40|$|An {{automatic}} <b>decade</b> <b>scaler</b> {{which operates}} for a fixed number of counts {{has been developed}} for use with a Geiger tube. The elapsed counting time is read by a 115 V AC clock to 0. 01 minute. Manual operation is provided to allow the scaler to be run for a fixed time interval in which case every 10, 000 counts are recorded by a Cyclotron recording meter. The instrument has a two pulse resolution time of 25 microseconds. Four decades in cascade {{are used in the}} scaler, one of which has a resolution time of 8 microseconds; the other three, a resolution time of 30 microseconds. Ten neon bulbs are used in each decade to indicate the count. An automatic <b>decade</b> <b>scaler</b> which operates for a fixed number of counts has been developed for use with a Geiger tube.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for multiple-coincidence counting systems with 10 {sup - 8 }- to 10 {sup - 9 }-sec time resolution {{can be met}} economically with presently available high-frequency transistors. The design of solid-state coincidence circuits, amplitude discriminators, and <b>decade</b> <b>scalers</b> is considered and their operation discussed. Several systems have been designed utilizing up to 180 channels from scintillation detectors...|$|R
40|$|A {{requirement}} arose for a sidereal {{drive for}} a small microwave radiometer on an equatorial mount, the equipment to run unattended to a precision of about 2 minutes in hour angle over a 7 -day period. The installation already included a solar-time crystal clock based on a IO MHz oscillator (type HCD 25), which through <b>decade</b> <b>scalers</b> could easily be arranged to operate a standard 50 Hz synchronous motor which would drive the mounting at one revolution per solar day. However, no suitable gearing was available to generate the required sidereal rate...|$|R
