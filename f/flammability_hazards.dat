The environmental management of mixed waste containing transuranic radionuclides is difficult because these nuclides are alpha particle emitters and the energy deposited by the alpha particles causes chemical transformations in the matrices accompanying the waste. Most radiolysis programs focus on conventional radiation such as gamma rays, but the chemical changes induced by alpha particles and other heavy ions are typically very different and product yields can vary by more than an order of magnitude.

This knowledge {{can also be used to}} directly give reasonable estimates of explosive or <b>flammability</b> <b>hazards</b> in the storage or transport of transuranic wastes in order to enhance the safety of DOE sites. This report summarizes the work after eight months of a three-year project on determining the production of hazardous gases in transuranic waste. The first stage of the project was to design and build an assembly to irradiate solid organic matrices using accelerated ion beams. It is necessary to measure absolute radiolytic yields, and simulate some of the conditions found in the field. A window assembly was constructed allowing the beam to pass consecutively through a collimator, a vacuum exit window and into the solid sample. The beam is stopped in the sample and the entire end of the assembly is a Faraday cup. Integration of the collected current, in conjunction with particle energy and charge, allows for accurate determination of dose. A stream of gas, such as nitrogen, flows between the sample and the beam exit window to flush away gaseous products that evolve from the sample surface. The gas steam is sampled with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. By monitoring the desired mass peak with the spectrometer it is possible to quantitatively determine a number of different products on line. ...|$|E
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have {{identified}} {{health and safety}} risks to workers who manually gauge or sample fluids on production and flowback tanks from exposure to hydrocarbon gases and vapors, exposure to oxygen-deficient atmospheres, {{and the potential for}} fires and explosions. This Hazard Alert describes the safety and health hazards when workers manually gauge or sample fluids from production, flowback, or other tanks. It recommends ways to protect workers by eliminating or reducing exposures to hazardous atmospheres, and actions employers should take to ensure that workers are properly aware of the hazards and protected from exposure to hydrocarbon gases and vapors. This alert is a supplement to the OSHA Alliance Tank Hazard Alert released in 2015 [National STEPS Network 2015]. NIOSH and OSHA also identified nine worker fatalities that occurred while workers manually gauged or sampled production tanks from 2010 - 2014 [NIOSH 2015]. Exposures to hydrocarbon gases and vapors and/or oxygen-deficient atmospheres are believed to be primary or contributory factors to the workers' deaths [Harrison et al. 2016]. NIOSH & OSHA Recommendations for Manual Tank Gauging and Fluid Sample Collection: 1. Implement alternative tank gauging and sampling procedures that enable workers to monitor tank fluid levels and take samples without opening the tank hatch. 2. Retrofit existing tanks with dedicated sampling ports (i. e., tank sampling taps [American Petroleum Institute 2013]) that minimize worker exposures to hydrocarbon gases and vapors, thereby eliminating the need to routinely open thief hatches to sample. These sampling taps should minimize the magnitude of hydrocarbon plumes and should limit the need for workers to access the top of tanks. 3. Install thief hatch pressure indicators to provide an immediate visual indicator of tank pressures and potential hazards. Pressure indicators can show workers the pressure in the tank and allow a trained worker to follow appropriate procedures, such as actuating a blowdown valve, venting gas to a flare, or using appropriate respiratory protection, such as a self-contained breathing apparatus or an air-line respirator. 4. Conduct worker exposure assessments to determine exposure risks to volatile hydrocarbons and other contaminants. Employers may consult an occupational safety and health professional trained and certified in industrial hygiene and who has knowledge and experience with combined flammable gas and vapor exposures to ensure that an appropriate air-sampling strategy is used. 5. Provide hazard communication training in a language that employees understand to ensure that general site workers, tank gaugers and samplers, water haulers, drivers, and others who open tank hatches understand the hazards associated with opening tanks and the precautions necessary to conduct this work safely. These hazards include reduced oxygen environments, <b>flammability</b> <b>hazards</b> and possible ignition sources, and the potential for concentrations of hydrocarbons that can approach or exceed IDLH concentrations. Post hazard signage at access stairs, catwalks, and/or tanks to alert workers about the hazards associated with opening thief hatches and precautions that must be taken. 6. Ensure that workers are trained on - and correctly and consistently use - calibrated multi-gas and oxygen monitors that measure percent LEL and oxygen concentration. Workers should understand the limitations of these monitors as well as appropriate actions to take whenever an alarm occurs or they experience health symptoms (e. g., leave the hazard area, report symptoms to supervisors). 7. Do not permit employees to work alone when tank gauging or working around tanks, thief hatches, or other areas where they may encounter process fluids. Observers should be trained on proper rescue procedures and be stationed outside potentially hazardous areas. 8. As an interim measure, where remote gauging or sampling is not feasible or engineering controls are not implemented, (a) train workers in proper work practices, such as tank-opening procedures, that can minimize risks for exposures, (b) ensure intrinsic safety by proper grounding and prohibiting the use of spark producing devices or equipment, (c) establish administrative controls {{to reduce the number of}} times throughout a shift a worker is required to manually gauge tanks, (d) safely reduce tank pressure prior to gauging, and (e) use appropriate respiratory protection, including a supplied air respirator (SAR) and/or self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) in areas where IDLH VOC exposures may occur (i. e., during manual tank gauging/sampling). Employers should consult with a trained occupational safety and health professional to determine the appropriate respirator to be used. NIOSH guidance for selecting respirators is at: [URL] 9. Wear flame-resistant clothing to protect against burns from fires and explosions. Also, use appropriate impermeable gloves to limit risks for skin exposures to chemicals (e. g., benzene). 10. Establish and practice emergency procedures to provide on-scene, immediate medical response in the event of an incident, such as a collapsed worker, or workers experiencing symptoms of chemical overexposures or exposure to an oxygen-deficient atmosphere.

The standard of gastightness {{is consistent with a}} decay of an excess external pressure from 500 Pa to 250 Pa in not less than 5 minutes in filled storage (SCA Technical Report 1980). Because of their volatility, fumigants dissipate from foodstuffs upon exposure to the open air with minimal chemical residues.

Therefore, testing was designed to provide critical flammability information necessary to support safety related considerations {{for the development of}} ozone treatment and potential scale-up to the commercial level. Since information was lacking on flammability issues at low levels of hydrogen and ozone, a testing program was developed to focus on filling this portion of the information gap. A 2 -L vessel was used to conduct flammability tests at atmospheric pressure and temperature using a fuse wire ignition source at 1 percent ozone intervals spanning from no ozone to the Lower Flammable Limit (LFL) of ozone in the vessel, determined as 8. 4 %(v/v) ozone. An ozone generator and ozone detector were used to generate and measure the ozone concentration within the vessel in situ, since ozone decomposes rapidly on standing. The lower flammability limit of hydrogen in an ozone-oxygen mixture was found to decrease from the LFL of hydrogen in air, determined as 4. 2 % (v/v) in this vessel. From the results of this testing, Savannah River was able to develop safety procedures and operating parameters to effectively minimize the formation of a flammable atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Flash {{point is}} an {{important}} property of chemical compounds that is widely used to evaluate <b>flammability</b> <b>hazard.</b> However, {{there is often a}} significant gap between the demand for experimental flash point data and their availability. Furthermore, the determination of flash point is difficult and costly, particularly for some toxic, explosive, or radioactive compounds. The development of a reliable and widely applicable method to predict flash point is therefore essential. In this paper, the construction of a quantitative structure - property relationship model with excellent performance and domain of applicability is reported. It uses the largest data set to date of 9399 chemically diverse compounds, with flash point spanning from less than - 130 °C to over 900 °C. The model employs only computed parameters, eliminating the need for experimental data that some earlier computational models required. The model allows accurate prediction of flash point for a broad range of compounds that are unavailable or not yet synthesized.

Along with impurity data, often absent or unknown as a result of post-processing storage environment is moisture content. Radiolysis of moisture may lead to a hydrogen <b>flammability</b> <b>hazard</b> within a closed volume such as a storage can or a transportation package. This paper offers a practical means of qualifying payloads of unknown moisture content for shipment within Type B packaging, while supporting the DOE program to maintain radworker dose as low as reasonable achievable (ALARA). Specifically, the paper discusses part of a qualification program carried out at the Savannah River Site for onsite shipment of legacy RAM within the DDF- 1 package. The DDF- 1 is an onsite-only prototype of the currently certified 9975 package. Measurement of storage-can lid bulge can provide an upper bound for pressure within a storage can. Subsequent belljar testing can measure the rate of gas leakage from a storage can.

40|$|As a novel {{class of}} solvents, ionic liquids have {{properties}} {{that make them}} promising key chemicals for the future bio-based economy. However, safety performance of ionic liquids relating physico-chemical hazards is very rarely investigated as they are often perceived as a non existing issue due {{to the status of}} ionic liquids in regulatory <b>flammability</b> <b>hazard</b> ranking systems. Limitations of conventional hazard rating in the case of ionic liquids lead to misleading statements pertaining physico-chemical hazards given the wide range of chemicals under interest (~ 10 18), while by contrast safety is of paramount importance as a goal in green chemistry principles. Thus, it becomes important to go beyond conventional hazard rating and therefore we promote the development of a dedicated methodology from hazard identification to contextual risk assessment, as illustrated in figure 1. For that purpose, work has been focused here to qualify fire hazard profiles of ionic liquids by use of both experimentation (oxygen bomb calorimetry, pyrolysis combustion flow calorimetry and fire propagation apparatus) and predictive tools using molecular modelling.

These time constants are specific to a single aircraft type and flight envelope and may not accurately represent fuel outgassing behaviour for other aircraft types with differing fuel tank configurations and flight envelopes.

Measurements of oxygen evolution rate, made on a dimensionally similar model, have been projected to an A 320 aircraft. The evolution of oxygen from the fuel was found to increase monotonically with time. Fitting the test data with an inverse-exponential function enabled oxygen release rate and its associated time constant (t) to be determined. Dimensional modelling of aviation fuel outgassing using model fuel tanks will enable oxygen evolution rate from aviation fuel to be determined {{for a wide range of}} aircraft fuel tank configurations and environments without the need for flight testing. In turn the accuracy of flammability assessment of aircraft fuel tanks will be improved and significant cost savings made...|$|R
40|$|The term {{champagne}} {{heat pump}} denotes a developmental heat pump that exploits {{a cycle of}} absorption and desorption of carbon dioxide in an alcohol or other organic liquid. Whereas most heat pumps in common use in the United States are energized by mechanical compression, the champagne heat pump is energized by heating. The concept of heat pumps based on other absorption cycles energized by heat has been understood for years, but some of these heat pumps are outlawed in many areas {{because of the potential}} hazards posed by leakage of working fluids.

40|$|Ammonia is {{ubiquitous}} as {{a component}} of the waste stored in the Hanford Site single-shell tanks (SSTs) and double-shell tanks (DSTs). Because ammonia is both flammable and toxic, concerns have been raised about the amount of ammonia stored in the tanks and the possible mechanisms by which it could be released from the waste into the head space inside the tanks as well as into the surrounding atmosphere. Ammonia is a safety issue for three reasons. As already mentioned, ammonia is a flammable gas and may contribute to a <b>flammability</b> <b>hazard</b> either directly, if it reaches a high enough concentration in the tank head space, or by contributing to the flammability of other flammable gases such as hydrogen (LANL 1994). Ammonia is also toxic and at relatively low concentrations presents a hazard to human health. The level at which ammonia is considered Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) is 300 ppm (WHC 1993, 1995). Ammonia concentrations at or above this level have been measured inside the head space in a number of SSTs. Finally, unlike hydrogen and nitrous oxide, ammonia is highly soluble in aqueous solutions, and large amounts of ammonia can be stored in the waste as dissolved gas. Because of its high solubility, ammonia behaves in a qualitatively different manner from hydrogen or other insoluble gases. A broader range of scenarios must be considered in modeling ammonia storage and release...|$|R
40|$|The Main Propulsion System (MPS) uses three Flow Control Valves (FCV) to {{modulate}} {{the flow of}} pressurant hydrogen gas from the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME) to the hydrogen External Tank (ET). This maintains pressure in the ullage volume as the liquid level drops, preserving ET structural integrity and assuring the engines receive a sufficient amount of head pressure. On Space Transportation System (STS) - 126 (2009), with {{only a handful of}} International Space Station (ISS) assembly flights {{from the end of the}} Shuttle program, a portion of a single FCV?s poppet head broke off at about a minute and a half after liftoff. The risk of the poppet head failure is that the increased flow area through the FCV could result in excessive gaseous hydrogen flow back to the external tank, which could result in overboard venting of hydrogen ullage pressure. If the hydrogen venting were to occur in first stage (i. e., lower atmosphere), a <b>flammability</b> <b>hazard</b> exists that could lead to catastrophic loss of crew and vehicle. Other failure risks included particle impact damage to MPS downstream hardware. Although the FCV design had been plagued by contamination-related sluggish valve response problems prior to a redesign at STS- 80 (1996), contamination was ruled out as the cause of the STS- 126 failure. Employing a combination of enhanced hardware inspection and a better understanding of the consequences of a poppet failure, safe flight rationale for subsequent flights (STS- 119 and later) was achieved. This paper deals with the technical lessons learned during the investigation and mitigation of this problem at a time when assembly flights were each in the critical path to Space Station success...|$|R
40|$|The <b>flammability</b> <b>hazard</b> {{assessment}} of wall and ceiling linings has occupied {{the attention of}} fire scientists and engineers and regulators over the last fifty years. Several tests (small, medium, and large) {{have been developed to}} classify the flammability of linings and predict their burning behavior in real enclosure fire situations. We examine in some detail three such efforts: (a) the development of an experimental room and a 9 ft vertical wall full scale test by Ferris leading to the Early Fire Hazard test in Australia, (b) the ISO room corner test, and (c) The new SBI (Single Burning Item test) which maybe the most thoroughly examined test in the history of flammability testing. Of these tests, the experimental room used by Ferris and the ISO room corner test may be considered as end use applications for medium size rooms whereas the SBI test and the vertical wall test by Ferris are intermediate scale test designed to represent the room fire behavior in a more controlled way. Performance criterion in the ISO room corner test is the time to reach flashover. Performance criteria in the SBI test are related to the fire growth in an open corner (no ceiling) configuration due to upward flame spread. Performance criterion in the experimental room of Ferris was the time to reach untenable conditions in the room. Finally, performance criterion in the vertical wall of Ferris was the time interval from ignition until the flames reach the top of the wall. Examination of all these efforts has led to consistently validating a new correlation of the performance criteria of these tests with small-scale cone calorimeter tests whenever both data are available. Previous correlations are also discussed. The new correlation compares well with essential features of upward flame spread as this is related to flammability properties. Comparison between the ISO room corner test and the SBI test leads to suggestions regarding the suitability of these tests as a regulatory tool. Some comments are also directed towards a new test method of parallel wall panels recently proposed by Fmglobal. This test method can be analyzed using the same methodology outlined in this paper...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{performance}} goals for NASA's enterprise of Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) is to develop methods, data bases, and validating tests for material <b>flammability</b> characterization, <b>hazard</b> reduction, and fire detection/suppression strategies for spacecraft and extraterrestrial habitats. This work addresses these needs by applying the fundamental knowledge gained from low stretch experiments {{to the development of}} a normal gravity low stretch material flammability test method. The concept of the apparatus being developed uses the low stretch geometry to simulate the conditions of the extraterrestrial environment through proper scaling of the sample dimensions to reduce the buoyant stretch in normal gravity. The apparatus uses controlled forced-air flow to augment the low stretch to levels which simulate Lunar or Martian gravity levels. In addition, the effect of imposed radiant heat flux on material flammability can be studied with the cone heater. After breadboard testing, the apparatus will be integrated into NASA's White Sands Test Facility's Atmosphere-Controlled Cone Calorimeter for evaluation as a new materials screening test method...|$|R
40|$|Many of the {{photovoltaic}} (PV) {{systems on}} buildings are of sufficiently high voltages, with potential to cause or promote fires. However, research about photovoltaic fires is insufficient. This paper {{focuses on the}} <b>flammability</b> and fire <b>hazards</b> of photovoltaic modules. Bench-scale experiments based on polycrystalline silicon PV modules have been conducted using a cone calorimeter. Several parameters including ignition time (tig), mass loss, heat release rate (HRR), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration, were investigated. The fire behaviours, fire hazards and toxicity of gases released by PV modules are assessed based on experimental results. The results show that PV modules under tests are inflammable with the critical heat flux of 26 kW/m 2. This work will lead to better understanding on photovoltaic fires and how to help authorities determine the appropriate fire safety provisions for controlling photovoltaic fires...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{consolidated}} overview on explosion and fire safety issues pertaining to ionic liquids. Indeed safety performance of ionic liquids relating to physico-chemical hazards is very rarely investigated as it is often perceived as a non-existing issue {{due to the lack}} of traditional flashpoint for these liquids. It focuses on the experimental evaluation of the fire hazard of imidazolium, phosphonium and pyrrolidinium-based ionic liquids by use of the Fire Propagation Apparatus. It provides experimental data that can quantify the flammability of ionic liquids in all its aspects (ease of ignition, mass burning rate, heat release rate, fire-induced toxicity data [...] .). A case study featuring a major failure in a process unit leading to a given fire scenario is also illustrated. This case study is examined in terms of fire induced toxicity by use of CFD modeling of fire product releases dispersion and using the concept of fractional effective concentration.
