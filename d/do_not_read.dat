25|$|Since {{there is}} a {{selection}} process used to gain admission to the TAG Magnet; and, since one of the definitions of a TAG student is a national-norm reading score of “80” or higher, the school does not have students who read below grade level. However, since TAG requires an AP course (AP Human Geography) as freshman, the school does have students who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> well enough to tackle a college-level course {{in their first year}} of high school. These students are referred to the Student Support Team (SST) for review. This leads to a parent-teacher-student conference attended by both the counselor and the principal. Parent, student, and teacher agree to work together as they check on progress achieved through tutoring before and after school. In some cases, additional projects are assigned to improve reading skills.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Orthodox and some Conservative Jews reject {{the idea that}} a woman can publicly read from the Torah or lead prayer services whenever there is a minyan (quorum of 10 males) available to do so. However, the public celebration of a girl becoming bat mitzvah in other ways has made strong inroads into Modern Orthodox Judaism and also into some elements of Haredi Judaism. In these congregations, women <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> from the Torah or lead prayer services, but they occasionally lecture on a Jewish topic to mark their coming of age, learn a book of Tanakh, recite verses from the Book of Esther or the Book of Psalms, or say prayers from the siddur. In some Modern Orthodox circles, bat mitzvah girls will read from the Torah and lead prayer services in a women's tefillah. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, a prominent Orthodox posek, has ruled that bat mitzvah celebrations are permissible, but should not be held in a synagogue, because then they would be construed as imitating Reform and Conservative customs; in any case, {{they do not have the}} status of seudat mitzvah. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef holds that it is a seudat mitzvah.|$|E
500|$|The Tribune {{continued}} to print {{a wide variety}} of material. In 1851, its managing editor Charles Dana recruited Karl Marx as a foreign correspondent in London. Marx collaborated with Friedrich Engels on his work for the Tribune, which continued for over a decade, covering 500 articles. Greeley felt compelled to print, [...] "Mr. Marx has very decided opinions of his own, with some of which we are far from agreeing, but those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> his letters are neglecting one of the most instructive sources of information on the great questions of current European politics." ...|$|E

He was almost heartbroken by the rebuke from Most, who had [...] "preached propaganda by deed all his life—now he repudiates the first attentat in this country". He was encouraged by the words of Kropotkin, who wrote that [...] "Berkman {{has done more to}} spread the anarchist idea among the masses who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> our papers than all the writings that we may publish. He has shown that there are among the anarchists, men capable of being revolted by the crimes of capitalism to the point of giving their life {{to put an end to}} these crimes, or at least to open a way to such an end." ...|$|E

500|$|Statements which {{imply that}} nature has goals, for example where a species {{is said to}} do {{something}} [...] "in order to" [...] achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write {{in a way which}} can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention. John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins.|$|E
500|$|The main game {{features}} {{two pairs}} of contestants answering brain-teaser questions. In the first round, each team faces two questions, taking {{the form of a}} visual puzzle. Contestants can work together and must answer by touching the correct answer (or answers, depending on what the question is asking them) on the screen. The question is often phrased so that the contestants may be misled if they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> it correctly (for example, [...] "Touch the largest greenhouse" [...] could be misread as [...] "Touch the largest green house") The value of the question begins at $300, with $20 deducted for every second the team takes in answering; the money begins counting down when the puzzle first appears on the screen. The money stops counting down when the contestants submit an answer on the touchscreen. For all questions, a correct answer earns the remaining money, while no answer or a wrong answer earns nothing.|$|E

2500|$|On July 11, 1941, Roosevelt {{signed an}} order naming Donovan Coordinator of Information (COI). [...] "At the time," [...] Evan Thomas has written, [...] "the U.S. {{government}} had no formal spy agency. In 1929, the Secretary of State, Henry L. Stimson, had abolished the highly effective Black Chamber, a code-breaking organization {{left over from}} World War I." [...] In Stimson's view, [...] "Gentlemen <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> each other's mail." [...] To be sure, the Army, Navy, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Department of State, and other entities all ran their own intelligence units, but they were feeble and isolated from one another.

2500|$|Among {{the spiritual}} leaders of Damascus in the 16th century may be mentioned: Jacob Berab, who, in the {{interval}} between his sojourns in Egypt and at Safed, lived there for some years (c. 1534); ִHayim Vital the Calabrian (1526–1603), for many years chief rabbi of Damascus, {{and the author of}} various cabalistic works, including [...] "Etz ִHayim"; Samuel ben David the Karaite (not [...] "Jemsel," [...] as Eliakim Carmoly has it), who visited Damascus in 1641, mentions the circumstance that the Karaites there <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> the Haftarah after the Pentateuch section. Moses Najara; his son, the poet Israel Najara; Moses Galante (died in 1608), the son of Mordecai Galante; and Samuel Laniado ben Abraham of Aleppo were also among the prominent men of the 16th century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{value of}} {{extensive}} literary analysis {{has been questioned}} by several prominent artists. Vladimir Nabokov once wrote that good readers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> books, and particularly those which {{are considered to be}} literary masterpieces, [...] "for the academic purpose of indulging in generalizations". At a 1986 Copenhagen conference of James Joyce scholars, Stephen J. Joyce (the modernist writer's grandson) said, [...] "If my grandfather was here, he would have died laughing ... Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man can be picked up, read, and enjoyed by virtually anybody without scholarly guides, theories, and intricate explanations, as can Ulysses, if you forget about all the hue and cry." [...] He later questioned whether anything has been added to the legacy of Joyce's art by the 261 books of literary criticism stored in the Library of Congress.|$|E
2500|$|Wordsworth's poetry, {{especially}} when the Lyrical Ballads had been published 26 years earlier, was such a radical departure that scarcely anyone understood it. Even at the time Hazlitt was writing this essay, [...] "The vulgar <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> , the learned, who see all things through books, do not understand them, the great despise, the fashionable may ridicule them: but the author has created himself {{an interest in the}} heart of the retired and lonely student of nature, which can never die." [...] "It may be considered as a characteristic of our poet's writings," [...] Hazlitt reflects, [...] "that they either make no impression on the mind at all, seem mere nonsense-verses, or that they leave a mark behind them that never wears out. ... To one class of readers he appears sublime, to another (and we fear the largest) ridiculous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rashi exerted {{a decisive}} {{influence}} on establishing the correct {{text of the}} Talmud. Up to and including his age, texts of each Talmudic tractate were copied by hand and circulated in yeshivas. Errors often crept in: sometimes a copyist would switch words around, and other times incorporate a student's marginal notes into the main text. Because of {{the large number of}} merchant-scholars who came from throughout the Jewish world to attend the great fairs in Troyes, Rashi was able to compare different manuscripts and readings in Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, Midrash, Targum, and the writings of the Geonim, and determine which readings should be preferred. However, in his humility, he deferred to scholars who disagreed with him. For example, in Chulin 4a, he comments about a phrase, [...] "We <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> this. But as for those who do, this is the explanation..." ...|$|E

Reflecting this diversity, in 1999, New Zealander Frank Naea, who has Samoan and Māori parentage, was chosen to become YWAM's first non-white president in 2000, replacing Jim Stier, who was to continue as international director of evangelism and frontier missions and national director for Brazil. In 2000, YWAM developed a new role of Executive Chairman, which Jim Stier stepped into, and made the presidency a three-year rotating position. However, {{at a meeting in}} 2011 the organization's elders did away with the titles director, chairman, and president, in reference to all leadership roles except at the local level.

2500|$|When activated, some earlier ABS systems {{caused the}} brake pedal to pulse noticeably. As most drivers rarely {{or do not}} brake hard enough to cause brake lock-up, and drivers {{typically}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>read</b> the vehicle's owners manual, {{this may not be}} noticeable until an emergency. Some manufacturers have therefore implemented a brake assist system that determines that the driver is attempting a [...] "panic stop" [...] (by detecting that the brake pedal was depressed very fast, unlike a normal stop where the pedal pressure would usually be gradually increased, Some systems additionally monitor the rate at the accelerator was released) and the system automatically increases braking force where not enough pressure is applied. Hard or panic braking on bumpy surfaces, because of the bumps causing the speed of the wheel(s) to become erratic may also trigger the ABS, sometimes causing the system to enter its ice mode, where the system severely limits maximum available braking power. Nevertheless, ABS significantly improves safety and control for drivers in most on-road situations.|$|E
