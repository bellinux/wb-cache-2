40|$|Everything is vague to {{a degree}} you do not realize till you have {{tried to make it}} precise. ” — “The Philosophy of Logical Atomism, ” Bertrand Russell H <b>eart</b> <b>failure,</b> classically defined as the heart’s {{inability}} to“pump blood at a rate commensurate with the require-ments of metabolizing tissue, ” has long been considered a disease of the myocardium. 1 With improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms of heart failure, it is increasingly clear that heart failure is a systemic disorder and results from the complex interplay between numerous cardiac and extra-cardiac pathologies. 2 Within the clinical spectrum of heart failure, there is significant heterogeneity of phenotypic subtypes with potentially different pathophysiology, treat-ments, and outcomes. Given that diverse molecular pathways such as cardiac stress, fibrosis, inflammation, and injury can be quantified, biomarkers have the potential to play a critica...|$|E
40|$|H <b>eart</b> <b>failure</b> is a {{major public}} health {{epidemic}} that claimshundreds {{of thousands of lives}} annually in the United States alone. Despite important advances in the management and prevention ofmany cardiovascular disorders, the incidence and prevalence of heart failure are increasing with the aging of the population. Existing treatments for patients with heart failure are far from being optimal and are often associated with proarrhythmic activity and risk of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the search for novel, effective, and safe therapeutic options for these patients represents a critical area of unmet need for this country {{and the rest of the}} world. In an elegant proof of concept study published in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Lugenbiel et al 1 de-scribe a novel gene-based approach for potentially treating heart failure by targeting discrete cell populations within the sino-atrial node...|$|E
40|$|Background: Research {{indicates}} many nurses {{lack the}} appropriate heart failure (HF) education necessary {{to assist with}} readmission reduction efforts. Employer approved nurse HF education has resulted in improved nurse HF knowledge, and, reduced readmissions. Problem: ED nurses require a competent knowledge of heart failure to effectively educate heart failure patients upon admission to the ED. No {{research has been conducted}} with ED nurse specific populations to assess ED nurse knowledge of heart failure, and, to determine if heart failure educational interventions increase ED nurse 2 ̆ 7 HF knowledge. Aims: To evaluate the effectiveness of an ED nurse b. <b>eart</b> <b>failure</b> educational intervention in improving ED nurses 2 ̆ 7 knowledge of heart failure. Methodology: A descriptive, prospective, one-group, comparative pre-test/ post-test intervention study design was used, with 24 (N= 24) nurses filling out the Nurses Knowledge of Heart Failure Education Principles survey pre/post exposure to an evidenced-based heart failure educational intervention. Results: A significant increase in overall ED nurse heart failure knowledge scores was found pre/post intervention, rising from a pre-test M= 78. 54 (SD= 9. 38) to a post-test M= 90. 0 (SD= 9. 08), p 3 ̆c. 001, a passing score. Significant ED nurse HF knowledge gains were identified in the areas of HF medications, diet, weight, and symptom management (p 3 ̆c. 05), with a 171...|$|E
40|$|H <b>eart</b> <b>failure</b> with {{preserved}} {{ejection fraction}} (HFpEF) is agrowing {{public health problem}} that accounts for approximately half of all prevalent heart failure (HF). 1, 2 Once believed to carry a favorable prognosis compared with HF and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), contemporary data suggest that both groups face similar outcomes in the community setting. 1, 3 Although survival rates for patients with chronic HFrEF have improved in the last 2 decades with advances in drug and device-based therapies, {{there has been no}} such parallel progress in HFpEF management, 4 and treatment remains largely limited to the active recognition and treat-ment of comorbidities and the use of diuretics. The prevalence of HFpEF relative to HFrEF continues to rise at 1 % per year, projecting it to be the more common form of HF over the next decade. 5, 6 HFpEF is particularly common in the elderly and is associated with a significant risk of death, hospitalization and suboptimal quality of life. Thus, there remains an enormous unmet need for effective therapy for this group of patients. 7, 8 Augmentation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling is recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy in HFpEF based on several preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated various mechanisms and effects of cGMP enhancement. 7, 9 – 14 However, the recent neutral result of th...|$|E
40|$|H <b>eart</b> <b>failure</b> (HF) can be consid-ered {{the last}} stage {{of heart disease}} and a {{significant}} cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. 1 It is associated with a persistent activation of a circadian neurohormonal system and endothelial dysfunction. 2 This low endo-thelial function, as exercise capacity, is associated with an increase in mortal-ity. 3, 4 Aerobic exercise training (ET) is a well-established nonpharmacological method to increase exercise capacity and to improve endothelial function (vasodilatation) in HF patients. 5 Patients can experience fatigue and dizziness that may relate to periods of hypotension exacerbated by vasodilator drug therapy. The 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in HF may help to evaluate time-depen-dent pharmacodynamic drug effects, titrate angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and other drugs to optimization. 6 Auscultation of the Korotkoff sounds is fraught with potential sources of error. 7 Arterial blood pressure (BP) has a daily variation characterized by reduc-tions during sleep, a rapid rise upon awakening, and increased variability during the awake period. 8 The timing and amplitude of the rhythm of BP is influenced by intrinsic and extrinsic fac-tors, such as neurohormonal regulation, ET, and dietary sodium. 8 The 24 -hour ABPM is reproducible and allows regis-tration of the BP in subjects engaged in their usual activities, avoiding the white-coat effect. 7 We hypothesized that ET could decrease 24 -hour BP in HF patients and in healthy subjects by the attenuation of the sympathetic system. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of ET on 24 -hour BP in seden-tary HF patients...|$|E
40|$|H <b>eart</b> <b>failure</b> affects {{1 million}} to 2 million {{adults in the}} United States alone. 1 In the {{majority}} of patients, an inexorable, although often slow, deterioration of ventricular function occurs, and only 60 % survive 4 years. 2 Although the long-term outcome is viewed with pessimism, death is classified as sudden and "unexpected " in up to 80 % of patients. One may ask whether any death preceded by months or years of chronic heart failure can truly be called sudden. Sudden death is often defined as death preceded by a short duration, typically < 1 hour, of acute symptoms. 3, 4 In the adult United States population, ventricular fibrillation {{in the setting of}} coronary artery disease is the most common scenario identified by this definition. Many heart failure patients periodically suffer mild exacerba-tions of heart failure that require adjustment of their medical regimen but have good functional status be-tween exacerbations. In such circumstances, out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation during a mild heart failure exacerbation may not meet everyone's definition of sudden death. Even if one focuses on "arrhythmic death, " the clinical implications are not always straight-forward. Preventing ventricular fibrillation in a patient with mild dyspnea on climbing hills is clearly desirable. Preventing ventricular fibrillation in a patient with no option for cardiac transplantation who is bedridden with resting dyspnea despite maximal medical therapy may not be an appropriate therapeutic goal. From a clinically practical standpoint, sudden death could be considered an unexpected death that occurs without sufficient warning to allow an ambulatory patient to seek medical assistance before the fatal collapse...|$|E
40|$|Background Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is {{a common}} {{congenital}} heart disease causing some blood in the aorta to flow into the pulmonary artery (PA), resulting in dilatation of the left atrium (IA) and left ventricle (LY), increased B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, {{and the development of}} h <b>eart</b> <b>failure.</b> Objectives To evaluate the clinical course, changes in heart size and function, and BNP level after transcatheter closure of PDA using the Amplatzer® duct occluder (ADO). Methods This quasi-experimental study used a one-group, pretestposttest design, and was done on PDA patients who underwent transcatheter closure using ADO. The outcomes measurements were performed four times, namely, before the procedure and at one, three, and six months after the procedure. Results were compared using a serial time analysis. Outcomes measured were heart failure scores, chest x-ray (CXR) and echocardiography findings, and plasma BNP level. Results There were 23 PDA patients enrolled, of which 12 were females. Subjects' median bodyweight was 11 (range 6. 6 to 55) kg. Prior to PDA closure, 12 subjects had mild heart fa ilure (class II) and 7 had moderate heart failure (class III). On follow-up at one month after the procedure, all subjects had improved heart failure scores (P< 0. 0001), and no heart failure was found on further follow up. Likewise, there was a decreased mean cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) from 58 to 55 % at 1 -month (P = 0. 001), and also from 55 to 52 % at 3 -month follow up (P< 0. 0001), but no further decrease was found afterwards (P = 0. 798). The left atrium/aorta (LA/Ao) ratio measured by echocardiography also showed a statistically significant decrease from 1. 6 prior to the procedure to 1. 3 (P< 0. 0001) in the first month, but it remained stable afterwards. Diastolic function, represented by peak E and A waves also significantly decreased from 127 and 91 cm/sec, before the procedure, to 90 and 68 cm/sec, respectively, at 1 month follow-up (P < 0. 0001 and P < 0. 0001, respectively). However, there were no statistically significant changes in E/ A ratio, ejection fract ion and fractional shortening. Plasma BNP level significantly decreased from 58 pg/mL before the procedure to 28 pg/mL at 1 month follow-up (P= 0. 001), but no further significant decrease was observed afterwards. Conclusion After PDA closure with ADO, we observe significant improvements in heart failure scores, heart size, diastolic function, and BNP level of our subjects especially in the first month after the procedure...|$|E
