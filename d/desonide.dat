50|$|<b>Desonide</b> is a {{synthetic}} nonfluorinated corticosteroid; topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. The mechanism of these properties, however, is unclear for the dermal route of administration. Following absorption through the skin, corticosteroids follow pharmacokinetic pathways similarly to intravenously administered corticosteroids. The mechanism of corticosteroids {{is thought to}} induce phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Lipocortins control the biosynthesis of inflammation mediators, like prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Lipocortins can inhibit the common precursor of inflammation mediators, arachidonic acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Desonide</b> (INN) is a low-potency topical {{corticosteroid}} anti-inflammatory {{that has been}} available since the 1970s.

It has a fairly good safety profile and is available as a cream, ointment, lotion, and as a foam under the tradename Verdeso Foam. Other trade names for creams, lotions, and ointments include Tridesilon, DesOwen, Desonate. It is a group VI corticosteroid under US classification, the second least potent group.|$|E
40|$|Objective: <b>Desonide</b> {{hydrogel}} 0. 05 %, {{an effective}} treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, is United States Food and Drug Administration approved {{as a treatment}} for patients as young as three months of age. Previous studies have also demonstrated that this hydrogel formulation of <b>desonide</b> 0. 05 % improved moisturization and reduced transepidermal water loss. Increased skin hydration has been correlated with improved and sustained integrity of the epidermal barrier in patients with atopic dermatitis. The objective of this clinical noninferiority study was to compare the efficacy of <b>desonide</b> hydrogel 0. 05 % with <b>desonide</b> ointment 0. 05 %, the clinical standard for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Design and setting: Randomized, investigator-blinded, parallel-group, noninferiority study in an outpatient setting. Participants: Individuals 12 years of age and older with atopic dermatitis. Measurements: Outcome measures included disease severity, body surface area involvement, subjective assessments of symptoms, corneometry, transepidermal water loss, and the patient's preference for vehicle attributes. Patients were assessed at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 4. Results: <b>Desonide</b> hydrogel 0. 05 % was shown, through visual grading assessments and noninvasive instrumentation measurements, to be as effective as generic <b>desonide</b> ointment 0. 05 % in reducing the signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in patients aged 12 to 65 years during a four-week period. In addition, patients rated <b>desonide</b> hydrogel significantly better than <b>desonide</b> ointment for absorbability and (lack of) greasiness. Conclusion: <b>Desonide</b> hydrogel, which uses a hydrogel vehicle, was preferred by patients and shown to restore the skin barrier, thus offering an efficacious alternative to <b>desonide</b> ointment...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids {{can boost}} some Malassezia-driven dermatoses. However, both antifungals and topical {{corticosteroids}} improve lesions of seborrheic dermatitis. OBJECTIVE: To revisit the topical {{activity of the}} antifungal ketoconazole and the corticosteroid <b>desonide</b> on Malassezia growth on human stratum corneum. Material and Methods: The computer-assisted corneofungimetry bioassay {{was used to compare}} the growth of M. furfur, M. globosa and M. restricta on human stratum corneum coated with olive oil. Four blinded gel formulations were tested. They contained either 2 % ketoconazole, 0. 05 % <b>desonide</b> or a combination of 2 % ketoconazole and 0. 05 % desonide; one gel was unmedicated. Untreated stratum corneum and specimens coated with a 2 % ketoconazole cream were used as negative and positive comparators, respectively. A total of 45 samples (15 M. furfur, 15 M. globosa, and 15 M. restricta) were used for each test formulation in this randomized, double-blind study. RESULTS: The 2 % ketoconazole gel and cream and the combination of 2 % ketoconazole and 0. 05 % <b>desonide</b> formulation abated similarly and significantly the M. furfur, M. globosa and M. restricta growth. The 3 species were similarly sensitive to these formulations. By contrast, no significant inhibitory effect was yielded by the 0. 05 % <b>desonide</b> gel and the vehicle. CONCLUSION: The presence of 0. 05 % <b>desonide</b> does not impair or improve the Malassezia susceptibility to 2 % ketoconazole when growing on lipid-enriched human stratum corneum.

Currently, there is no widely accepted treatment for the disorder, but it is usually treated with bleaching agents because it is considered a variant of inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the efficacy of niacinamide 4 % and <b>desonide</b> 0. 05 % emulsions compared with placebo in the treatment of axillary hyperpigmentation. Methods: Twenty-four women aged 19 &ndash; 27 years with hyperpigmented axillae (phototype III&ndash;V) were randomly assigned to receive the study treatments in the axillary region. Improvement was assessed at baseline, then clinically and by colorimetry 9 weeks later. Quantitative evaluation including melanin, inflammatory infiltrates, NKI/Beteb, CD 1 a, CD 68, and collagen type IV content was performed by histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, assisted by computerized morphometric analysis. Results: Both niacinamide and <b>desonide</b> induced significant colorimetric improvement compared with placebo; however, <b>desonide</b> showed a better depigmenting effect than niacinamide. A good to excellent response was achieved in 24 % of cases for niacinamide, 30 % for <b>desonide,</b> and 6 % for placebo. We observed a marked disruption of the basal membrane in axillary hyperpigmentation and an inflammatory infiltrate that improved after treatment. Decreased pigmentation in the desonide-treated axillae was associated with recovery of disruption at the basal membrane. Conclusion: Niacinamide and <b>desonide</b> showed depigmenting properties in women with axillary hyperpigmentation. These findings may be explained by their antimelanogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, respectively. Keywords: post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, niacinamide, desonid...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The pathobiology of {{seborrheic}} dermatitis {{is rooted in}} a peculiar inflammatory reaction to Malassezia spp. Both topical corticosteroids and antifungals are routinely used with success, either singly or in combination. OBJECTIVE: To assess {{the effect of a}} new combination therapy in this condition. METHODS: Eighteen patients with facial {{seborrheic dermatitis}} were treated in a pilot double-blind trial with an anhydrous gel containing the combination of 2 % ketoconazole and 0. 05 % <b>desonide</b> (n = 9) or the unmedicated gel (n = 9). The products were applied once daily for 3 consecutive weeks. Disease severity was assessed at the start and weekly during treatment, as well as 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the end of treatment or at the time of recurrence. The overall clinical assessments were performed using a visual analogue scale. Objective measurements included squamometry X after harvesting the stratum corneum and the erythema index yielded by narrow-band reflectance spectrophotometry. Data were evaluated in an intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: The combination therapy yielded reductions in the overall clinical symptom severity of 49, 84 and 92 % after 1, 2 and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively. The corresponding improvements with the placebo gel were significantly smaller (p < 0. 01), reaching 23, 29 and 42 % at successive 1 -week intervals. At the end of the 3 -week treatment, the clinical signs had completely subsided in 6 / 9 patients treated with the medicated gel and in only 1 / 9 patients using the placebo gel. Thus, the clinical response rate was significantly faster (p < 0. 01) with the combination therapy than with the vehicle. Differences between the treatment groups using objective noninvasive assessments were also significantly (p < 0. 01) in favor of the combination therapy. The squamometry X measurements showed 47, 67 and 74 % improvements with the combination gel after 1, 2 and 3 weeks, respectively. The corresponding values with the placebo gel were 34, 46 and 53 %, respectively. The erythema index was almost completely reduced to normal at week 2 of treatment in contrast with about 50 % reduction with the unmedicated vehicle. None of the patients reported any side effects. CONCLUSION: The combination of ketoconazole with <b>desonide</b> in an anhydrous gel is well tolerated and proves to be significantly more effective than the vehicle for treating facial seborrheic dermatitis. The fast response to treatment and the limited additional improvement between weeks 2 and 3 of the treatment suggest that this combination product may be efficacious with once daily applications for 2 weeks. These data call for expanded studies comparing each single compound, the vehicle and the combination therapy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|SCLE) is {{characterized}} by annular, nonscarring, photodistributed, or papulosquamous lesions. The disease may be idiopathic, drug induced, or drug exacerbated. Observations: A 66 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} hypertension, parkinsonism, rheumatoid arthritis, anxiety and depression, and symptoms of Sjögren syndrome was seen with a 1 -month history of an eruption on her upper extremities and upper trunk. The eruption had begun 2 to 3 weeks after subcutaneous injection of golimumab for rheumatoid arthritis. She had developed SCLE 2 years previously due to furosemide use and 10 years previously due to hydrochlorothiazide use. Physical examination revealed scaly, annular, erythematous plaques photodistributed on the arms, legs, and upper trunk. A punch biopsy specimen demonstrated vacuolar interface dermatitis and lymphohistiocytic perivascular inflammation. Serological abnormalities included a positive antinuclear antibody, an elevated anti-La/SS-B antibody level, and an elevated anti-Ro/SS-A antibody level. She was diagnosed as having SCLE and was initially treated with <b>desonide</b> lotion, photoprotection, prednisone (40 mg/d) tapered over 6 weeks, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200 mg twice daily). Because of persistent disease, methotrexate sodium (12. 5 mg/wk) was subsequently added to the regimen, and her eruption cleared completely. Conclusions: Golimumab should be added to the list of medications capable of inducing or exacerbating SCLE.
