50|$|Most {{dicentric}} chromosomes {{are known}} to form through chromosomal inversions, which are rotations in regions of a chromosome due to chromosomal breakages or intra-chromosomal recombinations. Inversions that exclude the centromere are known as paracentric inversions, which result in unbalanced gametes after meiosis. During prophase of meiosis I, homologous chromosomes form an <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> and crossover occurs. If a paracentric inversion has occurred, one of the products will be acentric, while the other product will be dicentric. The dicentric chromatid is pulled apart during anaphase of meiosis I {{with such force that}} the chromosome breaks at random positions. These broken fragments result in deletions of genes that lead to genetically unbalanced gametes. This can have severe consequences, contributing to the development of genetic disorders such as Kabuki syndrome and Edwards syndrome.|$|E

One implementation employs four articulated reflective vanes {{located at the}} periphery of the sail assembly to generate control torque about all three axes. A second attitude control configuration uses mass on a gimbaled boom to alter the center-of-mass location relative to the center-of-pressure producing roll and pitch torque along with a pair of articulated control vanes for yaw control. Command generation algorithms employ linearized dynamics with a feedback <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> to map desired vehicle attitude control torque into vane and/or gimbal articulation angle commands. We investigate the impact on actuator deflection angle behavior due to variations in how the Jacobian matrix is incorporated into the feedback <b>inversion</b> <b>loop.</b> Additionally, we compare how well each implementation tracks a commanded thrust profile, which has been generated to follow an orbit trajectory from the sun-earth L 1 point to a sub-L 1 station...|$|E

40|$|In Allium ursinum {{meiotic pairing}} of homologues is always incomplete; a {{proximal}} region on each bivalent remains regularly unsynapsed even in late pachytene. The spatial correlation of the unsynapsed region with the kinetochore {{suggests that the}} kinetochore itself exerts an inhibitory effect on synapsis in its vicinity. This {{can be interpreted as}} the cytological basis of the 'centro-mere effect ' on recombination in this species. Moreover, the high incidence of a pericentric <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> in a heterozygous chromosome pair shows that proximal pairing initiation is possible and that its failure cannot be respon-sible for pericentric asynapsis. The formation of the <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> is compli-cated by the need for two independent pairing initiation sites because synapsis cannot proceed across the pericentric region. It is proposed that the meiotic bouquet polarization helps in estab-lishing the presynaptic alignment of the homolo-gous sites within the inverted regions and hence to achieve a high rate of <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> form-ation. Thickenings of the axial/lateral elements are not distributed equally along the synaptonemal complex. They are underrepresented in unpaired axes but strikingly abundant at the borders with synapsed regions, suggesting their origin in the pairing forks during the process of synapsis. They are virtually always present at nucleolus-organizing regions and often they appear at corresponding sites on opposite lateral elements. Besides the thickenings several other kinds of axial deformities are present in unpaired axes.

40|$|Meiotic {{irregularities}} {{and partial}} sterility {{were found in}} the hybrid between the soybean, Glycine max and its presumed wild progenitor, Glycine soja. Chromosome bridges and fragments were believed to be caused by inversion heterozygosity. The presence of an inversion was confirmed by finding an <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> at pachytene. Other evidence for inversions came from bivalents that failed to separate in the first division. These bivalents acted as laggards or passed intact to one pole at anaphase I. Nondisjunction of the partners in the bivalents was believed to result from chiasmata occurring in the region of an inversion in the bivalents. The number of bridges, fragments, and lagging bivalents suggest the presence of more than two inversion differences between the two species.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in animal studies that, in animals heterozygous for pericentric chromosomal <b>inversions,</b> <b>loop</b> formation is greatly reduced during meiosis. This results in absence of recombination within the inverted segment, with recombination seen only outside the inversion. A recent study in yeast has shown that telomeres, rather than centromeres, lead in chromosome movement just prior to meiosis and {{may be involved in}} promoting recombination. We studied by cytogenetic analysis and DNA polymorphisms the nature of meiotic recombination in a three-generation family with a large pericentric X chromosome inversion, inv(X) (p 21. 1 q 26), in which Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) was cosegregating with the inversion. On DNA analysis {{there was no evidence of}} meiotic recombination between the inverted and normal X chromosomes in the inverted segment. Recombination was seen at the telomeric regions, Xp 22 and Xq 27 - 28. No deletion or point mutation was found on analysis of the DMD gene. On the basis of the FISH results, we believe that the X inversion is the mutation responsible for DMD in this family. Our results indicate that (1) pericentric X chromosome inversions result in reduction of recombination between the normal and inverted X chromosomes; (2) meiotic X chromosome pairing in these individuals is likely initiated at the telomeres; and (3) in this family DMD is caused by the pericentric inversion...|$|R

40|$|Inversion heterozygotes are {{expected}} to suffer from reduced fertility and {{a high incidence of}} chromosomally unbalanced gametes due to recombination within the inverted region. Non-homologous synapsis of the inverted regions can prevent recombination there and diminish the deleterious effects of inversion heterozygosity. The choice between non-homologous and homologous synapsis depends on the size of inversion, its genetic content, its location in relation to the centromere and telomere, and genetic background. In addition, there is a class of inversions in which homologous synapsis is gradually replaced by non-homologous synapsis during meiotic progression. This process is called synaptic adjustment. The degree of synaptic adjustment depends critically on the presence and location of the COs (crossovers) within the <b>inversion</b> <b>loop.</b> Only bivalents without COs within the loop and those with COs {{in the middle of the}} inversion can be completely adjusted and became linear.

From analysis of the plasmid by use of BamHI and Bgl II, the din gene specifying the din+ activity was located near or within the C region of P 1. It is highly plausible that the din gene of P 1 was also involved in the inversion of the C region. Similarly, the DNA fragment containing the G and beta segments of Mu was cloned on pCR 1.

The location of the rp 49 gene region within the <b>inversion</b> <b>loop</b> differs among heterokaryotypes: it {{is very close to}} one of the breakpoints in heterozygotes involving Ost chromosomes, while it is in a more central position in all other heterokaryotypes. The distribution of nucleotide polymorphism in the different arrangements is consistent with a monophyletic origin of the inversions. The data also provide evidence that gene conversion and possibly double crossover are involved in shuffling nucleotide variation among gene arrangements. The analyses reveal that the level of genetic exchange is higher when the region is located in a more central position of the inverted fragment than when it is close to the breakpoints. The pairwise difference distributions as well as the negative values of Tajima's and Fu and Li's statistics further support the hypothesis that nucleotide variation within chromosomal arrangements still reflects expansion after the origin of the inversions. Under the expansion model, we have estimated the time of origin of the studied inversions...|$|E

40|$|Techniques {{have been}} {{developed}} for manipulating pericentric inversions in Drosophila that are based on the lethality of grossly aneuploid zygotes and the existence of recombinationally interconvertible genotypes for any heterozygous inversion complex: males of some of these genotypes will produce only aneuploid sperm, which can be used to rescue complementary aneuploid ova and selectively recover recombinational derivatives of inversions. Markers can be recombined into inversions through a sequence of selected single exchanges, and a novel type of duplication can be synthesized from overlapping inversions that has the characteristics of both insertional and tandem duplications; there are also applications to half-tetrad analyses. ——Two cytogenetic screens are developed: (1) the dominant lethality of a large insertional-tandem duplication can be reverted by deletional events that give rise to net deficiencies or duplications, and (2) deficiencies and tandem duplications in proximal regions can be selectively recovered as the results of unequal exchanges within an <b>inversion</b> <b>loop.</b> Recombinants have been recovered between breakpoints separated by distances of as little as fifty bands, arguing against the existence of some small number of sites necessary for the initiation of recombinational pairing.

40|$|An {{examination}} of synaptic {{data from a}} series of X-autosome translocations and crossover data from an extensive series of autosome-autosome translocations and autosomal inversions in mice has lead {{to the development of a}} hypothesis which predicts synaptic and recombinational behavior of chromosomal aberrations during meiosis. This hypothesis predicts that in heterozygotes for chromosomal rearrangements that meiotically align G-light chromatin with G-light chromatin lack of homology will be recognized. If homologous synapsis cannot proceed, synaptonemal complex formation will cease and there will be no physical suppression of crossing over in such rearrangements. However, if a chromosomal rearrangement aligns G-light chromatin with G-dark chromatin at the time of synapsis, lack of homology will not be recognized and synaptonemal complex formation will proceed nonhomologously through the G-dark chromatin. Crossing over will be physically suppressed in this region and this suppression of crossing over will be confined to the chromosome in which the G-light chromatin is nonhomologously synapsed with G-dark chromatin. When G-light chromatin is once again aligned with G-light chromatin, lack of homology again will be recognized and either homologous synapsis will be reinitiated (as in an <b>inversion</b> <b>loop),</b> or will cease altogether (as in some translocations). Unlike the previously described ``synaptic adjustment,'' this nonhomologous synapsis of G-light with G-dark chromatin appears to compete with homologous synapsis during early pachynema...|$|E
