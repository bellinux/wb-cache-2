First, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> suppress all armed resistance out in the provinces, and thus bring order back to the empire. Second, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> create a strong central government in Rome. And finally, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> knit together the entire empire into a single cohesive unit.|$|E
