25|$|The Ba'ath Party of Syria, which {{advocated}} the ideologies of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism had {{clashed with the}} Muslim Brotherhood, a group with a Sunni Islamist ideology, since 1940. The two groups were opposed <b>in</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways.</b> The Ba'ath party was nominally secular, nationalist. The Muslim Brotherhood, like other Islamist groups, saw nationalism as un-Islamic and religion as inseparable from politics and government. Most Ba'ath party members were from humble, obscure backgrounds and favored radical economic policies, while Sunni Muslims had dominated the souqs and landed power of Syria, and tended to view government intervention in the economy as threatening. Not all Sunni notables believed in fundamentalism, but even {{those who did not}} often saw the Brotherhood as a useful tool against the Ba'ath.|$|E

Some shell [...] "currencies" [...] were not used for commercial transactions, but mainly as social status displays at important occasions, such as weddings.

500|$|Timothy Johnson {{contends that}} Nixon in China goes beyond minimalism <b>in</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways.</b> [...] Adams had been inspired, in {{developing}} his art, by minimalist composers such as Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley, {{and this is}} reflected in the work by repetitive rhythmic patterns. [...] However, the opera's complex harmonic structures are very different from the simpler ones in, for example, Glass's Einstein on the Beach, which Adams terms [...] "mindlessly repetitive"; Johnson nevertheless considers the Glass opera an influence on Nixon in China. As Glass's techniques did not allow Adams to accomplish what he wanted, he employed a system of constantly shifting metric organizational schemes to supplement the repeated rhythms in the opera. [...] The music is marked by metrical dissonance, which occurs both for musical reasons and in response to the text of the opera.|$|E

In the last few years, there has been growing interest in Castoriadis's thought, including the publication of two monographs authored by Arnason's former students: Jeff Klooger's Castoriadis: Psyche, Society, Autonomy (Brill), and Suzi Adams's Castoriadis's Ontology: Being and Creation (Fordham University Press).|$|E
2500|$|According to a later account, which Searle {{presents}} in Intentionality (1983) {{and which}} differs <b>in</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways</b> {{from the one}} suggested in Speech Acts, illocutionary acts are characterised by their having [...] "conditions of satisfaction" [...] (an idea adopted from Strawson's 1971 paper [...] "Meaning and Truth") and a [...] "direction of fit" [...] (an idea adopted from Elizabeth Anscombe). For example, the statement [...] "John bought two candy bars" [...] is satisfied {{if and only if}} it is true, i.e. John did buy two candy bars. By contrast, the command [...] "John, buy two candy bars!" [...] is satisfied if and only if John carries out the action of purchasing two candy bars. Searle refers to the first as having the [...] "word-to-world" [...] direction of fit, since the words are supposed to change to accurately represent the world, and the second as having the [...] "world-to-word" [...] direction of fit, since the world is supposed to change to match the words. (There is also the double direction of fit, in which the relationship goes both ways, and the null or zero direction of fit, in which it goes neither way because the propositional content is presupposed, as in [...] "I'm sorry I ate John's candy bars.") ...|$|E

2500|$|The CPUSA {{played a}} {{significant}} role in defending the rights of African-Americans during its heyday in the 1930s and 1940s. The Alabama Chapter of the Communist Party USA played a highly important role in organizing the unemployed Black workers, the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union and numerous anti-lynching campaigns. Further, the Alabama chapter organized many young activists that would later go on to be prominent members in the Civil Rights Movement, such as Rosa Parks. [...] Throughout its history many of the Party's leaders and political thinkers have been African Americans. James Ford, Charlene Mitchell, Angela Davis and Jarvis Tyner, the current executive vice chair of the Party, all ran as presidential or vice presidential candidates on the Party ticket. Others like Benjamin J. Davis, William L. Patterson, Harry Haywood, James Jackson, Henry Winston, Claude Lightfoot, Alphaeus Hunton, Doxey Wilkerson, Claudia Jones and John Pittman contributed <b>in</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways</b> to the party's approaches to major issues from human and civil rights, peace, women's equality, the national question, working class unity, socialist thought, cultural struggle and more. African American thinkers, artists and writers such as Claude McKay, Richard Wright, Ann Petry, W. E. B. Du Bois, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Lloyd Brown, Charles White, Elizabeth Catlett, Paul Robeson, Gwendolyn Brooks and many more were one-time members or supporters of the party and the CPUSA also had a close alliance with Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. The party's work to appeal to African Americans continues to this day. It was instrumental in the founding of the Black Radical Congress in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Sahagún wrote two {{versions}} of the conquest of Mexico, the first is Book 12 of the General History (1576) and the second is a revision completed in 1585. The version in the Historia General is the only narration of historical events, as opposed to information on general topics such as religious beliefs and practices and social structure. [...] The 1576 text is exclusively from an indigenous, largely Tlatelolcan viewpoint. [...] He revised the account in 1585 <b>in</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways,</b> adding passages praising the Spanish, especially the conqueror Hernan Cortés, rather than adhering to the indigenous viewpoint. [...] The original of the 1585 manuscript is lost. In the late 20th century, a handwritten copy in Spanish was found by John B. Glass in the Boston Public Library, and has been published in facsimile and English translation, with comparisons to Book 12 of the General History. [...] In his introduction ("To the reader") to Book 12 of the Historia General, Sahagún claimed the history of the conquest was a linguistic tool so that friars would know the language of warfare and weapons. [...] Since compiling a history of the conquest {{from the point of view}} of the defeated Tenochtitlan-Tlatelolcan could be controversial for the Spanish crown, Sahagún may have been prudent in trying to shape how the history was perceived. Sahagún's 1585 revision of the conquest narrative, which included praise for Cortés and the Spanish conquest, was completed in a period when work on indigenous texts was under attack. Sahagún likely wrote this version with that political situation well in mind, when a narrative of the conquest entirely from the defeated Mexicans' viewpoint was suspect.|$|E
2500|$|The idea, here, {{is that a}} truth's {{invariance}} {{makes it}} genuinely indiscernible: because a truth is everywhere and always the case, it passes unnoticed {{unless there is a}} rupture in the laws of being and appearance, during which the truth in question becomes, but only for a passing moment, discernible. Such a rupture is what Badiou calls an event, according to a theory originally worked out in Being and Event and fleshed out <b>in</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways</b> in Logics of Worlds. The individual who chances to witness such an event, if he is faithful to what he has glimpsed, can then introduce the truth by naming it into worldly situations. For Badiou, it is by positioning oneself to the truth of an event that a human animal becomes a subject; subjectivity is not an inherent human trait. According to a process or procedure that subsequently unfolds only if those who subject themselves to the glimpsed truth continue to be faithful in the work of announcing the truth in question, genuine knowledge is produced (knowledge often appears in Badiou's work under the title of the [...] "veridical"). While such knowledge is produced {{in the process of being}} faithful to a truth event, it should be noted that, for Badiou, knowledge, in the figure of the encyclopedia, always remains fragile, subject to what may yet be produced as faithful subjects of the event produce further knowledge. According to Badiou, truth procedures proceed to infinity, such that faith (fidelity) outstrips knowledge. (Badiou, following both Lacan and Heidegger, distances truth from knowledge.) The dominating ideology of the day, which Badiou terms [...] "democratic materialism," [...] denies the existence of truth and only recognizes [...] "bodies" [...] and [...] "languages." [...] Badiou proposes a turn towards the [...] "materialist dialectic," [...] which recognizes that there are only bodies and languages, except there are also truths.|$|E
