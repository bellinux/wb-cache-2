40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a {{solvency}} model {{to estimate the}} necessary economic capital of a real <b>insurance</b> <b>undertaking</b> operating solely in the Automobile branch, applying the Tail Conditional Expectation risk measure. The model assumes a one year time horizon static approach with an unchanged asset and liability structure for the company.
