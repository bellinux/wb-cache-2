The deal lifted suspensions for some players the week it was approved. The NFL began testing players for HGH the next month.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Olympics, the Australian public {{expected}} Thorpe {{to deliver}} multiple world records and gold medals as a formality; Sydney's Daily Telegraph posted a front-page spread headlined Invincible. Thorpe cruised through the heats of the 400m {{on the first}} morning of competition, posting a new Olympic record and shortening bookmakers' odds to 50–1. By the time the final was held that night, the pressure had intensified—the host nation had yet to win its first gold medal. Thorpe led throughout, and although Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino was within a body length at the 300m mark, Thorpe's finishing kick extended the final margin to three body lengths. This set a new world record of 3min 40.59s. Secret tests {{carried out by the}} Italian National Olympic Committee prior to the Olympics later showed that Rosolino had abnormal levels of <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone.</b> Rosolino aside, Thorpe had left bronze medallist Klete Keller fifteen metres in arrears.|$|E
5|$|Season 4 {{continues}} in Lima {{with a new}} generation of students but also follows some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club through a loss at the Sectionals competition (episode 9) and subsequent reinstatement when the winning Dalton Academy Warblers were found to have used banned substances (<b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone)</b> (episode 12) before winning at the Regionals competition (episode 22), which meant they would be attending their third consecutive National show choir competition. In the meantime, Rachel Berry and Kurt Hummel navigate NYADA and their lives as aspiring performers, plus their relationships with Finn and Blaine. Issues during the season include sex, bulimia, gender identity, child molestation, dyslexia, school violence, and pregnancy scares. Former main cast members Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) were credited as guest stars, while previously recurring glee club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) was promoted to the main cast.|$|E

25|$|Xanax {{was found}} in Daniel Benoit's system. District Attorney Scott Ballard noted {{this was not a}} drug that would be given to a child under normal circumstances. It is {{believed}} that Daniel was sedated prior to being murdered, with Sperry ruling out that Daniel died of a drug overdose. The GBI, however, said in the press conference that it could not perform tests for steroids or <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> on Daniel {{because of a lack of}} urine.|$|R

25|$|The major isoform of the <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> is {{a protein}} of 191 amino acids and a {{molecular}} weight of 22,124 daltons.

It appears that, in structure, GH is evolutionarily homologous to prolactin and chorionic somatomammotropin. Despite marked structural similarities between growth hormone from different species, only human and Old World monkey growth hormones have significant effects on the <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor.|$|E
50|$|Most {{children}} would compete in youth sport centers and be scouted by the government, {{which resulted in}} the best prospects being taken for the purpose of intense Olympic training. These children were expected to deliver great victories, and the state was willing to use anything at its disposal to ensure that. The advances in medicine and science meant that use of steroids, amphetamines, <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormones</b> and blood boosting were common practice behind the scenes in training centers for professional athletes.|$|R
50|$|Boyd {{decides to}} look for work rather than repeat Year 12 after barely passing the {{previous}} year. He takes a job at a local gym and becomes obsessive over fitness and body shape to the extent of purging, which alienates him from his friends and family.

Krystal, Boyd's boss offers him <b>Human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormones,</b> which later have an effect on his personality, causing out of character behavior.|$|R
5000|$|Treatment is {{expensive}} and requires {{many years of}} injections with <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormones.</b> The result depends on the cause, but is typically an increase in final height of about 5 to 10 cm taller than predicted. [...] Thus, treatment takes {{a child who is}} expected to be much shorter than a typical adult and produces an adult who is still obviously shorter than average. For example, several years of successful treatment in a girl who is predicted to be 145 cm as an adult may result in her being 150 cm instead.|$|R

50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} {{has many}} applications to medicine {{that include the}} manufacturing of drugs, creation of model animals that mimic human conditions and gene therapy.

This application has now been applied to, <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormones,</b> follistim (for treating infertility), human albumin, monoclonal antibodies, antihemophilic factors, vaccines and many other drugs. Mouse hybridomas, cells fused together to create monoclonal antibodies, have been humanised through genetic engineering to create human monoclonal antibodies. Genetically engineered viruses are being developed that can still confer immunity, but lack the infectious sequences.|$|R

5000|$|Injection {{into the}} {{subcutaneous}} tissue is a {{route of administration}} used for drugs such as insulin: because it is highly vascular, the tissue absorbs drugs quickly. Subcutaneous injection {{is believed to be}} the most effective manner to administer some drugs, such as <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormones.</b> Just as the subcutaneous tissue can store fat, it can also provide good storage space for drugs that need to be released gradually because there is limited blood flow. [...] "Skin popping" [...] is a slang term that includes this method of administration, and is usually used in association with recreational drugs.|$|R
25|$|On February 28, 2007, Holyfield was {{anonymously}} {{linked to}} Applied Pharmacy Services, a pharmacy in Alabama that was {{under investigation for}} supplying athletes with illegal steroids and <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (HGH). He denied ever using performance enhancers.|$|E
25|$|Following the season, Ankiel {{admitted}} to using <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (HGH), {{but said he}} was following doctor's orders.

2500|$|In 2013, {{at least}} twenty MLB players (and athletes in other sports) were accused of taking HGH. Ultimately 14 were suspended, most famously Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers (suspended for final 65 games of 2013 season), Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees (suspended for 211 games), and Nelson Cruz of the Texas Rangers (50 games). The clinic was run by Anthony “Tony” Bosch in Florida.

5000|$|Choh Hao Li (sometimes Cho Hao Li) ( [...] ; pinyin: Lǐ Zhuōhào) (April 21, 1913 - November 28, 1987) was a Chinese-born U.S. {{biochemist}} who discovered, in 1966, that <b>human</b> pituitary <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> (somatotropin) {{consists of}} a chain of 256 amino acids. In 1970 he succeeded in synthesizing this hormone, the largest protein molecule synthesized up to that time.|$|R
25|$|Growth hormone (GH l) is {{also called}} {{somatotropin}} (British: somatotrophin). The human form of {{growth hormone is}} known as <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone,</b> or hGH (ovine growth hormone, or sheep growth hormone, is abbreviated oGH). GH can refer either to the natural hormone produced by the pituitary (somatotropin), or biosynthetic GH for therapy.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for {{achondroplasia}} {{even though the}} cause of the mutation in the growth factor receptor has been found. Although used by those without achondroplasia to aid in growth, <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> does not help people with achondroplasia.

25|$|Some athletes {{also use}} GHB, as GHB {{has been shown}} to elevate <b>human</b> <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> in vivo. One study found that it doubled growth hormone {{secretion}} in normal young males.

40|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>hormone</b> {{deficiency}} {{was first}} described in chil-dren with growth retardation, and for three decades, the therapeutic use of <b>growth</b> <b>hormone</b> {{was restricted to}} promoting linear growth.
