40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{rationale}} for choosing franchising rather than independent activity, arguing that this choice may be motivated by knowledge and competence considerations. We consider the franchise chain as a specific learning organizational form and explore whether this structure handles knowledge and builds competences according to an idiosyncratic pattern. Concretely, we empirically identify differences in the architecture of competences of <b>franchised</b> vs independent <b>shops</b> in the car maintenance industry in France, and analyze some causes for those differences. Thanks to in depth interviews coupled with lexical and quantitative analyses we find that <b>franchised</b> <b>shops</b> do master specific competences. However, the distinctive competences held by franchisees {{do not necessarily reflect}} franchisors' knowledge, and are not exclusively the consequences of a shared identity in the franchise chain. We conclude that the development of franchise cannot be explained by competence-related arguments only, knowledge and competences being managed in distinctive ways within different franchising networks...|$|R

[...] During the 1980s, her garments were primarily in black, dark grey or white. The emphasis on black clothing led to the Japanese press describing Kawakubo and her followers as 'The Crows'. The materials were often draped around the body and featured frayed, unfinished edges along with holes and a general asymmetrical shape. Challenging the established notions of beauty she created an uproar at her debut Paris fashion show where journalists labeled her clothes 'Hiroshima chic' amongst other things. Since the late 1980s, her colour palette has grown somewhat.|$|R
