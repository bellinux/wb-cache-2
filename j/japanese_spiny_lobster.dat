50|$|Learning of {{the seal}} placed on him, Doukoku briefly changes {{his plans to}} target Takeru as {{the death of the}} Shiba House would ensure that he would never be sealed again. But when that plan failed, Doukoku has his force carry on the {{original}} plan without giving wind of this knowledge to any Ayakashi with his own agenda. During the summer while in a comatose state that leaves him open to his enemies, Doukoku manages to suppress his magnified power. Later, after learning of Akamaro's true colors, Doukoku risks his life to enter the mortal realm to repair Dayu's shamisen after driving off Akumaro and defeating Shinken Red. As a result, he has to be submerged in the Sanzu River to rehydrate. But after the Shiba Clan true's eighteenth head is revealed, Doukoku's followers attempt to speed up his awakening by increasing the amount of suffering until Dayu uses Shinza's anguish to bring Doukoku back to the mortal realm. After absorbing Dayu's energy to heal his body, Doukoku gains immunity to the Sealing Character and can now endure being in the mortal realm without drying up. As a result, Doukoku overpowers the Shinkengers before bringing the Rokumon Junk into the mortal realm when the Sanzu River floods the city. Thinking he had broken the Shinkengers' spirits when they attempt to defeat him, Doukoku is immobilized before Shinken Blue delivers the final blow. Assuming his second life, Doukoku overpowers Samuraihaoh, blasting it and throwing off its components until only Shinkenoh remains, then impales it on his sword. However, the Shinkengers take advantage of the events and mortally wound him before he explodes. He attempts to take the Shinkengers down with him, but this fails as they survive the explosion. Doukoku is modeled after Vaiśravaṇa (Bishamonten) and a <b>Japanese</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{small number}} of fishers in Chiba Prefecture of eastern Japan use cotton gill nets to catch <b>Japanese</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> Panulirus japonicus. To examine the {{advantages}} of cotton gill nets, we analyzed changes in mesh breaking load of a new cotton gill net used in a fishing operation. A new cotton gill net was also soaked in a seawater tank to simulate ghost fishing conditions. The average mesh breaking load of new cotton mesh was 50. 3 N. This value decreased to 19. 0 N after 38 days (∼ 912 h), and after 82 days (∼ 1968 h) the mesh could be easily torn (breaking load 0. 07 N). Under fishing conditions, the cumulative soak time was only 744. 4 h over 19 months. The average breaking load {{at the end of}} this period was 43. 1 N, a strength 86 % that of the presoaked mesh.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{investigate}} unknown prey organisms for lobster phyllosoma larvae, molecular approach {{was developed and}} adopted using the laboratory-reared and wild phyl-losoma samples. The central domain of 18 S rDNA was amplified via nested PCR using crude DNAs extracted from the hepatopancrea of the larvae and cloned into plasmid. Clones hav-ing 18 S rDNA different from the hosts were screened by RFLP analysis, and the nucleotide sequences determined were subjected to FASTA homology search and phylogenetic analy-sis to identify the source of eukaryotic organisms. Feasibility of this method was confirmed in the laboratory-reared larvae of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> (Panulirus japonicus) fed exclu-sively on either gonad of common mussel (Mytilus edulis) or Artemia nauplii. From the two wild-caught larvae (Scyllarus sp. and P. japonicus), 178 and 168 clones were isolated, of which 132 and 4 clones had different restriction profiles from the hosts, respectively. DNAs of Cni-daria and Urochordata were observed from the scyllarid larva, while those of fungi and host variant were observed in P. japonicus larva.

40|$|The {{studies on}} the phyllosoma larvae of Palinulid and Scyllarid lobster, {{crustacean}} decapod, have been made from various points of view, but their larval development, migration in the sea, and the way how to return for recruitment to their habitat from off-sea, are still left to further research. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to study the phyllosoma larvae, reared or collected, in connection with oceanographic conditions that surrounds them. 1. On the rearing of phyllosoma larva. (1) Phyllosoma of genus Panulirus. As to Panulirus phyllosoma Panulius japonicas, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> was mainly used. In author’s experiments, 12 times moulted larva (13 th instar), 6. 4 mm in length, was obtained, though the attempt to rear up the Puerulus larva was not successful. The suitable water temperature for phyllosoma is 22 °- 29 °C. For their food were used the nauplii of brine-shrimps. The growth of cultured phyllosoma was nearly constant till 5 th instar, and after that it became dull gradually. From these results, it may reasonably be assumed that the growth from 6 th till 13 th instar is abnormal in some degree. Each ecdyses of Phyllosoma occurs at almost regular intervals, which are apt to widen gradually, and the interval is short at first (7 - 8 days) and later it becomes gradually prolonged (10 - 15 days). These intervals shows ome fluctuations when their food is changed in quality or in quantity. Usually the intervals become shorter when more or better food is given. (2) Phyllosomas excepting genus Panulirus. The rearing up of phyllosoma of Ibacus ciliates to 4 th instar, that of Parribacus antarcticus to 3 rd instar and that of Scyllarus bicuspidatus to 9 th instar were brought forth successfully. The condition of breeding is nearly the same with Panulirus phyllosoma. 2. On the distribution of phyllosoma in the Indian Ocean. In 1963 - 64, Kagoshima-maru, attached to the Kagoshima University, engaged in the International Indian Ocean Expedition, carrying on the plankton investigations at the areas of 7 °N 26 °S and 78 °E 98 °E. Phyllsoma larvae collected were 340 individuals in all; that is, 201 of genus Panulirus and 139 of other phyllosomas. Almost all the phyllosomas were collected by surface horizontal towing with 160 cm larval net at night. The densities of phyllosoma at the surface were calculated from the time required in towing and from the numbers collected at each station. ""Average density of phyllosoma per km^ 2 at the areas of 6 ° 302 ̆ 7 N 5 °N, 5 °N 0 °, 0 ° 5 °S, 5 °S 10 °S, 10 °S 15 °S, 15 °S 20 °S, 20 °S 25 °S were 1700, 3200, 1600, 1200, 100, 24, 0, respectively. The fact that phyllosomas were found in many off-sea stations would mean that waters of almost all areas were previously mixed with coastal waters to some degree. The distribution of phyllosoma disappeared at 15 ° 17 °S, and from this, it may be supposed that there is no active mixture between Indian equatorial waters and Indian central waters. A remarkable change of plankton biomass showing the existence of two different watermasses over there was also observed. It is sometimes not by hydrographic elements such as temperature and chrolinity but by plankton that the oceanographic conditions are made clear. Phyllosoma larva may be useful as an indicator of these oceanographic conditions to confirm the existence of watermasses or currents which are not to be indicated completely by ordinary hydrographic elements. To ascertain how many phyllosomas come back to the coast again is very difficult but important. The average density of the late stage phyllosoma in the Indian Ocean (more than 20 mm in length; which are going to be changed into Puerulus larva in a month or so) was about 1, 700 per km^ 2 at the north of equator. Provided that all the Puerulus larvae that are distributed within 100 km from the coast can go back to the coast again, the number of larvae becomes 170, 000 per 1 km coast length. Although {{on their way to the}} coast, a considerable decrease in their number can not be avoided, still the returning of enough survived number of the larvae might be expected. ...|$|E

25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat.

5|$|Natural predators of the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant {{sea bass}} and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> including the California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument.

If a predator is very close, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|R
40|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> feed on a {{wide range}} of natural marine food. They prey nocturnally upon a diverse {{assemblage}} of epifaunal and infaunal organisms including molluscs (such as snails and clams), smaller crustaceans, echinoderms, polychaetes and algae (Lipicius and Cobb, 1994). Slow moving or sessile benthic marine invertebrates, which serve as main food of most <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> in the wild have also been found useful in culture trials of lobsters. Marine food items are preferred over terrestrial animal food by lobsters and among marine food sources, shellfish (particularly mussels) is preferred over finfish (Booth and Kittaka, 1994). Tropical <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have several amenable characteristics which make them suitable for aquaculture. Tropical lobsters are adaptable to captive conditions, less cannibalistic and relatively fast growing than their counterparts in the sub-tropical and temperate regions (Anon., 1994). The greatest hurdle in growing <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is the difficulty in larval rearing and hence the culture of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> is still not commercially taken up in spite of significant advances made in recent years.

40|$|Abstract. A complex {{nervous system}} enables <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{to have a}} rich {{behavioural}} repertoire. The present paper discusses {{the ways in which}} the sensory systems of the Caribbean <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panulirus argus, particularly its chemosensory systems, are involved in feeding behaviour. It addresses the neural mechanisms of three aspects of their food-finding ability: detection, identification, and discrimination of natural food odours; the effect of learning on responses to food odours; the mechanisms by which <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> orient to odours from a distance under natural flow conditions. It demonstrates that the olfactory organ of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> might use acrossneuron response patterns in discriminating odour quality; that the hedonic value of food can be modified by experience, including associative and nonassociative conditioning; that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can readily orient to distant odour sources; and that both chemo- and mechanosensory antennular input are important in this behaviour. Either aesthetasc or nonaesthetasc chemosensory pathways can be used in identifying odour quality, mediating learned behaviours, and permitting orientation to the source of distant odours.
