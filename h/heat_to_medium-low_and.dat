40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of global value chains, trade has increased in intermediates goods. The first objective of the paper is to provide a picture of Italian intermediate imports by industry and over time. Moreover, this paper attempts to study three possible factors than can influence the import of intermediate goods - global sourcing, outsourcing and MNE networks - using pooled cross-section data for the period 1985 - 2004 for Italian industries. The econometric results point to a different relationship for high and medium-high technology industries <b>and</b> <b>medium-low</b> <b>and</b> low technology industries relative to the role of inward and outward FDI in explaining the imported intermediate demand. The results suggest that outsourcing is important in explaining intermediate imports for <b>medium-low</b> <b>and</b> low technology industries. On the contrary, for high and medium-high technology industries the data give support to the global-sourcing hypothesis while the evidence for the MNE network hypothesis is weak.

30|$|The OECD {{classification}} identifies four categories: low, <b>medium-low,</b> medium-high, <b>and</b> {{high technology}} industries. While the printing and paper industry {{is classified as}} low-technology by the OECD with the highest score within this group, in our paper, we classify it as medium technology. We also lump together the <b>medium-low</b> <b>and</b> medium-high categories into one medium-technology category except that we reclassified the scientific instruments, motor vehicles, and electronic machinery in the high technology category instead of putting them in the medium-high group. These three industries ranked {{at the top of}} the medium-high technology based on R&D intensity (see Table  3 of Hatzichronoglou 1997). This change in cutoff points is made to allow sufficient number of observation in applying the OECD classification to less industrialized countries.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{business}} enterprise R&D expenditures in Brazil are decomposed {{to stress the}} role of the individual firms’ innovation efforts and of the industrial structure in the aggregate levels of this indicator. Based on the aggregation of the manufacturing industry sectors into four groups according to their technological intensity, the ratio between R&D expenditures and net sales of the manufacturing in Brazil was analyzed and compared with the ratios observed in Germany, in the United States and in Canada. It is argued that if the target of Brazilian innovation policy is to increase the ratio between {{business enterprise}} R&D expenditures and the GDP, the focus should be placed on high and medium-high technology sectors.

Then the grassland was classified into higher coverage grassland, high coverage grassland, medium coverage grassland and low coverage grassland by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Finally, the spatial-temporal dynamic changes of above-mentioned eight kinds of landscape patterns were analyzed using landscape ecology principle.

Total alkane concentrations ranged from 3755 to 129, 027 mu g kg(- 1), and the concentrations of 16 PAHs ranged from 375 to 29, 517 mu g kg(- 1). The ratios of specific n-alkanes (e. g., CPI 24 - 34, WaxC(n), and Paq), including a new proposed index, terrestrial-marine discriminant (TMD), {{as well as the}} ratios of selected PAHs (e. g., Ant/Sigma 178, Fl/Sigma 202, BaAnt/Sigma 228, and IPyr/Sigma 276), showed that the sources of hydrocarbons in the sediments were generally biogenic, including both terrigenous and marine, with an anthropogenic pyrolytic contribution (petrogenic and biogenic combustion). For the environmental risk assessment, a sediment quality guideline (SQGs) comparison indicated that the station risk levels ranged from low <b>to</b> <b>medium-low,</b> except for R 6, which has a greater impact on the ecological risk for marine organisms.

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of quantifying the return on investment of market-based assets, my dissertation examines how different aspects of intangible market-based assets affect firms’ financial performance. Each of our datasets covers more than 90 firms across different industries, and we adopt the widely accepted economic and financial models to estimate marketing and finance metrics of each firm. Essay 1 provides an empirical investigation {{of the effects of}} six product line positioning strategies (high, medium, low, high–medium, <b>medium–low,</b> <b>and</b> high–medium–low) and three primary branding strategies (corporate branding, house-of-brands, and mixed-branding) on firms’ financial performance. This research illustrates that narrower product line positioning strategies are associated with higher cash flow and lower firm idiosyncratic risk. Meanwhile, branding strategies {{have a significant impact on}} firms’ cash flow but not idiosyncratic risk. In addition, product line positioning strategy moderates the relationship between branding strategies and cash flow but not the relationship between branding strategies and firm idiosyncratic risk. Essay 2 examines brand social engagement, a new conceptualization of consumers’ responses to brands’ social media efforts, and its role in translating brand assets into firm value. We propose and test the three dimensions of brand social engagement–Affiliation, Conversation and Responsiveness–and link them to firm financial performance. We find that the three dimensions of brand social engagement are significantly associated with firm financial performance. Moreover, advertising expenditures moderate the relationship between brand social engagement and firm financial performance...|$|R

Methods: This study used a self administered survey, including the Coping Responses Inventory.

Fluid {{inclusions}} (FIs) studies indicate three types of FIs, including aqueous, aqueous-carbonic, and daughter mineral-bearing multiphase inclusions. The daughter minerals in FIs are mainly composed of marcasite, chalcopyrite, calcite, and dolomite. Microthermometric data show that the homogenization temperature and salinity of FIs decrease gradually from early to late stages. Homogenization temperatures from early to main to late stages span from 244 to 334 °C, from 164 to 298 °C, and from 111 to 174 °C, respectively, while their salinities are 4. 0 – 9. 9 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., 0. 5 – 12. 7 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., and 0. 2 – 8. 8 [*]wt. % NaCl equiv., respectively.

This paper {{is part of}} the dissemination phase of a research project assessing the need to adapt buildings in New Zealand to climate change based on <b>medium-low</b> <b>and</b> medium-high climate change scenarios from research by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA). The overall purpose is to determine the impact of climate change on the built environment and to generate a set of options for adaptation. The building sector’s vulnerability to climate change is assessed through: • Topology and condition review of the national building stock; • House overheating conditions and energy consumption simulations; and • A scenario-based social impacts study. Adaptation options and recommendations are presented for a broad range of building-related climate change impacts. Economic modelling and cost-benefit analyses are used to investigate the economic viability of thermal adaptation. Although the effects of climate change are expected to be less severe in New Zealand than in many other parts of the world, the key message from this report is that the strong, early and coordinated action on climate change can limit potentially large social, cultural and economic costs in New Zealand...|$|R
