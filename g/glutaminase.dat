25|$|Ammonia {{toxicity}} {{is often}} seen through two routes of administration, either through consumption or through endogenous ailments such as liver failure. One notable case in which ammonia toxicity is common {{is in response to}} cirrhosis of the liver which results in hepatic encephalopathy, and can result in cerebral edema (Haussinger 2006). This cerebral edema can be the result of nervous cell remodeling. As a consequence of increased concentrations, ammonia activity in-vivo has been shown to induce swelling of astrocytes in the brain through increased production of cGMP (Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate) within the cells which leads to Protein Kinase G-mediated(PKG) cytoskeletal modifications. The resultant effect of this toxicity can be reduced brain energy metabolism and function. Importantly, the toxic effects of ammonia on astrocyte remodling can be reduced through administration of L-carnitine. This astrocyte remodeling appears to be mediated through ammonia-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. This mitochondrial transition {{is a direct result of}} glutamine activity a compound which forms from ammonia in-vivo. Administration of antioxidants or <b>glutaminase</b> inhibitor can reduce this mitochondrial transition, and potentially also astrocyte remodeling.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the prime}} {{candidates}} {{in the treatment of}} debilitating human cancers includes a family of enzymes referred to as L- <b>glutaminases.</b> The antitumor activity of these enzymes found effective in countering Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL a commonly diagnosed pediatric cancer.). Further it is found to inhibit four human tumour cell lines namely Hep-G 2 [Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line], MCF- 7 [Breast cancer cell line], HCT- 116 [Colon cell line] and A 549 [Human lung Carcinoma]. Apart from therapeutic use, it is having a number of other applications like in food industry, analysis and in production of fine chemicals. This review, hence, mainly focuses on the biochemical aspects of L-Glutaminase production, aiming to comprehend the physiochemical characteristics, application of L-Glutaminase and its properties.

40|$|Central {{nitrogen}} metabolism {{contains two}} pathways for glutamate biosynthesis, <b>glutaminases</b> and glutamate synthase (GOGAT), using glutamine {{as the sole}} nitrogen source. GOGAT's importance for cellular metabolism is still unclear. For a further physiological characterisation of the GOGAT function in central nitrogen metabolism, a GOGAT-negative (¿glt 1) mutant strain (VWk 274 LEU+) was studied in glutamine-limited continuous cultures. As reference, we did the same experiments with a wild-type strain (VWk 43). Intracellular and extracellular metabolites were analysed during different steady states in both strains. The redox state of the cell was taken into account and the NAD(H) and NADP(H) concentrations were determined {{as well as the}} reduced and oxidised forms of glutathione (GSH and GSSG, respectively). The results of this study confirm an earlier suggestion, based on a metabolic network model, that GOGAT may be a link between the carbon catabolic reactions (energy production) and nitrogen anabolic reactions (biomass production) by working as a shuttle between cytosol and mitochondria...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{overview of the}} hierarchical network of intracellular processes revolving around central nitrogen metabolism in Escherichia coli. The hierarchy intertwines transport, metabolism, signaling leading to posttranslational modification, and transcription. The protein components of the network include an ammonium transporter (AmtB), a glutamine transporter (GlnHPQ), two ammonium assimilation pathways (glutamine synthetase [GS]-glutamate synthase [glutamine 2 -oxoglutarate amidotransferase {GOGAT}] and glutamate dehydrogenase [GDH]), the two bifunctional enzymes adenylyl transferase/ adenylyl-removing enzyme (ATase) and uridylyl transferase/uridylyl- removing enzyme (UTase), the two trimeric signal transduction proteins (GlnB and GlnK), the two-component regulatory system composed of the histidine protein kinase nitrogen regulator 2 (NRII) and the response nitrogen regulator 1 (NRI), three global transcriptional regulators called nitrogen assimilation control (Nac) protein, leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), and cyclicAMP(cAMP) receptor protein (Crp), the <b>glutaminases,</b> and the nitrogen-phosphotransferase system. First, the structural and molecular knowledge on these proteins is reviewed. Thereafter, {{the activities of the}} components as they engage together in transport, metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription and their regulation are discussed. Next, old and new molecular data and physiological data are put into a common perspective on integral cellular functioning, especially with the aim of resolving counterintuitive or paradoxical processes featured in nitrogen assimilation.

40|$|Multicellular tumour spheroids are an {{important}} model system to investigate the response of tumour cells to radio- and chemotherapy. They share more properties with the original tumor than cells cultured as 2 D monolayers do, which helps distinguish the intrinsic properties of monolayer cells from those induced during cell aggregation in 3 D spheroids. The paper investigates some metabolic aspects of small tumour spheroids of breast cancer and their originating MCF- 7 cells, grown as monolayer, by means of high resolution 1 H NMR spectroscopy and MR microimaging before and after gamma irradiation. The spectra of spheroids were characterized by higher intensity of mobile lipids (ML), mostly neutral lipids, and glutamine (Gln) signals {{with respect to their}} monolayer cells counterpart, mainly owing to the lower oxygen supply in spheroids. Morphological changes of small spheroids after gamma-ray irradiation, such as loss of their regular shape, were observed by MR microimaging. Lipid signal intensity increased after irradiation, as evidenced in both MR localized spectra of the single spheroid and in high-resolution NMR spectra of spheroid suspensions. Furthermore, the intense Gln signal from spectra of irradiated spheroids remained unchanged, while the low Gln signal observed in monolayer cells increased after irradiation. Similar results were observed in cells grown in hypoxic conditions. The different behavior of Gln in 2 D monolayers and in 3 D spheroids supports the hypothesis that a lower oxygen supply induces both an upregulation of glutamine synthetase and a downregulation of <b>glutaminases</b> with the consequent increase in Gln content, as already observed under hypoxic conditions. The data herein indicate that 1 H NMR spectroscopy can be a useful tool for monitoring cell response to different constraints. The use of spheroid suspensions seems to be a feasible alternative to localized spectroscopy since similar effects were found after radiation treatment...|$|R
40|$|Glutamine {{metabolism}} {{is largely}} controlled by two enzyme pathways: 1) Conversion of glutamine to glutamate catalyzed by <b>glutaminases,</b> followed by conversion of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate by a glutamate-linked aminotransferases (or by {{the action of}} glutamate dehydrogenase); and 2) conversion of glutamine to α-ketoglutaramate (KGM) catalyzed by glutamine-utilizing transaminases (aminotransferases), followed by conversion of KGM to α-ketoglutarate {{by the action of}} ω-amidase. The former pathway has been well documented and intensively studied for over 60 years, whereas only recently has research focused on the latter pathway, its importance in homeostasis and the control of anaplerotic metabolites. The glutamine transaminases are of fundamental importance 1) as repair enzymes (salvage of α-keto acids), 2) in nitrogen and sulfur homeostasis (closure of the methionine salvage pathway), 3) in 1 -carbon metabolism, and 4) in metabolism of seleno amino acids. As a result of their broad substrate specificity the two principal mammalian glutamine transaminases (i. e. glutamine transaminases L and K) have also been characterized as kynurenine aminotransferases (KAT I and KAT III, respectively), responsible for the production of neuroactive kynurenate. The glutamine transaminases are also active with a variety of sulfur- and selenium-containing amino acids. Some of the products derived from the transamination of these amino acids may also be neuroactive (e. g. certain sulfur-containing cyclic ketimines) as well as chemopreventive (e. g. the α-keto acids derived from seleno amino acids). Of relevance to human health and disease, the glutamine transaminases may contribute to the bioactivation (toxification) of halogenated alkenes (and possibly other xenobiotic electrophiles), some of which are environmental contaminants. Finally, the role of the glutamine transaminases and ω-amidase in cancer biology has been little studied. However, the "glutamine addiction" of many tumors suggests that the glutamine transaminases together with ω-amidase may have a fundamental and influential role in regulating cancer progression. 18 page(s...|$|R
