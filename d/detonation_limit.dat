40|$|ABSTRACT The present paper {{reports on}} {{experimentally}} obtained results of fast propagating deflagrations, the transition-process from deflagration to detonation, and detonations in hydrogen-air mixtures. These combustion phenomena are investigated {{by means of}} various sophisticated optical and conventional measurement-techniques like the Laser-induced Predissociation Fluorescence, which, in particular, gives a new insight into the understanding of these supersonic combustion-modes. Focus is put on the regime of the lean detonation-limit, depending on both, the mixture-composition and the dimension of the test-facility. For this limit criteria of empirical character have been applied for hydrogen-safety considerations until now. This study reports that a transition into a detonation of a fast-propagating flame is possible for leaner mixture-compositions as they are covered in the empirical criterion down to the theoretical <b>detonation</b> <b>limit</b> of the test-facility. It was observed that a detonation {{is not the most}} dangerous combustion mode. For mixture-combositions bewtween the theoretical and the empirical <b>detonation</b> <b>limit,</b> it is as well possible that the flame propagates as a supersonic deflagration with the same velocity as the leading shock-wave. The peak-pressure of this combustion mode can be more than two-times higher compared to that of a detonation. 1...|$|E

Dixon and Walls [I] and Campbell and Woodhead [2] were probably the first to discover the strong effect of a very small amount of hydrogen on the detonability of CO-O 2 mixtures. They found that the addition ofabout 1 % (by volume) of hydrogen to the otherwise undetonahle CO-O 2 mixture would make it detonablÂ¢.

Between 48 and 80 % of HNO 3 (the <b>detonation</b> <b>limits),</b> {{evidence for the}} formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex between the two molecules at the liquid/solid transition is inferred from our data. HNO 3 / 2 -nitropropane mixture is well known as good energetic material [1, 2]. However, depending on the proportions of the two constituents, the energetic properties of the mixture can change drastically. It can behave either as an explosive or as a propellant. It is therefore very important to know the <b>detonation</b> <b>limits</b> of this mixture. Using shock experiments in a cylinder tube, the detonation celerity of the HNO 3 / 2 -nitropropane mixtures was measured by P. Claude {{as a function of the}} proportion of the constituents [2]. In the same work, the <b>detonation</b> <b>limits</b> of the mixture were also determined. Detonation was found to occur for mixtures containing a mass proportion of nitric acid lying between 50 and 80 %. However, no attempt was made in this work to try to relate the macroscopic properties of the mixture to molecular properties.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. We have constructed a facility {{for the study}} of jet-initiated deflagration and detonation in hydrogen-air-steam mixtures. The facility is built around two pressure vessels. Mixtures of hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen are spark-ignited in the driver vessel, generating a hot mixture of combustion products. The pressure rise ruptures a diaphragm, venting the products into the receiver vessel through nozzles of 12. 7 - 92 mm diameter. The receiver is filled with hydrogen-air and hydrogen-oxygen mixtures diluted with either nitrogen or steam. The deflagration tests studied the lean and maximum-dilution limits of hydrogen-air mixtures ignited by a hydrogen-steam jet. The lean limit of 6 % hydrogen was comparable to other studies. The maximum dilution limit for steam was 60 %. This is higher than the limit found in spark/glow plug ignition experiments. Shock oscillations in the receiver increased with nozzle size. Further tests studied the initiation of detonation in both hydrogen-air and stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen-diluent mixtures. In terms of jet diameter, D, and receiver detonation cell size, [?], we found initiation limits of 2 < D[?] < 7, where other experiments required a D[?] of 11 or more. We propose that the D[?] model does not adequately characterize jet initiation, as it does not reflect the conditions in the driver. The tests indicated that shock focusing plays an important role, promoting strong secondary explosions with or without prompt initiation of detonation. Mixtures with steam dilution were prone to DDT near the <b>detonation</b> <b>limit,</b> as the slower flame speed allows shock reflection and pressurization to occur before the reactants are consumed. Tests with nitrogen dilution had no DDT regime. Because of DDT and shock focusing, peak pressures were highest in mixtures that were slightly less sensitive than the detonation threshold.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the results using the BWR plant {{simulator}} about the plant behavior under the condition of the severe accident that LOCA occurs but ECCS fails the water irrigation into the reactor core. The simulation experiments were carried out for the cases that LOCA has occurred in the main steam piping or in the recirculation piping, respectively. As for the results about the relationship between the LOCA area and the time from LOCA occurs until the fuel temperature rise start, the effect that RCIC operated was extremely big for LOCA area of up to 100 cm 2 for both type LOCA. In the case of main steam system LOCA, the core water level suddenly decreased for large LOCA of 2000 cm 2 area, however, if the irrigation into the reactor core was carried out 30 min after LOCA occurrence, the core had little damage. In addition, the H 2 concentration in the containment vessel did not exceed both limits of H 2 explosion nor detonation. The pressure of the containment vessel was around 3 kg/cm 2 of design value, so the soundness of the containment vessel was confirmed. On the other hand, for the recirculation system LOCA of 2000 cm 2 area, a drop of the core water level was extremely in comparison with main steam system LOCA, and the fuel assemblies were completely exposed during up to 30 min. to the irrigation from approximately 100 sec. after LOCA occurrence. Therefore, the fuel temperature during the irrigation had reached approximately 1900 â. Thus, the fuel cladding were damaged approximately less than 10 %, and H 2 concentration in the containment vessel was approximately 9 % which did not exceed H 2 <b>detonation</b> <b>limit</b> of 13 % but exceeded H 2 explosion limit of 4 %. However, the containment vessel internal pressure was settled around design pressure value of containment vessel.

50|$|The {{reverse flow}} design is {{generally}} considered to be inferior to a crossflow design in terms of ultimate engineering potential for two reasons. Firstly, there is limited space when inlet and exhaust ports are arranged in a line {{on one side of the}} head meaning a reduction in port area compared to a crossflow head. This mainly affects power delivery at high rpm by limiting airflow. Secondly, since inlet and exhaust manifolds are both on the same side of the engine and in close proximity, the inlet manifold and carburetor (if applicable) are heated by the exhaust. This heating reduces the density of the inlet charge and hence the volumetric efficiency of the engine. In a spark-ignition petrol engine the heat also increases the likelihood of pre-ignition or <b>detonation</b> which <b>limits</b> the allowable compression ratio reducing both power and efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of an ideal, air breathing Pulse Detonation Engine {{is described in}} a manner that is useful for application studies (e. g., as a stand-alone, propulsion system, in combined cycles, or in hybrid turbomachinery cycles). It is shown that the Pulse Detonation Engine may be characterized by an averaged total pressure ratio, which is a unique function of the inlet temperature, the fraction of the inlet flow containing a reacting mixture, and the stoichiometry of the mixture. The inlet temperature and stoichiometry (equivalence ratio) may in turn be combined to form a nondimensional heat addition parameter. For each value of this parameter, the average total enthalpy ratio and total pressure ratio across the device are functions of only the reactant fill fraction. Performance over the entire operating envelope can thus be presented on a single plot of total pressure ratio versus total enthalpy ratio for families of the heat addition parameter. Total pressure ratios are derived from thrust calculations obtained from an experimentally validated, reactive Euler code capable of computing complete Pulse <b>Detonation</b> Engine <b>limit</b> cycles.

50|$|The {{design of}} {{gasoline}} engines and the compression ratio impact the maximum possible boost. To obtain more power from higher boost levels and maintain reliability, many engine components {{have to be}} replaced or upgraded from that of naturally aspirated powertrains. Design considerations include the fuel pump, fuel injectors, pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts, valves, head-gasket, and head bolts. The maximum possible boost depends on the fuel's octane rating and the inherent tendency of any particular engine toward detonation. Premium gasoline or racing gasoline can be used to prevent <b>detonation</b> within reasonable <b>limits.</b> Ethanol, methanol, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) allow higher boost than gasoline, because of their higher resistance to autoignition (lower tendency to knock). Diesel engines can also tolerate much higher levels of boost pressure than Otto cycle engines, because only air is being compressed during the compression phase, and fuel is injected later, removing the knocking issue entirely.|$|R

The experiments were carried out for different mixtures of hydrogen, ethylene and propane in air, and also hydrogen-oxygen with argon as diluent. It is reasonable to seek a dependence of detonability limits on the geometry length scale of the system, i. e. the tube diameter d, and on the characteristic of the cell width $ lambda$. A d/$ lambda$ criterion has been proposed to define the limits in circular tubes. However, the present results show that such a correlation is not sufficient. For a ratio $ lambda$/d less than 1, the transition back to detonation occurred relatively easily within the length of the tubes.

40|$|Compressed gas {{cylinders}} contaminated with radionuclides are a unique waste item that {{may become a}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste through two mechanisms: either {{the contents of the}} compressed gas cylinder are regulated under RCRA or the internal pressure of the compressed gas cylinder gives it the characteristic of reactivity. The characteristic of reactivity is defined by RCRA in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 261. 23 (a) (6) as a waste that is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or heated under confinement. In a letter dated September 1, 1989, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste referred the interpretation of the definition of reactivity to the EPA Regional Office and/or the state (if the state has primacy). The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has made the interpretation that to meet the definition of reactive as specified in 40 CFR 261. 23 (a) (6) there must be a chemical reaction that causes the explosion or <b>detonation.</b> This interpretation <b>limits</b> the compressed {{gas cylinders}} that have to be treated as RCRA hazardous waste to those that have other RCRA characteristic codes or contain listed wastes. The difficulty in treating compressed gas cylinders is heightened in the case of radiologically contaminated compressed gas cylinders because the internal pressure and possible hazardous constituents must be treated in most cases before decontamination of the cylinder is possible. Special procedures must be followed to ensure that radiological contamination is not transferred to clean gas cylinders or released into the environment...|$|R
40|$|Detonation {{propagation}} in {{the limit}} of highly spatially discretized energy sources is investigated. The model of this problem begins with a medium consisting of a calorically perfect gas with a prescribed energy release per unit mass. The energy release is collected into sheet-like sources that are now embedded in an inert gas that fills the spaces between them. The release of energy in the first sheet results in a planar blast wave that propagates to the next source, which is triggered after a prescribed delay, generating a new blast, and so forth. The resulting wave dynamics as the front passes through hundreds of such sources is computationally simulated by numerically solving the governing one-dimensional Euler equations in the lab-fixed reference frame. The average wave speed for each simulation is measured once the wave propagation has reached a quasi-periodic solution. Velocities in excess of the CJ speed are found as the sources are made increasingly discrete, with the deviation above CJ being as great as 15 %. The total energy release, delay time, and whether the sources remain lab-fixed or are convected with the flow do not have a significant influence on the deviation of the average wave speed away from CJ. Such continuous waves can also be shown to have a time-averaged structure consistent with the classical ZND structure of a <b>detonation.</b> In the <b>limit</b> of highly discrete sources, temporal averaging of the wave structure shows that the effective sonic surface does not correspond to an equilibrium state. The average state of the flow leaving the wave in this case does eventually reach the equilibrium Hugoniot, but only after the effective sonic surface has been crossed. Thus, the super-CJ waves observed in {{the limit of}} highly discretized sources can be understood as weak detonations due to the non-equilibrium state at the effective sonic surface...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the technology used for {{tools and equipment}} for humanitarian landmine clearance. The main {{focus is on the}} removal of mine and unxeploded ordnance contamination in the poor, heavily mined countries, particularly Afghanistan and Cambodia. Initially, the process of humanitarian demining in these countries was examined and described, and the relevant literature reviewed. Three studies were undertaken with a dual purpose of (a) providing relevant contributions to the science of mine clearance and (b) evaluating some of the methods commonly used in humanitarian demining research. (i) A statistical analysis of the evaluation of mine detection systems in trials was undertaken. This demonstrated that (a) this statistical analysis is straightforward, and (b) feasible sized trials do not yield useful results from analysis of the crude minedetection rate. An enhancement to the evaluation process, "Margin of Detection," was suggested. (ii) Research into improved "prodders" for detecting mines was undertaken with as much consultation with deminers as possible early in the research cycle. "Sensing prodders" were shown to function technically but not to improve the overall demining process. Measurements showed that many deminers prod in hard soils with suÃcient force to detonate some mines; rotary prodders were developed to reduce the force required for excavation, but success in the laboratory could not be duplicated in eld conditions. From this work a potentially useful tool for deminer training was developed, which might reduce the risks of accidental <b>detonation.</b> (iii) The <b>limits</b> of a high-tech detection technique (neutron irradiation and detection of prompt gamma rays) were examined (a) to advance understanding of this method and (b) to demonstrate the feasibility of early evaluation of technologies before extensive research is started. This neutron technology was shown to oer potential benets to military demining, but to be unlikely to have general application when the higher clearance standards and lower equipment budgets of humanitarian demining were applied. The thesis ends with conclusions and suggestions for some further work. Throughout the thesis, the research is focussed on investigating practical problems which deminers have suggested as important constraints on their work...|$|R
