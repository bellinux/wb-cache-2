40|$|In recent years, mobile devices (e. g. cell phones, PDAs, and notebooks) {{have had}} a high {{increase}} in their networking, computational and storage power. The mobile nature of these devices causes {{a new set of}} problems not seen in conventional wired networks. Mobile devices can go off-line, experience network outages, have batteries with limited power-life, and require energy efficient components. As users start moving their application to these devices, it becomes to have a middleware infrastructure that should integrate the different data held by mobiles users. Unfortunately, existing middleware technologies are ill-equipped to overcome these new set of problems since they are designed for application that reside in workstations and mainframes. To address these issues, we are developing NetTraveler, a database middleware system to integrate mobile devices reliably in a computer network. In this thesis, we present the Registration Server for NetTraveler. Registration Servers are <b>directory</b> <b>managers,</b> located at cooperative local area networks (LANs) that work together to keep track of moving data sources and route query request as appropriate. ii RESUME...|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} map depicting Roselle Field was the December 10, 1964 Chicago Sectional Chart. According the Illinois Airport <b>Directory,</b> the <b>manager</b> was Richard Leach, {{and there}} was Beechcraft sales/service on the field. Roselle Field was annexed into the Village of Schaumburg. The runway was 2,500 ft long and 50 ft wide at the time. In 1965, the runway was extended to 3,100 ft. On February 6, 1970, President Richard M. Nixon flew to Roselle Field to dedicate a water treatment plant {{at the corner of}} Barrington and Irving Park Road in neighboring Hanover Park. In the early 1970s, the name was changed to Schaumburg Airpark. The Fixed-Base Operator (FBO) changed to Northwest Flyers in 1985, who continues to operate as the FBO today.|$|R

50|$|In 1905 the {{property}} was transferred to Eliza Wrench, wife of Robert Wrench who is listed in the Post Office <b>Directory</b> as <b>manager</b> of Childers Cash Butchery, although a 1907 photograph of the shop shows {{the name of the}} proprietors as Wrench and Thompson. Wrench had been a butcher in Childers since 1896, though by 1907 he was also acting as an insurance agent and may have run the New Zealand Insurance agency in the timber building. He eventually worked only as an insurance and commission agent and valuer. The land was divided into two and that with the butcher shop complex was sold in 1911 to Hermann Lassig, also a butcher. His change to the signage of the building consisted simply of substituting his name for that of Wrench & Thompson and removing the New Zealand Insurance hoarding. The front of the shop in this and the earlier photograph show an open front to the shop. It is not known when the closed and tiled shopfront was installed.|$|R

The Register of the Queensland Parliament, 1860-1927 states that Francis Gregory, the owner of Harlaxton House, resigned as Mining Commissioner for Stanthorpe in November 1872 to take over the administration of the estate of his late friend William Beit, and the family moved to Westbrook. Gregory appears in the Post Office <b>Directories</b> as Station <b>Manager,</b> Westbrook, Toowoomba by 1874. By 1876, however, he is not listed as such. The Toowoomba Chronicle, on 30 November 1875, reported a court case between Sarah Beit, as plaintiff and a number of defendants including, Henry Beit (William Beit's brother) and Francis Thomas Gregory (as Trustees) as the defendants.|$|R
50|$|Analyst {{performance}} is ranked by {{a range of}} services such as StarMine owned by Thomson Reuters, Institutional Investor magazine, or TipRanks.In particular the Institutional Investor categorizes by many subdivisions including leading analysts, global rankings, and leading executives. Analyst accuracy has been measured as well in studies involving forecast information. Generally analyst forecast is measured by absolute forecast error. Generally absolute forecast error and overall accuracy is smallest when institutional investors are present. This also applies to future performance because when analysts have reasonably small forecast errors they will tend to have smaller forecast errors in their future predictions as well. It has been proven that higher analyst ranking and reputation leads to more trading volume and when analysts are accurate in predictions they are end up with reputations {{at the end of}} the set period being measured by the ranking system. In addition to the above, Analyst Performance is housed in Financial/Nelson Information <b>Directory</b> of Fund <b>Managers.</b> This is a bit different, as it contains information on fund structure, investment style, performance, as well as the decision making process behind the investment choices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} model for caching {{database}} data in mobile ad-hoc networks through caching the queries and their responses. The approach makes {{a distinction between the}} queries and their responses and caches them on separate mobile nodes. This method is driven by the fact that queries do not become invalid unless when the design of the database entities changes while data changes depending on the application that feeds information into the database. The architecture we use is hierarchical and employs three types of designated nodes: a Query <b>Directory</b> (QD), Service <b>Manager</b> (SM), and Caching Node (CN). The one or more QDs are responsible for caching the queries and are assigned and supervised by the SM that also oversees the mobility activities and the availability of nodes in the network and makes “managerial ” decisions accordingly, including appointing backup nodes. With this model, any node that joins the ad hoc network will either contribute services to other nodes (willingness to become an SM, a QD, or a CN) or consume services offered by other nodes. This model attempts to coordinate the query executing and query caching mechanisms in a seamless manner while maintaining minimal communication among nodes. We present preliminary results of a model that was simulated using the NS- 2 software and show the viability of the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{scientific}} community many high performance applications are used in order to run experiments on data sets. These data sets can be very large in size or in number. Both of these situations can cause problems to the centralized manager scheduling the system. In our approach we minimize {{the role of the}} manager by using a distributed hash table. This way all files have a given “home ” location to be at {{if they are going to}} be used which reduces location maintenance. We further reduce the strain on the central manager by using a counter-based bloomfilter. This allows the central manager to quickly and easily see if a given data set exists in the system without having to use the large storage space of a database. By adding false positive detection in the form of locality checks to the bloomfilter, we can reduce the probability of a false positive causing a problem in our system. In this fashion we can move away from a centralized manager to a more distributed one while reducing the amount of additional metadata the manager needs to maintain. With our approach we show that the workload of the centralized <b>manager</b> <b>directory</b> has been reduced significantly. Not only are we capable of reducing the number of files that must be migrated into the system by up to nearly 90 % compared to a centralized storage-aware scheduling but it is also possible to achieve greater hit rates than a standard cache if job placement is influenced by data location. We also show that a significant number of false positives can be detected from the bloomfilter (at least 25 %) at the cost of allowing smaller false negative instances to occur at an increased rate.
