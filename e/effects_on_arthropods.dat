40|$|In {{food web}} studies, taxonomically {{unrelated}} predators are often grouped into trophic levels {{regardless of their}} relative importance on prey assemblages, multiple predator effects, or interactions such as omnivory. Ants and birds are important predators likely to differentially shape arthropod assemblages, but no studies have compared their effects on a shared prey base. In two separate studies, we excluded birds and ants from branches of a canopy tree (Inga micheliana) in a coffee farm in Mexico for 2  months in the dry and wet seasons of 2002. We investigated changes in arthropod densities with and without predation pressure from (1) birds and (2) ant assemblages dominated by one of two ant species (Azteca instabilis and Camponotus senex). We first analyzed individual effects of each predator (birds, Azteca instabilis, and C. senex) then used a per day effect metric to compare differences in effects across (birds vs ants) and within predator taxa (the two ant species). Individually, birds reduced densities of total and large arthropods and some arthropod orders (e. g., spiders, beetles, roaches) in both seasons. Azteca instabilis did not significantly affect arthropods (total, small, large or specific orders). Camponotus senex, however, tended to remove arthropods (total, small), especially in the dry season, and affected arthropod densities of some orders both positively and negatively. Predators greatly differed in their effects on Inga arthropods (for all, small, large, and individual orders of arthropods) both in sign (±) and magnitudes of effects. Birds had stronger negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> than ants and the two dominant ant species had stronger <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> in different seasons. Our results show that aggregating taxonomically related and unrelated predators into trophic levels without prior experimental data quantifying the sign and strengths of effects {{may lead to a}} misrepresentation of food web interactions. ...|$|E
40|$|Arthropods within soil, litter, and coarse woody debris play vital {{roles in}} {{maintaining}} soil fertility, health, and productivity in eastern Oregon and Washington, USA. Arthropods shred plant material, help mineralize nutrients for plants, act as predators, and serve as food for other wildlife. Some species or groups of species are potentially valuable for monitoring forest health. Natural and human-caused disturbance may immediately kill many arthropods, but changes to habitat structure are likely to cause longer-term effects on their community compositions. Fire <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> may be minimized if refugia of litter and coarse woody debris are retained. Possible effects of timber harvesting on arthropods include mechanical effects on soil and litter, microclimate changes, {{and the addition of}} organic matter to the forest floor. Soil compaction reduces pore size, which may result in loss of habitat and decreased nutrient retention, and changes the microbial and nematode communities, which can affect nutrient cycling and food resources for microarthropods. Thresholds required for healthy ecosystem function, and predictive and decision-support tools that include these components in relation to disturbances are not available.

40|$|Using two genetic {{approaches}} and seven different plant systems, we present findings from a meta-analysis examining {{the strength of}} the effects of plant genetic introgression and genotypic diversity across individual, community and ecosystem levels with the goal of synthesizing the patterns to date. We found that (i) the strength of plant genetic effects can be quite high; however, the overall strength of genetic effects on most response variables declined as the levels of organization increased. (ii) Plant genetic effects varied such that introgression had a greater impact on individual phenotypes than extended <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> or microbes/fungi. By contrast, the greatest effects of genotypic diversity were on arthropods. (iii) Plant genetic effects were greater on above-ground versus below-ground processes, but {{there was no difference between}} terrestrial and aquatic environments. (iv) The strength of the effects of intraspecific genotypic diversity tended to be weaker than interspecific genetic introgression. (v) Although genetic effects generally decline across levels of organization, in some cases they do not, suggesting that specific organisms and/or processes may respond more than others to underlying genetic variation. Because patterns in the overall impacts of introgression and genotypic diversity were generally consistent across diverse study systems and consistent with theoretical expectations, these results provide generality for understanding the extended consequences of plant genetic variation across levels of organization, with evolutionary implications...|$|E
40|$|Microorganisms {{have many}} roles in nature. They may act as {{decomposers}} that obtain nutrients from dead materials, while some are pathogens that cause diseases in animals, insects, and plants. Some are symbionts that enhance plant growth, such as arbuscular mycorrhizae and nitrogen fixation bacteria. However, roles of plant pathogens and diseases in natural ecosystems are still poorly understood. Thus, {{the current study}} addressed this deficiency by investigating possible roles of plant diseases in natural ecosystems, particularly, their positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> diversity. In this study, the model system was the oak tree (Quercus spp.) and the canker disease caused by Annulohypoxylon truncatum, and its <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> diversity. The oak tree site contained 44 oak trees; 31 had canker disease symptoms while 13 were disease-free. A total of 370 individual arthropods were detected at the site during the survey period. The arthropods belonged to 25 species, 17 families, and seven orders. Interestingly, the cankered trees had significantly higher biodiversity and richness compared with the canker-free trees. This study clearly demonstrated that arthropod diversity {{was supported by the}} oak tree canker disease...|$|R

After four weeks we sampled arthropod abundance with pitfall traps. The abundance of arthropods was compared using two-way MANOVA (treatments=salamanders and season), followed by univariate tests for each taxon.

40|$|Riparian {{areas in}} the {{southwest}} United States have been invaded by the invasive shrub Tamarix ramosissima, which has displaced native vegetation, created monotypic stands, and reduced biodiversity, amongst other things. The <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the <b>arthropod</b> community however is still unclear, with many different studies showing either little effect or a lessened abundance and diversity. Our study sought {{to determine the effect}} of Tamarix compared to two different native counter-part habitats; a willow (Salix exigua) habitat, and a shrub (Atriplex canescens, Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Guitierrezia spp., and Forestiera pubescens) habitat. 30, 913 arthropods were organized into over 300 different taxa in 7 different 48 hour pit trapping sample periods, with 3 habitat types, each with 3 replicate sites. We found that Tamarix had no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> abundance. Shrub had a higher shannon-wiener diversity index, but Tamarix and willow habitats did not significantly differ. Functional feeding groups (predator, herbivore, omnivore, and detritivore) did differ significantly between habitat types at different dates in the season. Also a NMS ordination showed that all three habitat types represent unique arthropod communities, with different taxa making up the abundance in each. Our overall conclusion is thus; Tamarix does not decrease arthropod abundance or diversity, but does form its’ own unique community of arthropods different from native counter-part habitats...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} maize tolerant to broad-spectrum herbicides may greatly alter weed flora composition, {{abundance and}} therefore affect organisms of higher trophic levels, including herbivore and detritivore arthropods and their natural enemies. This three-year study measured the <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> of an intensive use of broad-spectrum herbicides {{in comparison with}} one application of conventional pre-emergence herbicide. Numbers of arthropods were measured by three techniques: visual counts on plants, catches in pitfall and yellow sticky traps. Weed density was much higher in conventional treatment in the first year, showed {{significant difference in the}} second year, but {{was no significant difference in}} the third year. Counts of arthropod taxa were significantly different only in the first year in the two kinds of weed management systems. In visual counts Cicadellidae and Aphididae among herbivores, the two main generalist predators, Orius spp. and Araneae, and the family Coccinellidae were more abundant on plants treated twice with glyphosate. In pitfall there were higher records in glyphosate-treated plots for Myriapoda but the opposite was seen for Carabidae counts. The yellow sticky traps catches were higher in the glyphosate-treated plots for Cicadellidae and Mymaridae, and lower for Thysanoptera. Most of the significant differences found between herbicide regimes disappeared when abundances of weeds (monocotyledons and dicotyledons) were introduced into the analysis as covariates; this finding signals weed abundance as the main cause of arthropod abundance alteration. However, only a drastic alteration of weed abundance causes significant changes in arthropod densities...|$|E
40|$|Global {{change is}} {{predicted}} to cause non-random species loss in plant communities, with consequences for ecosystem functioning. However, beyond the simple effects of plant species richness, {{little is known about}} how plant diversity and its loss influence higher trophic levels, which are crucial to the functioning of many species-rich ecosystems. We analyzed to what extent woody plant phylogenetic diversity and species richness contribute to explaining the biomass and abundance of herbivorous and predatory arthropods in a species-rich forest in subtropical China. The biomass and abundance of leaf-chewing herbivores, and the biomass dispersion of herbivores within plots, increased with woody plant phylogenetic diversity. Woody plant species richness had much weaker <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods,</b> but interacted with plant phylogenetic diversity to negatively affect the ratio of predator to herbivore biomass. Overall, our results point to a strong bottom-up control of functionally important herbivores mediated particularly by plant phylogenetic diversity, but do not support the general expectation that top-down predator effects increase with plant diversity. The observed effects appear to be driven primarily by increasing resource diversity rather than diversity-dependent primary productivity, as the latter did not affect arthropods. The strong effects of plant phylogenetic diversity and the overall weaker effects of plant species richness show that the diversity-dependence of ecosystem processes and interactions across trophic levels can depend fundamentally on non-random species associations. This has important implications for the regulation of ecosystem functions via trophic interaction pathways and for the way species loss may impact these pathways in species-rich forests...|$|E
40|$|Arthropods are {{the most}} diverse and {{abundant}} group of animals found in tropical lowland forests, and in light of ongoing global change phenomena, {{it is essential to}} better understand their responses to anthropogenic disturbances. Here we present a review of arthropod responses to forest deforestation and fragmentation based on studies conducted at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP), located in central Amazonia. These studies involved a wide range of arthropod groups. All but one of the studies evaluated changes in total species number or species density in relation to fragment size, (i. e. area effects), and one-third also evaluated edge effects. Our review indicates that almost every arthropod group studied showed some kind of response to reduction in forest area, including altered abundances, species richness or composition in comparisons of different-sized fragments, fragmented and non-fragmented areas, or comparisons of forest edges and forest interiors. These responses tended to be idiosyncratic, with some groups showing predicted declines in abundance or diversity in the fragments while others show no response or even increases. However, some of the observed <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods,</b> or on the ecological processes in which they are involved, were transient. The most likely explanation for this was the rapid development of secondary growth around fragments, which greatly increased the connectivity between fragments and the remaining forest. Although the BDFFP has provided many insights regarding the effects of forest fragmentation on arthropod assemblages, many diverse groups, such as canopy arthropods, have received scant attention. For those that have been studied, much remains to be learned regarding the long-term dynamics of these assemblages and how landscape context influences local biodiversity. The BDFFP remains an exceptional site in which to investigate how the ecological interactions in which arthropods are engaged are altered in fragmented landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Biological Sciences, 2006 Determining {{the factors}} that shape {{arthropod}} communities {{has a long history}} in ecology. I examined the direct and indirect effects of nitrogen availability on plant productivity and plant community composition to assess their <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> community structure in an old-field ecosystem. I sampled arthropods across the entire plant community, as well as on individual dominant plant species over two years. Both the addition and reduction of plant-available nitrogen had deleterious <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> richness and abundance. The negative effect of nitrogen was indirect: an increase in nitrogen increased early season cover of Bromus sp., which altered the microenvironment and reduced the availability of host plant diversity later in the season. Arthropod richness and abundance were not influenced by plant productivity or richness with or without the influence of nitrogen. Instead, particular plant species were better predictors of the arthropod community, although the pattern was complex and changed within and between years. Among the three dominant plant species, Verbesina occidentalis hosted fewer arthropods than V. virginica or Solidago canadensis in 2005. In both years V. virginica hosted more arthropod species than S. canadensis or V. occidentalis. At a broader scale, arthropod abundance in nitrogen plots decreased in 2004 but these relationships were only significant in mid-summer. These temporal changes in the arthropod community may be explained by changes in susceptibility of plants to herbivores, which in turn depends on leaf texture and trichome density. My results suggest that the overall attributes of a plant community are poor predictors of arthropod community structure. Instead, the direct and indirect <b>effects</b> of nitrogen <b>on</b> Bromus sp., and also the persistence of particular plant species throughout the summer, shape arthropod community structure in this old-field ecosystem.

(Eds.), Crianlarich: Scottish Agricultural College. 1 - 5 Livestock production extends to most non-forested, marginal, upland habitats of Britain. Of these, indigenous grasslands are stocked predominantly by sheep, stocking densities having increased in Scotland by 25 % between 1975 and 1990. Conversely, the national herd of cattle in Scotland declined by 22 % over the same period. The effects of grazing management on arthropod distribution and abundance is reviewed, with particular emphasis {{on the results of}} grazing experiments that have investigated the <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> of varied livestock species and stocking rates. Arthropods contribute the most species of any taxa in the uplands and are critical in upland food chains. The direction and magnitude of the response of different arthropod taxa to grazing management reflects their trophic level, life history, size and mobility, e. g., 30 % of ground and rove beetle species are more sensitive to landform than grazing management. For the arthropod taxa that are sensitive to grazing management, the effects are generally indirect, via changes in the heterogeneity of botanical composition and vegetation structure. A mosaic of contrasting botanical composition and structural heterogeneity is essential to conserve and enhance arthropod and broader wildlife diversity in the uplands. However, the landscape-scale study of mammalian herbivore-vegetation-arthropod interactions is required both to quantify the relative importance of land use (grazing management) and landform (landscape physiognomy) across the uplands and to determine the optimal grain-size of the habitat mosaic to sustain biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{urbanisation}} {{increases the}} pressure on urban nature. Urban woodlands are receiving growing attention as they provide valuable ecosystem services to urban citizens, mainly by providing areas for recreation but also through improving air quality and reducing noise. There is an increasing demand for knowledge of how urban woodlands should be managed to combine several functions, such as recreational values and biodiversity conservation. There are, however, few field experiments that evaluate the effects of forest management. The work in this thesis {{is based on the}} results of large-scale, replicated field experiments in urban woodlands in southern Sweden. Management by clearance of woody understory (bushes and small trees) was conducted at five sites in oakdominated forest stands on the fringe of three midsize cities. Two different types of clearance were applied: 90 % removal of understory and 50 % removal in regular 50 x 50 meter patches. Control plots of equal size were left unmanaged. Bird communities were surveyed before and after management, and the impact of bird predation on arthropods in bush and tree canopies were evaluated with exclosure experiments. Bird communities were affected by understory clearance and a decrease in bird abundance was observed in the stands with 90 % removal of understory. Patchy clearance had no negative effects on bird abundance. Bird predation had strong <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropods</b> in the understory, which suggests that an important food resource for birds is removed when the understory is cleared. Arthropods were affected by bird predation in the tree canopies too, but the effects of bird predation were weaker in the managed areas, which further stresses the negative impact on birds by extensive clearance of understory. The recreational values in relation to understory density were evaluated in a photo survey where pictures from the managed areas were shown to panels of students. Open forests were considered most attractive for recreation but 75 % of the respondents claimed that they preferred a mix of open and closed forest. In a field study, the participants used cameras to take photos of liked and disliked places along a forest trail in an urban forest. The analysis of photo contents showed that both open and dense forest landscapes were appreciated while visible human impact was usually perceived negatively. Implications for management are that clearance of understory can enhance recreational values but should be conducted in a small scale pattern to promote visual variation and minimise the negative effects on birds. Visible impact from recreational facilities and forest management should be minimised as far as possible. Openness is often affected by management and was found to be useful as a key-variable to analyse management trade-offs between social and ecological values...|$|E

We have compared the abundance, biomass, diversity and specific composition of arthropod communities in grazed and ungrazed plots experimentally excluded from ungulates. In general, we found that arthropods were more abundant and diverse in grazed than in ungrazed plots. However, the effect of ungulates depended on the variable considered (diversity versus abundance versus biomass). Moreover, ungulates also affected species composition. This means that without affecting diversity, ungulates can still have a strong <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> communities by changing species composition. Also, the relationship between ungulates and <b>arthropods</b> differed depending <b>on</b> the year of study and the sampling period. In conclusion, our study indicates that to extrapolate the results obtained {{for a group of}} insects, a habitat or a sampling period is not appropriate for the conservation of arthropod communities...|$|R

Pirimicarb effects were marginal, primarily on aphids and their antagonists, with no <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> the Collembola community. Collembola-predator ratios were significantly higher following cypermethrin treatment, suggesting that cypermethrin-induced increases in collembolan abundance represent a classical resurgence.

In general, the plants species in the conservation strips supported a greater abundance of predators, parasitoids and alternative prey than turf. Conservation strips also resulted in a greater abundance of natural enemies and alternative prey in the fairway adjacent to the conservation strips versus fairways without conservation strips. Predation on cutworm larvae in fairways was significantly more frequent when conservation strips were present.

In a lysimeter facility (totally 18 3 -m 2 -plots), we experimentally tested the effects of long-term past vs. prognosticated future rainfall variations (15 % increased rainfall per event, 25 % more dry days) according to regionalized climate change models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) <b>on</b> aboveground <b>arthropods</b> in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivated at three different soil types (calcaric phaeozem, calcic chernozem and gleyic phaeozem).

Aboveground arthropods were assessed by suction sampling, their mean abundances (± SD) differed between April, May and June with 20 ± 3 m- 2, 90 ± 35 m- 2 and 289 ± 93 individuals m- 2, respectively. Averaged across sampling dates, future rainfall reduced the abundance of spiders (Araneae, - 47 %), cicadas and leafhoppers (Auchenorrhyncha, - 39 %), beetles (Coleoptera, - 52 %), ground beetles (Carabidae, - 41 %), leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae, - 64 %), spring tails (Collembola, - 58 %), flies (Diptera, - 73 %) and lacewings (Neuroptera, - 73 %) but increased the abundance of snails (Gastropoda, + 69 %). Across sampling dates, soil types had no <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> abundances. Arthropod diversity was neither affected by rainfall nor soil types.

Exclosure resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of herbivorous and predatory arthropods. Total arthropods (with and without ants), spiders, adult Coleoptera, and larval Lepidoptera were significantly more abundant on meshed than unmeshed saplings. All size-classes of arthropods, taxa grouped, were more abundant on meshed than unmeshed saplings, but with no evidence of a disproportionate increase of the largest <b>arthropods</b> <b>on</b> meshed saplings. All size-classes of spiders increased in abundance on saplings from which birds were excluded. There were significant differences in the total abundance of arthropods (with and without ants), spiders (Araneae), sucking bugs (Homoptera), adult beetles (Coleoptera), larval moths (Lepidoptera), and wasps and ants (Hymenoptera) for both unmeshed and meshed saplings between sample periods. These seasonal patterns of abundance and differences between sample periods appeared to be determined by seasonal weather patterns, with the lowest numbers associated with drier and hotter conditions in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. The conclusion reached is that eucalypt forest birds have limited <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> temporal variation in canopy arthropod abundances, but depress abundances, and affect the size and trophic composition of the fauna.

Pesticides/insecticides had a significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> non-targeted <b>arthropods</b> order- Collembola, Arachinida/Opiliones, Hymenoptera and Thysonoptera were suppressed after pesticides/insecticides spraying.

In conclusion, organic farming does not significantly affected the beneficial-non targeted arthropods biodiversity, whereas preventive insecticide application in conventional fields had significant negative <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> beneficial non targeted arthropods.

Organic agriculture can increase arthropod diversity but the response of pests and their natural enemies is variable.

In this study, meta-analysis and vote-counting techniques were used to compare farming system (organic and conventional) and fertiliser <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> pests and their natural enemies. The meta-analyses indicated that pests generally benefitted from organic techniques, this is particularly evident when experiments were carried out on a smaller scale. Pest responses to organic and conventional fertiliser types were divergent, plant composts benefitted pest arthropods while the opposite was true for manures, this has implications for pest management. Most natural enemy groups responded positively to organic farming although this was not true for Coleopterans. Experimental scale had a prominent impact on natural enemy responses with farm scale studies showing particularly positive effects of organic agriculture on natural enemies. This suggests that it is large scale features of organic agriculture such as landscape heterogeneity that are beneficial to natural enemies. Natural enemy responses to organic fertilisers were positive indicating that field scale management practices including fertiliser can also be important in pest management. ...|$|R

The aboveground neighbor <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> abundance <b>on</b> the focal plant were strongly negative. However, the magnitude of the <b>effect</b> depended <b>on</b> the identity of the neighboring species, and herbivore abundance on the focal plant was higher when surrounded by conspecific than by heterospecific plants. We also observed interactions between above- and belowground neighbor effects, indicating that these effects may be non-additive. We conclude that above- and belowground associational effects are not equally strong, and that neighbor <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> plant-arthropod interactions occur predominantly aboveground.

40|$|Application of {{processed}} kaolin particle film repels insects without lethal effects; hence side <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> beneficial <b>arthropods</b> are low. Processed kaolin may be {{an alternative}} to broad-spectrum insecticides used against European pear sucker, Cacopsylla pyri (L.), in organic and conventional pear production. Trials showed that the processed kaolin showed a very high efficacy, and the population of C. pyri was kept under a damaging level over the whole season. In conclusion, kaolin shows promise as an alternative control for C. pyri in organic and orchards of Integreted Pest Management. ...|$|R
40|$|In Germany plant {{protection}} products are evaluated and labeled during the approval process according to their <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> beneficial <b>arthropods.</b> Products are labelled for each individual species of beneficial arthropod relevant to the treated crop. Labelling is based on one or more studies with the beneficial arthropod species in question. Lethal and sublethal effects like mortality, rates of parasitism or feeding, fertility and behavioural disorders are evaluated. Based on lethal and sublethal effects determined, products are classified as not harmful, slightly harmful or harmful to the beneficial arthropod species in question...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVertical {{transmission}} mode {{is predicted to}} decrease the virulence of symbionts. However, Wolbachia, a widespread vertically transmitted endosymbiont, exhibits both negative and beneficial <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> fitness. This 'Jekyll and Hyde' behaviour, {{as well as its}} ability to live transiently outside host cells and to establish new infections via horizontal transmission, may reflect the capacity of Wolbachia to exhibit various phenotypes depending on the prevailing environmental constraints. To study the ability of Wolbachia to readily cope with new constraints, we forced this endosymbiont to spread only via horizontal transmission. To achieve this, we performed serial horizontal transfers of haemolymph from Wolbachia-infected to naive individuals of the isopod Armadillidium vulgare. Across passages, we observed phenotypic changes in the symbiotic relationship: (i) The Wolbachia titre increased in both haemolymph and nerve cord but remained stable in ovaries; (ii) Wolbachia infection was benign {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, but highly virulent, killing most hosts after only a few passages. Such a phenotypic shift after recurrent horizontal passages demonstrates that Wolbachia can rapidly change its virulence when facing new environmental constraints. We thoroughly discuss the potential mechanism(s) underlying this phenotypic change, which are likely to be crucial for the ongoing radiation of Wolbachia in arthropods...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{pest control}} with mass-produced {{arthropod}} natural enemies is well developed in greenhouse crops and has often {{resulted in the}} evolution of complex ecosystems with persistent populations of multiple arthropod natural enemy species. However, there are cases where arthropod natural enemies are either not effective enough, not available, or their use is rather costly. For these reasons, biological control based on microorganisms, also referred to as ‘microbials’, represents a complementary strategy for further development. Although commercially available microbials have been around for quite some time, research on and the applied use of combinations of arthropod natural enemies and microbials have remained relatively under explored. Here, we review current uses of entomopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses, and their possible direct and indirect <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> natural enemies in European greenhouses. We discuss how microbials might be combined with arthropod natural enemies in the light of new methodologies and technologies such as conservation biological control, greenhouse climate management, and formulation and delivery. Furthermore, we explore the possibilities of using other microorganisms for biological control, such as endophytes, and the need to understand the effect of insect-associated microorganisms, or symbionts, on the success of biological control. Finally, we suggest future research directions to optimize the combined use of microbials and arthropod natural enemies in greenhouse production. </p...|$|R
50|$|In {{forensic}} entomology, entomotoxicology is {{the analysis}} of toxins in arthropods (mainly flies and beetles) that feed <b>on</b> carrion. Using <b>arthropods</b> in a corpse or at a crime scene, investigators can determine whether toxins were present in a body {{at the time of}} death. This technique is a major advance in forensics; previously, such determinations were impossible in the case of severely decomposed bodies devoid of intoxicated tissue and bodily fluids. Ongoing research into the <b>effects</b> of toxins <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> development has also allowed better estimations of postmortem intervals.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to richness and H’, the <b>effects</b> of fire <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> pattern diversity (Magurran 1988), {{sometimes referred to}} as “community heterogeneity” (Collins 1992), was examined. Arthropod community heterogeneity was defined as the mean pairwise dissimilarity between trapping points in an experimental unit and was calculated using the methods of Bray and Curtis (1957) and Faith et al. (1987). Mean heterogeneities of the treatments were calculated from the average heterogeneity values of the experimental units and were evaluated with ANOVA.|$|R
40|$|Increases in {{nutrient}} availability and alterations to mammalian herbivore communities are {{a hallmark of}} the Anthropocene, with consequences for the primary producer communities in many ecosystems. While progress has advanced understanding of plant community responses to these perturbations, the consequences for energy flow to higher trophic levels in the form of secondary production are less well understood. We quantified arthropod biomass after manipulating soil {{nutrient availability}} and wild mammalian herbivory, using identical methods across 13 temperate grasslands. Of experimental increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, only treatments including nitrogen resulted in significantly increased arthropod biomass. Wild mammalian herbivore removal had a marginal, negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> biomass, with no interaction with nutrient availability. Path analysis including all sites implicated nutrient content of the primary producers as a driver of increased arthropod mean size, which we confirmed using 10 sites for which we had foliar nutrient data. Plant biomass and physical structure mediated the increase in arthropod abundance, while the nitrogen treatments accounted for additional variation not explained by our measured plant variables. The mean size of arthropod individuals was 2. 5 times more influential on the plot-level total arthropod biomass than was the number of individuals. The eutrophication of grasslands through human activity, especially nitrogen deposition, thus may contribute to higher production of arthropod consumers through increases in nutrient availability across trophic levels...|$|R
40|$|Tropical {{forest loss}} and {{transformation}} to agroecosystems have serious impacts on biodiversity, associated ecosystem {{services and the}} livelihood of local people. The high crop plant biodiversity and low intensity management in many homegardens could {{play an important role}} in the preservation of biodiversity in modified landscapes, as well as sustain food security of low income households. In this study, we focused on the role of the owner’s cultural background as migrants (from the island of Java) or non-migrants (local residents) for homegarden characteristics, such as size, management diversification, and crop species richness, and their <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> communities in Jambi province, Indonesia. Vane traps, pitfall traps and sweep netting were used to survey the arthropod communities, in particular bees and wasps, in 24 homegardens. Our results show that the native Jambi locals used a smaller number of management practices and had smaller homegardens than the Javanese transmigrants, whereas crop species richness did not differ. Management diversification and crop species richness were positively related to arthropod abundance as well as species richness of bees and wasps, presumably due to the enhanced homegarden heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that the cultural practices of migrant versus non-migrant land-use managers, which is usually neglected in agroecology, can be a major determinant of management practices shaping community structure and services of beneficial arthropods...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that insecticidal transgenic crops can indirectly cause detrimental <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>arthropod</b> predators or parasitoids when they prey on or parasitize sublethally affected herbivores. Our studies revealed that Chrysoperla carnea is negatively affected when fed Bt-susceptible but not Cry 1 Ac-resistant Helicoverpa armigera larvae that had fed Bt-transgenic cotton expressing Cry 1 Ac. This {{despite the fact}} that the predators ingested 3. 5 times more Cry 1 Ac when consuming the resistant caterpillars. In order to detect potential differences in the nutrient composition of prey larvae, we evaluated the glycogen and lipid content plus the sugar and free amino acid content and composition of caterpillars fed non-Bt and Bt cotton. The only change in susceptible H. armigera larvae attributable to Bt cotton feeding were changes in sugar concentration and composition. In case of the Cry 1 Ac-resistant H. armigera strain, feeding on Bt cotton resulted in a reduced glycogen content in the caterpillars. The predators, however, appeared to compensate for the reduced carbohydrate content of the prey by increasing biomass uptake which caused an excess intake of the other analyzed nutritional compounds. Our study clearly proves that nutritional prey-quality factors other then the Bt protein underlie the observed negative effects when C. carnea larvae are fed with Bt cotton-fed prey. Possible factors were an altered sugar composition or fitness costs associated with the excess intake of other nutrients...|$|R
