No conclusive evidence has demonstrated {{that any of these}} techniques are more effective than the others, and no method has shown to improve chest tube drainage. Furthermore, chest tube manipulation has proved to increase negative pressure, which may be detrimental, and painful to the patient.

5000|$|Having {{struvite}} {{scale in}} a {{wastewater treatment system}} can lead to great inefficiency within the plant or operation <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>clogging</b> of the pipes, pumps and equipment. There {{have been a few}} options to solve this issue. Replacing the pipes, using a hydro-jetter or a mechanical grinder, but many lines can be underground and have to consider the great amount of downtime and labor. Chemical cleaning is now predominately used to clear systems of struvite. Chemical cleaning products have been developed to remove and prevent struvite with minimal downtime. Even a chemical-free, electric method of removing and preventing struvite has been developed and tested successfully at wastewater treatment plants in the USA. The electronic sine wave it produces is sent through the water in the pipe and is therefore effective on underground piping as well.|$|E

40|$|Elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) and hydrophobins (HFBI) are fusion tags which {{enhance the}} {{accumulation}} levels of recombinant proteins in plants and {{aid in the}} non-chromatographic purification of these proteins.

In this study, transient expression of intein-GFP fused to ELP or HFBI in Nicotiana benthamiana yielded the full size fusion protein. The ELP-fused proteins were successfully purified using inverse transition cycling (ITC) with 1. 0 M NH 4 (SO 4) 2 at room temperature. However, the purification using membrane ITC was unsuccessful <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>clogged</b> membrane pores. Purification of HFBI-fused proteins through aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) using Triton X- 114 was also unsuccessful. The proteins did not separate into the correct phase for recovery.

5000|$|Whirlpool tubs {{first became}} popular in America during the 1960s and 1970s. A spa is also called a [...] "jacuzzi" [...] in USA since the word became a generic after {{plumbing}} component manufacturer Jacuzzi introduced the [...] "spa whirlpool" [...] in 1968. Air bubbles may be {{introduced into the}} nozzles via an air-bleed venturi pump that combines cooler air with the incoming heated water to cool the pool if the temperature rises uncomfortably high. Some spas have {{a constant stream of}} bubbles fed via the seating area of the pool, or a footwell area. This is more common as a temperature control device where the heated water comes from a natural (uncontrolled heat) geothermal source, rather than artificially heated. Water temperature is usually very warm to hot — 38 to 42 C, so bathers usually stay in for only 20 to 30 minutes. Bromine or mineral sanitizers are often recommended as sanitizers for spas because chlorine dissipates at a high temperature thereby heightening its strong chemical smell. Ozone is an effective bactericide and is commonly included in the circulation system with cartridge filtration, but not with sand media filtration <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>clogging</b> problems with turbid body fats.|$|E

30|$|The major {{advantages}} {{of this technique}} are its simplicity and its fabrication of well-defined 3 D scaffolds {{in a variety of}} patterns and {{with a wide range of}} thicknesses. It can produce structures with the highest lateral resolution of 5 – 10  μm. The operating system at low temperature also allows for the incorporation of proteins and other biomolecules, which can build favourable microenvironments for tissue regeneration. The limitations of this technique are the low vertical dimension, the inability to incorporate even small particles, and the limited usage for low-concentrated solutions.

40|$|Determining {{particulate}} emission from mechanically ventilated confined animal feeding buildings is a challenging undertaking. This is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the relatively large particle sizes involved, wide size range and difficulties in {{measurement of the}} ventilation rate of the building. This study seeks {{to address these issues}} by looking at the three critical measurements used in determining {{particulate emission}}s: total suspended particulates (TSP), particle size and ventilation rate. A new TSP sampling system was developed and tested in a controlled environment. This system appeared to perform as expected based on existing literature. It was fairly easy to use and its low cost suggests that further study is warranted. Measurement of particle size for agricultural particles is difficult since most of the instrumentation is designed for laboratory work or for particles smaller than those encountered in these settings. Several instruments were used to measure particle sizes. As expected many of the samplers designed for ambient sampling failed <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>clogged</b> nozzles or overloaded impactors. The final results focused on three instruments: the TSI APS, TSI Aerosizer DSP and the Coulter Multisizer.
