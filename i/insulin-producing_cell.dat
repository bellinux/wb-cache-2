Here we describe a novel reproducible protocol to establish homogeneous and scalable <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cell</b> lines from mouse (m) ESCs via differentiation of the previously described lineage-restricted clonal mESC-derived E-RoSH cells. Unlike their parental mESCs, E-RoSH cells expressed high levels of mesodermal and endodermal genes.

Limiting dilution of these cultures resulted in the isolation of eight independent <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cell</b> lines in five experiments. All these lines were cloned and shown to be amenable to repeated cycles of freeze and thaw and to replicate for months with a doubling time of 3 – 4 days.

In this study we explored the effect of selective extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins on the potential of <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cell</b> differen-tiation using ARIP cells, an adult rat pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line, as a model in vitro. Quantitative single cell morphology analysis indicated that all the four ECM proteins we have used (type I collagen, laminin, fibronectin and vitronectin) increased the single cell area and diameter of ARIP cells. In addition, se-rum-free cell cultivation was dependent on cell density and particular components; and serum could be replaced when systematic optimisa-tion could be performed. Surface treated with laminin was shown to be able to enhance overall cell expansion in the presence of de-fined serum-free medium conditions.

Here we have developed a new optimized four-stage differentiation protocol and compared this with an established reference protocol. The new protocol minimized differentiation towards neuronal progeny, resulting in a population of <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> with ß-cell characteristics but lacking neuronal features. The yield of glucagon and somatostatin cells was negligible. Crucial for this improved yield was the removal of a nestin selection step as well as removal of culture supplements that promote differentiation towards the neuronal lineage. Supplementation of the differentiation medium with insulin and fetal calf serum was beneficial for differentiation towards monohor-monal insulin-positive cells. After implantation into diabetic mice these <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> produced a time-dependent improvement of the diabetic metabolic state, in contrast to cells differentiated according to the reference protocol.

40|$|<b>Insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> are transplanted by {{portal vein}} {{injection}} {{as an alternative}} to pancreas transplantation in both clinical and preclinical trials. Two of the main limitations of portal vein transplantation are the prompt activation of the innate immunity and concomitant loss of islets and a small but significant risk of portal vein thrombosis. Furthermore, to mimic physiological release, the <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> should instead be located in the pancreas. The trans-vessel wall approach is an endovascular method for penetrating the vessel wall from the inside.

40|$|Background/Aims: Elevated {{levels of}} non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) are under {{suspicion}} to mediate β-cell dysfunction and β-cell loss in type 2 diabetes, a {{phenomenon known as}} lipotoxicity.

Experimental evidence suggests that oxidative stress mediates lipotoxicity and {{there is evidence that}} the subcellular site of ROS formation is the peroxisome. However, the interaction between unsaturated and saturated NEFAs in this process is unclear. Methods: Toxicity of rat <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> after NEFA incubation was measured by MTT and caspase assays. NEFA induced H 2 O 2 formation was quantified by organelle specific expression of the H 2 O 2 specific fluorescence sensor protein HyPer. Results: The saturated NEFA palmitic acid had a significant toxic effect on the viability of rat <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells.</b> Unsaturated NEFAs with carbon chain lengths > 14 showed, irrespective of the number of double bonds, a pronounced protection against palmitic acid induced toxicity.

Dexamethasone is a synthetic diabetogenic glucocorticoid, which impairs pancreatic beta cell function. Therefore we investigated the toxicity of dexamethasone in RINm 5 F <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> and its dependence on the expression level of the antioxidant enzyme catalase, which inactivates hydrogen peroxide. This was correlated with oxidative stress and cell death. An increased generation of ROS was observed in dexamethasone-treated cells together with an increase in caspase- 3 activity and apoptosis rate. Interestingly, exposure to dexamethasone increased the cytosolic superoxide dismutase Cu/ZnSOD protein expression and activity, whereas the mitochondrial MnSOD isoform was not affected by the glucocorticoid. Catalase overexpression in <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> prevented all the cytotoxic effects of dexamethasone. In conclusion, dexamethasone-induced <b>cell</b> death in <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> is ROS mediated.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Embryonic stem cells, when {{grown as}} embryoid bodies, spontaneously {{generate}} <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> {{which could be}} used in therapy of diabetes mellitus, provided that their selection and differentiation are optimized. To achieve such optimization, one needs to know whether the differentiation of cells in embryoid bodies mimicks that of pancreatic beta cells in embryos. To address this question we verified if the differentiation of the <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> in embryoid bodies requires Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor- 6 (HNF- 6), a transcription factor known to control pancreatic endocrine differentiation in embryos. METHODS: We generated mouse Hnf 6 -/- embryonic stem cells and grew them as embryoid bodies. The expression of HNF- 6, insulin, and transcription factors that are regulated by HNF- 6 in developing pancreas was compared in wild-type and Hnf 6 -/- embryoid bodies. RESULTS: No difference was observed in the expression of insulin between wild-type and Hnf 6 -/-embryoid bodies. In both cases insulin was expressed in the outer layer of cells, which is similar to the visceral endoderm. In wild-type embryoid bodies HNF- 6 was transiently expressed in the outer layer of cells, but was not co-expressed with insulin. The expression of genes that are targets of HNF- 6 in developing pancreas was unaffected in Hnf 6 -/-embryoid bodies.

With the aim of developing a nonintegrative reprogramming strategy for derivation of <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells,</b> here, we evaluated a new approach utilizing synthetic messenger RNAs encoding reprogramming transcription factors. Administration of synthetic mRNAs encoding three key transcription regulators of β-cell differentiation'Pdx 1, Neurogenin 3, and MafA'efficiently reprogrammed the pancreatic exocrine <b>cells</b> into <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition to the insulin genes expression, the synthetic mRNAs also induced the expressions of genes important for proper pancreatic β-cell function, including Sur 1, Kir 6. 2, Pcsk 1, and Pcsk 2. Pretreating cells with the chromatin-modifying agent 5 -Aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine further enhanced reprogramming efficiency, increasing the proportion of <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells</b> from 3. 5 [*]±[*] 0. 9 to 14. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 9 % (n = 4). Moreover, 5 -Aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine pretreatment enabled the reprogrammed cells to respond to glucose challenge with increased insulin secretion. In conclusion, our results support that the reprogramming of pancreatic exocrine <b>cells</b> into <b>insulin-producing</b> <b>cells,</b> induced by synthetic mRNAs encoding pancreatic transcription factors, represents a promising approach for cell-based diabetes therapy...|$|R
