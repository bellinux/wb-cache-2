5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> or three weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{plutonium}} for the fissile {{component of the}} bomb meant that Penney's HER team at Fort Halstead had to design an implosion-type nuclear weapon. The Los Alamos Laboratory had solved the problem of doing this with explosive lenses. The involvement of several British scientists gave HER a solid base of experience to work from. The British design would hew {{to that of the}} American Fat Man as closely as possible. An important change would be the substitution of RDX, an ARD product, for Composition B as the fast explosive component of the lenses; Baratol would still provide the slow component. This was handled by the explosives experts at Woolwich, who devised the machining processes and produced prototypes of the lenses and moulds. Production was then handled by two Royal Ordnance Factories. The first lenses were delivered in 1952, and there were <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> sets for the Operation Hurricane assemblies. Woolwich provided the supercharge, the spherical shell of explosive that encases the tamper. Test firings of explosive lenses were conducted at Foulness by a team under the direction of Roy Pilgrim. To achieve near-simultaneous detonations of the lenses, the Americans had developed the exploding-bridgewire detonator; this had to be duplicated. Ernest Mott and Cecil Bean developed them, while Challens devised the firing circuits.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{determined that}} it did not need to go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra and preferred Hancock's original choice of the TFX as a long-term solution, leading to the Menzies government's announcement on 24 October that it was ordering 24 F-111s for US$125 million, <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> squadrons. The announcement came during the campaigning for the 1963 general election. Calwell's Labor party had on 22 October reiterated its pre-campaign promise that it would replace the Canberras as soon as it formed a government. The government's announcement, and the consequent improvement of its chances against Labor, likely also benefited the United States; the purchase helped rebut American critics of the TFX, and the Kennedy administration preferred Menzies' defence policies to the opposition's. The contract was signed the following year through the U.S. Department of Defense. The British government's cancellation of the TSR-2 in April 1965 showed that Australia's decision to not order it was correct.|$|E

25|$|Two-wheeled and four-wheeled chariots (singular carbad) {{were used}} in Ireland from ancient times, both in private life and in war.

The wheels were spoked, shod all round with iron, and were from three to {{four and a half}} feet high. Chariots were generally drawn by horses or oxen, with horse-drawn chariots being more common among chiefs and military men. War chariots furnished with scythes and spikes, like those of the ancient Gauls and Britons, are mentioned in literature.|$|E

25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today.

It fits over the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the roof rack) as a sort of foyer or vestibule.

25|$|According {{to another}} story, during a great famine that Myra {{experienced}} in 311–312, a ship {{was in the}} port at anchor, loaded with wheat for the Emperor in Constantinople. Nicholas invited the sailors to unload {{a part of the}} wheat to help in the time of need. The sailors at first disliked the request, because the wheat had to be weighed accurately and delivered to the Emperor. Only when Nicholas promised them that they would not suffer any loss for their consideration, the sailors agreed. When they arrived later in the capital, they made a surprising find: the weight of the load had not changed, although the wheat removed in Myra was <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> full years and could even be used for sowing.|$|E
25|$|When {{river flow}} wasn't quite <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> turbines, {{operation}} was cycled between running one and both turbines, {{based on a}} daily reservoir draw-down and refill cycle. The cycling was timed to meet peak electrical demands. That is, both turbines operated during hours of high electrical demand and the reservoir was drawn down. A single turbine operated during low electrical demand hours while the reservoir refilled. A similar cycle was used when inflow was less than enough for a single turbine. A weekly cycle was superimposed on the daily cycle that tended to draw down the reservoir during the week and allowed it refill during the weekend. In these cases, known as load factoring, the plant operated as a peaking plant. This mode of operation was greatly reduced through the 1980s and 1990s to appease lakefront cabin owners.|$|E

25|$|In later years, when wood {{freight cars}} {{had long been}} forgotten, helpers and pushers remained, {{although}} {{in the form of}} much larger, heavier, more powerful locomotives assisting far heavier trains. The BR operated two 700 series of Mallets: the comparatively light 700 through 741 and the heavier 742 through 754. Since they differed in frame design, this meant that the weaker 8th century were never doubled together. Instead, a light 700 would be coupled ahead of the heavier one for a double. When two 700 series Mallets were pushing, the same constraint was applied. If the run utilized two light Mallets, then the second one was placed at the rear, ahead of the caboose, and pushed. One more issue with doubled Mallets was whether or not all the bridges on the run were strong <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> of the 9th century or the heavy 8th century running together.|$|E
25|$|The Bideford District Association of the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (as it {{was then}} known) {{introduced}} a lifeboat service in February 1825. The boat was kept in the King's Watch House at Appledore. In 1831 the work {{was taken over by}} the Devon Humane Society and they built a new boat house at Watertown, half a mile nearer the sea. This was large <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>two</b> boats and a second one arrived in December that year but in 1848 was transferred to a second boat house at Braunton Burrows {{on the opposite side of}} the estuary. It was easier to launch from here to help ships on that side of the water but crews for lifeboats at Braunton Burrows always came from Appledore. A third station was built at Northam Burrows to the west of Appledore in 1851. This was expanded to house a second boat in 1856 and the old boat house at Watertown eventually lost its boats.|$|E
