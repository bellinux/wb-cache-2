Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed {{responses}} from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>every</b> cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{persistence}} and attempts at marketing, Evans's designs were finally given a trial on larger scales and adopted elsewhere. A breakthrough came in 1789 when the Ellicotts, a progressively minded Quaker family in Baltimore, invited Evans to refit their mills on the Patapsco River. The refits proved a success, and Evans worked with Jonathan Ellicott {{to develop a}} modified form of Archimedean screw that could act as a horizontal conveyor to work alongside the vertically orientated bucket elevators. He added a rake-drill and conveyor belt to his designs, and now possessed {{a full complement of}} materials handling machines for <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>every</b> possible configuration. In 1790, Evans moved from Newport to Wilmington and constructed a working model of his designs in the town. Evans's inventions were given a major boost when leading miller Joseph Tatnall converted his mills to the Evans system, and estimated that in one year the changes saved his operation a small fortune amounting to $37,000. Local millers quickly followed suit, and Brandywine Village was soon a showcase for Evans's milling technology. After almost a decade, the Brandywine millers were finally convinced, and within a short period automated mills began to spread across the eastern seaboard. In 1790, upon introduction of federal patent law, Evans immediately applied for protection for his milling designs and was granted the third US patent, with his application personally examined and approved by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of War Henry Knox, and Attorney-General Edmund Randolph.|$|E

This paper suggests that the principles of “inclusion, ” via which traditionally-labeled “handicapped ” and “gifted” learners are “mainstreamed ” into the general student population, when applied with the appropriate utilization of educational technology, might present solutions to such dilemmas. At certain points the discussion within converges and even intersects with the concepts of “sheltered instruction, ” but these connections will need to be addressed in a subsequent work. Please note that educational technology alone is not being touted as the answer, but rather a combination of computers and the “user-centric (if not-specific) learning environments ” they create and maintain. The business/technology teaching principles described herein should generally apply equally to English “per se ” classes.
