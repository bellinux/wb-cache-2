40|$|Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a {{respiratory}} disease {{caused by a}} zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) named SARS-CoV (SCoV), which rapidly swept the globe after its emergence in rural China during late 2002. The origins of SCoV have been mysterious and controversial, until the recent discovery of SARS-like CoV (SLCoV) in bats and the proposal of bats as the natural reservior of the Coronaviridae family. In this article, we focused on discussing how phylogenetics contributed to our understanding towards the emergence and transmission of SCoV. We first reviewed the epidemiology of SCoV from a phylogenetic perspective and discussed the controversies over its phylogenetic origins. Then, we summarized the phylogenetic findings in relation to its zoonotic origins and the proposed <b>inter-species</b> viral <b>transmission</b> events.

40|$|Evidence of <b>inter-species</b> {{pathogen}} <b>transmission</b> from {{managed to}} wild bees has sparked concern that emerging diseases could be causing or exacerbating wild bee declines. While some pathogens, like RNA viruses, {{have been found}} in pollen and wild bees, the threat these viruses pose to wild bees is largely unknown. Here, we tested 169 bees, representing 4 families and 8 genera, for five common honey bee (Apis mellifera) viruses, finding that more than 80 % of wild bees harbored at least one virus. We also quantified virus titers in these bees, providing, for the first time, an assessment of viral load in a broad spectrum of wild bees. Although virus detection was very common, virus levels in the wild bees were minimal-similar to or lower than foraging honey bees and substantially lower than honey bees collected from hives. Furthermore, when we experimentally inoculated adults of two different bee species (Megachile rotundata and Colletes inaequalis) with a mixture of common viruses that is lethal to honey bees, we saw no effect on short term survival. Overall, we found that honey bee RNA viruses can be commonly detected at low levels in many wild bee species, but we found no evidence that these pathogens cause elevated short-term mortality effects. However, more work on these viruses is greatly needed to assess effects on additional bee species and life stages...|$|R
40|$|Bats {{and birds}} {{are known to}} be the {{reservoirs}} of a number of zoonotic diseases. The capacity of flight and the diversity of these animals may make them special in maintaining and disseminating diverse viruses leading to instances of emerging zoonoses. In particular bats are increasingly recognized to be reservoirs {{of a wide range of}} viruses, including Nipah, Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. In most instances these viruses appear to establish long-term persistence in bats. In this thesis I report the identification of novel astroviruses from different insectivorous species of apparently healthy bats sampled in Hong Kong and in 11 provinces of Mainland China with high positive rates. Astroviruses are important causes of diarrhea in many animal species, including humans. This study revealed a remarkably high genetic diversity of bat astroviruses, which form novel distinct phylogenetic groups in the genus Mamastrovirus. Evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for bats astroviruses has been found. The finding of diverse astroviruses in Miniopterus bats captured within a single cave habitat in Hong Kong illustrates a very unusual virus host relationship between astroviruses and these bats. Surveillance of astroviruses in rodents, the only mammal with species numbers surpassing that of bats, has revealed a novel astrovirus in only 1. 6 % of the faecal samples of urban brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in Hong Kong in marked contrast with the prevalence and diversity of astroviruses in bats. Rat astrovirus was phylogenetically related to human astroviruses MLB 1 which was detected from clinical samples from diarrhoeal patients in Hong Kong in this study. The unusually high positive rates of astroviruses in bats have been again highlighted. Avastroviruses were detected in 7. 1 % of the aquatic wild bird samples. Avastrovirus have also been detected in doves in Hong Kong, pond herons and a less whistling duck in Cambodia. A phylogenetic analysis of these novel astroviruses together with other previously known astroviruses revealed that avastrovirus can be divided into 3 monophyletic groups. On the other hand, avian coronaviruses was detected in 12. 5 % of the aquatic wild bird samples. Phylogenetic analysis of these avian coronaviruses has led us to suggest taxonomic separation of these viruses into two groups as gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses. Frequent interspecies transmissions of gammacoronaviruses between duck species were demonstrated. Analysis of the avian viral sequences and host mitochondrial DNA sequences suggested that some coronaviruses may have coevolved with birds from the same order. With the discoveries of coronaviruses and astroviruses in mammalian and birds, we now have a better understanding on the diversity and ecology of these two virus families in wildlife. These findings provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of these viruses in nature and have revealed possible <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmissions</b> of these viruses. The role of bats as a reservoir of viruses with potential to pose zoonotic threats to human health was also reinforced. Studies of the virus ecology in wildlife as demonstrated in this thesis will help formulating better strategies for controlling emerging diseases in the future. published_or_final_versionMicrobiologyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Intra-species transmission is the norm and has the potential for substantial morbidity and mortality, but <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> of influenza A viruses may occur with outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infections and no intra-species spread to severe illness that spreads widely among the new host species. Pandemics are global epidemics among humans caused by the transmission of novel influenza A viruses generated via <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission.</b> For an influenza A virus to cause a pandemic, the virus must cause human illness, the population must have little or no protective immunity against the virus, and the virus must spread easily from person to person. The most infamous of pandemics was the 1918 - 1919 Spanish Flu pandemic, which resulted in more than 20 million deaths worldwide and a large increase in the U.

40|$|Background Until recently, Klebsiella pneumoniae {{carbapenemase}} (KPC) -producing Enterobacteriaceae {{were rarely}} identified in Australia. Following {{an increase in}} the number of incident cases across the state of Victoria, we undertook a real-time combined genomic and epidemiological investigation. The scope of this study included identifying risk factors and routes of transmission, and investigating the utility of genomics to enhance traditional field epidemiology for informing management of established widespread outbreaks. Methods All KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates referred to the state reference laboratory from 2012 onwards were included. Whole-genome sequencing was performed in parallel with a detailed descriptive epidemiological investigation of each case, using Illumina sequencing on each isolate. This was complemented with PacBio long-read sequencing on selected isolates to establish high-quality reference sequences and interrogate characteristics of KPC-encoding plasmids. Results Initial investigations indicated that the outbreak was widespread, with 86 KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates (K. pneumoniae 92 %) identified from 35 different locations across metropolitan and rural Victoria between 2012 and 2015. Initial combined analyses of the epidemiological and genomic data resolved the outbreak into distinct nosocomial transmission networks, and identified healthcare facilities at the epicentre of KPC transmission. New cases were assigned to transmission networks in real-time, allowing focussed infection control efforts. PacBio sequencing confirmed a secondary transmission network arising from <b>inter-species</b> plasmid <b>transmission.</b> Insights from Bayesian transmission inference and analyses of within-host diversity informed the development of state-wide public health and infection control guidelines, including interventions such as an intensive approach to screening contacts following new case detection to minimise unrecognised colonisation. Conclusion A real-time combined epidemiological and genomic investigation proved critical to identifying and defining multiple transmission networks of KPC Enterobacteriaceae, while data from either investigation alone were inconclusive. The investigation was fundamental to informing infection control measures in real-time and the development of state-wide public health guidelines on carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae surveillance and management...|$|R

Understanding their inter-species contact {{structure}} {{is important for}} assessing therisk of pathogen transmission between them. These spatio-temporal patterns of interac-tions are shaped, in part, by range management and environmental factors affecting elkdistribution. In this study, resource selection modeling was used to identify factors influ-encing elk presence on cattle pasture and elk selection of foraging patches; furthermore,consequences for <b>inter-species</b> disease <b>transmission</b> were discussed. Data on pasture management practices and observations of elk were collected from 15 ranchers during interviews. Pasture use by elk was defined based on telemetry data (fromGPS collars deployed on 168 elk in 7 herds) and rancher observations. At the patch scale,foraging patches used by elk were identified by spatio-temporal cluster analysis of teleme-try data, whereas available patches were randomly generated outside the area delimitedby used patches. For pastures and patches, landscape and human-managed features werecharacterized using remote sensing data and interviews, respectively. Attributes of avail-able and used pastures (or patches) were compared using resource selection functions, onannual and seasonal (or annual and monthly) time scales. Additionally, intensity of pastureuse was modeled using negative binomial regression. Cultivated hay land and mineral supplements were associated with elk presence on cat-tle pastures, whereas pastures with manure fertilization and higher traffic-weighted roaddensities {{were less likely to}} be used by elk. The effects of landscape (elevation, aspect, wateraccess) and vegetation (forest cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) characteris-tics on patch selection were consistent with typical elk habitat requirements. The presenceof cattle and the traffic-weighted road density were negatively associated with patch selec-tion. The apparent avoidance of cattle by elk reduced the risk of direct transmission ofpathogens, except during winter months. However, human-managed features attractingelk to cattle pastures (e. g. hay land and mineral supplements) may increase inter-speciespathogen transmission through indirect contacts...|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{epidemiological}} studies have linked many cryptic human rabies {{cases in the}} United States with expo-sure to rabies virus (RV) variants associated with insectivorous bats. In Colorado, bats accounted for 98 % of all reported animal rabies cases between 1977 and 1996. The genetic divergence of RV was investigated in bat and terrestrial animal specimens that were submitted for rabies diagnosis to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE), Colorado, USA. RV isolates from animal specimens across the United States were {{also included in the}} analysis. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences, which revealed seven principal clades. RV associated with the colonial big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, an bats of the genus Myotis were found to segregate into two distinct clades (I and IV). Clade I was harbored by E. fus-cus and Myotis species, but was also identified in terrestrial animals such as domestic cats and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Clade IV was divided into subclades IVA, IVB, and IVC; IVA was identified in E. fuscus, and Myotis species bats, and also in a fox; subclades IVB and IVC circulated predominantly in E. fuscus. Clade II was formed by big free-tailed bat (Nyctinomops macrotis) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) samples. Clade III included RVs that are maintained by generally solitary, migratory bats such as the silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and bats of the genus Lasiurus. Big brown bats were found to harbor this RV variant. None of the Colorado specimens segregated with clades V and VII that harbor RVs associated with terrestrial animals. Dif-ferent species of bats had the same RV variant, indicating active <b>inter-species</b> rabies <b>transmission.</b> In Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats, and the identification of bat RVs in cat, gray fox Urocyon cinereoargen-teus), and striped skunks demonstrated the importance of rabies spillover from bats to domestic and terrestrial wildlife species.

40|$|Tesis Doctoral inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 11 - 01 - 2008 Barriers {{limiting}} prion transmission {{between two}} species are not absolutely defined. In one way, {{it is known}} that intra-species prion transmission is a highly efficient process, affecting 100 % individual with relative sort survival times, while inter-species prion transmission is a low efficient process accompanied with extended incubation periods. Moreover, it is demonstrated that <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> can give rise to the emergency of new characteristics in the generated prions. With regard to BSE, natural and experimental <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> to sheep and goat had been described, including genotypes traditionally considered as resistant, besides the subsequent intra-species transmission of the ovine BSE generated in sheep. As <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> can alter the biochemical and biological properties of prions the possibility of having circulating BSE in other species than cattle constitutes an animal and human health risk. In this work, we have deeply evaluated the changes in the BSE prion properties when transmitted to sheep. For that purpose, we performed a comparative study of the biochemical, biological and neuropathological properties of BSE before (cattle-BSE) and after propagation in sheep (sheep-BSE). For the biological characterization of these two prions we used transgenic mouse models expressing either bovine PrP (boPrP-Tg 110) or porcine PrP (poPrP-Tg 001). Results show that the BSE prion after crossing through the ovine species barriers maintains most of its biochemical and neuropathological characteristics which are different from Sheep-Scrapie prions. However, the comparative analysis of cattle-BSE and sheep-BSE prion transmission in the transgenic mice models showed an alteration in the biological characteristics of BSE after propagation in sheep. This alteration constitutes an increased virulence of the sheep-BSE prion in both transgenic models when compared to the original cattle-BSE prion. The high infectivity of sheep-BSE in the porcine transgenic model and the absence of many data about porcine species susceptibility to scrapie prions justified the study of the transmissibility of a panel of different Sheep-Scrapie strains into the poPrPTg 001 mice. Results show the inability of different classical scrapie isolates to infect the porcine model suggesting a high transmission barrier, if not total, to those ovine prion strains in pig. Meanwhile, the porcine model shows a high susceptibility to sheep- BSE prions and moderated to the atypical scrapie Sc- 152 (Nor 98 like) which reveal the risk of porcine species to ovine prion infection and its implication in animal and human health. In another hand, this results show the first <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> for an atypical scrapie prion. Finally, we try to overcome the practical handicaps of animal experimentation in this work by establishing neurosphere cultures from two lines of wild type mice (129 /ola and FVB), one line of mice over-expessing murine PrP (Tga 20) and mice knocked out for the Prnp gene (KO). Murine neurospheres inoculated during their differentiation have result susceptible to prion infection with the two murine strains tested. Independently of the line of mice origin of the neurospheres, those cells propagate the inoculated prions at detectable levels. Those results allow us to consider neurospheres inoculated during differentiation as a valuable model for prion replication and propagation...|$|E

40|$|There are {{currently}} 16 identified H subtypes of influenza A; all 16 {{are known to}} infect avian species. In 2006 a novel influenza subtype (H 2 N 3) was identified in a swine herd in Missouri. The hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes {{were found to be}} avian in origin, raising concern regarding the potential for <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> of avian viruses to swine and humans. In early 2007, H 2 N 3 influenza virus was isolated from a duck and a chicken from two separate backyard poultry flocks in Ohio. The nearly coincidental isolation of the same subtype in unnatural hosts in the Midwest United States raised the question about the origin of the viruses and the potential for these viruses to adapt to a new host and easily spread to nearby flocks or herds. Therefore, the viruses were further characterized by DNA sequencing and in vivo chicken pathogenicity testing. The virus sequences were compared to those from the 2006 swine isolates. In addition, the avian viruses were tested for cross-reactivity by virus neutralization (VN) and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) using a panel of H 2 reference sera including serum from the Missouri swine virus. Serologic survey on swine herds and poultry flocks in Ohio for H 2 virus infection was also conducted to assess virus spreading. Sequence comparisons for the H and N genes demonstrated that the avian viruses were similar, but not identical, to the swine viruses. Accordingly, the avian and swine isolates were also antigenically related as determined by HI and VN assays, suggesting that both avian and swine viruses originated from the same group of H 2 N 3 avian influenza viruses. Although serological surveys using the HI assay on poultry flocks and swine herds in Ohio did not reveal further spreading of H 2 virus from the index flocks, continuous surveillance will be necessary. Contemporary H 2 N 3 avian influenza viruses appear to be easily adaptable to poultry and swine, raising concern regarding the potential for <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> of H 2 N 3 avian virus to humans...|$|E

The purpose of this study was to genetically characterize a collection of S. aureus isolates (bovine = 146, human = 12) recovered from cases of bovine mastitis and nasal swabs of close human contacts in the dairy environment. Isolates were screened for a combination of clinically significant antimicrobial and virulence gene markers whilst the molecular epidemiology of these isolates and possible <b>inter-species</b> host <b>transmission</b> was investigated using a combination of genotyping techniques. None of the isolates under evaluation tested positive for methicillin or vancomycin resistance encoding genes. Twenty seven percent of the bovine S. aureus isolates tested positive for one or more of the pyrogenic toxin superantigen (PTSAg) genes with the sec and sell genes predominating. Comparatively, 83 % of the human S. aureus isolates tested positive for one or more PTSAg genes with a greater variety of genes being detected. Genomic DNA macrorestriction followed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of the bovine isolates generated 58 electrophoretic patterns including: ST 8 (CC 8), ST 97 (CC 97), ST 351 (CC 705), ST 352 (CC 97), ST 508 (CC 45), ST 2992 (CC 97) and a novel sequence type, ST 3538 (CC 97). Based on PFGE analysis, greater genetic diversity was observed among the human S. aureus isolates. Bovine and human isolates from three sampling sites clustered together and were genotypically indistinguishable. Two of the isolates, ST 97 and ST 352 belong to the common bovine lineage CC 97, and their isolation from close human contacts suggests zoonotic transfer. In the context of this study, the third isolate, ST 8 (CC 8), is believed to be a human clone which has transferred to a dairy cow and has subsequently caused mastitis. The detection of indistinguishable S. aureus isolates from bovine and human hosts at three of the sampling sites is suggestive of bacterial transmission and supports the need for vigilant monitoring of staphylococcal populations at the human-animal interface. which grouped into 10 pulsotypes at an 80 % similarity level.

40|$|The {{risk for}} a {{pathogen}} to cross the species barrier depends on the rate of efficient contacts between the species. However, contact rates between species have rarely been estimated from observations. Here we estimate contact rates and exposure of chamois Rupicapra rupicapra and Alpine ibex Capra ibex exposed to domestic pasteurellosis and brucellosis carried by sheep or cattle herds summering in mountain pastures. We use field observation data on animal positions treated in a geographic information system (GIS). Comparing 10 pastures, we show that the management of domestic herds influences the risk of <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission.</b> Exposure to direct transmission of pasteurellosis is high when herds are not guarded nor enclosed, whereas exposure to indirect transmission of brucellosis is increased on epidemiological dangerous points such as salt deposits. Our preliminary results need further investigation, but they underline the importance of both herd management and pathogen transmission mode when {{the aim is to}} reduce the risk of contamination of wild populations by a pathogen associated with domestic pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Spermatogonia, or {{spermatogonial}} {{stem cells}} are necessary to maintain male fertility. In the complex process of ongoing spermatogenesis in the testes these pluripotent stem cells proliferate and differentiate into sperm cells. In 1994 the first spermatogonial transplantation technique was described in rodents to allow the study of male germ cells. The following series of studies of intra- and <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> of testicular tissue revealed the regenerative capacity of transplanted spermatogonial stem cells and their possible usage. Recently, spermatogonia transplantation systems are developed in many vertebrates {{making it possible to}} study the development of sperm as well as artificial production of male and female gametes derived from germ cell donors. The differentiation potential of spermatogonial stem cells enabled the creation of transgenic organisms by genetic manipulation of isolated spermatogonia and subsequent transplantation into a suitable recipient. Spermatogonial transplantation in the future may find their application in regenerative medicine, the treatment of disorders of spermatogenesis, or serve to preservation of genetic stock of endangered species...|$|E
40|$|Serotype G 6 and G 8 rotaviruses {{are rarely}} found in man {{and may have}} {{originated}} in animals. Human serotype G 6 and G 8 rotaviruses, isolated from hospitalised children at various locations in Australia, were characterised. Deduced amino acid sequences of the major neutralising antigen, V 7, showed significant identity to the cognate proteins of prototype human and bovine G 6 and G 8 viruses, respectively, and the strains reacted with G 6 and G 8 serotype-specific neutralising monoclonal antibodies, respectively, in an enzyme immunoassay. The VP 4 type was determined as P[14] for all strains tested. Phylogenetic analysis {{of these and other}} human and bovine VP 7 sequences suggested that a single <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> event, possibly from cattle, may have led to the emergence of G 6 viruses in man. In contrast, the exchange of genes between human and bovine G 8 viruses may have occurred on more than one occasion, or these genes may have originated in a different host...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{shifts in}} the {{predominant}} strains and the periodic emergence of new strains are epidemiological features of human rotaviruses. After the sporadic detection in two samples in 1998, G 3 P[8] strains reemerged as the predominant rotavirus during 2008 - 2009 in Argentina. Notably, in 2011 6. 3 % (37 / 587) of samples presented the G 3 P[6] genotypes, which coincided with the recent detection of G 3 P[6] and G 2 P[6] strains in South America and Europe. Analyses of the 11 gene segments of four G 3 P[8] and two G 3 P[6] strains revealed that G 3 P[8] strains detected a decade apart (1998 and 2009) presented minor differences, while the G 3 P[6] strains presented a complete different genomic constellation albeit showing a similar VP 7 gene. This study provides insights in the dynamics and evolution {{of one of the}} genotypes with the wider range of hosts and <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> potential...|$|E
40|$|Infection of {{domestic}} cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes progressive immunological deterioration {{similar to that}} caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Lentiviruses related to but phylogenetically distinct from FIV have been detected in several non-domestic feline species. Serological cross-reactivity of these viruses raises {{the question as to}} whether <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> may occur. To address this issue, we asked whether lion lentivirus (FIV-Ple) or two strains of puma lentivirus (FIV-Pco) could replicate or cause disease in domestic cats. We found that domestic cats inoculated with FIV-Ple developed persistent cell-associated viraemia, transient cell-free viraemia and antiviral antibody. Clinical disease was not detected throughout a 6 month observation period. Two of four cats inoculated with FIV-Pco developed cell-associated viraemia, seroconverted and exhibited transient lymphadenopathy. No changes in white blood cell parameters or other haematological abnormalities were detected in any of the infected cats. Virus-specific RNA was detected in cocultivated lymphocytes of all infected cats by RT– PCR. These findings reveal that non-domestic cat lentiviruses are infectious for domestic cats and can establish persistent infection in the absence of disease...|$|E
40|$|The receptor-binding {{specificity}} of influenza A viruses {{is a major}} determinant for the host tropism of the virus, which enables <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission.</b> In 2013, the first human case of infection with avian influenza A (H 6 N 1) virus was reported in Taiwan. To gather evidence concerning the epidemic potential of H 6 subtype viruses, we performed comprehensive analysis of receptor-binding proper-ties of Taiwan-isolated H 6 HAs from 1972 to 2013. We propose that the receptor-binding properties of Taiwan-isolated H 6 HAs have undergone three major stages: initially avian receptor-binding pref-erence, secondarily obtaining human receptor-binding capacity, and recently human receptor-binding preference, which has been confirmed by receptor-binding assessment of three representative virus isolates. Mutagenesis work revealed that E 190 V and G 228 S substitutions are important to acquire the human receptor-binding capacity, and the P 186 L substitution could reduce the binding to avian receptor. Further structural analysis revealed how the P 186 L substitution in the receptor-binding site of HA determines the receptor-binding preference change. We conclude that the human-infecting H 6 N 1 evolved into a human receptor preference...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{interactions}} between humans, domestic animals and wildlife {{may result in}} <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> of infectious agents. To evaluate the presence of pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. and to test the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates, rectal swabs from 36 different free-ranging wild mammals were taken from two distinct natural sites in Brazil: Cantareira State Park (CSP, state of São Paulo) and Santa Isabel do Rio Negro Region (SIRNR, state of Amazonas). The swabs were randomly collected and processed for bacterial isolation, identification, characterization and anti-microbial resistance. Eighteen E. coli strains from CSP and 20 from SIRNR were recovered from 14 and 22 individuals, respectively. Strains from animals captured in CSP, the site with the greatest anthropization, exhibited a higher range and percentage of virulence genes, including an eae+/bfpA+ strain. Antimicrobial resistance was verified in strains originating from both sites; however, in strains from SIRNR, aminopenicillins were almost the exclusive antimicrobial class to which strains exhib-ited resistance, whereas in CSP there were strains resistant to cephalosporins, sulfonamide, amino-glycoside, tetracycline and fluoroquinolone, in addition to strains exhibiting multidrug resistance.

40|$|Influenza A viruses are {{amongst the}} most {{challenging}} viruses that threaten both human and animal health. Influenza A viruses are unique in many ways. Firstly, they are unique in the diversity of host species that they infect. This includes waterfowl (the original reservoir), terrestrial and aquatic poultry, swine, humans, horses, dog, cats, whales, seals and several other mammalian species. Secondly, they are unique in their capacity to evolve and adapt, following crossing the species barrier, in order to replicate and spread to other individuals within the new species. Finally, they are unique {{in the frequency of}} <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> events that occur. Indeed, the consequences of novel influenza virus strain in an immunologically naïve population can be devastating. The problems that influenza A viruses present for human and animal health are numerous. For example, influenza A viruses in humans represent a major economic and disease burden, whilst the poultry industry has suffered colossal damage due to repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of influenza A viruses by shedding light on interspecies virus transmission and summarising the current knowledge regarding how influenza viruses can adapt to a new host...|$|E
40|$|Feline and primate {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (FIVs, SIVs, and HIV) {{are transmitted}} via direct contact (e. g. fighting, sexual contact, and mother–offspring transmission). This dynamic likely poses a behavioral barrier to cross-species transmission in the wild. Recently, several host intracellular anti-viral proteins {{that contribute to}} species-specificity of primate lentiviruses have been identified revealing adaptive mechanisms that further limit spread of lentiviruses between species. Consistent with these <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> barriers, phylogenetic evidence supports the prediction that FIV transmission is an exceedingly rare event between free-ranging cat species, though it has occurred occasionally in captive settings. Recently we documented that puma and bobcats in Southern California share an FIV strain, providing an opportunity to evaluate evolution of both viral strains and host intracellular restriction proteins. These studies are facilitated by {{the availability of the}} 2 × cat genome sequence annotation. In addition, concurrent viral and host genetic analyses have been used to track patterns of migration of the host species and barriers to transmission of the virus within the African lion. These studies illustrate the utility of FIV as a model to discover the variables necessary for establishment and control of lentiviral infections in new species...|$|E
40|$|In Argentina, {{successful}} vaccination {{and control}} of terrestrial rabies in the 1980 s revealed {{the importance of the}} aerial route in RABV transmission. Current distribution of cases shows a predominance of rabies by hematophagous bats in the Northern regions where rabies is a major public health concern; in contrast, in Central and Southern regions where rabies is not a major public health concern, little surveillance is performed. Based on the analysis of insectivorous bats received for RABV analysis by the National Rabies system of surveillance, the positivity rate of RABV in insectivorous bats in these regions ranged from 3. 1 to 5. 4 %. This rate is comparable to other nations such as the United States (9 – 10 %) where insectivorous bats are an important cause of concern for RABV surveillance systems. Antigenic and genetic analysis of a wide collection of rabies strains shows the presence of multiple endemic cycles associated with six bat insectivorous species distributed among an extensive area of the Argentinean territory and several countries of the Americas. Finally, <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission,</b> mostly related with Lasiurus species, was demonstrated in 11. 8 % of the samples. Increased public education about the relationship between insectivorous bats and rabies are essential to avoid human cases and potential spread to terrestrial mammals...|$|E
40|$|Salmonella enterica {{serotype}} Enteritidis is {{a worldwide}} zoonotic agent {{that has been}} recognized as a very important food-borne bacterial pathogen, mainly associated with consumption of poultry products. The aim of this work was to determine genotypic and phenotypic evidence of S. Enteritidis transmission among seabirds, poultry and humans in Chile. Genotyping was performed using PCR-based virulotyping, pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Pathogenicity-associated phenotypes were determined with survival to free radicals, acidic pH, starvation, antimicrobial resistance, and survival within human dendritic cells. As result of PCR and PFGE assays, some isolates from the three hosts showed identical genotypic patterns, and through MLST {{it was determined that}} all of them belong to sequence type 11. Results of phenotypic assays showed diversity of survival capabilities among isolates. When results were analyzed according to bacterial host, statistical differences were identified in starvation and dendritic cells survival assays. In addition, isolates from seabirds showed the highest rates of resistance to gentamycin, tetracycline and ampicillin. Overall, the very close genetic and phenotypic traits shown by isolates from humans, poultry and seabirds suggest the <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> of S. Enteritidis bacteria between hosts, likely through anthropogenic environmental contamination that determines infection of seabirds with bacteria that are potentially pathogenic for other susceptible organism, including humans...|$|E
40|$|Influenza A viruses are {{zoonotic}} agents, {{capable of}} cross-ing the species barriers. Nowadays, they still constitute {{a great challenge}} worldwide. The natural reservoir of all influenza A viruses are wild aquatic birds, despite the fact they have been isolated {{from a number of}} avi-an and mammalian species, including humans. Even when influenza A viruses are able to get into another than waterfowl population, they are often unable to ef-ficiently adapt and transmit between individuals. Only in rare cases, these viruses are capable of establishing a new lineage. To succeed a complete adaptation and further transmission between species, influenza A virus must overcome a species barrier, including adaptation to the receptors of a new host, which would allow the virus–cell binding, virus replication and, then, animal-to-animal transmission. For many years, pigs were thought to be intermediate host for adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans, because of their susceptibility to in-fection with both, avian and human influenza viruses, which supported hypothesis of pigs as a “mixing vessel”. In this review, the molecular factors necessary for <b>inter-species</b> <b>transmission</b> are described, with special empha-sis on adaptation of avian influenza viruses to the pig population. In addition, this review gives the informa-tion about swine influenza viruses circulating around the world with special emphasis on Polish strains.
