The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was too costly to run in light of budget cuts.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Objective. Bottle feeding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bed or crib before {{sleep time}} has been {{associated}} with an in-creased risk of wheezing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of life. We examined whether bottle feeding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bed or crib be-fore sleep time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of life is associated with wheezing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 5 <b>years</b> of life. Methods. In a prospective cohort study of 448 chil-dren with parental history of atopy followed from birth, we examined the relation between the number of bi-monthly parental reports of bottle feeding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bed or crib before sleep time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of life (range: 0 – 6 reports) and parental report of wheezing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 5 <b>years</b> of life.

The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant team in the league, became a rival. The two teams' five Grey Cup match-ups include an epic 38–36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie. In the pre-CFL days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>years</b> of the Grey Cup championship, including the Argonauts' first win in 1914.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th century major landowners {{tended to}} rent out their demesne lands for money, {{motivated}} by static prices for produce and {{the chaos of}} the Anarchy between 1135 and 1153. This practice began to alter in the 1180s and 1190s, spurred by the greater political stability. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>years</b> of John's reign, agricultural prices almost doubled, at once increasing the potential profits on the demesne estates and also increasing the cost of living for the landowners themselves. Landowners now attempted wherever possible to bring their demesne lands back into direct management, creating a system of administrators and officials to run their new system of estates.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace {{are usually not}} meant to be drunk young, but many are still best <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>years.</b> Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up the sweetness of the wine.|$|E

In his capacity as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, George held influence in parliamentary boroughs on the south coast of England, which he used to support Whig candidates in the general election of 1705. In that year's election for Speaker of the House of Commons, George and Anne supported a Whig candidate, John Smith. George instructed his secretary, George Clarke, who was a Member of Parliament, to vote for Smith, but Clarke refused, instead supporting the Tory candidate William Bromley. Clarke was sacked, and Smith was elected.|$|E

However, from 1343 onwards, with the aid of his friend, Umur Beg of Aydin, Kantakouzenos began to reverse the situation. With the initial support of Stefan Dušan, Kantakouzenos regained much of Macedonia, and despite his failure to take Thessalonica, his Turkish allies enabled him to return to his old stronghold of Didymoteicho in Thrace. Gradually, Apokaukos's {{supporters}} abandoned him, including his son Manuel, who deserted his post at Adrianople and went over to the Kantakouzenos camp.|$|E

It also controlled large bus and tram fleets, the profits from which subsidised the financially weaker railways. After the war, railway extensions took the UERL's services out into suburban areas to stimulate additional passenger numbers, so that, by the early 1930s, the company's lines stretched beyond the County of London and served destinations in Middlesex, Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey.|$|E
