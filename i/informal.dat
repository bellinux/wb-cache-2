5|$|The oldest form of hare {{coursing}} simply involved two dogs chasing a hare, the winner being the dog {{that caught the}} hare; this could be for sport, food or pest control. In order to indulge in the <b>informal</b> practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. <b>Informal</b> coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised <b>informal</b> coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, so there was no formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge NATO to the East is a matter of dispute among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an <b>informal</b> agreement existed. Texas A University political scientist Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an <b>informal</b> agreement existed.|$|E

5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as <b>informal</b> workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of <b>informal</b> employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised sector that {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E
5|$|In 1914 {{the college}} hired noted {{landscape}} architect Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. with bigger buildings like Olds and Agriculture Halls being built Olmsted faced {{the challenge of}} maintaining the <b>informal</b> character of campus while minimizing walking distance. In 1915, the Olmsted Brothers firm issued a report its solution was a dramatic redesign of campus around quadrangles However, the plan was unpopular with students and alumni who wished to maintain the <b>informal</b> parklike feel of campus. After eight years of consulting and little in way of changes the school ended its relationship with Olmsted in 1922.|$|E

5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of <b>informal</b> work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the <b>informal</b> industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

The <b>informal</b> sector consists of small-scale enterprises that utilize traditional technologies and operate outside the legal regime of labor protections and taxation.

25|$|Due to lack {{of skills}} and {{education}} as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment. The limit of job opportunities causes many of them to employ themselves in the <b>informal</b> economy, inside the slum or in developed urban areas near the slum. This can sometimes be licit <b>informal</b> economy or illicit <b>informal</b> economy without working contract or any social security. Some of them are seeking jobs {{at the same time}} and some of those will eventually find jobs in formal economies after gaining some professional skills in <b>informal</b> sectors.|$|E

25|$|Some {{hold the}} view that <b>informal</b> logic is not a branch or subdiscipline of logic, or even {{the view that}} there cannot be {{such a thing as}} <b>informal</b> logic. Massey criticizes <b>informal</b> logic {{on the grounds that it}} has no theory {{underpinning}} it. <b>Informal</b> logic, he says, requires detailed classification schemes to organize it, which in other disciplines is provided by the underlying theory. He maintains that there is no method of establishing the invalidity of an argument aside from the formal method, and that the study of fallacies may be of more interest to other disciplines, like psychology, than to philosophy and logic.|$|E
25|$|Improved {{literacy}} bolsters {{both the}} <b>informal</b> and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence {{was found that}} the <b>informal</b> economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the <b>informal</b> economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is <b>informal.</b> Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the <b>informal</b> to the formal sector have not succeeded, suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.|$|E
