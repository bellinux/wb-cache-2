The same is valid for the functional production strategy of mass customization.

40|$|Design-to-cost is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for controlling costs. Although qualitative techniques exist for implementing <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost,</b> quantitative methods are sparse. In the launch vehicle and spacecraft engineering process, the question whether to minimize mass is usually an issue. The lack of quantification in this issue leads to arguments on both sides. This paper presents a mathematical technique which both quantifies the design-to-cost process and the mass/complexity issue. Parametric cost analysis generates and applies mathematical formulas called cost estimating relationships. In their most common forms, they are continuous and differentiable. This property permits {{the application of the}} mathematics of differentiable manifolds.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to compare the operational and performance cost factors for an Optical Deep Space Network (ODSN). Two major baseline architectures, namely the Linearly Dispersed Optical Subnet (LDOS) and Clustered Optical Subnet (COS), have previously been compared from various perspectives, in the Ground Based Advanced Technology Study (GBATS) and summarized in a report in 1994. Since then, new advances in telescope technology have occurred and new requirements for deep space missions have been proposed. This paper addresses and identifies the need of an update of the findings of GBATS for an ODSN considering the new set of requirements of future deep space missions and the importance to introduce the <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> consideration during the design of the ODSN itself.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate how additive manufacturing (AM) technologies may influence the architecture of satellite systems, namely the spacecraft design process. The benefits of AM for the “Space 4. 0 ” are first examined and the possible consequence of the use of AM for “in space” manufacturing are highlighted. The influence of AM on satellite systems are then evaluated for the mechanical adjustments of the sub-systems, namely for the structural one.

40|$|AbstractThe {{systematic}} {{method for}} conceptual {{design of a}} new product has been introduced as a comprehensive design tool by Pahl and Beitz in 1977 and improved since. In our studies the method has been extended by introduction of new techniques and tools, that enable {{to be more specific}} and more focused. The design methodology is called ICDM – Integrated, Customer Driven, Conceptual Design Method. Three out of the new ICDM tools are shortly described in this paper. These tools are the Enriched QFD for task definition, the CFMA – Conceptual Failure Mode Analysis and the DQM – Design Quality Measurement to evaluate the satisfaction from the generated concepts. The other new tools like the CDTC – the Conceptual <b>Design</b> <b>To</b> <b>Cost,</b> the Roobustool – to evaluate and improve the robustness of the solution combination, the RTA – the Risk and Time to Market Analysis and the DSO - the Direct Synthesis Optimization, are only shortly mentioned.
