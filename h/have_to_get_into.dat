6000|$|Friedrich calls halt: rest here a little; to consider, examine, settle how. A hot close morning; {{rest for}} an hour or two, till our rear from Kaurzim come up: horses and men will be the better for it,--horses can have a mouthful of grass, mouthful of water; some of them [...] "had no drink last night, so late in getting home."

6000|$|My {{story was}} now world-wide enough: Scotland, India, and America being all {{obligatory}} scenes. But of these India was {{strange to me}} except in books; I had never known any living Indian save a Parsee, a member of my club in London, equally civilised, and (to all seeing) equally accidental with myself. It was plain, thus far, that I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> India and out of it again upon a foot of fairy lightness; and I believe this first suggested to me {{the idea of the}} Chevalier Burke for a narrator. It was at first intended that he should be Scottish, and I was then filled with fears that he might prove only the degraded shadow of my own Alan Breck. Presently, however, it began to occur to me it would be like my Master to curry favour with the Prince's Irishmen; and that an Irish refugee would have a particular reason to find himself in India with his countryman, the unfortunate Lally. Irish, therefore, I decided he should be, and then, all of a sudden, I was aware of a tall shadow across my path, the shadow of Barry Lyndon. No man (in Lord Foppington's phrase) of a nice morality could go very deep with my Master: in the original idea of this story conceived in Scotland, this companion had been besides intended to be worse than the bad elder son with whom (as it was then meant) he was to visit Scotland; if I took an Irishman, and a very bad Irishman, {{in the midst of the}} eighteenth century, how was I to evade Barry Lyndon? The wretch besieged me, offering his services; he gave me excellent references; he proved that he was highly fitted for the work I had to do; he, or my own evil heart, suggested it was easy to disguise his ancient livery wit a little lace and a few frogs and buttons, so that Thackeray himself should hardly recognise him. And then of a sudden there came to me memories of a young Irishman, with whom I was once intimate, and had spent long nights walking and talking with, upon a very desolate coast in a bleak autumn: I recalled him as a youth of an extraordinary moral simplicity--almost vacancy; plastic to any influence, the creature of his admirations: and putting such a youth in fancy into the career of a soldier of fortune, it occurred to me that he would serve my turn as well as Mr. Lyndon, and in place of entering into competition with the Master, would afford a slight though a distinct relief. I know not if I have done him well, though his moral dissertations always highly entertained me: but I own I have been surprised to find that he reminded some critics of Barry Lyndon after all.

60|$|Soon it {{was raining}} so hard that but little could be seen beyond the {{entrance}} to the cave.

The rain drove in at times, and they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a split in the rocks to keep dry.|$|R
5000|$|According to Kirkus Reviews, [...] "Paterson <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> Louise's {{later years}} to make the point, and to avoid the instant realizations that {{substitute}} in too many juvenile novels. However, this tends to flatten the tone and blur {{the shape of the}} novel. Louise's earlier, intense feelings evoke recognition and sympathy, but this hasn't the resonant clarity of Bridge to Terabithia or The Great Gilly Hopkins." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{may save}} {{misunderstanding}} if {{a word or}} so be said here of the aim and scope of this book. It is written {{in relation to a}} previous work, Anticipations, [Footnote: Published by Harper Bros.] and together with that and a small pamphlet, [...] "The Discovery of the Future," [...] [Footnote: Nature, vol. lxv. (1901-2), p. 326, and reprinted in the Smithsonian Report for 1902] presents a general theory of social development and of social and political conduct. It is an attempt to deal with social and political questions in a new way and from a new starting-point, viewing the whole social and political world as aspects of one universal evolving scheme, and placing all social and political activities in a defined relation to that; and to this general method and trend it is that the attention of the reader is especially directed. The two books and the pamphlet together are to be regarded as an essay in presentation. It is a work that the writer admits he has undertaken primarily for his own mental comfort. He is remarkably not qualified to assume an authoritative tone in these matters, and he is acutely aware of the many defects in detailed knowledge, in temper, and in training these papers collectively display. He is aware that at such points, for example, as the reference to authorities in the chapter on the biological problem, and to books in the educational chapter, the lacunar quality of his reading and knowledge is only too evident; to fill in and complete his design--notably in the fourth paper--he has had quite frankly to jerry-build here and there. Nevertheless, he ventures to publish this book. There are phases in the development of every science when an incautious outsider may think himself almost necessary, when sketchiness ceases to be a sin, when the mere facts of irresponsibility and an untrained interest may permit a freshness, a freedom of mental gesture that would be inconvenient and compromising for the specialist; and such a phase, it is submitted, has been reached in this field of speculation. Moreover, the work attempted is not so much special and technical as a work of reconciliation, the suggestion of broad generalizations upon which divergent specialists may meet, a business for non-technical expression, and in which a man who knows a little of biology, a little of physical science, and a little in a practical way of social stratification, who has concerned himself with education and aspired to creative art, may claim in his very amateurishness a special qualification. And in addition, it is particularly a business for some irresponsible writer, outside the complications of practical politics, some man who, politically, [...] "doesn't matter," [...] to provide the first tentatives of a political doctrine that shall be equally available for application in the British Empire and in the United States. To that we must come, unless our talk of co-operation, of reunion, is no more than sentimental dreaming. We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> line, and that we cannot do while over here and over there men hold themselves bound by old party formulae, by loyalties and institutions, that are becoming, that have become, provincial in proportion to our new and wider needs. My instances are commonly British, but all the broad project of this book--the discussion {{of the quality of the}} average birth and of the average home, the educational scheme, the suggestions for the organization of literature and a common language, the criticism of polling and the jury system, and the ideal of a Republic with an apparatus of honour--is, I submit, addressed to, and could be adopted by, any English-reading and English-speaking man. No doubt the spirit of the inquiry is more British than American, that the abandonment of Rousseau and anarchic democracy is more complete than American thought is yet prepared for, but that is a difference not of quality but of degree. And even the appendix, which at a hasty glance may seem to be no more than the discussion of British parochial boundaries, does indeed develop principles of primary importance in the fundamental schism of American politics between the local State government and the central power. So much of apology and explanation I owe to the reader, to the contemporary specialist, and to myself.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unfinished}} look of {{the painting}} was commented on by Bachardy himself—he said that it stemmed from his difficulty in [...] "capturing" [...] Brown during their five sittings. Of his technique Bachardy said, [...] "Some people are restless and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> their rhythm...I’ll just hope to get something essential. You boil {{it down to the}} most crucial parts of the face and get the living quality. And sometimes that essence can be achieved in just a few moments." ...|$|E
50|$|Before departing Waterland, {{teams would}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a {{whitewater}} raft and ride {{it down a}} series of heavy rapids. During the wild ride, they had to throw balls so that they landed in nearby baskets. If they could get at least three balls into baskets before they {{reached the end of}} the rapids, they would get their next clue. After their second failed attempt, they would only have to get two balls into baskets, and after four failed attempts they would only have to get one in.|$|E

60|$|I took my ticket, {{and marched}} proudly up the platform, with my cheeses, the people falling back respectfully on either side. The train was crowded, and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a {{carriage}} {{where there were}} already seven other people. One crusty old gentleman objected, but I got in, notwithstanding; and, putting my cheeses upon the rack, squeezed down with a pleasant smile, {{and said it was}} a warm day.|$|R
5000|$|The son of F.

From the age of 13 he worked on farms as a labourer. He has likened the repetitive quality of farm tasks to the routine of making sculpture: [...] "A lot of my work is like picking potatoes; you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the rhythm of it." ...|$|E
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the leg, teams were given a set of geographical coordinates and instructed to travel to the Claro Information Centre to look them up on the internet.

After traveling by bus to the Itabaca Canal, teams would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a kayak and paddle themselves across to Santa Cruz Island. At Muelle Municipal, teams would find a Roadblock. The chosen team member had to dive into the water and search among the coral reefs for some artificial coral coloured with race colours.|$|E

50|$|The Navy's disinterest in {{missiles}} {{had been}} greatly reduced with the August 1955 appointment of Admiral Arleigh Burke to the Chief of Naval Operations, replacing Robert B.

Burke was convinced the Navy <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the missile field {{as rapidly as}} possible, and was well aware that the Air Force would oppose any such endeavor. Instead, he approached the Army, and found their new design to fit the range goals needed by the Navy.|$|R
5000|$|Macfarlane's {{style of}} {{seemingly}} inexhaustible, conga-inspired dancing during the band's festival appearances and gigs has become legendary and customary at all their performances. In April 2009, the band performed {{at their first}} Coachella Festival, and despite the heat, the Friendly Fires frontman didn't disappoint fans, giving it his all: [...] "I remember having about six bottles of water next to my synthesiser. It was painfully hot, and I still have to dance to our music and I still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> it. After one song, you feel shrivelled up like a raisin.

5000|$|Whitehouse {{has said}} that {{development}} of alternate energy sources, including solar power, will eliminate U.S. dependence on foreign oil. He has cited the installation of new solar panels on three new bank branches in Rhode Island, saying that the projects “created jobs, they put people to work, they lowered the cost for these banks of their electrical energy, and they get us off foreign oil and away, step by step, from these foreign entanglements that we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> to defend our oil supply”. In regard to these comments, PolitiFact investigated the economics of renewable energy and determined that solar and wind investments {{would not have a}} large effect on oil consumption, calling Whitehouse's comments [...] "mostly false" [...] due to [...] "this misimpression—and because of the other inaccuracies in Whitehouse’s speech".|$|E

It will segue into a sequel sometime." [...] Dick said that he had [...] "started several times to write a sequel", but progressed little, because he was too {{disturbed}} by his original research for The Man in the High Castle and could not mentally bear [...] "to go back and read about Nazis again." [...] He suggested that the sequel would be a collaboration with another author: [...] "Somebody would have to come in and help me do a sequel to it.
