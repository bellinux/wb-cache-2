40|$|Micrometastasis {{is defined}} as microscopical deposit of {{malignant}} cells, less than 2 mm in diameter, separated from the primary tumor. This does not include discontinous growth in peritumoral region, but include microinolvement of regional lymph nodes.

40|$|Background and Aim: Tumor {{dissemination}} via {{blood to}} distant organs {{is the main}} cause of death. Therefore, there is a critical need to set up sensitive methods for the early detection of circulating tumor cells(CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells(DTCs) in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow(BM) specimens of breast cancer patients. The aim of this research is to study the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> using MUC 2 in such patients. Materials and Methods: In this study, PB and BM samples were collected from 50 breast cancer patients after operation and before adjuvant therapy. Mucin 2 (MUC 2) was used as a tumor marker and its transcript level in the sample patients was analyzed using gene specific, quantitative real-time PCR reaction with SYBR Green technology. Samples from 20 healthy individuals were used as negative controls. HPRT was used as a reference gene. Results: MUC 2 mRNA was detected in 8 (16 %) of PB and BM samples. MUC 2 mRNA was not detected in PB samples of healthy individuals. The relapse rate among MUC 2 -positive patients was higher than MUC 2 -negative patients; and it was statistically significant in BM (P< 0. 05).

The so-called sentinel node surgery offers a therapeutic approach to resect the first draining lymph node. This technique enables accurate staging of melanoma patients {{in an early}} stage of the disease. Detection of a sentinel node metastasis is a strong argument for local lymphadenectomy. To improve the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in sentinel nodes of melanoma patients, molecular biological techniques were used. The exclusively melanocyte-specific tyrosinase transcript was amplified by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In sentinel node examination, the detection of tyrosinase-positive cells by RT-PCR was compared with routine immunohistochemistry. From 16 patients, a total of 28 lymph nodes were tested. The lymph nodes were derived after lymphadenectomy (4 patients) and after sentinel node resection (12 patients with melanoma stage I). By using RT-PCR we could detect 100 tumor cells in a background of 10 (8) peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The negative controls were all negative for tyrosinase. Cryostat sections of lymph nodes for mRNA isolation were alternated with sections for immunohistochemistry. By using tyrosinase RT-PCR, we detected 6 additional positive sentinel nodes in patients with melanoma stage I. Furthermore, the tyrosinase RT-PCR enabled us to design a blood test for circulating melanoma cells. Therefore, mRNA was directly isolated from whole blood of 23 blood samples, of which 3 samples were positive for tyrosinase. The present study demonstrates the possibility of a simple and rapid blood test for melanoma patients that has not been available until now. Furthermore, the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in sentinel nodes by tyrosinase RT-PCR dramatically increases the accuracy of melanoma staging...|$|E

The results yielded from prior hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining were compared with results following exhaustive serial sectioning at 150 -µm intervals using identical staining methods. These experimental findings were compared with pathologic results of immediate completion selective neck dissection, previously recorded prospectively. Results. Reexamination of 35 sentinel nodes at 150 -µm intervals has not revealed any missed micrometastatic disease at 2 -mm intervals used initially.

40|$|Background: Liver {{resection}} {{is considered}} the best treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Several prognostic factors have been investigated, and many {{studies have shown that}} hepatic hilum lymph nodes involvement has a negative impact on prognosis. The present study evaluated the frequency of microscopic involvement of hilar lymph nodes, through systematic lymphadenectomy and analysis of micrometastases in patients undergoing hepatectomy due to colorectal metastasis. Methods: A total of 28 patients underwent hepatic resection with hilar lymphadenectomy. Lymph nodes considered negative by conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were analyzed by serial sectioning with 100 -mu m intervals and immunohistochemistry (IHC) with antihuman pancytokeratin antibody AE 1 /AE 3. Results: In average, 6. 18 lymph nodes were dissected per patient. No morbidity or mortality was associated to lymphadenectomy. In two patients, conventional H&E analysis showed presence of microscopic lymph node metastasis. H&E analysis allowed the identification of three other patients with lymph node micrometastases.

40|$|OBJECTIVES Indocyanine green (ICG) with {{near-infrared}} (NIR) {{fluorescence imaging}} represents {{a new and}} promising tracer modality used for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. This report outlines our initial experience using ICG for SLN mapping in a minimally invasive robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach in women with endometrial cancer by using Da Vinci Xi NIR fluorescence imaging system. METHODS Patients with clinical stage I endometrial cancer were recruited from December 2015 to June 2016. All patients underwent simple robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy and SLNs mapping {{by the use of}} Da Vinci Xi NIR fluorescence imaging system for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> fluorescence. An intracervical injection of ICG dye at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions was performed after the induction of general anesthesia. Histological examination of SLNs was compared with the histological definitive results of pelvic lymph nodes. RESULTS A total of 7 patients were included in the study. The median age was 63 (50 - 76) and median BMI 26 (23 - 29). The median SLN count was 2 and median lymph node count was 15 (9 - 24). SLNs were located primarily in the common iliac 64. 3 % (9 / 14), followed by the external iliac node basin 21. 3 % (3 / 14), internal iliac 7. 2 %(1 / 14) and presacral 7. 2 %(1 / 14). The overall and bilateral detection rate was respectably 100 % (7 / 7) and 100 % (7 / 7). Positive SLNs with 1 micrometastasis were identified in 14. 3 % of patients (1 / 7), and in the final histological examination a metastatic disease was detected also in the pelvic lymph nodes of the same hemi-pelvis. There were no allergic reactions to the ICG. All procedures were successfully completed without conversion to open laparotomy and no intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS In our preliminary experience NIR fluorescence imaging with ICG showed a high overall and bilateral detection rate for SLNs mapping in patients with endometrial cancer. The <b>detection</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in SLNs confirms the role of the method in <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> metastasis < 2 mm. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. The perfect agreement (Cohen’s Kappa= 1) between the histological results of SNLs and the final histological results of pelvic lymph node, demonstrates the technique’s reliability. Therefore, the results obtained are promising for the validation of the method in our surgical center, making it possible to modulate the surgery on SNLs results. They could also allow the gradual introduction of new criteria for the planning of adjuvant therapy. Finally these results are promising to gain a surgical-anatomo pathological expertise in order to collaborate with multicenter randomized trials...|$|R
40|$|Keratin {{filament}} are characteristically {{present in}} epithelial cells and tumors, but {{have also been}} detected in many normal and neoplastic non-epithelial cell types using immunohistochemical techniques. To investigate the validity of this seemingly aberrant protein expression, we applied the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to study keratin gene expression {{in a variety of}} non-epithelial tissues. Total RNA was extracted from nine samples of leiomyosarcoma, four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, seven normal bone marrows, normal lymph node, normal peripheral blood cells, freshly isolated and cultured endothelial cells, cultured skin fibroblasts, and the myeloid leukemia cell line HL- 60. Amplification primers and probes for the three most primitive keratin types (8, 18, and 19) were synthesized using published gene sequences. RNA from the breast carcinoma cell line MCF- 7, known to be rich in all three keratins, was used as positive control. Concurrently run actin primers were used to confirm RNA integrity. After an initial cycle with reverse transcriptase, PCR amplification was performed for 30 cycles. Southern blots of the PCR products showed variably intense bands corresponding to keratin 8 and 18 gene products in all samples, offering conclusive evidence of keratin gene expression in cells of both stromal and hematopoietic derivation. However, keratin 19 gene transcription was not nearly so ubiquitous, being detected in normal fibroblasts and endothelial cells, two of four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and four of nine leiomyosarcoma, but not in normal lymph node, peripheral blood cells, HL- 60 cells, or any of the seven normal bone marrows examined. Dilutional experiments showed PCR to be highly sensitive in the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> keratin 19 gene expression, capable of registering one MCF- 7 cell in 10 (6) HL- 60 cells. These studies show that variable levels of keratin 8 and 18 gene expression may be detected by PCR {{in a wide variety of}} non-epithelial tissues, supporting previous immunohistochemical and phylogenetic studies. However, keratin 19 gene expression appears to be more restricted and was not evident in any hematopoietic cells devoid of contaminating stromal elements.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the molecular identification of cancer cells in the circulation may be useful in predicting the presence of micrometastasis in several cancer types. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to assess the feasibility of CEA mRNA identification in blood for diagnosing and staging colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We studied 16 control subjects, 69 patients with colorectal (CRC), 30 with gastric (GC), 27 with pancreatic cancer (PC) and 8 with benign diseases of the pancreatobiliary tree. At diagnosis CEA mRNA was identified in peripheral blood by means of a RT-PCR procedure. RESULTS: The specificity of this test in control subjects was 94 %, and its sensitivity in identifying CRC, GC and PC were 34, 37 and 41 %, respectively. False-positive findings were recorded in 25 % patients with benign diseases. No association was found between CEA mRNA and stage in patients with GC or PC. In CRC patients, positive CEA mRNA findings were correlated with local spread (chi(2) = 14. 6, p< 0. 01), lymph node (chi(2) = 18. 95, p< 0. 001) and distant metastasis (chi(2) = 11. 3, p< 0. 001). In these cases, CEA mRNA, but not CEA, was entered in stepwise discriminant analysis to classify the presence of lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in the blood by means of CEA mRNA identification is feasible for colorectal, but not for gastric or pancreatic cancer staging.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the sensitivity of}} sentinel node (SN) ultrastaging and to define parameters that may reduce the overall false-negative rate in women with early-stage cervical cancer. Methods. We analyzed data from a large retrospective multicenter cohort group with FIGO stages IA-IIB cervical cancer in whom at least one SN was identified and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy was uniformly performed. All who were SN negative by initial evaluation were subjected to ultrastaging. Results. In all, 645 patients were evaluable. SN were detected bilaterally in 72 % of cases and unilaterally in 28 %. Patients with optimal bilateral SN detection {{were significantly more likely}} to have any metastasis detected (33. 3 % vs. 19. 2 %; P < 0. 001) as well as micrometastasis detected in their SN (39. 6 % vs. 11. 4 %). SN ultrastaging resulted in a low overall false-negative rate of 2. 8 % (whole group) and an even lower false-negative rate of 1. 3 % for patients with optimal bilateral mapping. Patients with false-negative SN after ultrastaging had a higher prevalence of LVSI and more frequent unilateral SN detection. Sensitivity of SN ultrastaging was 91 % (95 % CI: 86 %- 95 %) for the whole group and 97 % (95 % CI: 91 %- 99 %) in the subgroup with bilateral SN detection. Conclusion. These data confirm previous observations that optimal bilateral SN detection substantially decreases the false negative rate of SN ultrastaging and increases <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis.</b> In patients with bilateral SN detection, the sensitivity of SN ultrastaging is not reduced in more advanced stages of the disease.

We applied the molecular techniques (RT-PCR) {{to improve the}} <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in order to evaluate an improvement of staging in early {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) patients (pts). METHODS: This study was carried out on 22 consecutive NSCLC pts with stage I disease. A dose of 37 MBq (1 ml (99 m) Tc-nanocolloid suspension) was administered. The intralesional injection was performed under CT-guidance (7 pts), by using bronchoscopy (5 pts), VATS (2 pts) and at time of the thoracotomy (8 pts). RT-PCR analysis for cytokeratin 7 and 19 (CK 7 -CK 19) was used to identify tumour-derived material in lymph nodes (LN). Each SLN was bisected: half was used for conventional examination (H&E staining/by immunohistochemistry (IHC), half was snap-frozen to - 80 degrees C for RNA-detection of CK 7 and CK 19. RESULTS: SLN was detected in 16 out of 19 pts. In three pts SLN was not identified (due to an incorrect technique). Conventional pathologic examination showed stage I disease in 13 pts, T 3 N 0 disease in 1 pt, N 2 in 5 pts. The IHC analysis identified micrometastasis in seven pts (two evaluated N 0 according to H&E staining). RT-PCR analysis, performed in 10 / 16 pts, identified micrometastasis in 6 pts (3 pts evaluated N 0 disease by H&E; 1 of these evaluated N 0 even by IHC). All N 2 patients relapsed. One patient (N 0 pts after H&E and IHC analysis) with positive CK 7 and CK 19 expression by RT-PCR analysis relapsed (systemic relapse) 3 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: SLN technique could provide a subgroup of patients in which the use of RT-PCR could be applied on a well-focused target.

30|$|EC {{patients}} are usually obese and aged [9]. The {{primary goal of}} SLN in EC consists in reducing the morbidity of a full lymphadenectomy (by decreasing surgical time), as well as early (need of blood transfusion, fever, wound infection, thromboembolism [10]) and late complications (lymphocysts formation, leg lymphedema, transient neuralgias [3, 6, 8 – 14]). Besides, SLN allows an accurate exploration of all drainage routes {{as well as those}} considered aberrant or not routinely examined [12]. It is suggested that SLN could have a value in isolated PA metastatic node detection. PA metastasis is a known adverse prognostic factor in EC [15], and there is no reliable way to predict its involvement [16]. SLN detection could select patients that beneficiate from PA lymphadenectomy that would be performed in presence of a positive SLN. For this purpose, the most accurate technique involves hysteroscopic injection [17]. Moreover, the use of more sensitive techniques for SLN detection could better identify pelvic nodes and probably reduce the reported incidence of isolated infra-renal metastasis [8]. The secondary goal is to improve <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis,</b> which is associated with a recurrence risk [13], with resource to ultra-sectioning and immunohistochemestry (IHC) protocols [3, 6, 8 – 13]. Therefore, the risk of recurrence related to positive lymph nodes missing despite a full lymphadenectomy could be reduced [12], and SLN could improve selection of patients for adjuvant therapy. Despite the controversy concerning therapeutic benefit of lymphadenectomy, some experts argue that lymph node staging is necessary to guide appropriate adjuvant therapy [18]. Adjuvant therapies based only on uterine factors may result in over or under treatment [12, 32]. Identification of microscopic disease outside the uterus can help to determine the need of adjuvant therapy. SLN application in EC is more accurate than MRI and intra-operative frozen section analysis in assessing lymph node status [1, 8] and SLNs are {{three times more likely to}} harbor disease than non-SLNs [34]. SLN in EC, incorporating ultrastaging, may improve selection of women at high risk and could potentially avoid 80  % full unnecessary lymphadenectomy [6].

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prognostic values of ex vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of SLN micrometastasis in colorectal cancers. Methods Colorectal cancer specimens were obtained during radical resections and the SLN was identified by injecting a 1 % isosulfan blue solution submucosally and circumferentially around the tumor within 30 [*]min after surgery. The first node to stain blue was defined as the SLN. SLNs negative by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were further examined for micrometastasis using cytokeratin IHC. Results A total of 54 patients between 25 and 82 [*]years of age were enrolled, including 32 males and 22 females. More than 70 % of patients were T 3 or above, about 86 % of patients were stage II or III, and approximately 90 % of patients had lesions grade II or above. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected in all 54 patients. There were 32 patients in whom no lymph node micrometastasis were detected by HE staining and 22 patients with positive lymph nodes micrometastasis detected by HE staining in non-SLNs. In contrast only 7 SLNs stained positive with HE. Using HE examination as the standard, the sensitivity, non-detection rate, and accuracy rate of SLN micrometastasis detection were 31. 8 % (7 / 22), 68. 2 % (15 / 22), and 72. 2 %, respectively. Micrometastasis were identified by ICH in 4 of the 32 patients with HE-negative stained lymph nodes, resulting in an upstaging rate 12. 5 % (4 / 32). The 4 patients who were upstaged consisted of 2 stage I patients and 2 stage II patients who were upstaged to stage III. Those without lymph node metastasis by HE staining who were upstaged by IHC <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> had a significantly poorer disease-free survival (p[*]=[*] 0. 001) and overall survival (p[*]=[*] 0. 004). Conclusion Ex vivo localization and immunohistochemical detection of sentinel lymph node micrometastasis in patients with colorectal cancer can upgrade tumor staging, and may become a factor affecting prognosis and guiding treatment.

They can potentially be used as fluorescent probes for various biomedical imaging applications, including cancer localization, <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis,</b> image guided surgery, and targeted drug delivery. Their main limitation is toxicity, which requires a biologically compatible surface coating to shield the toxic core from the surrounding environment. However, this leads to an increase in QD size that may lead to problems of excretion and systemic sequestration. We describe a one pot synthesis, characterization, and in vitro cytotoxicity of a novel polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) -coated CdTe-cored QD using mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) and D-cysteine as stabilizing agents. Characterization was performed using transmission electron microscopy Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence studies. POSS-coated QDs demonstrated high colloidal stability and enhanced photostability on high degrees of ultraviolet (UV) excitation compared to QDs coated with MSA and D-cysteine alone (P value &lt; 0. 05). In vitro toxicity studies showed that both POSS and MSA-QDs were significantly less toxic than ionized salts of Cd+ 2 and Te- 2. Confocal microscopy confirmed high brightness of POSS-QDs in cells at both 1 and 24 hours, indicating that these QDs are rapidly taken up by cells and remain photostable in a biological environment. We therefore conclude that a POSS coating confers biological compatibility, photostability, and colloidal stability while retaining the small size and unique photophysical properties of the QDs. The amphiphilic nature of the coating allows solubility in aqueous solutions and rapid transfer across cell membranes, enabling the use of lower concentrations of the QDs for an overall reduced toxicity particularly for prolonged live cell and in vivo imaging applications.

40|$|The {{monoclonal}} antibody D 2 - 40 {{is a specific}} lymphatic endothelial markers and D 2 - 40 staining have been applicable to evaluate lymphatic invasion in various malignant neoplasms. In the present study, we investigated lymph node micrometastasis determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) in all dissected lymph nodes obtained from 80 patients with node-negative gastric cancer, and analysed the relationship between micrometastasis and clinicopathological findings including lymphatic invasion of the resected primary tumour using D 2 - 40 immunohistochemical staining. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> determined by IHC and RT–PCR was 11. 3 % (nine out of 80) and 31. 3 % (25 out of 80), respectively. Although haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining revealed lymphatic invasion in 11. 3 % (nine out of 80) of patients, D 2 - 40 staining uncovered new invasion in 23. 8 % (19 out of 80) of patients. In the diagnosis of HE and D 2 - 40 staining, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> was significantly higher in patients with lymphatic invasion than in those without lymphatic invasion (P= 0. 0150 and P< 0. 0001, respectively). Micrometastasis correlated more closely with D 2 - 40 than with HE staining. We demonstrated a high incidence <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> and lymphatic invasion and a correlation between them even in pN 0 gastric cancer. When planning less invasive treatment, the presence of such occult cancer cells should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Background: The ultrarapid {{immunohistochemistry}} (IHC) {{technique was}} applied to the intra-operative examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) because routine SLN frozen section examinations sometimes produce false-negative results. The present study was undertaken to develop a reliable protocol for the ultrarapid IHC of SLNs. Methods: SLNs from 79 breast cancer patients with clinically negative axillary node were examined intraoperatively by frozen hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) stain and by ultrarapid cytokeratin IHC assay. On the basis of the result of serially sectioned permanent study, the sensitivity and accuracy of each intraoperative technique were compared. Results: The total number of dissected SLNs was 178 with a mean of 2. 3 (1 – 5) per patient. The mean turnaround time for ultrarapid IHC was 20 min. The sensitivity rates of frozen H&E staining and ultrarapid IHCwere 70. 0 and 85. 0 %, respectively (P = 0. 083). Eachmethod had a specificity of 100 %. The accuracy rates for frozen H&E staining and rapid IHC were 92. 4 and 96. 2 %, respectively (P = 0. 083). Ultrarapid IHC detected one additional patient with sentinel node micrometastasis and two additional patients with isolated tumor cells (ITCs). In those patients, two underwent completion axillary dissection simultaneously and could avoid a second operation. Conclusions: Ultrarapid cytokeratin IHC enhanced the intraoperative <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> sentinel node <b>micrometastasis</b> and ITCs in breast cancer without consuming much time. In patients who need completion axillary dissection after sentinel node biopsy, this technique could be helpful in avoiding a second operation.

40|$|Background. Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of the thorax {{can be used}} in {{the staging}} of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (PGTD). However, the prognostic significance <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in the lung detected by CT of the thorax has not been well documented. The aim of the study is to define the effect <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> on the clinical course of the disease. Methods. Thirty-five patients who had nonmetastatic GTD underwent CT thorax examination before treatment in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Hong Kong. All patients had workups which showed no evidence of metastasis and were diagnosed as FIGO stage IA. They all received methotrexate (MTX) infusion therapy. Results. Three groups of patients were identified based on the thorax CT findings. Sixteen patients (45. 7 %) showed no evidence <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> on CT thorax. Two of them (12. 5 %) had poor response to MTX with unsatisfactory fall in serum hCG levels requiring change of chemotherapy to actinomycin D. Nine patients had suspicious micrometastasis and one (11. 1 %) of them needed change of MTX. Ten patients had micrometastasis and one (10 %) of them needed change of MTX. There was only one recurrence and it was in the suspicious micrometastasis group (11. 1 %). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of poor drug response or recurrence among the three groups of patients. Conclusions. Micrometastases in the lung do not affect the clinical outcome of patients with FIGO stage IA disease. CT thorax is not essential in the staging of GTD. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Approximately 35 %- 40 % {{of patients with}} newly diagnosed non-small cell Lung cancer have locally advanced disease. The average survival time of these patients only have 6 - 8 months with chemotherapy. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore and summarize the probability of <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> in peripheral blood for molecular staging, and for selection of indication of surgical treatment, and beneficiary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative adjuvant therapy in locally advanced lung cancer; to summarize the long-time survival result of personalized surgical treatment of 516 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer based on molecular staging methods. Methods CK 19 mRNA expression of peripheral blood samples was detected in 516 lung cancer patients by RT-PCR before operation for molecular diagnosis of micrometastasis, personalized molecular staging, and for selection of indication of surgical treatment and the beneficiary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer invaded heart, great vessels or both. The long-term survival result of personalized surgical treatment was retrospectively analyzed in 516 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer based on molecular staging methods. Results There were 322 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 194 cases with adenocarcinoma in the series of 516 patients with locally advanced lung cancer involved heart, great vessels or both. There were 112 patients with IIIA disease and 404 cases with IIIB disease according to P-TNM staging. There were 97 patients with M-IIIA disease, 278 cases with M-IIIB disease and 141 cases with III disease according to our personalized molecular staging. Of the 516 patients, bronchoplastic procedures and pulmonary artery reconstruction was carried out in 256 cases; lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of partial left atrium was performed in 41 cases; Double sleeve lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of super vena cava was carried out in 90 cases; Lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of diaphragm was performed in 3 cases; Double sleeve lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of partial left atrium was performed in 30 cases; Bronchoplastic procedures and pulmonary artery reconstruction combined with reconstruction of aorta sheath was carried out in 10 cases; Right pneumonectomy combined with resection and reconstruction partial left atrium, total right diaphragm with Dacron, and post cava and right liver vein was performed in one case; Lobectomy combined with resection and reconstruction of carina was carried out in 10 cases; Bronchoplastic procedures and pulmonary artery reconstruction combined with resection and reconstruction of carina and superior vane cava, or combined with superior vena cava and left atrium, or with carina and left atrium was performed in 55 cases in this series. Five patients died of operative complications and the operative mortality was 0. 97 %. CK 19 mRNA expression was found in 141 patients. The positive rate of CK 19 mRNA expression was 27. 3 % in peripheral blood samples in the 516 cases. The positive rates of micrometastasis in peripheral blood was significantly related to histological classification, P-TNM staging and N staging of the cancer (P 0. 05). The median survival time was 43. 74 months. The 1, 3, 5 and 10 year survival rates of the 516 cases was 89. 1 %, 39. 3 %, 19. 8 % and 10. 4 %, respectively. The postoperative survival rate was remarkably correlated with micrometastasis in peripheral blood, histological classification of the tumor, size of primary cancer and lymph mode involvement (P < 0. 05). The results of multivariable Cox model analysis showed that "personalizedmolecular P-TNM staging", micrometastasis in peripheral blood, pathological types of the tumor and mediastinal lymph node metastasis of the cancer were the most significant factors for predicting prognosis in the patients with locally advanced nonsmall lung cancer. Conclusion (1) Micrometastasis was existed in peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer, which can not be detected with conventional methods. (2) Detecting of CK 19 mRNA expression in peripheral blood in lung cancer patients can be used for diagnosis of micrometastasis of lung cancer and “molecular staging” and “molecular P-TNM staging” for lung cancer patients. It will be helpful for selection of surgical treatment indication, the beneficiary of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and postopertive adjuvant therapy in the patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. (3) Personalized surgical treatment can significantly improve prognosis and increase curative rate and long-term survival rate of locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer based on personalized molecular staging...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} number of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early stage breast cancer increased the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis.</b> The clinical importance <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> is still discussed. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the incidence and the risk factors for metastasis in the axillary non-sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early stage breast cancer and micrometastatic sentinel lymph node. Method: Data about the axillary sentinel and non-sentinel lymph nodes collected from January 2000 to December 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. In the patients with micrometastatic sentinel lymph nodes, the incidence of non-sentinel metastasis was correlated with some features of the primary tumour, such as the T status, the grading, the proliferation index and the peritumoral lymphvascular invasion. Statistical univariate analysis was performed. Results: The sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 370 patients with early stage breast cancer, and 87 metastatic lymph nodes were found. Macrometastasis were 63, micrometastasis were 23 and only 1 case of isolated tumour cells was found. In the patients with micrometastatic sentinel lymph node, 7 patients (30, 4...|$|R
40|$|Sentinel {{lymph node}} (SLN) biopsies have widely {{been used for}} the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> occult LN {{metastasis}} of malignant melanoma (MM). In addition to conventional biomarkers, we assessed the diagnostic and prognostic significance of melanoma-initiating cell (MIC) markers in SLNs of MM. We examined the expressions of gp 100, MART- 1 and tyrosinase mRNA for routine diagnosis and those of ABCB 5, CD 133, nestin, KDM 5 B, NGFR and RANK mRNA as MIC markers. The presence <b>of</b> <b>micrometastasis</b> was confirmed immunohistochemically using antibodies to S- 100, HMB- 45, MART- 1, and tyrosinase. Discordance between immunohistochemical and molecular data was observed in 14 of 70 (20. 0 %) patients, among whom five (7. 1 %) were positive for only molecular markers;two of these five patients tested positive for micrometastasis by repeated immunohistochemical stainings. The quantitative expression levels of gp 100, MART- 1, and tyrosinase mRNA were significantly higher in the metastatic LNs;the cut-off values remain to be elucidated. ABCB 5 mRNA expression was detected more frequently in the metastatic SLNs (p＜ 0. 05) and {{in the group of}} patients with recurrence. To make a definite diagnosis of metastasis, we still need a combination of immunohistochemical and molecular probes. ABCB 5 might be a suitable molecular marker for the <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> melanoma-initiating cells in SLNs...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is a {{very strong}} {{documented}} correlation between the appearance of cancer cells in blood and occurrence of metastasis in gastrointestinal cancer. Aim: To determine MUC 1, CK 19, CK 20 and CEA mRNA expression in bone marrow of patients with gallbladder cancer and evaluate its clinical significance. Material and methods: Sixty eight samples were analyzed, 38 bone marrow samples of gallbladder cancer patients, 20 healthy donors, and 10 frozen samples of gallbladder cancer. Nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) was used to analyze mRNA expression. Results: All frozen tumors were positive for CEA, CK 19, and MUC 1 mRNA and 70 % were positive for CK 20. Seventeen of 20 donor samples were positive for MUC 1 and only one sample from donors was positive for both CK 20 and CK 19 mRNA. Among the 38 blood and bone marrow samples of gallbladder cancer patients, the expression of MUC 1, CK 19, CK 20, and CEA, mRNA was 60. 5 % (23 / 38), 31. 6 % (12 / 38), 7. 9 % (3 / 38), and 7. 9 % (3 / 38), respectively. Disregarding the MUC 1 results. 37 % (14 / 38), 13 % (5 / 38) and 5 % (2 / 38) were positive for one, two and three markers respectively. Not significant differences were found in survival with a follow up to 12 months. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the molecular <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> tumor cells in bone marrow in patients with gallbladder carcinoma is technically possible, being CEA, CK 19 and CK 20 gene expression the best markers. The MUC 1 gene expression marker was highly unspecific and it should not been considered. The <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> bone marrow <b>micrometastasis</b> might be helpful in prognosis and the selection of clinical treatment but a larger series with a longer follow-up should be studied (Rev Méd Chile 2004; 132 : 1489 - 98) ...|$|R
