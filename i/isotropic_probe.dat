40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Complete and {{homogeneous}} illumination of the pleural cavity {{is essential}} to the success of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for mesothelioma, but remains a challenge. Knowing the repartition and propagation of light around the light applicator could be the first step towards optimizing dosimetry. Here we propose a characterization method of the illumination profile of a specific light device. METHODS: The light wand, made of a cylindrical diffuser located inside an endotracheal tube, was fixed in a tank filled with dilute 0. 01 % intralipid. Light dosimetry was performed around the tip of the wand using two complementary methods: direct measurements of light power with an <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> and measurements of light distribution characterization. RESULTS: Dosimetry with the <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> showed an ellipse-shaped illumination. An optimized effective attenuation coefficient was deduced. Combined with the spatial representation, a theoretical illumination profile was established with iso-surfaces of fluence rate, defining a gradient light dose according to the distance from the diffuser. CONCLUSION: A theoretical illumination profile of a light device was established and could be part of an intra-operative dosimetry system to improve light delivery during intrapleural PDT.

40|$|Problem statement: Inadequate {{knowledge}} of electromagnetic field emitted by mobile phones and increased usage at close proximity, created {{a lot of}} skepticism and speculations among end users on its safety or otherwise. Approach: In this study, near field electromagnetic field radiation measurements were conducted on different brand of mobile phones in active mode using a tri-axis <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> and electric field meter. Results: The highest electromagnetic field exposure was recorded when the mobile phones are at outgoing call mode and backing the probe, which is higher in comparison to ICNIRP guidelines for exposure to general public. Conclusion: According to this finding, some mobile phones electromagnetic field radiation were found to be lower than the ICNIRP guidelines while some were far above the guidelines. Electromagnetic field intensity however, depends on the mode of operation and proximity of the mobile phones to the end user; hence it is safer to use mobile phones at SMS mode...|$|E
40|$|An Electric (E-) {{field sensor}} based on {{coplanar}} waveguide-fed microstrip antenna to measure E-field strength for dual-band operation at 914 MHz and 2. 1 GHz is proposed, designed, and characterized. The parametric optimization {{of the design}} has been performed to obtain resonance at global system for mobile communication and universal mobile telecommunication system frequency band. Low return loss (- 17 dB and - 19 dB), appropriate gain (0. 50 dB and 1. 55 dB), and isotropic behaviour (directivity similar to 1 dB), respectively, at 914 MHz and 2. 1 GHz, are obtained for probing application. Antenna factor (AF) is used as an important parameter to characterize {{the performance of the}} E-field sensor. The AF measurement is explained in detail and results are reported. Finally, using the designed E-field sensor, the E-field strength measurements are carried out in a transverse electromagnetic cell. The key sources of uncertainties in the measurement are identified, evaluated, and incorporated into the final results. The measurement results are compared with theoretical values, which are found in good agreement. For comparative validation, the results are evaluated with reference to an already calibrated commercially available <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe.</b> Published by AIP Publishing...|$|E

In this paper, we {{resume the}} results of {{electromagnetic}} radiation measurements performed {{in the city of}} Santander, mainly from mobile telephony base stations, but also from other communications systems that operate in the area, namely radio and television broadcasting, police, private communications, etc. Four different measuring equipments were used, two of them wideband with <b>isotropic</b> <b>probes</b> and two, narrowband with dipole antennas. Special attention was put in places such as schools and geriatric residences. Furthermore, a wide survey through the urban area of the city was carried out, collecting more than 3000 samples at street level which were statistically analyzed...|$|R

40|$|With recent {{growth in}} the use of fluorescence-detected {{resonance}} energy transfer (FRET), it is being applied to complex systems in modern and diverse ways where it is not always clear that the common approximations required for analysis are applicable. For instance, the ideal dipole approximation (IDA), which is implicit in the Forster equation, is known to break down when molecules get ‘‘too close’’ to each other. Yet, no clear definition exists of what is meant by ‘‘too close’’. Here we examine several common fluorescent probe molecules to determine boundaries for use of the IDA. We compare the Coulombic coupling determined essentially exactly with a linear response approach with the IDA coupling to find the distance regimes over which the IDA begins to fail. We find that the IDA performs well down to roughly 20 A separation, provided the molecules sample an isotropic set of relative orientations. However, if molecular motions are restricted, the IDA performs poorly at separations beyond 50 A. Thus, <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> motions help mask poor performance of the IDA through cancellation of error. Therefore, if fluorescent probe motions are restricted, FRET practitioners should be concerned with not only the well-known k 2 approximation, but also possible failure of the IDA...|$|E
40|$|Administration of the {{synthetic}} estrogen ethinyl estradiol (17 α-ethinyl- 1, 3, 5 -estratriene- 3, 17 β-diol) decreases hepatic Na+,K+-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase; EC 3. 6. 1. 3) activity and bile flow to 50 % and alters {{the composition and}} structure of surface membrane lipid in rats. Although the content of phospholipids was not changed by treatment, free cholesterol (130 %) and cholesterol esters (400 %) were increased in liver surface membrane fractions. These observations correlate with changes in membrane viscosity, as shown by electron spin resonance probes. Both rotational correlation time, using the <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> methyl (12 -nitroxyl) stearate, and the order parameter, determined by the anisotropic probe 5 -nitroxylstearic acid, were significantly increased in liver surface membrane fractions from rats treated with ethinyl estradiol. Administration of Triton WR- 1339, a nonionic detergent that corrects hepatic and serum lipid changes caused by ethinyl estradiol treatment, restored toward normal elevated membrane lipids and viscosity as well as Na+,K+-ATPase activity and bile flow. Although restoration of normal liver surface membrane structure and function {{may be due to}} reversal of abnormal lipid composition, detergents also may directly alter membrane enzyme activity. Addition of Triton WR- 1339 in vitro increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity and reduced membrane viscosity of surface membranes from rats treated with ethinyl estradiol. Triton had no effect on either parameter in normal membrane preparations. Studies of membrane structure and function both in vivo and in vitro suggest that alterations in lipid composition may alter Na+,K+-ATPase function and bile flow...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{radiowave}} {{exposure is}} a major concern in most countries due to possible adverse health effects. Over the last 10 years, many technological changes (digital television, mobile technologies, wireless networks…) have led to variations in the electromagnetic field (EMF) levels. A large number of studies devoted to the analysis of EMF levels with personal dosimeters or computer models of the exposure of mobile stations have been conducted. However, the study of the exposure values, taking into account all the existing sources, and their evolution in a wide area, using measurements, has rarely been performed. In this paper, we provide a comparison of the EMF exposure levels for the city of Alcalá de Henares (Spain) over a ten-year period using a broadband <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> in the range from 100 kHz to 3 GHz. A statistical and spatial analysis of the measurements and their variations are also presented {{for the study of the}} global and local variations. The measured values in the period from 2006 to 2015 were ranging from 0. 02 to 2. 05 V/m. Our global results show a moderate increase from 2006 to 2010 and they are almost invariant from 2010 to 2015. Although the whole dataset does not have relevant statistical difference, we have found marked local differences. In the city areas where the population density has remained unaltered, we have measured lower exposure levels. Conversely, new urban and industrial developments have demanded new resources, which have potentially contributed to the observed increase in the measured electric field levels within these areas...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{trapping}} {{techniques have}} been used to investigate fundamental biological processes ranging from the identification of the processive mechanisms of kinesin and myosin to understanding the mechanics of DNA. To date, these investigations have relied almost exclusively on the use of <b>isotropic</b> <b>probes</b> based on colloidal microspheres. However, there are many potential advantages in utilizing more complex probe morphologies: use of multiple trapping points enables control of the interaction volume; increasing the distance between the optical trap and the sample minimizes photodamage in sensitive biological materials; and geometric anisotropy introduces the potential for asymmetric surface chemistry and multifunctional probes. Here we demonstrate that living cells of the freshwater diatom Nitzschia subacicularis Hustedt can be exploited as advanced probes for holographic optical tweezing applications. We characterize the optical and material properties associated with the high shape anisotropy of the silica frustule, examine the trapping behavior of the living algal cells, and demonstrate how the diatoms can be calibrated for use as force sensors and as force probes in the presence of rat B-cell hybridoma (11 B 11) cells...|$|R

40|$|Improved {{metrological}} capabilities for three-dimensional (3 D) {{measurements of}} various complex micro- and nanoparts are increasingly in demand. This paper gives {{an overview of}} the research activities carried out by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), the national metrology institute of Germany, to meet this demand. Examples of recent research advances in the development of instrumentation and calibration standards are presented. An ultra-precision nanopositioning and nanomeasuring machine (NMM) has been upgraded with regard to its mirror corner, interferometers and angle sensors, as well as its weight compensation, its electronic controller, its vibration damping stage and its instrument chamber. Its positioning noise has been greatly reduced, e. g., from 1 σ = 0. 52 nm to 1 σ = 0. 13 nm for the z-axis. The well-known tactile-optical fibre probe has been further improved with regard to its 3 D measurement capability, <b>isotropic</b> <b>probing</b> stiffness and dual-sphere probing styli. A 3 D atomic force microscope (AFM) and assembled cantilever probes (ACPs) have been developed which allow full 3 D measurements of smaller features with sizes from a few micrometres down to tens of nanometres. In addition, several measurement standards for force, geometry, contour and microgear measurements have been introduced. A type of geometry calibration artefact, referred to as the “ 3 D Aztec artefact”, has been developed which applies wet-etched micro-pyramidal marks for defining reference coordinates in 3 D space. Compared to conventional calibration artefacts, it has advantages such as a good surface quality, a well-defined geometry and cost-effective manufacturing. A task-specific micro-contour calibration standard has been further developed for ensuring the traceability of, e. g., high-precision optical measurements at microgeometries. A workpiece-like microgear standard embodying different gear geometries (modules ranging from 0. 1 mm to 1 mm) has also been developed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of phased protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) bleach kinetics {{has been shown}} to correlate with esophageal response to 5 -aminolevulinic acid-based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) in animal models. Here we confirm the existence of phased PpIX photobleaching by increasing the temporal resolution of the fluorescence measurements using the therapeutic illumination and long wavelength fluorescence detection. Furthermore fluorescence differential pathlength spectroscopy (FDPS) was incorporated to provide information on the effects of PpIX and tissue oxygenation distribution on the PpIX bleach kinetics during illumination. ALA at a dose of 200 mg kg(- 1) was orally administered to 15 rats, five rats served as control animals. PDT was performed at an in situ measured fluence rate of 75 mW cm(- 2) using a total fluence of 54 J cm(- 2). Forty-eight hours after PDT the esophagus was excised and histologically examined for PDT-induced damage. Fluence rate and PpIX photobleaching at 705 nm were monitored during therapeutic illumination with the same <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe.</b> A new method, FDPS, was used for superficial measurement on saturation, blood volume, scattering characteristics and PpIX fluorescence. Results showed two-phased PpIX photobleaching that was not related to a (systematic) change in esophageal oxygenation but was associated with an increase in average blood volume. PpIX fluorescence photobleaching measured using FDPS, in which fluorescence signals are only acquired from the superficial layers of the esophagus, showed lower rates of photobleaching and no distinct phases. No clear correlation between two-phased photobleaching and histologic tissue response was found. This study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring fluence rate, PpIX fluorescence and FDPS during PDT in the esophagus. We conclude that the spatial distribution of PpIX significantly influences the kinetics of photobleaching {{and that there is a}} complex interrelationship between the distribution of PpIX and the supply of oxygen to the illuminated tissue volum...|$|E
40|$|The {{separation}} between the two reactive thiols SH 1 (Cys- 704) and SH 2 (Cys- 694) and that between SH 1 and the active site of myosin subfragment- 1 were further investigated by Forster energy transfer techniques. The SH 1 -SH 2 distance was determined with the probe 5 [[2 -[(iodoacetyl) amino]ethyl]amino]naphthalene- 1 -sulfonic acid (AEDANS) attached to SH 1 as the energy donor and 5 -(iodoacetamido) fluorescein (IAF) attached to SH 2 as energy acceptor. The results derived from measurements of donor lifetimes yielded a donor-acceptor separation in the range 26 - 52 A, with the distance R(2 / 3) based on rapid and <b>isotropic</b> <b>probe</b> motions being 40 A. These parameters were not sensitive to added MgADP, in agreement with previous results obtained by using the steady-state method. The SH 1 -SH 2 distance was also determined with AEDANS attached to SH 1 and N-(4 -dimethylamino- 3, 5 -dinitrophenyl) maleimide (DDPM) attached to SH 2. The range in R for the AEDANS/DDPM pair was 12 - 36 A, with R(2 / 3) equal to 27 A. The transfer efficiency between these two probes increased {{by an average of}} 38 % upon addition of MgADP. These results are in agreement with those previously reported (Dalbey, R. E.; Weiel, J.; Yount, R. G. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 4696 - 4706), but the uncertainty in choosing an appropriate value of the orientation factor to describe the AEDANS-DDPM separation does not allow a unique interpretation of the observed increase in energy transfer because it could reflect either an increase in the average orientation factor or a decrease in the donor-acceptor separation. Nevertheless, the results are consistent with the notion that nucleotide binding induces structural perturbations that can be sensed by SH 1 and SH 2. The distance between SH 1 and the ATPase site was determined with AEDANS linked to SH 1 and the nucleotide analogue 2 '(3 ') -O-(2, 4, 6,-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5 '-diphosphate (TNP-ADP) noncovalently bound to the active site as energy acceptor. The bound TNP-ADP was highly immobilized, with a depolarization factor approaching unity. The sepration between AEDANS at SH 1 and TNP-ADP at the active site was in the range 15 - 44 A. The actual minimal {{separation between}} SH 1 and the active site is probably less than 15 A, which suggests that direct interaction between the two sites cannot be ruled out from energy transfer results...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIsotropic {{broadband}} probes or {{spectrum analyzers}} (SAs) {{may be used}} for the measurement of rapidly varying electromagnetic fields generated by emerging wireless communication systems. In this paper this problematic is investigated by comparing the responses measured by two different <b>isotropic</b> broadband <b>probes</b> typically used to perform electric field (E-field) evaluations. The broadband probes are submitted to signals with variable duty cycles (DC) and crest factors (CF) either with or without Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation but with the same root-mean-square (RMS) power. The two probes do not provide accurate enough results for deterministic signals such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WIMAX) or Long Term Evolution (LTE) as well as for non-deterministic signals such as Wireless Fidelity (WiFi). The legacy measurement protocols should be adapted to cope for the emerging wireless communication technologies based on the OFDM modulation scheme. This is not easily achieved except when the statistics of the RF emission are well known. In this case the measurement errors are shown to be systematic and a correction factor or calibration can be applied to obtain a good approximation of the total RMS power...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objective: In {{order to}} {{understand}} the mechanisms of photodynamic therapy (PDT) it is important to monitor parameters during illumination that yield information on deposited PDT dose. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the possibility of monitoring implicit parameters, such as photobleaching, in addition to monitoring explicit parameters (fluence (rate), oxygenation, photosensitizer concentration) directly or indirectly. These parameters are monitored during PDT without interrupting the therapeutic illumination. Materials and Methods: Rats were injected with 0. 3 mg kg(- 1) m-THPC. Sixteen hours after administration the abdominal muscle in rats was irradiated for 1, 500 seconds using clinically relevant fluence rates of 50, 100, and 250 mW cm(- 1) of diffuser length at 652 nm. In addition to the linear diffuser for delivering treatment light, <b>isotropic</b> fiber-optic <b>probes</b> and fiber-optic probes for differential path-length spectroscopy (DPS) were placed on both sides of the muscle to monitor tissue physiological parameters, fluence rate, and fluorescence. Results: The m-THPC treatment groups show a decrease in fluence rate throughout PDT of 16 %, 19 %, and 27 % for the 50, 100, and 250 mW cm(- 1) groups, respectively. Both during and post-PDT differences in vascular response between treatment groups and animals within the same treatment group are observed. Furthermore we show fluence rate dependent bleaching of m-THPC up to a measured fluence rate of 100 mW cm(- 1) Conclusion: The data presented in this study show the possibility of simultaneously monitoring fluence (rate), fluorescence, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and blood volume during PDT without interruptions to the therapeutic illumination. Differences in saturation profiles between animals and treatment groups indicate differences in vascular response during illumination.

Measurements were also made inside the helmet close to the metallic plate at 17 locations and 10 cm away from it.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra to study spin labels selectively and rigidly attached to myosin heads in glycerinated rabbit psoas muscle fibers. Because the angle between the magnetic field and the principal axis of the probe determines {{the position of the}} EPR absorption line, spectra from labeled fibers oriented parallel to the magnetic field yielded directly the distribution of spin label orientations relative to the fiber axis. Two spin labels, having reactivities resembling iodoacetamide (IASL) and maleimide (MSL), were used. In rigor fibers with complete filament overlap, both labels displayed a narrow angular distribution, full width at half maximum approximately 15 degrees, centered at angles of 68 degrees (IASL) and 82 degrees (MSL). Myosin subfragments (heavy meromyosin and subfragment- 1) were labeled and allowed to diffuse into fibers. The resulting spectra showed the same sharp angular distribution that was found for the labeled fibers. Thus is appears that virtually all myosin heads in a rigor fiber have the same orientation relative to the fiber axis, and this orientation is determined by the actomyosin bond. Experiments with stretched fibers indicated that the spin labels on the fraction of heads not interacting with actin filaments had a broad angular distribution. Addition of ATP to unstretched fibers under relaxing conditions produced orientational disorder, resulting in a spectrum almost indistinguishable from that of an <b>isotropic</b> distribution of <b>probes.</b> Addition of either an ATP analog (AMPPNP) or pyrophosphate produced partial disorder.
