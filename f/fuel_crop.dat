The cause of the blooms and their subsequent damage to the populations of other organisms has been studied. The exudate of Bb in the form of free fatty acids has been identified as the cause. A higher alkalinity changes these free fatty acids into a form which is more toxic to other species, thus causing Bb to become more dominant. Higher alkalinity often occurs when ashes from burned areas are washed into a body of water.

40|$|Climate-smart {{cropping}} systems {{should be designed}} with three objectives: reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, adapting to changing and fluctuating climate and environment, and securing food production sustainably. Agriculture can improve the net GHG emissions balance via three levers: less N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 emissions, more carbon storage, and green energy production (agrifuels, biogas). Reducing the application of mineral N fertilizer is the main option for reducing N 2 O emissions either directly or by increasing the proportion of legumes in the rotation. The most promising options for mitigating CH 4 emissions in paddy fields are based on mid-season drainage or intermittent irrigation. The second option is storing more carbon in soil and biomass by promoting no-tillage (less <b>fuel,</b> <b>crop</b> residues), sowing cover crops, introducing or maintaining grasslands and promoting agroforestry. Breeding for varieties better adapted to thermal shocks and drought is mainly suggested as long-term adaptation to climate change. Short-term strategies have been identified from current practices {{to take advantage of}} more favorable growing conditions or to offset negative impacts: shifting sowing dates, changing species, cultivars and crop rotations, modifying soil management and fertilization, introducing or expanding irrigation. Some crops could also move to more suitable locations. Model-based tools and site-specific technologies should be developed to optimize, support and secure farmer's decisions in a context of uncertainty and hazards. Most of the adaptation and mitigation options are going in the same way but trade-offs will have to be addressed (e. g. increasing the part of legumes will be possible only with significant breeding efforts). This will be a challenge for designing {{cropping systems}} in a multifunctional perspective. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

30|$|It is also {{possible}} that there will be climate-adaptation rationales that apply to biofuel. Here, the idea would be that development and utilization of biofuels would be undertaken in order to help counter some of the adverse impact of climate change. Within the context of agriculture, adaptation generally involves the development of new crops and new farming systems that will help farmers cope with changes in temperature, humidity and rainfall that are associated with climate change. In many cases, the challenge of adapting agricultural production will be extreme and may preclude all currently viable systems for agricultural production. In less drastic cases, farmers will search for crops (possibly including tree crops) that do well under changed climatic conditions. It is possible that crops useful for fuel production will be among them (Howden et al. 2007). However, the role that biofuels will play in adaptation is very unclear. The suggestion that growing crops for fuel rather than food will help farmers cope with climate change implies that the <b>fuel</b> <b>crop</b> will have unambiguous agronomic advantages over all food crops, but the current evidence for such a case is speculative (Smith 2010). What is more likely is that in a world with well-developed markets for biofuel, production of crops for fuel will prove more economically attractive than production of food crops for some farmers who have been harmed by climate change. However, to characterize such a scenario as providing an adaptation-oriented rationale for biofuels is to make an exceedingly broad claim. By this standard, virtually any economic development activity becomes an adaptation strategy. Until a more clearly articulated adaptation rationale is articulated, it is reasonable to presume that biofuels fit into climate ethics primarily as a mitigation strategy, though one should recognize that there may be other non-climate-related rationales that are ethically persuasive.|$|E
40|$|Metabolomics is an {{emerging}} method {{to improve our}} understanding of how genetic diversity affects phenotypic variation in plants. Recent studies have demonstrated that genotype has a major influence on biochemical diversity in several types of plant tissues, however, the association between metabolic diversity and variation in morphological and physiological traits is largely unknown. Sorghum bicolor (L.) is an important food and <b>fuel</b> <b>crop</b> with extensive genetic and phenotypic variation. Sorghum lines have been bred for differing phenotypes beneficial for production of grain (food), stem sugar (food, fuel), and cellulosic biomass (forage, fuel), and these varying phenotypes are the end products of innate metabolic programming which determines how carbon is allocated during plant growth and development. Further, sorghum has been adapted among highly diverse environments. Because of this geographic and phenotypic variation, the sorghum metabolome is expected to be highly divergent; however, metabolite variation in sorghum has not been characterized. Here, we utilize a phenotypically diverse panel of sorghum breeding lines to identify associations between leaf metabolites and morpho-physiological traits. The panel (11 lines) exhibited significant variation for 21 morpho-physiological traits, as well as broader trends in variation by sorghum type (grain vs. biomass types). Variation was also observed for cell wall constituents (glucan, xylan, lignin, ash). Non-targeted metabolomics analysis of leaf tissue showed that 956 of 1181 metabolites varied among the lines (81 %, ANOVA, FDR adjusted p < 0. 05). Both univariate and multivariate analyses determined relationships between metabolites and morpho-physiological traits, and 384 metabolites correlated with at least one trait (32 %, p < 0. 05), including many secondary metabolites such as glycosylated flavonoids and chlorogenic acids. The use of metabolomics to explain relationships between two or more morpho-physiological traits was explored and showed chlorogenic and shikimic acid to be associated with photosynthesis, early plant growth and final biomass measures in sorghum. Taken together, this study demonstrates the integration of metabolomics with morpho-physiological datasets to elucidate links between plant metabolism, growth, and architecture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Switchgrass, a C 4 {{species and}} a warm-season grass {{native to the}} prairies of North America, has been {{targeted}} for development into an herbaceous biomass <b>fuel</b> <b>crop.</b> Genetic improvement of switchgrass feedstock traits through marker-assisted breeding and biotechnology approaches calls for genomic tools development. Establishment of integrated physical and genetic maps for switchgrass will accelerate mapping of value added traits useful to breeding programs and to isolate important target genes using map based cloning. The reported polyploidy series in switchgrass ranges from diploid (2 X = 18) to duodecaploid (12 X = 108). Like in other large, repeat-rich plant genomes, this genomic complexity will hinder whole genome sequencing efforts. An extensive physical map providing enough information to resolve the homoeologous genomes would provide the necessary framework for accurate assembly of the switchgrass genome. Results A switchgrass BAC library constructed by partial digestion of nuclear DNA with Eco RI contains 147, 456 clones covering the effective genome approximately 10 times based on a genome size of 3. 2 Gigabases (~ 1. 6 Gb effective). Restriction digestion and PFGE analysis of 234 randomly chosen BACs indicated that 95 % of the clones contained inserts, ranging from 60 to 180 kb {{with an average of}} 120 kb. Comparative sequence analysis of two homoeologous genomic regions harboring orthologs of the rice OsBRI 1 locus, a low-copy gene encoding a putative protein kinase and associated with biomass, revealed that orthologous clones from homoeologous chromosomes can be unambiguously distinguished from each other and correctly assembled to respective fingerprint contigs. Thus, the data obtained not only provide genomic resources for further analysis of switchgrass genome, but also improve efforts for an accurate genome sequencing strategy. Conclusions The construction of the first switchgrass BAC library and comparative analysis of homoeologous harboring OsBRI 1 orthologs present a glimpse into the switchgrass genome structure and complexity. Data obtained demonstrate the feasibility of using HICF fingerprinting to resolve the homoeologous chromosomes of the two distinct genomes in switchgrass, providing a robust and accurate BAC-based physical platform for this species. The genomic resources and sequence data generated will lay the foundation for deciphering the switchgrass genome and lead the way for an accurate genome sequencing strategy. </p...|$|E

30|$|Thompson {{argues that}} the focus on non-food crops {{to escape from the}} food-versus-fuel dilemma misses the mark. If a farmer grew {{miscanthus}} or jatropha instead of maize as a <b>fuel</b> <b>crop,</b> this would just as well affect the supply of maize for food, albeit more indirectly. Ultimately, due to the interconnection of the markets for agricultural products, all the various forms of land use are in competition with each other. Nor would the development of cellulosic ethanol resolve the tension. As Thompson remarks, “the ethical issue is not one of finding technically feasible alternatives to crops currently used for food. It is rather in the socio-economic priorities that dictate which of many technically feasible possibilities will be realized in practice” (Thompson 2012, p. 347). In fact, the successful development of cellulosic ethanol would even put food and fuel production into more direct competition with each other, at least theoretically, because if cellulose can be converted into sugar and starch the latter could theoretically also be processed further into food rather than being transformed into ethanol for blending with petrol. The fact that no practical technologist would pursue this ‘theoretical’ goal only reflects the relative value judgments that are embodied in current world prices for food and fuel and thus underscores precisely the ethical point Thompson is trying to make. As a society we place so much more value on driving our cars than on ending world hunger, that we uncritically accept the relative prices of fuel and food that express our valuations as the correct signals for economic action. This not only holds for allocating given resources in the market, but also for decisions to pursue certain research lines aimed at developing new resources. Here we find a similar moral issue: “The fact that poor people cannot compete with rich people for basic grains is structurally isomorphic {{to the fact that they}} cannot compete with the rich when it comes to land use allocation or to capital investment in new technology” (ibid., p. 349). In line with Thompson’s analysis we can reframe and generalize the underlying ethical issue in the food-versus-fuel dilemma. The ultimate ethical problem, then, is that the priorities and the claims of the rich carry so much more weight in world markets than the needs of the poor, both in determining what gets produced and in determining the direction of the research effort. Just as pharmaceutical research is skewed in serving the desires of the rich rather than the needs of the poor (by developing drugs against baldness or erectile dysfunction rather than against Chagas disease), so the biotechnological research aiming at advanced generations of biofuels is similarly driven first and foremost by the priorities of the rich (Pogge 2005). In a finite world this will lead to a further displacement of the needs of the poor. We may add to Thompson’s analysis that it is mainly the institutional mechanism of the patent system (itself a global system since the TRIPS Agreement of 1994) that connects the research effort to the wants and priorities of the rich (Timmermann and Van den Belt 2013; Pogge 2005).|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Bioethanol and {{biodiesel}} {{are currently}} the main biofuels. The United States of America and Brazil {{are the major}} bioethanol producers from maize and sugar cane respectively. European and Asian countries produce and consume biodiesel as transportation fuel. Generally, governments want to avoid importing biofuels, since this erodes the advantage of fuel security from growing fuel locally. There are however opportunities for many African countries to export to Europe and the United States of America, since they have preferential import tax exemption agreements with African countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has large potential to produce biomass. Inherently, South Africa has poor potential to produce biomass, due to the climatic conditions and water scarcity. However, South Africa has infrastructure, skills, commercial farmers and, importantly, government policy on biofuels. These advantages should be leveraged to optimise gains from a biofuel industry. A biofuels industry holds potential in terms of job creation and rural development gains, apart from the advantages of fuel security, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, stimulation of the agricultural sector, and reduced fuel imports with the balance of payment advantages. The South African government aims to develop rural communities in former homeland areas. If degraded land in these areas is recovered and used for production of biofuels, the environmental benefits are immediate and substantial. <b>Fuel</b> <b>crop</b> production in these areas does not compromise food security nor does it result in further deforestation. Creating jobs in rural areas can contribute to reduction of poverty. The Department of Minerals and Energy (DME) published its strategy in 2007. This excluded maize as permitted bioethanol feedstock, it sets a two per cent liquid fuels penetration target, and gave fuel tax exemptions for biodiesel and bioethanol. The biofuels would be distributed through voluntary low concentration blending into petroleum products by oil companies. The industry would be regulated and producers require licensing through the South African Revenue Service (SARS). The license conditions were mainly related {{to the type of}} feedstock, where it was produced, volumes produced, local consumption, environmentally friendliness, compliance with broad based black economic empowerment requirements and it should not compete with food sources. The strategy is up for review after the initial five years phase. Currently there are no commercial bioethanol fuel production plants in South Africa and only some small scale biodiesel production plants with very limited outlets to consumers. With all the apparent advantages, why is nothing happening in the industry? Business is not showing interest, proving that the economic conditions are not favourable. The government wants to control the production side to maximise the gains from it, but instead of assisting the industry, it has practically inhibited it from getting started. The consumers must also be prepared to accept the new fuels. Awareness, education and a culture of sustainable use are vital to create the required market. This is an exciting industry with potential benefits to South Africa and its society as a whole, but the fundamental elements of business must be in place in order for it to become self-sustainable...|$|E
