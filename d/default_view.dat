50|$|Facelets was {{originally}} created by Jacob Hookom in 2005 as a separate, alternative view declaration language for JSF 1.1 and JSF 1.2 that both used JSP as the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> declaration language. Starting from JSF 2.0, Facelets {{has been promoted}} by the JSF expert group to be the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> declaration language. JSP has been deprecated as a legacy fall back.|$|E

50|$|The {{text view}} is the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> for editing an XML document. As the name suggests, this view shows the XML text as text.|$|E
50|$|For ease of use, several <b>default</b> <b>views</b> exist {{which show}} files of a {{specified}} type only, including: audio, images, or video.|$|R
50|$|The {{framework}} is entirely {{driven by a}} data model. Once the data model is defined, one gets a functional web application and can further customize the <b>views</b> (by <b>default</b> it provides a set of <b>default</b> <b>views</b> {{for each type of}} data).|$|R
50|$|Various view items, or panes, can {{be aligned to}} the top, left, right, {{or moved}} in {{drop-down}} menus, {{that can be used}} to further filter results. For example, one of the <b>default</b> <b>views,</b> artist/album, allows selecting a specific artist or album, or both, and shows files from that album or artist only.|$|R
50|$|The <b>default</b> <b>view</b> mode is the {{playback}} {{view and}} can be changed via -V option. Also, each view mode can be switched via keyboard commands.|$|E
5000|$|... "Despite {{the fact}} that presentism has the firm backing of common sense and eternalism revolts against it, eternalism is widely {{regarded}} as almost the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> in contemporary debates, and presentism as a highly problematic view." ...|$|E
5000|$|Facelets, the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> {{technology}} in JavaServer Faces, was reportedly inspired by early versions of Tapestry, {{as an attempt}} to fill the need for [...] "a framework like Tapestry, backed by JavaServer Faces as the industry standard".|$|E
5000|$|CubicWeb is an {{open source}} {{semantic}} web framework entirely driven by a data model. High-level directives allow to refine the data model iteratively, release after release. Defining the data model is {{enough to get a}} functioning web application. Further work is required to define how the data is displayed when the <b>default</b> <b>views</b> are not sufficient.|$|R
50|$|The tabs {{are hidden}} by <b>default.</b> This <b>view</b> only shows {{applications}} and their associated processes.|$|R
40|$|Two factors {{govern the}} {{performance}} of computerized systems for classifying foraminiferal tests (forams) from optical microscopy images: (1) {{the amount of information}} captured by the images; and (2) the ability of computer algorithms to exploit the information. This paper provides an analysis of the former, to understand the efficacy and limitations of digital images in foram representation. To this end, 500 images were captured to show default (unmanipulated) and alternative views of 250 variable-grade specimens taken from 25 core samples. The specimens (mainly planktic forams) were classified by a specialist three times: first, from the <b>default</b> <b>views</b> alone; second, from the <b>default</b> and alternative <b>views</b> together; and third, from the archived particles. Image and particle-based classifications were compared using statistical methods to establish significance. <b>Default</b> <b>views</b> alone were sufficient to realize low incorrect genus and species rates and high correct genus rates, irrespective of specimen quality, view side, and image quality. Availability of alternative views had only a minimal impact on performance, at least for the statistical sample. However, image quality, which was primarily limited by depth-of-field issues, {{had a significant impact on}} performance. To facilitate this work, an online database called the Microfossil Wiki was developed. All images and classifications referred to here are accessible via the wiki...|$|R
50|$|KCalc is the {{software}} calculator {{integrated with the}} KDE Software Compilation. In the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> it includes a number pad, buttons for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, brackets, memory keys, percent, reciprocal, factorial, square, square root, and x {{to the power of}} y buttons.|$|E
50|$|In computing, Facelets is an {{open-source}} Web template {{system under}} the Apache license and the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> handler technology (aka view declaration language) for JavaServer Faces (JSF). The language requires valid input XML documents to work. Facelets supports {{all of the}} JSF UI components and focuses completely on building the JSF component tree, reflecting the view for a JSF application.|$|E
5000|$|Developers {{need to be}} wary of storing {{sensitive}} {{or private}} information in the View state of a page or control, as the base64 string containing the view state data can easily be de-serialized. By <b>default,</b> <b>View</b> state does not encrypt the [...] value. Encryption can be enabled on a server-wide (and server-specific) basis, allowing for a certain level of security to be maintained.|$|E
2500|$|... iTunes 11 {{removes the}} Cover Flow option, {{previously}} the <b>default</b> <b>viewing</b> method for a user's music collection. It also disables the sidebar by default, focusing on spreading content across {{the width of}} the window. The status bar is also disabled by default. Both of these may be reactivated by the user. The sidebar design has been slightly altered, reinstating the colored icons removed in iTunes 10. When the sidebar is not activated, users can move between media libraries using a drop down menu below the control buttons.|$|R
50|$|The February 2016 Release {{introduced}} Skill Trading, allowing {{players to}} transfer skillpoints between characters, {{and a new}} <b>default</b> camera <b>view</b> with features such as first person view, marquee select and improved zoom options.|$|R
50|$|Trace files {{generated}} by ktrace (named ktrace.out by <b>default)</b> can be <b>viewed</b> in human-readable form {{by using the}} kdump utility.|$|R
50|$|Photos {{provides}} {{the ability to}} organize digital photo collection in its gallery view by selecting photos and arranging photos by albums. The <b>default</b> <b>view</b> is Collection, which is sorted by date. Users can also view items by Album or Folder view. Album view shows both auto-generated and user-generated albums. Folder view displays files based on their location in File Explorer. Users can choose which folders to display.|$|E
5000|$|Driftmoons {{rudimentary}} set of key bindings {{can also}} be changed via the [...] "Options" [...] menu. Notable key commands include [...] "pause combat", [...] "toggle item highlights" [...] (to indicate items {{on the ground and}} objects in the environment for user interaction), [...] "show map" [...] (to display the current areas local map), and tilt camera up / down (the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> of the games 2D graphics is a top-down perspective).|$|E
5000|$|Wikipedia {{articles}} consist {{mostly of}} free text, but also include structured information {{embedded in the}} articles, such as [...] "infobox" [...] tables (the pull-out panels that appear in the top right of the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> of many Wikipedia articles, or {{at the start of}} the mobile versions), categorisation information, images, geo-coordinates and links to external Web pages. This structured information is extracted and put in a uniform dataset which can be queried.|$|E
25|$|Financier George Soros {{called for}} an {{outright}} ban on naked credit <b>default</b> swaps, <b>viewing</b> them as “toxic” and allowing speculators to bet against and “bear raid” companies or countries. His concerns were echoed by several European politicians who, during the Greek Financial Crisis, accused naked CDS buyers of making the crisis worse.|$|R
5000|$|Customization - This feature allow {{users to}} {{customize}} several available features such as: email appointment remainders, calendar <b>viewing</b> <b>default,</b> workweek and work hours display, etc.|$|R
50|$|Gmail {{places the}} cursor above quoted text when replying, which {{encourages}} top-posting. Regardless of the formatting of received messages, Gmail's conversation <b>view</b> <b>defaults</b> to showing only unique content, in chronological order.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>default</b> <b>view</b> for {{the client}} window is {{referred}} to as [...] "tree view", but can be configured for a tabbed interface instead. Tabs change color as text arrives, other users enter or leave channels, or another user addresses the user's nickname. The interface can display clickable operator ("op") commands and others, and allows customization of fonts, event sounds, timestamps, and logging. XChat implements all standard IRC commands (e.g. [...] or [...] ), as well as DCC chatting (...) , which allows chat to continue if the IRC server is disconnected.|$|E
50|$|There are tools on {{the website}} for viewing an {{interactive}} pathway diagram, performing pathway mapping and pathway over-representation analysis and for overlaying expression data onto Reactome pathways. The pathway mapping and over-representation tools take a single column of protein/compound identifiers, Uniprot and ChEBI accessions are preferred but the interface will accept and interpret many other identifiers or symbols. Mixed identifiers can be used. Over-representation results are presented as a list of statistically over-represented pathways (note that the <b>default</b> <b>view</b> only shows the major pathway topics, {{which may not be}} the most significant, click on the Open All button to see the subpathways).|$|E
50|$|Looks are {{displayed}} {{a variety of}} different ways on the website. The <b>default</b> <b>view</b> of the site is via the Hot tab, which shows those looks which are most popular on the site, judged by the amount of hype it has received, and its popularity on that day in competition with other looks. A second tab, New, shows all looks uploaded, with the most recent shown first. The New tab offers a feature known as the Karma Filter, which allows for users with a higher karmic average to be featured more prominently on the feed. The Top tab features the most popular Looks posted - and can be sorted by day/week/month/year.|$|E
50|$|AmigaGuide is the <b>default</b> {{tool for}} <b>viewing</b> AmigaGuide files used with AmigaOS 2.1, {{and is also}} a basic text viewer for ASCII documents. It can handle {{multiple}} files thanks to cross-linking tables called XREF.|$|R
5000|$|Internet: select or {{install a}} default browser, set the homepage, {{and change the}} <b>default</b> search engine. <b>View</b> enabled {{toolbars}} and add-ons, descriptions of them, and whether Soluto recommends the item be disabled. Disable toolbars and add-ons.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{development}} {{of the theory of}} default information structures, combining ideas from domain theory with ideas from non-monotonic logic. Conceptually, our treatment ii distinguished from standard default logic in that we <b>view</b> <b>default</b> structures as generating models rather than theories. Reiter's <b>default</b> rules are <b>viewed</b> as non-deterministic algorithms for generating preferred partial models. Using domain-theoretical notions, we suggest a robust alternative to the standard definition of extensions in default logic, by introducing the notion of dilation. We prove the existence of such dilations for a new class of default information structures, called the class of rational structures, which properly includes the class of semi-normal structures. Keywordr. Default reasoning, domain theory, non-monotonicity. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{island was}} {{displayed}} on the Google Maps Internet mapping service until 26 November 2012, when it was removed. On Google Earth's <b>default</b> <b>view</b> the island area is covered by black pixels, but the program's historical imagery feature displays a satellite image of the southern portion taken by DigitalGlobe on 3 March 2009, showing a darkened sea. On 29 November 2012, the National Geographic Society {{announced that it was}} officially striking Sandy Island from its maps. [...] "The Geographer" [...] at National Geographic, Juan Valdes, said, [...] "full evidence has finally been presented. 'Sandy Island' has now been officially stricken from all National Geographic map products".|$|E
50|$|In August 2010, Bing Maps {{launched}} an overhauled design for its <b>default</b> <b>view.</b> The new colors {{create a more}} visually appealing backdrop for information delivery that helps content ‘pop’ on the map. The backdrop provides clear differentiation for pushpins, labels and red, yellow and green traffic overlays. These design principles also works well {{in black and white}} and creates differentiation for those with the most common forms of color blindness.Also, larger fonts correspond to larger roads to help customers more easily identify main roads in cities. More readable labels eliminate the need for bolding and less-attractive glows. The inclusion of neighborhood labels allows users to quickly find or convey locations in a commonly used and highly relevant format.|$|E
5000|$|Outlook Mail is the webmail {{component}} of Outlook on the web. It has an interface {{similar to the}} mail part of Outlook Web App before it. The <b>default</b> <b>view</b> is a three column view with folders and groups on the left, email in the center, and on the right the selected message. As of the 2015 Outlook on the web update, Microsoft introduced the ability to pin messages, sweep, archive, undo, and richer image editing features. Outlook Mail added the ability to connect to other services such as GitHub and Twitter through Office 365 Connectors. Actionable Messages in emails allows a user to complete a task from within the email, such as retweeting a Tweet on Twitter or setting a meeting date on a calendar.|$|E
50|$|Road <b>view</b> is the <b>default</b> map <b>view</b> and {{displays}} vector imagery of roads, buildings, and geography. The data {{from which the}} default road map is rendered is licensed from Navteq. In {{certain parts of the}} world, road view maps from alternative data providers are also available. For example, when viewing a map of London, road data from the Collins Bartholomew London Street Map may be displayed. In all parts of the UK, road data from the Ordnance Survey can also be displayed. A Bing Maps app is available that will display road data from OpenStreetMap.|$|R
5000|$|Firebird {{supports}} multiple row-level, BEFORE or AFTER, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (or {{any combination}} thereof) triggers per table, {{where they are}} always [...] "in addition to" [...] the default table changes, and {{the order of the}} triggers relative to each other can be specified where it would otherwise be ambiguous (POSITION clause.) Triggers may also exist on views, where they are always [...] "instead of" [...] triggers, replacing the <b>default</b> updatable <b>view</b> logic. (Before version 2.1, triggers on views deemed updatable would run in addition to the default logic.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Mylist: Each user {{may create}} [...] "mylists", which {{function}} similarly {{to a list}} of bookmarks. All users can create up to 25 mylist folders, while a basic account can have 100 videos recorded and a premium (paid) account 500 videos per mylist, giving them a total of 12,500 mylist spots. Daily mylist activity is used to compute the <b>default</b> ranking <b>view,</b> although one may also sort by view or comment count. Mylists may be optionally made public and linked to; for example, to make a list of one's own works.|$|R
