These endings often measure ∼ 18 µ in length by ∼ 3 – 4 µ in width. The axoplasm of the endings contains very few synaptic vesicles, {{a large number of}} neurofilaments oriented parallel to the long axis of the nerve fiber, and microtubules and numerous mitochondria. The synaptic membrane complex shows areas of localized occlusion of the synaptic cleft with the formation of an <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> membrane.

A standard glazed flat plate collector and an evacuated tube collector are installed in parallel and tested at the same working conditions; the evacuated collector is a direct flow through type with <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> parabolic concentrator (CPC) reflectors. Efficiency in steady-state and quasi-dynamic conditions is measured following the standard EN 12975 - 2 and it is compared with the input/output curves measured for the whole day. The first purpose of the present work is the comparison of results in steady-state and quasi-dynamic test methods both for flat plate and evacuated tube collectors. Beside this, the objective is to characterize and to compare the daily energy performance of these two types of collectors. An effective mean for describing and analyzing the daily performance is the so called input/output diagram, in which the collected solar energy is plotted against the daily incident solar radiation. Test runs have been performed in several conditions to reproduce different conventional uses (hot water, space heating, solar cooling). Results are also presented in terms of daily efficiency versus daily average reduced temperature difference: this allows to represent the comparative characteristics of the two collectors when operating under variable conditions, especially with wide range of incidence angles...|$|E

Its performance in providing power for space cooling has been analyzed. This solar cooling system is comprised of 53. 3 m 2 of XCPC trough collectors which are used to power a 23 kW double effect (LiBr) absorption chiller. This is the first system that combines both XCPC and absorption chilling technologies. Performance of the system was measured in both sunny and cloudy conditions. The collector system maintained operating temperatures between 160 - 200 °C. When operated in this temperature range, the XCPC collector array collected solar energy with an average daily efficiency of 36. 7 % and reached instantaneous efficiencies up to 40 %. The thermal COP of the system (including thermal losses and COP of absorption chiller) averaged at 0. 99 and the daily solar COP of the entire system averaged 0. 363.

Three distinct open queueing network models (QNMS) under CPS, PSS and ASS, respectively, are described, subject to <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> Poisson traffic processes and generalised exponential (GE) transmission times under a repetitive service blocking mechanism and a complete buffer sharing management rule. Each QNM generally consists of three building block stations, namely a loss system with GSM/GPRS traffic and a system of access and transfer finite capacity queues in tandem dealing with GPRS traffic under head-of-line and discriminatory processor sharing scheduling disciplines, respectively. The analytic methodology is illustrated by focusing on the performance study of the GE-type tandem queueing system for GPRS under a CPS. An ME product-form approximation is characterised leading into a decomposition of the tandem system into individual queues and closed-form ME expressions for state and blocking probabilities are presented. Typical numerical examples are included to validate the ME solutions against simulation and study the effect of external GPRS bursty traffic upon the performance of the cell. Moreover, an overview of recent extensions of the work towards the analysis of a GE-type multiple server finite capacity queue with preemptive resume priorities and its implications towards the performance modelling and evaluation of GSM/GPRS cells with PSS and ASS are included. ...|$|E

Their sheaths are {{found to have a}} consistent and unique structure that is unlike vertebrate myelin in four respects: (1) The sheath is composed of l 0 to 50 thin (200 - to 1000 -A) layers or laminac; each lamina is a cellular process that contains cytoplasm and wraps concentrically around the axon. The laminae do not connect to form a spiral; in fact, no cytoplasmic continuity has been demonstrated among thcm. (2) Nuclei of sheath cells occur only in the innermost lamina of the sheath; thus, they lie between the sheath and the axon rather than outside the sheath as in vertebrate myelinated fibers. (3) In regions in which the structural integrity of the sheath is most prominent, radially oriented stacks of desmosomes are formed between adjacent laminae.

New Internet applications, mostly multimedia-based, require differentiated treatments under certain QoS constraints. Due to a rapid increase in these new services, Internet routers are facing serious traffic congestion problems. This paper presents an approximate analytical performance model in a discrete-time queue, based on closed form expressions using queue threshold, to control the congestion caused by the bursty Internet traffic. The methodology of maximum entropy (ME) has been used to characterize closed form expressions for the state and blocking probabilities.

This creates an implicit feedback from the queue to the arrival process. The system can be potentially used as a model for congestion control based on the Random Early Detection (RED) mechanism. Typical numerical experiments have been included to show the credibility of ME solution against simulation for various performance measures and to demonstrate the performance evaluation of the proposed analytical model...|$|E

Many preparations were stained before embedding with phosphotungstic acid or after sectioning with uranyl acetate. Typical intercalated discs are observed in this muscle. They {{are similar to the}} discs found in heart muscle. These intercalated discs represent boundaries between separate muscle cells. Along the discs, cells are joined in planes normal to their myofilaments. The same cells are also joined in planes parallel to the myofilaments by means of lateral interconnections. These lateral cell boundaries are in continuity with the intercalated discs. Three morphologically distinct parts occur within the lateral cell interconnections: One is characterized by small vesicles along the plasma membrane, the second part has the structure of desmosomes, and a third part represents an <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> membrane (formed by the two plasma membranes of the adjoining cells) and is termed "quintuple-layered cell interconnection.

However, in solution, many parameters (pH, ionic strength) and <b>external</b> <b>compounds</b> (polyelectrolytes, nanoparticles) can modify biomacromolecule structure as well as acid/base properties, thus resulting {{in a loss of}} activity and denaturation. In this paper, the impact of neutral and charged nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations on polypeptide (PP) chains with primary structure based on bovine serum albumin. The influence of pH, salt valency, and NP surface charge density is systematically studied. It is found that the PP is extended at extreme pH, when no complex formation is observed, and folded at physiological pH. PP adsorption around oppositely-charged NPs strongly limits chain structural changes and modifies its acid/base properties. At physiological pH, the complex formation occurs only with positively-charged NPs. The presence of salts, in particular those with trivalent cations, introduces additional electrostatic interactions, resulting in a mitigation of the impact of negative NPs. Thus, the corona structure is less dense with locally-desorbed segments. On the contrary, very limited impact of salt cation valency is observed when NPs are positive, due to the absence of competitive effects between multivalent cations and NP...|$|R

40|$|Nitriding and {{carbonitriding}} treatments {{generate on}} the surface of the steel workpieces a combined double layer with an <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> layer of nitrides and carbonitrides and an inner layer with the microstructure of the base steel modified by nitrogen enrichment by diffusion. Tlte composition and constitution of the compound layer depend both on the treatment conditions and on the composition and microstructure of the base material. Off course, to different constitution correspond also differences in properties and technological behaviour: hardness, porosity, wear and corrosion resistance, etc. In the paper the compound layers obtained by the same "hard nitriding" treatment on steels of different carbon content have been examined. The interaction of nitrogen with the steel surface can produce too different nitrides: the γ-Fe 4 N and the ε-Fe 2 N. Only the latter can dissolve significant amount of carbon, up to about 3 %. Tγe nitriding of pure iron (or ferrite) usually produce at first the γ′-nitride, and subsequently the C, superimposed to the first γ′layer. But the progressive growth of the C layer generate some porosity, coming from the partial decomposition in the inner zone of the layer of this nitride, not more in equilibrium with the external nitriding atmosfere, Therefore the nitriding compound layer on ferrite, or pure iron, is a double layer, with a thick external layer of C nitride over an inner layer of γ′-nitride. The nitriding mechanism of the steels is more complex because, as contemporary to the previously described phenomena, also occur the interaction of the nitrogen with the cementite, the iron carbide, which produce the c-carbonitride. Therefore the compound layer assume a more complex constitution: a nitrogen rich ε-carbonitride as surface layer, an intermediate γ′ layer, and a inner, carbon rich, carbonitridc layer. The compound layer obtained on steel samples shown in Table 1 have been examined by usual metallographic techniques (OM and SEM, backscattered electron images), X-ray diffraction and hardness measurements. In the same Table 1 hardness and thickness of compound layer obtained are also reported. XRD results in Fig. 1, enlighten the different constitution of surface compound layers obtained on various steels: the different ratios between the C and γ′ nitrides and the progressive formation of carbonitrides, increasing the carbon content of the treated steel. The microstructures of the compound layers are reported in the Fig. 2 - 11. The double layer C and γ′' are evident in steels at lower carbon content and the triple layer ε-γ′-E in other steels at higher carbon. The thickness values (table 1) are very similar, but higher in the alloyed steel. The surface hardness increase with the carbon content, but the hardness of the compound layer is not too much different, with a little increase with the carbon content. The porosity appear rather limited in steels up to 0, 4 % of carbon, but more evident at higher carbon...|$|E

Nitriding treatment forms this layers sequence: a. the more external one, named white layer, formed by e-Fe 2 - 3 N e y'-Fe 4 N nitrides, b. the underlying diffusion layer in which nitrides of alloying element precipitates at grain boundary. The simultaneous presence of active carbon and nitrogen during nitrocarburizing treatment forms an <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> layer, composed by e-Fe 2 - 3 (N,C) and Y'-Fe 4 (N,C) carbonitrides laying on diffusion layer. The use of thermochemical treatments to enhance fatigue and wear resistance performances of highly stressed mechanical components is well known and established [2 - 5]. However it's technologically interesting post-nitriding and post-nitrocarburizing treatment development to guarantee good aesthetic and mechanical properties and high wear and corrosion resistance. Post-oxidation treatment, already studied in years [6 - 12], causes: a. nitrides and carbonitrides partial decomposition; b. Fe 3 O 4 growth on the surface; c. partial surface microporosity closure. Remaining open porosity, filled with lubricant oil (impregnation), could further increase wear and corrosion resistance. Aim {{of the work is}} the characterization and optimisation of post-treatments on nitrided and nitrocarburized 41 CrAlMo 7 and X 37 CrMoV 5 - 1 steels, in order to improve corrosion resistance and to reduce wear during dry sliding against counterparts. In this study, two kinds of post-treatments have been performed after gaseous nitriding and nitrocarburizing: a) oxidation, b) oxidation and oil impregnation using two different oil in water emulsions (10 wt% and 30 wt% oil). The morphological features of the post-treated surface have been characterized using scanning electron microscopy and surface roughness measurements, in order to evaluate the surface morphology influence on wear and corrosion resistance. In can be concluded that, in the applied experimental conditions: 1. in both steels, nitrocarburizing a compound layer 11 - 16 m thick forms, constant in whole material, while nitriding a white layer, 9 - 10 (xm thick; 2. in both steels, the nitrided diffusion layer is thicker than nitrocarburized one and therefore nitriding allows higher total and effective hardening depth; 3. after the treatments of Tab. II, 41 CrAlMo 7 shows higher diffusion layer, while X 37 CrMoV 5 - 1 achieved higher surface hardness than other steel. For this reason X 37 CrMoV 5 - 1 presents lower wear rate; 4. nitrocarburizing and nitriding originate surfaces with very different morphology: nitrided surface is smooth, regular with a low porosity, while after nitrocarburizing the surface presents higher roughness parameters and abundant open microporosity; 5. oxidation forms Fe 3 O 4 on both nitrided and nitrocarburized samples. The oxide surface morphology is influenced by the substrate chemical composition and mainly by the surface morphology of the treated substrate: on the nitrocarburized sample the oxide is smooth, non porous and well adhered to the substrate; on nitrided substrate the oxide presents higher roughness value and a high porosity content. As a consequence, oxidation promotes an improvement of wear and corrosion resistance when performed on nitrocarburized substrate, but it has a detrimental effect on corrosion and wear resistance when it is performed after nitriding; 6. nitriding and nitrocarburizing promote an significant improvement of wear resistance, and nitrided steels exhibits the highest wear resistance. All the nitriding post-treatments decrease wear resistance; 7. nitriding and nitrocarburizing promote a significant corrosion resistance increment, oxidation has positive effects only after nitriding, because of post-oxidized surface morphology; 8. oil impregnation effect on wear resistance is moderate, but it is decisive on corrosion resistance, because the oil acts as an insulating...|$|E
40|$|Steroid hormones {{regulate}} a broad {{variety of}} physiological functions through the transcriptional regulation of target genes. The active steroid hormones {{discussed in this}} thesis largely elicit their physiological effects through the activation of nuclear receptors. Many of these receptors reside in their inactive form in the cytoplasm, translocate to the nucleus upon ligand binding and drive the transcription of target genes. The local interconversion of active and inactive steroid hormones is regulated by members of 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases/reductases (17 β-HSDs). The enzyme 17 β-HSD 2 converts active estrogen estradiol and the potent androgen testosterone to its inactive keto-forms, whereas 17 β-HSD 3 mainly converts androstenedione into testosterone. The present thesis is split into three major projects that focus mainly on potential toxicological and therapeutic effects of inhibiting the enzyme 17 β-HSD 2 and biochemical aspects of the enzymes 17 β-HSD 3. The first project was designed to develop a 17 β-HSD 2 pharmacophore model and subsequently use this model as a virtual screening tool to identify novel nonsteroidal 17 β-HSD 2 inhibitors. It has been hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme 17 β-HSD 2 expressed in osteoclasts could be a useful strategy to treat osteoporosis through increasing local concentrations of active sex hormones. Our approach was initiated {{through the development of}} a pharmacophore model that underwent several rounds of experimental validation and improvement. In silico screening of internal and <b>external</b> <b>compound</b> databases using the optimized pharmacophore model resulted in the identification of several novel nonsteroidal compounds that inhibit 17 β-HSD 2 at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. Furthermore, the virtual screening of a cosmetic ingredients database revealed several paraben compounds as potential 17 β-HSD 2 inhibitors. In vitro examinations revealed that all tested paraben compounds were found to significantly inhibit 17 β-HSD 2 at a concentration of 20 µM. However, parabens are rapidly metabolized to p-hydroxybenzoic acid, which does not influence 17 β-HSD 2 activity. We reported a novel potential estrogenic effect of paraben compounds by inhibiting 17 β-HSD 2 although their estrogenic potential is unlikely to be of toxicological concern due to their rapid metabolism by esterases. In the second project we biochemically analyzed six mutations in the HSD 17 B 3 gene that were associated to cause 17 β-HSD 3 deficiency in Egyptian and Tunisian patients with 46, XY disorder of sexual development (DSD). Patients with 17 β-HSD 3 deficiency are unable to synthesize sufficient amounts of testosterone during embryogenesis which leads to severe undervirilization of internal and external genitals. All tested mutations (G 133 R, C 206 X, T 54 A, M 164 T, and L 194 T) were confirmed to be nearly inactive in vitro and therefore unable to sufficiently convert androstenedione into testosterone. Further analyses showed that the G 289 S polymorphism exhibited a similar rate of testosterone formation as the wild type 17 β-HSD 3 enzyme and consequently cannot be causing the pathogenesis of 46, XY DSD. All HSD 17 B 3 mutations associated with 46, XY DSD in this project were predicted by an in silico 17 β-HSD 3 homology model (based on the structure of 17 β-HSD 1) to interfere with either cofactor (NADPH) or substrate (androstenedione) binding sites. The G 289 S polymorphism however, was located {{on the surface of the}} enzyme without eliciting any effects on the cofactor or substrate active sites. Besides its critical role in sexual differentiation, testosterone regulates a variety of physiological functions. The vast majority of testosterone is produced in testicular Leydig cells. The final project in the thesis focused on reviewing the in vitro models available for investigating androgen disruption by xenobiotics. Our in vitro investigations focused on validating the three most promising Leydig cell lines (MA- 10, BLTK, TM 3) for their potential to report androgen disruption by xenobiotic compounds through alteration of 17 β-HSD 3 activity and transcription. Our experiments revealed that these cell lines express minimal levels of 17 β-HSD 3 mRNA compared to freshly isolated mouse testes. Furthermore, the cell lines also exhibited a low rate of androstenedione to testosterone formation. In conclusion, all tested cell lines are not useful as screening tool to test androgen disruption by xenobiotic compounds due to the lack of endogenous 17 β-HSD 3. Through the work described in this thesis, we have developed and optimized an in silico 17 β-HSD 2 pharmacophore model for the identification of inhibitors of the enzyme. We then confirmed and mechanistically evaluated mutations in the HSD 17 B 3 gene associated with 46, XY DSD and finally investigated Leydig cell models to test testosterone disruption by xenobiotic compounds. Altogether, these findings significantly expand the knowledge about physiological and biochemical aspects of the enzymes 17 β-HSD 2 and 17 β-HSD 3. ...|$|E

We compared the performances of three different methods for measuring cellular oxygen consumption: electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry, the Clark electrode, and the MitoXpress fluorescent assay. To compare the assays, we used K 562 cells {{in the presence of}} rotenone and hydrocortisone, compounds that are known to inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain to different extents. The EPR method {{was the only one that}} could identify both rotenone and hydrocortisone as inhibitors of tumor cell oxygen consumption. The Clark electrode and the fluorescence assay demonstrated a significant decrease in cellular oxygen consumption after administration of the most potent inhibitor (rotenone) but failed to show any significant effect of hydrocortisone. EPR oximetry is, therefore, the most sensitive method for identifying inhibitors of oxygen consumption on cell assays, whereas the Clark electrode offers the unique opportunity to add <b>external</b> <b>compounds</b> during experiments and still shows great sensitivity in studying enzyme and chemical reactions that consume oxygen (non-cell assays). Finally, the MitoXpress fluorescent assay has the advantage of a high-sample throughput and low bulk requirements but at the cost of a lower sensitivity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and {{restriction}} of Chemicals) and BPR (Biocidal Product Regulation) regulations strongly promote {{the use of}} non-animal testing techniques to evaluate chemical risk. This has renewed the interest towards alternative methods such as QSAR in the regulatory context. The assessment of bioconcentration factor (BCF) required by these regulations is expensive, in terms of costs, time, and laboratory animal sacrifices. Herein, we present QSAR models based on the ANTARES dataset, which is a large collection of known and verified experimental BCF data. Among the models developed, the best results were obtained from a nine-descriptor highly predictive model. This model was derived from a training set of 608 chemicals and challenged against a validation and blind set containing 152 and 76 chemicals, respectively. The model's robustness was further controlled through several validation strategies and {{the implementation of a}} multi-step approach for the applicability domain. Suitable safety margins were used to increase sensitivity. The easy interpretability of the model is ensured by the use of meaningful biokinetics descriptors. The satisfactory predictive power for <b>external</b> <b>compounds</b> suggests that the new models could represent a reliable alternative to the in vivo assay, helping the registrants to fulfill regulatory requirements in compliance with the ethical and economic necessity to reduce animal testing...|$|R
40|$|Substrate-transport-elicited {{endocytosis}} is {{a common}} control mechanism of membrane transporters avoiding excess uptake of <b>external</b> <b>compounds,</b> though poorly understood at the molecular level. In yeast, endocytosis of transporters is triggered by their ubiquitylation mediated by the Rsp 5 ubiquitin-ligase, recruited by α-arrestin-family adaptors. We here report that transport-elicited ubiquitylation of the arginine transporter Can 1 is promoted by transition to an inward-facing state. This conformational change unveils a region of the N-terminal cytosolic tail targeted by the Art 1 α-arrestin which is activated via the TORC 1 kinase complex upon arginine uptake. Can 1 mutants altered in the arginine-binding site or a cytosolic tripeptide sequence permanently expose the α-arrestin-targeted region so that Art 1 activation via TORC 1 is sufficient to trigger their endocytosis. We also provide evidence that substrate-transport elicited endocytosis of other amino acid permeases similarly involves unmasking of a cytosolic Art 1 -target region coupled to activation of Art 1 via TORC 1. Our results unravel a mechanism likely involved in regulation of many other transporters by their own substrates. They also support the emerging view that transporter ubiquitylation relies on combinatorial interaction rules such that α-arrestins, stimulated via signaling cascades or in their basal state, recognize transporter regions permanently facing the cytosol or unveiled during transport.

40|$|Induction of {{long-term}} tolerance to b-cell autoantigens {{has been investigated}} both in animal models and in human type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) {{in order to prevent}} the disease. As regards <b>external</b> <b>compounds,</b> the dietary plant protein fraction has been associated with high penetrance of the disease, whereas gluten-free diets prevent T 1 D in animal models. Herewith we investigated whether intranasal (i. n.) administration of gliadin or gluten may arrest the diabetogenic process. I. n. administration of gliadin to 4 -week-old NOD mice significantly reduced the diabetes incidence. Similarly, the insulitis was lowered. Intranasal gliadin also rescued a fraction of prediabetic 13 -week-old NOD mice from progressing to clinical onset of diabetes compared to OVA-treated controls. Vaccination with i. n. gliadin led to an induction of CD 4 +Foxp 3 + T cells and even more significant induction of cd T cells in mucosal, but not in non-mucosal lymphoid compartments. This prevention strategy was characterized by an increased proportion of IL- 10 and a decreased proportion of IL- 2, IL- 4 and IFN-c-positive CD 4 +Foxp 3 + T cells, and IFN-c-positive cd T cells, preferentially in mucosal lymphoid organs. In conclusion, i. n. vaccination with gliadin, an environmental antigen with possible etiological influence in T 1 D, may represent a novel, safer strategy fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the heterotic effect on non-integrant parts of carcass from steers of the breeds Charolais (Ch) and Nellore (Ne) and crossbreeds from fifth (21 / 32 Ch 11 / 32 Ne; 21 / 32 Ne 11 / 32 Ch) and sixth (43 / 64 Ch 21 / 64 Ne; 43 / 64 Ne 21 / 64 Ch) generation, finished in feedlot. The heterotic effect was positive for slaughter weight, empty body weight in both generations, head in fifth (1. 29 kg) and sixth (1. 04 kg) generation and ears in fifth generation (0. 17 kg). There was a heterotic effect on fifth and sixth generation for rumen-reticule and intestines, respectively, and abomasum on fifth generation. In absolute weight, a heterotic effect was observed on fifth generation for heart, lungs, kidneys and spleen (0. 14; 0. 11; 0. 55 and 0. 16 kg, respectively) and lungs in sixth generation (0. 61 kg). The heterotic effect was positive for fats of heart, kidney and digestive tract in both generations and for inguinal fat in sixth generation. In relation to empty body weight, there were heterotic effects for rawhide, in both generations, ears in fifth generation, and heart fat and blood in sixth generation. The crossbred steers showed higher weights for different <b>external</b> <b>compounds</b> in relation to purebred Charolais or Nellore...|$|R

Economic growth slowed down and became more volatile {{in the early}} 1990 s compared with the 1980 s. <b>External</b> shocks, <b>compounded</b> by unfavorable domestic developments, kept GDP growth at unusually low levels in 1991 and 1993. Inflation, which had remained below the European Union (EU) average throughout the 1980 s, edged over it since 1991.

40|$|Interaction of microstructured fluids {{with skin}} is {{ubiquitous}} in everyday life, {{from the use}} of cosmetics, lotions, and drugs, to personal care with detergents or soaps. The formulation of microstructured fluids is crucial for the control of the transdermal transport. In biomedical applications transdermal delivery is an efficient approach, alternative to traditional routes like oral and parenteral administration, for local release of drugs. Poor skin permeability, mainly due to its outer layer, which acts as the first barrier against the entry of <b>external</b> <b>compounds,</b> greatly limits the applicability of transdermal delivery. In this review, we focus on recent studies on the improvement of skin transport efficiency by using microemulsions (ME). Quantitative techniques, which are able to investigate both skin morphology and penetration processes, are also reviewed. ME are increasingly used as transdermal systems due to their low preparation cost, stability and high bioavailability. ME may act as penetration enhancers for many active principles, but ME microstructure should be chosen appropriately considering several factors such as ratio and type of ingredients and physic-chemical properties of the active components. ME microstructure is strongly affected by the flow conditions applied during processing, or during spreading and rubbing onto skin. Although the role played by ME microstructure has been generally recognized, the skin transport mechanisms associated with different ME microstructures are still to be elucidated and further investigations are required to fully exploit the potential of ME in transdermal delivery...|$|R
40|$|Casein micelle is a supramolecular {{structure}} containing casein {{molecules and}} calcium phosphate nanoclusters. Due to the associations of casein molecules between themselves by hydrophobic interactions and with calcium phosphate by electrostatic interactions, the casein micelles {{have an average}} size around 200 nm and are highly hydrated. Thanks to the recent knowledge obtained in dairy science and technology, casein micelles can be purified and modified to form new nanostructures with original and interesting potential properties. The objective of this mini-review is to show three possible ways to modify the structure and function of casein micelles. The first is to modify the physico-chemical conditions of environment (pH, temperature or ionic environment) to alter association of casein molecules and calcium phosphate with consequently changes of casein micelles structure. The second way is to add some <b>external</b> <b>compounds</b> like -caroten, vitamins, antitumoral drug, iron, zinc … which can {{be able to be}} bound to casein micelles. In this case, casein micelles are considered as vector with new properties in the field of nutrition and health. The third way is to modify chemically or enzymatically the casein molecules. For example, modifications can be performed by addition of genipin, transglutaminase, chymosin or phosphatase. In these cases, the associations of casein molecules inside casein micelles are also changed and the properties of dairy products obtained with this kind of ingredient are changed. All these modifications are considered as new possibilities to create ne...|$|R
