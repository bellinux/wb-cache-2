The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any <b>government</b> <b>will</b> typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence.

With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the <b>government</b> <b>will</b> usually be permitted to retry the defendant.

However, according to the state-centralism explanation of fiscal sociology, since the economic development of Shanxi’s coal-rich counties and their fiscal revenues rely heavily on coal-related rents, the <b>governments</b> <b>will</b> have higher state autonomy and will be less accountable to the public.

After Magaldi leaves her, she goes through several {{relationships}} with increasingly influential men, becoming a model, actress and radio personality. She meets Colonel Juan Perón at a fundraiser following the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Perón's connection with Eva adds to his populist image, since they are both from the working class. Eva has a radio show during Perón's rise and uses all of her skills to promote him, even when the controlling administration has him jailed in an attempt to stunt his political momentum. The groundswell of support that Eva generates forces the government to release Perón, and he finds the people enamored of him and Eva. Perón wins election to the presidency and marries Eva, who promises that the new <b>government</b> <b>will</b> serve the descamisados.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, {{half of the}} funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people and}} the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector.

In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E

Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact {{on state and}} local governments: This provision would make it somewhat more difficult to raise State taxes; however, {{it is not possible}} to determine the magnitude of the fiscal impact it would have on State revenues.
