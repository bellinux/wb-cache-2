60|$|A week flew by in {{delightful}} anticipations. The {{happiness of}} this short but heavenly period became so exciting, so exquisite, that I {{was on the}} point of giving birth to an improvement on my theory (or rather on the theory of the political economists and constitution-mongers, for it is in fact theirs and not mine), when the answer of Anna was received. If anticipation be a state of so much happiness--happiness being the great pursuit of man--why not invent a purely probationary condition of society?--why not change its elementary features from positive to anticipating interests, which would give more zest to life, and bestow felicity unimpaired by the dross of realities? I had determined to carry out this principle in practice by an experiment, and left the hotel to order an agent to advertise, and to enter into a treaty or two, for some new investments (without the smallest intention of bringing them to a conclusion), when the porter delivered me the ardently expected letter. I never knew what would be the effect of taking a stake in society by anticipation, therefore; the contents of Anna's missive driving every subject that was not immediately connected with the dear writer, and with sad realities, completely out of my head. It is not improbable, however, that the new theory would have proved to be faulty, for I have often had occasion to remark that <b>heirs</b> (<b>in</b> <b>remainder,</b> for instance), manifest an hostility to the estate, by carrying out the principle of anticipation, rather than any of that prudent respect for social consequences to which the legislator looks with so much anxiety.|$|R
50|$|The 3rd Viscount Tenby's {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} David Lloyd George (later the Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor), Liberal Prime Minister (1916-1922), who previously served as Chancellor of the Exchequer 1908-1915; thus {{he and his}} <b>heirs</b> are also <b>in</b> <b>remainder</b> to that earldom; ironically, the rejection, out of hand, of his grandfather David Lloyd George's Budget, by the House of Lords in 1909, precipitated the ongoing pressure for reform of the Upper House, despite the Lloyd George family's now holding two hereditary peerage titles. His elder brother, Captain David Lloyd George RA, served in World War II and succeeded as the 2nd Viscount Tenby in 1967; he died unmarried in 1983.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the third}} son of Richard Dawson of Ardee by his wife Anne, {{daughter}} of Sir Edward O'Brien, 2nd Baronet, and after his father's death in 1782 he became heir-presumptive to his uncle Thomas Dawson, 1st Baron Dartrey. On 22 May 1784 he married Catherine, daughter of Colonel Arthur Graham of Hockley, county Armagh; they had one son and four daughters. Dawson {{was elected to the}} Irish House of Commons for County Monaghan in April 1797 through the influence of his uncle (now Viscount Cremorne), and was named as <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> the special <b>remainder</b> of the barony of Cremorne granted to his uncle in November of that year. He continued to represent Monaghan in the Irish Parliament until the Act of Union, and then sat for the same county in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom until his death in a Dublin Hotel. His son Richard Thomas Dawson succeeded as second Baron Cremorne in 1813.|$|R

[...] William IV had died in 1841, four years before the Earl's death, but his <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> 1876 became William IV's grandson, William VI Wyndham (1834-1914) of Dinton, who thus inherited the ancient family manor of Orchard Wyndham in Somerset.|$|R

5000|$|Nevertheless, Sāriputta {{was one of}} {{the most}} highly praised disciples and on at least one {{occasion}} the Buddha declared him to be a true spiritual son and his chief assistant in [...] "turning the Wheel of the Dhamma": [...] "If a person, rightly saying it of anyone, were to say, 'He is the Blessed One's son, his offspring — born of his mouth, born of the Dhamma, created by the Dhamma, his <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> the Dhamma, not his <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> material things,' he would be rightly saying it of Śāriputra if he were to say: 'He is the Blessed One's son, his offspring — born of his mouth, born of the Dhamma, created by the Dhamma, his <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> the Dhamma, not his <b>heir</b> <b>in</b> material things.'
