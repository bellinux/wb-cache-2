5|$|The B.1 with an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Countermeasures</b> (ECM) {{system in}} a new larger tail cone (as in B.2). Unlike the B.2, the B.1As did not undergo {{extensive}} wing strengthening for low-level flying and were withdrawn from service 1966–67.|$|E
5|$|During the 1967–1969 refit, {{thirteen}} Bofors were removed, leaving four twin {{and four}} single mountings. The three 277Q radars were replaced with updated American and Dutch designs: a LW-02 air search set and a SPN-35 landing aid radar. A TACAN aerial and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> pods were also installed during this refit. The four Bofors twin mountings were removed in 1980.|$|E
5|$|From December 1983, 75 Jaguar GR1s and 14 T2s were updated to the GR1A and T2A {{standards}} with FIN1064 {{navigation and}} attack systems replacing the original NAVWASS. At {{about the same}} time, most were also re-engined with Adour 104 engines and were fitted {{with the ability to}} carry Sidewinder air to air missiles or AN-ALQ-101(V)-10 <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> pods under the wings.|$|E

5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} basic design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (EDM) operator ejected upwards, while the lower deck crew ejected downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E
5|$|Waveguide filters were {{developed}} during World War II {{to meet the}} needs of radar and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures,</b> but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links. Much of post-war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters, first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components, then by innovations such as dual-mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the PoAF bought AN/ALQ-131 <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> pods {{to equip}} the A-7P. Later in 1995 the fire control and {{navigation}} computer (OFP-2) received a major update.|$|R

5|$|IAF {{aircraft}} carried <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> pods to foil radar tracking. The IAF {{command post}} in Tel Aviv provided Ivry a real-time command {{picture of the}} air battle through various data links. E-2Cs with airborne surveillance radar down-linked their pictures to the command post. A squadron of Tadiran Mastiff and IAI Scout Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV) kept at least two vehicles in the air all the time, providing constant location of the SAM batteries. A two-way voice communications link between Ivry and his pilots was set up, allowing for real-time command.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point was whether these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures.</b> As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, {{to improve}} the aircraft's combat {{capabilities}} in the changing strategic environment, SAC initiated the Big Four modification program (also known as Modification 1000) for all operational B-52s except early B models. The program was completed by 1963. The four modifications were the ability to launch AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff nuclear missiles and ADM-20 Quail decoys, an advanced <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM) suite, and upgrades to perform the all-weather, low-altitude (below 500feet or 150m) interdiction mission {{in the face of}} advancing Soviet missile-based air defenses.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1987, the U.S. Air Force {{ordered an}} <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> {{version of the}} aircraft, given the {{designation}} YCEM-138A Pave Cricket. Equipped with an AN/ALQ-176 jammer, the program was also cancelled in 1989.|$|R
50|$|An {{infrared}} countermeasure (IRCM) is {{a device}} {{designed to protect}} aircraft from infrared homing ("heat seeking") missiles by confusing the missiles' infrared guidance system {{so that they will}} miss their target (<b>Electronic</b> <b>countermeasure).</b>|$|R
5|$|Ongoing {{problems}} with avionics systems were {{addressed in the}} Jolly Well program, completed in 1964, which improved components of the AN/ASQ-38 bombing navigational computer and the terrain computer. The MADREC (Malfunction Detection and Recording) upgrade fitted to most aircraft by 1965 could detect failures in avionics and weapons computer systems, and was essential in monitoring the Hound Dog missiles. The <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> capability of the B-52 was expanded with Rivet Rambler (1971) and Rivet Ace (1973).|$|E
5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM) {{equipment}} to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles (another Navy development), which homed {{in on the}} radar systems of the SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the Shrike, but if the Shrike was launched and the radar operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy the radar source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E
5|$|As a multirole aircraft, the Tornado {{is capable}} of {{undertaking}} more mission profiles than the anticipated strike mission; various operators replaced multiple aircraft types with the Tornado as a common type– the use of dedicated single role aircraft for specialist purposes such as battlefield reconnaissance, maritime patrol duties, or dedicated <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM) were phased out– either by standard Tornados or modified variants, such as the Tornado ECR. The most extensive modification from the base Tornado design was the Tornado ADV, which was stretched and armed with long range anti-aircraft missiles {{to serve in the}} interceptor role.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{predistortion}} {{technique of}} travelling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs), by analyzing TWTA model proposed by Saleh, the gain transmission function curve and phase expansion function {{curve of the}} predistortion circuit are deduced. The linear range of TWTA could be enlarged by using predistortion technique, and invariable gain together with zero phase excursions are reached at the working region of the linearized TWTA. As a kind of microwave and millimeter wave amplifiers, TWTAs find a wide utilization in communication, radar and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> applications. To obtain high output power, TWTAs are usually working at their saturation region where severe nonlinear distortion appears. The nonlinearity manifests gain compression and phase excursion. For digital communications application, the nonlinear distortion increase bit error rate, and this limits system efficiency. For <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> applications, the nonlinear distortion limits the output power obtainable at the carrier frequency, and this limits the obtainable efficiency of the system. So insights into measures to improve nonlinearity of TWTAs will benefit wireless communications systems and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> systems. Predistortion technique {{is one of the}} best choices [1, 2, 4...|$|R
50|$|AN/APQ-46 is {{the last}} radar tested and {{evaluated}} on F-4 prototypes and pre-production series. F-4 equipped with this radar was specifically modified to meet US Navy Ferret <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> aircraft requirement, which eventually did not materialize.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s a {{modification}} called AN/ECP-91 was installed {{to improve its}} <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasure</b> (ECM) capability. About thirty units were produced. Another modification was the AN/FPS-107 which also operated in the L-Band which was manufactured by Westinghouse.|$|R
5|$|Coker {{was awarded}} the Navy Commendation Medal for his actions {{as part of a}} coordinated 23-aircraft attack on {{petroleum}} storage tanks in Hai Phong on August 2, 1966, consisting of four waves of A-6 Intruders and A-4 Skyhawks, firing a combination of 750 and 1,000 pound bombs and rockets. The attack was the third in a series of attacks on North Vietnamese oil storage depots dating back to June. Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, Coker provided accurate guidance to the pilot on airspeed, altitude and dive angle, while operating both the attack navigation radar system and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures.</b> Despite adverse weather conditions, Coker's actions contributed to an attack that destroyed {{all but one of the}} facility's storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|One {{experimental}} two-seat A-10 Night Adverse Weather (N/AW) {{version was}} built by converting an A-10A. The N/AW was developed by Fairchild from the first Demonstration Testing and Evaluation (DT) A-10 for consideration by the USAF. It included a second seat for a weapons system officer responsible for <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM), navigation and target acquisition. The N/AW version did not interest the USAF or export customers. The two-seat trainer version was ordered by the Air Force in 1981, but funding was canceled by U.S. Congress and the jet was not produced. The only two-seat A-10 built now resides at Edwards Air Force Base's Flight Test Center Museum.|$|E
5|$|Production B.1 Victors were {{powered by}} the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 {{turbojets}} rated at , and was initially deployed with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon, re-deploying with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon. A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard {{by the addition of}} Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.|$|E

5|$|The Menzies {{government}} first publicly {{discussed the}} need for replacing the English Electric Canberra in 1954, only {{a year after the}} RAAF began receiving the bomber. The non-supersonic Canberra lacked radar and <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures,</b> all disadvantages based on Korean War experience. The RAAF believed that it needed a new strategic bomber to fulfill the nation's obligations to the Commonwealth Strategic Reserve in Malaysia, ANZUS, and SEATO. Air Staff Requirement 36 that year mandated an all-weather attack aircraft by 1959 capable of delivering a variety of bombs and missiles. A study recommended one of the British V bombers, but Prime Minister Robert Menzies' Minister of Defence Frederick Shedden decided in 1956 that at £1million each they were too expensive.|$|E
5|$|The Radar System Improvement Program (RSIP) was a joint US/NATO {{development}} program. RSIP {{enhances the}} operational {{capability of the}} E-3 radars' <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures,</b> and dramatically improve the system's reliability, maintainability, and availability. Essentially, this program replaced the older transistor-transistor logic (TTL) and emitter-coupled logic (MECL) electronic components, long-since out of production, with off-the-shelf digital computers that utilised a High-level programming language instead of assembly language. Significant improvement came from adding pulse compression to the pulse-Doppler mode, replacing the old 8-bit FFT with 24-bit FFTs, and the 12-bit A/D (Sign + 12-bits) with a 15-bit A/D (Sign + 15-bits). These hardware and software modifications improve the E-3 radars' performance, providing enhanced detection with an emphasis towards low radar cross-section (RCS) targets.|$|E
5|$|To evade enemy {{detection}} and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive <b>electronic</b> <b>countermeasures</b> (ECM) suite which were {{operated by the}} air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|E
