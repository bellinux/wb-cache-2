Here are two very characteristic examples; one is good quartz, living with good pearl-spar, and the other, wicked quartz, living with wicked pearl spar. In both, the quartz yields to the soft carbonate of iron: but, in the first place, the iron takes only what <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> room; and is inserted into the planes of the rock crystal with such precision that you must break it away before you can tell whether it really penetrates the quartz or not; while the crystals of iron are perfectly formed, and have a lovely bloom on their surface besides. But here, when the two minerals quarrel, the unhappy quartz has all its surfaces jagged and torn to pieces; {{and there is not}} a single iron crystal whose shape you can completely trace. But the quartz has the worst of it, in both instances.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Having an {{effective}} and efficient strategy for optimizing long distance data migration is essential for every data center. With the ever increasing demands for the <b>IT</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> businesses {{it is also important}} for data centers to deliver data migration cost effectively especially when faced with the demands from remote office back up, outsourcing, data center movers and cloud computing. Data management and migration are important research challenges of novel Cloud environments. While moving data among different geographical domains, it is important to lower the transmission cost for performance purposes. Efficient scheduling methods allow us to manage data transmissions with lower number of steps and shorter transmission time. In previous research efforts, several methods have been proposed in literature in order to manage data and minimize transmission cost for the case of Single Cluster environments. This paper Explores the issues and method of Data Migration across the Cloud...|$|E

Even as these firms drive home their strategic technological expertise to rake in profits and expand in their countries of origin and globally, the need for a comprehensive information technology strategy to connect with customers and within the firm is increasingly felt. While these firms may have an internal IT department to begin with, an ever increasing customer base calls for a larger firm with proven prior expertise in implementing solutions on a larger scale. Further, it is seen that the <b>IT</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> these firms are significantly different from traditional heavy manufacturing firms, where production is on a mass scale.

40|$|THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the readiness of micro enterprises to adopt a new service under development by a Finnish telecommunication company. The new service called "WebTop" aimed at delivering computing resources to knowledge workers based on the Desktop as a Service model. In addition to assessing the overall demand for such a service, the research was designed to advise the development team on a set of features and applications to be included in the value proposition of the service. The final goal was to advise the development team about the viability of the service and find triggers that could promote its adoption by the desired target group. DATA The data used throughout this research was collected in 2008 through desk research and by interviews. The {{purpose of the}} desk research was to find existing DaaS providers, analyze their value propositions and revenue models. The primary data was collected by the means of face-to-face interviews with CEOs or owners of 31 Finnish micro enterprises. RESULTS The results indicate an overall lack of triggers of adopting DaaS as a new way of acquiring and using IT resources. The current <b>IT</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> the micro enterprise are sufficiently satisfied by current practices. The finding indicate that the structure of decision making in the company and the need for customer relationship management tools and collaboration and communication tools are most likely to influence the adoption of cloud computing based services...|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of {{a large amount of}} observational data recently collected from magnetar outbursts is now calling for a complete theoretical study of outburst characteristics. In this letter (the first of a series dedicated to model magnetar outbursts), we tackle the long-standing open {{issue of whether or not}} short bursts and glitches are always connected to long-term radiative outbursts. We show that the recent detection of short bursts and glitches seemingly unconnected to outbursts is only misleading our understanding of these events. We show that, in the framework of the starquake model, neutrino emission processes in the magnetar crust limit the temperature, and therefore the luminosity. This natural limit to the maximum luminosity makes outbursts associated with bright persistent magnetars barely detectable. These events are simply seen as a small luminosity increase over the already bright quiescent state, followed by a fast return to quiescence. In particular, this is the case for 1 RXS J 1708 - 4009, 1 E 1841 - 045, SGR 1806 - 20, and other bright persistent magnetars. On the other hand, a similar event (with the same energetics) in a fainter source will drive a more extreme luminosity variation and longer cooling time, as for sources such as XTE J 1810 - 197, 1 E 1547 - 5408 and SGR 1627 - 41. We conclude that the non-detection of large radiative outbursts in connection with glitches and bursts from bright persistent magnetars is not surprising per se, nor <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> any revision on the glitches and burst mechanisms as explained by current theoretical models.
