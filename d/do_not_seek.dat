5|$|Because the kakapo is long-lived, with {{an average}} life {{expectancy}} of 58years and the maximum at about 90 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was debunked in the 2008 breeding season when two 6-year-old females named Apirama and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and {{has one of the}} lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. Rimu mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.|$|E

25|$|UNAIDS has {{observed}} “sero-selection” (choosing a partner {{based on their}} HIV status) becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States. A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection. Many HIV-infected individuals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, {{a significant portion of}} individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.|$|E

25|$|In Lamparello v.

25|$|In Vajrayāna particularly, Tibetan Buddhists {{subscribe}} to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> and are not provided with information about it.

That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajrayāna is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists help {{to promote}} health and {{well-being}} by preventing illness. Some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. Health psychologists have worked to understand why some people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways {{to encourage people to}} have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. Health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors (e.g., engaging in unprotected sex) and encourage health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., regular tooth brushing or hand washing).|$|E

25|$|Other {{forms of}} {{violence}} against women include sexual harassment and abuse by authority figures (such as teachers, police officers or employers), trafficking for forced labour or sex, and traditional practices such as forced child marriages and dowry-related violence. At its most extreme, violence against women can result in female infanticide and violent death. Despite {{the size of the}} problem, many women do not report their experience of abuse and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> help. As a result, violence against women remains a hidden problem with great human and health care costs.|$|E
25|$|The newly hatched nymph soon {{begins to}} feed and, {{if it is}} a gragarious individual, is {{attracted}} to other hoppers and they group together. As it grows it needs to moult (shed its exoskeleton). Is hard cuticle splits and its body expands while the new exoskeleton is still soft. The stages between moulting are called instars and the desert locust nymph undergoes five moults before becoming a winged adult. Immature and mature individuals in the gregarious phase individuals form bands which feed, bask and move as cohesive units, while solitary phase individuals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> gregariousness.|$|E
25|$|Ultrashort {{bond funds}} are mutual funds, similar to money market funds, that, {{as the name}} implies, invest in bonds with {{extremely}} short maturities. Unlike money market funds, however, there are no restrictions {{on the quality of}} the investments they hold. Instead, ultrashort bond funds typically invest in riskier securities in order to increase their return. Since these high-risk securities can experience large swings in price or even default, ultrashort bond funds, unlike money market funds, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> to maintain a stable $1.00 NAV and may lose money or dip below the $1.00 mark in the short term. Finally, because they invest in lower quality securities, ultrashort bond funds are more susceptible to adverse market conditions such as those brought on by the financial crisis of 2007–2010.|$|E

25|$|In rugby union, World Rugby {{regulates the}} size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an {{official}} rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280–300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740–770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580–620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material, and may be treated to make it water resistant and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not weigh more than 460grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71–68.75 kilopascals, or 0.67–0.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5–10.0lbs per square inch. Spare balls are allowed under the condition that players or teams <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> an advantage by changing the ball. Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{one reason}} some people {{preferred}} transsexual to transgender {{is that the}} medical community in the 1950s through the 1980s encouraged {{a distinction between the}} terms that would only allow the former access to medical treatment. Other self-identified transsexual people state that those who <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> sex reassignment surgery (SRS) are fundamentally different from those who do, and that the two have different concerns, but this view is controversial, and others argue that merely having some medical procedures does not have such far-reaching consequences as to put those who have them and those who have not (e.g. because they cannot afford them) into such distinctive categories. Another reason for objecting to the term transsexual is the concern that it implies something to do with sexuality, when it is actually about gender identity. For example, Christine Jorgensen, the first person widely known to have sex reassignment surgery (in this case, male-to-female), rejected transsexual and instead identified herself in newsprint as trans-gender, on this basis.|$|E
25|$|Trajan’s short {{reply to}} Pliny overall affirms Pliny’s {{procedure}} and details four orders: (1) <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>seek</b> out the Christians for trial. (2) If the accused {{are guilty of}} being Christian, then they must be punished. (3) If the accused deny they are Christians and show proof {{that they are not}} by worshipping the gods, then they will be pardoned. (4) Pliny should not allow anonymous accusations. Leonard L. Thompson calls the policy “double-edged,” since, “on the one hand, Christians were not hunted down. They were tried only if accusations from local provincials were brought against them. But if accused and convicted, then Christians...were killed simply for being Christians.” Therefore, Pliny’s view of Christians was not necessarily persecution but rather Christians were only executed when they were brought before him at trial and confessed; however, pardons were also given to those who denied such charges. de Ste. Croix says the recommended course of action “was ‘accusatory’ and not ‘inquisitorial,’” so that it was never the governors themselves but instead private, local accusers (delatores) who brought forth accusations.|$|E
