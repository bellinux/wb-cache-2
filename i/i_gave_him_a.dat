25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, who do {{not know what to do}} with him. Today <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E
500|$|On {{collaborating with}} Ludacris, Cruz said, [...] "With Ludacris, {{pretty much every}} track he's ever {{featured}} on sounds amazing. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> quick call {{and asked him if}} he could get on the record, and he recorded it and sent it over. As I expected, there was nothing I needed to change. It sounded perfect. He put my name in there, which is great – so people know to pronounce it now properly, hopefully." [...] The version featuring Ludacris was originally released digitally as the b-side to [...] "No Other One" [...] in November 2009, before in the United States in February 2010.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, I believe I got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
6000|$|... "It's been {{worrying}} me also, I {{can assure}} you," [...] I told him; and <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> account of my Wednesday evening's experience.|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Worster {{wishes to}} visit {{you with a}} view of getting your {{permission}} to introduce into the army [...] "Harmon's Sandal Sock." [...] Shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> pass for that object? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good evening, Patty. Take a chair. That {{brother of}} yours hasn't turned up yet. The next time <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> assignment, he'll manage {{to be on}} hand in time to do it." ...|$|R
2500|$|He was {{recalled}} to the Australian one day {{team for}} the WSC finals series in 1988–89, as a third spinner. However he bowled poorly, going for 0-62 off 7 overs. [...] "I {{felt sorry for him}} in a lot of ways", said Alan Border, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> pretty tough task, bowling in that first 15 overs, and then he had to bowl towards the end when their guys were wacking out." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few years}} {{afterwards}} Blomfield {{came down from}} London to preach a charity sermon at Watford, and was Capel's house-guest. [...] Capel [...] "came down to breakfast in an old grey dressing gown and red slippers, much to the surprise and something to the discomfiture of his Diocesan". Asked, before the event, [...] by a close friend how {{he had managed to}} have his invitation accepted Capel's reply was said to have been: [...] "How, why <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> good licking and that made him civil. We are very good friends now." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Times {{called him}} a [...] "Gallant Figure in War and Politics" [...] and F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead, wrote, [...] "In fields of great and {{critical}} danger he has constantly {{over a long period}} of years displayed a cool valour which everybody in the world who knows the facts freely recognizes." [...] Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Supreme Commander of the Allied Armies in the final year of World War <b>I,</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> cigarette case inscribed, [...] "Au Ministre de 1912: au Vaillant de la Grande Guerre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{excuse me}} if <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> little brandy, won't you, sir?" [...] he said. [...] "He's really not quite fit for getting about yet, {{but he was}} {{worrying}} about his book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Own brother, sir,’ observes Durdles, turning himself about again, and as {{unexpectedly}} forgetting his offence {{as he had}} recalled or conceived it; ‘own {{brother to}} Peter the Wild Boy! But <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> object in life.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd like to ask, ma'am," [...] {{said the}} Champion, earnestly, [...] "whether I {{can act as}} the lad's second when the time comes. I've waited on him the last two fights. Can <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> knee?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Dettori {{sent the}} colt into the lead {{soon after the}} start and set the pace from Highland Reel, Pleascach, Free Eagle and Found. Two furlongs from the finish Free Eagle made a forward move but as he {{challenged}} the favourite, Golden Horn veered to the right, hampering his challenger. Golden Horn kept on well in the closing stages to win by a length from Found, who stayed on to deprive Free Eagle of second. Following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards the result was allowed to stand. Dettori said [...] "It was a stellar field and he was showing what a good horse he is. Pat [...] came to me then <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> couple of cracks and I got the measure of him and I thought, right, come on, let’s go home. All of a sudden, he just took a right turn. He must have seen something". Gosden offered {{the view that the}} horse had swerved because of the shadow cast across the course by the grandstand.|$|E
2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. I think he had just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, August was videotaped {{beating a}} man, and he posted the video on his {{personal}} Instagram account. Although he deleted the video from his profile, the video was later posted to YouTube, and shared by thousands. In the video, a shirtless August walks over {{to a man who}} is kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned. After the incident had spread, he went to his Twitter account to shed light on the situation, explaining: [...] "I'm just a lil one out here on my own, no mom because she stay taking from me & no father because he wasn't around until all this happened. You guys would only know half of my story, only what's on screen & definitely not behind scenes. But sorry for my misbehavior guys I reacted so fast because the fact <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> past [...] many times and every single time there was excuses. Sometimes it sucks waiting on somebody else time to get what they promised you, if you said a specific day & time for my money than I want my stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him {{pick out}} the prisoners' eyes, and chop off their hands, and shoot them into the town from mangonels,--he must go far and thrive well ere <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> chance of doing that by me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>an</b> {{ounce of}} lead to make sure, Captain?" [...] quoth the sergeant. But Wentworth, in his great haste, had already turned about, {{and the light}} of his lanthorn no longer {{revealed}} the form of Mr. Wilding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why abuse? Haven't <b>I</b> <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> {{home and}} an education, all because Thomas {{asked me to}} look after his relatives? And he's been rebellious and pig-headed and sullen in return for my kindness, so {{naturally}} there's little love lost between us." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance we saw a broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
60|$|I was {{in pretty}} good eyebrow-raising form by now, so <b>I</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> touch of it.|$|E
