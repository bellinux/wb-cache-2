25|$|In some nations, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and New Zealand, {{imported}} alien crayfish are {{a danger}} to local rivers. The three species commonly imported to Europe from the Americas are Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish may spread into different bodies of water because specimens captured <b>for</b> <b>pets</b> in one river are often released into a different catchment. There is a potential for ecological damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water (e.g., crayfish plague in Europe).|$|E
25|$|O. vernalis is hunted {{by various}} predators, {{including}} the red-tailed hawk, great blue heron, rough-legged buzzard, bears, raccoons, foxes, {{and the common}} house cat. Humans also find these snakes in the wild and keep them <b>for</b> <b>pets.</b> They are subjected to commercial collection because of their nice skin coloration, passive nature, and small size. However, this snake is not known to survive well in captivity. Because their populations are usually isolated and small in size, this commercial collection can greatly affect the overall population.|$|E

25|$|The keeping {{of animals}} as pets can cause {{concerns}} {{with regard to}} animal rights and welfare. Pets have commonly been considered private property, owned by individual persons. However, many legal protections have existed (historically and today) {{with the intention of}} safeguarding pets' (and other animals') well-being. Since the year 2000, a small but increasing number of jurisdictions in North America have enacted laws redefining pet's owners as guardians. Intentions have been characterized as simply changing attitudes and perceptions (but not legal consequences) to working toward legal personhood <b>for</b> <b>pets</b> themselves. Some veterinarians and breeders have opposed these moves. The question of pets' legal status can arise with concern to purchase or adoption, custody, divorce, estate and inheritance, injury, damage, and veterinary malpractice.|$|E
