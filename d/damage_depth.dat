40|$|Abstract. A {{probabilistic}} {{neural network}} was developed to classify corrosion <b>damage</b> <b>depth</b> ranges based on the aluminum alloy failure mode. The results obtained indicate that corrosion <b>damage</b> <b>depth</b> for aluminum alloy can be classified into three groups. Statistical study on classified corrosion damage was carried out. The results show that pitting corrosion depth for aluminum alloy is in conforms to Gumbel distribution. The normal distribution fits well with intergranular corrosion depth and the exfoliation corrosion depth is consistent with Weibull distribution law. It {{may be necessary to}} use several distribution functions rather than a single distribution to represent corrosion damage characteristics due to the large distribution of corrosion depth in aircraft materials. According to corrosion <b>damage</b> <b>depth</b> distribution, corrosion depth was simulated by Monte Carlo method and used as the starting crack size. Fatigue lives were estimated by using a life prediction program AFGROW and the results are in good agreement with the experimental data. A probabilistic analysis shows that the distribution of fatigue lives is strongly correlated to the distribution of corrosion <b>damage</b> <b>depth</b> and should be classified into several groups to study...|$|E

Recreating aesthetics and function are the two practical goals of such restorative treatment. However, the failure rate of ceramic prostheses is relatively high due to their inherent brittleness. A primary reason to premature failure of ceramic prostheses is surface and subsurface damage induced in dental intraoral finishing using dental handpieces and abrasive burs. In this paper, finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to predict quantitatively finishing-induced stress fields and subsurface <b>damage</b> <b>depths</b> in dental porcelain surfaces using fine grit diamond burs.

As one of machinable dental ceramics for prosthetic restorations, a leucite-reinforced glass ceramic has higher fracture toughness than feldspar porcelains. However, the extent of subsurface damage and stress induced in clinical dental adjustments is unknown. Tensile, shear, compressive and von Mises stresses at the bur-ceramic interface were investigated as functions of dental adjustment parameters using finite element analysis (FEA). The <b>depths</b> of subsurface <b>damage</b> were predicted using FEA according to the maximum principal stress criterion and experimentally measured using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The resulting predicted subsurface <b>damage</b> <b>depths</b> agree well with the experimentally measured data.

30|$|One {{critical}} {{problem with}} this technique is that the sample has a bond layer, which changes the stress-strain fields nearby the interface when the sample is subjected to indentation at the interface. The Hertzian theory {{can no longer be}} applied to analyzing the stress-strain field in this case. Helbawi et al. [45] found that the maximum stress position shifted away from the bonded-interfaces in both finite element simulation and indentation experiments. In consequence, the maximum subsurface <b>damage</b> <b>depth</b> was away from the bonded-interfaces and was larger than the measured <b>damage</b> <b>depth.</b> However, the damage zone observed with BIT was with a higher damage density than that induced in the practical machining processes. The findings from Helbawi et al. [45] verified the limitation in BIT. Therefore, BIT cannot provide precise information on subsurface damage induced in the practical machining processes, and should not thus be recommended for quantitative detection of SSD in hard and brittle materials.|$|E

In this article, surface roughness and subsurface damage characteristics of a (001) potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystal surface produced by traditional and rotary ultrasonic machining are studied. The influence of process parameters, including spindle speed, feed speed, type and size of sintered diamond wheel, ultrasonic power, and selection of cutting fluid on potassium dihydrogen phosphate crystal surface integrity, was analyzed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} surface characteristics, {{in terms}} of its morphology, roughness and near-surface damage of Si wafers cut by diamond wire sawing (DWS) of Si ingots under different cutting conditions. Diamond wire sawn Si wafers exhibit nearly-periodic surface features of different spatial wavelengths, which correspond to kinematics of various movements during wafering, such as ingot feed, wire reciprocation, and wire snap. The surface damage occurs in the form of frozen-in dislocations, phase changes, and microcracks. The in-depth damage was determined by conventional methods such as TEM, SEM and angle-polishing/defect-etching. However, because these methods only provide local information, we have also applied a new technique that determines average <b>damage</b> <b>depth</b> over a large area. This technique uses sequential measurement of the minority carrier lifetime after etching thin layers from the surfaces. The lateral spatial damage variations, which seem to be mainly related to wire reciprocation process, were observed by photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime mapping.
