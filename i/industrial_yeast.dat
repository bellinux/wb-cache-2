Beer and other alcoholic beverages, throughout human history, {{have played a}} significant role in society through drinking rituals, providing nutrition, medicine, and uncontaminated water. [...] During the domestication process, organisms shift from natural environments that are more variable and complex to simple and stable environments with a constant substrate. This often favors specialization adaptations in domesticated microbes, associated with relaxed selection for non-useful genes in alternative metabolic strategies or pathogenicity. [...] Domestication might be partially responsible for the traits that promote aerobic fermentation in industrial species. Introgression and HGT is common in Saccharomyces domesticated strains. [...] Many commercial wine strains have significant portions of their DNA derived from HGT of non-Saccharomyces species. HGT and introgression are less common in nature than is seen during domestication pressures.

30|$|On {{account of}} being a {{peculiar}} process, Brazilian ethanol production offers a hostile environment for yeasts where only the most adapted are successful. The manipulation of laboratory strains for later adaptation to the fermentation vats is not a recommended strategy since the implementation of these strains can be very difficult or even impossible. The recommended would be the modification of strains isolated from the fermentation vats, which are already adapted to the hostile environment (Della-Bianca et al. 2013; Steensels et al. 2014). Another point is the choice of promoters used in the genetic modifications of <b>industrial</b> <b>yeasts.</b> Our knowledge about <b>industrial</b> <b>yeasts</b> is not as vast as the knowledge about laboratory yeasts {{and it is still}} necessary to learn a lot about the functioning of these yeasts.

40|$|Objectives: To improve ethanolic {{fermentation}} {{performance of}} self-flocculating yeast, {{difference between a}} flocculating yeast strain and a regular <b>industrial</b> <b>yeast</b> strain was analyzed by transcriptional and metabolic approaches. Results: The number of down-regulated (<b>industrial</b> <b>yeast</b> YIC 10 vs. flocculating yeast GIM 2. 71) and up-regulated genes were 4503 and 228, respectively. It is the economic regulation for YIC 10 that non-essential genes were down-regulated, and cells put more "energy" into growth and ethanol production. Hexose transport and phosphorylation were not the limiting-steps in ethanol fermentation for GIM 2. 71 compared to YIC 10, whereas the reaction of 1, 3 -disphosphoglycerate to 3 -phosphoglycerate, the decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and its subsequent reduction to ethanol were the most limiting steps. GIM 2. 71 had stronger stress response than non-flocculating yeast and much more carbohydrate was distributed to other bypass, such as glycerol, acetate and trehalose synthesis. Conclusions: Differences between flocculating yeast and regular <b>industrial</b> <b>yeast</b> in transcription and metabolite profiling will provide clues for improving the fermentation performance of GIM 2. 71.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 11 JUL 2008 The contribution of yeast fermentation metabolites to the aromatic profile of wine is well documented; however, the biotechnological {{application of this}} knowledge, apart from strain selection, is still rather limited and often contradictory. Understanding and modeling the relationship between nutrient availability {{and the production of}} desirable aroma compounds by different strains must be one of the main objectives in the selection of <b>industrial</b> <b>yeasts</b> for the beverage and food industry. In order to overcome the variability in the composition of grape juices, we have used a chemically defined model medium for studying yeast physiological behavior and metabolite production in response to nitrogen supplementation so as to identify an appropriate yeast assimilable nitrogen level for strain differentiation. At low initial nitrogen concentrations, strain KU 1 produced higher quantities of esters and fatty acids whereas M 522 produced higher concentrations of isoacids, gamma-butyrolactone, higher alcohols and 3 -methylthio- 1 -propanol. We propose that although strains KU 1 and M 522 have a similar nitrogen consumption profile, they represent useful models for the chemical characterization of wine strains in relation to wine quality. The differential production of aroma compounds by the two strains is discussed in relation to their capacity for nitrogen usage and their impact on winemaking.
