40|$|In {{automotive}} and aeronautic fields, {{controlling the}} final shape of <b>flexible</b> <b>assemblies</b> (with sheet metal parts) {{is a key}} issue. Even assuming as known the shape errors in single manufactured parts, the assembly process can cause wide variability due to their flexibility and to the choice of fixtures and clamps {{as well as to}} the fastening technique adopted.

40|$|Increasing {{customer}} {{demands for}} product variety {{in conjunction with}} the short lifecycle of products has caused manufacturing companies to introduce a wide range of products by accommodating flexibility. An assembly system {{is an essential part of}} the manufacturing system from both cost and time perspectives. Hence, the shift towards flexibility in manufacturing companies highlights the significance of establishing <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems and designing products that are closely aligned with them. Despite its significance, however, the <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system concept and its requirements for product design have not been clearly defined in research and from a practical point of view. Most research on <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems has mainly approached either the design or the balancing and scheduling issues of these systems, whereas only a few studies have briefly defined the <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system they focused on, without further specifying the characteristics of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system and its requirements for product design. Taking that into account, the objective of this work is to provide a framework to contribute to the understanding of the concept of flexibility in an assembly system and its requirements for product design. In order to fulfil the objective, four empirical studies combined with literature reviews have been conducted. The empirical studies, a multiple case study and three single case studies, investigate the definition of flexibility in an assembly system as well as the requirements that a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system imposes on product design. Through its findings, this research provides a definition of flexibility in assembly systems that mainly revolves around volume, mix and new product flexibility. In addition, six constituents of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system have been identified: adaptable material supply, versatile workforce, increased commonality, standardised work content, integrated product properties and strategic planning. Furthermore, three requirements of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system for product design are defined, which, if fulfilled, reduce the complexity created by product variety and consequently support flexibility in the assembly system. Accordingly, to increase the understanding of the concept of flexibility in an assembly system and its requirements for product design, a four-staged framework is suggested. The proposed framework deals with the activities related to the concept and the development of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system and is expected to be received by assembly practitioners as a link between assembly and product design teams in the product realisation process.

40|$|Growing {{customer}} {{demands for}} product variety, new and rapid technological developments, {{and the short}} life cycle of products characterise the current volatile market. To maintain a competitive edge in the market, manufacturing companies need to accommodate flexibility in their assembly systems that are essential parts of the manufacturing systems with respect to cost, time, and creating product variety. Given the importance of establishing <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems, the complexity raised by increasing product variety {{and the value of}} appropriate product designs to assembly systems highlight the pivotal role of product design in a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system. Despite its significance to theory and practice, however, the characteristics of flexibility in an assembly system and its links to product design are still ambiguous and unexplored. The objective of this thesis is to expand the current knowledge of flexibility in assembly systems and using product design to support its achievement. To accomplish the objective and by adopting an interactive research approach, five case studies were conducted in the heavy machinery manufacturing industry. A literature review underpins all the case studies comprising one multiple and four single case studies. Through its findings, this research defines flexibility in an assembly system, identifies its dimensions, and pinpoints its enablers. Additionally, three requirements of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system for product design are identified: a common assembly sequence, similar assembly interfaces, and common parts. These requirements, if fulfilled in product design across distinct product families, reduce the perceived complexity and support various flexibility dimensions in the assembly system. Moreover, the development of a common assembly sequence and similar assembly interfaces, as the two key requirements of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system for product design, is described. Further, based upon developing understanding and knowledge about a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system and its requirements for product design, a model and a framework are proposed. The model addresses the role of product design in achieving flexibility in an assembly system. To support the alignment of product design with the key requirements of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system during the product design process, the assembly-oriented framework details the development of these requirements. Through its outcomes, this thesis contributes to the research area of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems and sheds light on its interface with the engineering design field.

40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> {{systems have}} emerged in {{response}} to changing markets and increased variety in form of demands of new products and manufacturer’s need for differentiation. Assembly systems {{play a critical role}} in handling great variety and adapting to dynamic changes at the same time as securing product quality and productivity. Therefore, assembly systems should be designed to be able to handle changes. However, the design of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems is a challenge because it involves several subjects such as the configuration of the flow, the material handling and the flexibility to handle future changes and adjustment. In addition, time-to-market and time-to-volume are important which means that faster assembly systems designs are required. The design process of assembly systems concerns the procedures that guide the design work to achieve an assembly system proposal. The design process is divided into a number of stages/phases describing the activities that should be done and when they should be performed as well as the expected result after each phase supporting the decision-making process. Research argues that working in a systematic and structured way is important in order to achieve better assembly systems in shorter time. However, even though there is extensive research work in regard to flexibility, knowledge is limited concerning the design process of assembly systems. Therefore, the objective of this thesis has been to increase the knowledge about the design of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems by investigating the relation between the assembly system design process and flexibility. The characteristics of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems and how flexibility is considered during the design process have also been studied in this thesis. Literature reviews were conducted as well as three case studies and one exploratory survey in the manufacturing industry of heavy vehicles. Study I concerns the results of having studied an industrial international project of the design process of a <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> system during two years. In study II, flexibility needs, enablers and challenges in assembly systems were identified. In study III, the mechanism used to achieve flexibility in the assembly systems of two companies were investigated. The exploratory survey study IV, was a pilot study to investigate the relationship between the design process of assembly systems and flexibility based on the association of different variables involved in the design process of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems. From the holistic perspective adopted in this thesis, the results showed that flexibility should be considered in a comprehensive way during all the design process. The design process of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems is iterative, circumscribed by different conditions, and requires support as well as the participation of different roles and functions to achieve a solution. The increased knowledge generated in the research is expected to lead to future development of working procedures that better can support the design process of <b>flexible</b> <b>assembly</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Helical Bacillus subtilis macrofibers {{are highly}} ordered {{structures}} consisting of individual cells packed in a geometry {{remarkably similar to}} that found in helically twisted yarns (G. A. Carnaby, in J. W. S. Hearle et al., ed., The Mechanics of <b>Flexible</b> Fibre <b>Assemblies,</b> p. 99 - 112, 1980; N. H. Mendelson, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75 : 2478 - 2482, 1978). The growth and formation of macrofibers were studied with time-lapse microscopy methods. The basic growth mode consisted of fiber elongation, folding, and the helical wrapping together of the folded portion into a tight helical fiber. This sequence was reiterated {{at both ends of}} the structure, resulting in terminal loops. Macrofiber growth was accompanied by the helical turning of the structure along its long axis. Right-handed structures turned clockwise and left-handed ones turned counterclockwise when viewed along the length of a fiber looking toward a loop end. Helical turning forced the individual cellular filaments into a close-packing arrangement during growth. Tension was evident within the structures and they writhed as they elongated. Tension was relieved by folding, which occurred when writhing became so violent that the structure touched itself, forming a loop. When the multistranded structure produced by repeated folding cycles became too rigid for additional folding, the morphogenesis of a ball-like structure began. The dynamics of helical macrofiber formation was interpreted in terms of stress-strain deformations. In view of the similarities between macrofiber structures and those found in multifilament yarns and cables, the physics of helical macrofiber structure and also growth may be suitable for analysis developed in these fields concerning the mechanics of <b>flexible</b> fiber <b>assemblies</b> (C.
