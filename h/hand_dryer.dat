Next, all the Sugababes are featured in separate toilet cubicles where they have their hands against the walls. The video cuts to Berrabah walking towards a <b>hand</b> <b>dryer,</b> which she rotates towards her face, causing her hair to be blown. Following this, Range sits on a couch and uses the nail polish to colour her nails. The group is again seen in the cubicles, where they repeatedly open and close the doors. Later, Buchanan, Range and Berrabah are featured in front of red curtains with traditional silver, gold and black outfits, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the microbiological characteristics of air blown from warm air <b>hand</b> <b>dryers,</b> and to compare findings with the microbiological characteristics of indoor air in which the dryer settled. Air samples was taken from different public places (shopping centers, restaurants and hospitals) and investigated for total viable counts, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, E.

There were differences between sampling indoor places for some of the microorganisms, but all of the air samples taken from dryers contained more microorganisms than indoor air, and the differences between <b>hand</b> <b>dryers</b> and indoor air were statistically significant (p< 0. 05) except for enteric pathogens. As a result it could be said that warm air <b>hand</b> <b>dryers</b> could be microbiological contamination sources in restrooms or the other places that they are used.

40|$|Introduction. Shopping habits {{have changed}} {{over the past several}} years and {{consumers}} choose shopping centres, where they can spend time and visit restaurants. People usually wash hands before meals, but toilets in shopping centres are visited by hundreds of users every day which makes their cleanliness questionable. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the sanitary condition of electrical <b>hand</b> <b>dryers</b> in toilets of the selected shopping centres in Kraków. Material and methods. Air was sampled at the outlet of electrical <b>hand</b> <b>dryers</b> and surface swabs of <b>hand</b> <b>dryers</b> were taken in toilets of five shopping centres. Air sampling was conducted using the MAS- 100 impactor. The number of mesophilic bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, staphylococci and Escherichia coli was determined. The results of air analyses were compared with the limits provided by the Polish Standards on air quality. Results. The number of microorganisms varied between the studied centres. In terms of mesophilic bacteria and fungi the air was unpolluted. The concentration of actinomycetes however significantly exceeded the limits set by the Polish Standards. Numerous Escherichia coli were found both in the air and in swabs in one of the centres. However the number of E. coli and staphylococci did not exceed the minimum infective dose. Conclusions. The studies showed high concentrations of airborne actinomycetes and staphylococci. Also the presence of E. coli in the air and swabs allows the conclusion that legal regulations for concentrations of airborne microorganisms are necessary to make people aware of this problem. However, it was found that using electrical <b>hand</b> <b>dryers</b> does not have impact on human health...|$|R
