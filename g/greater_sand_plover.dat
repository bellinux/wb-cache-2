5000|$|Some 96 km2 {{of the bay}} {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports, with its low-tide feeding habitat and high-tide roosting sites, over 1% of the world population of great knots. [...] Other birds recorded from the bay in significant numbers include black-tailed godwits, <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> Terek sandpipers and beach stone-curlews. Chestnut rails inhabit the mangroves.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its {{importance}} for shorebirds, Eighty Mile Beach {{is classified as}} an Important Bird Area (IBA) {{and is one of}} the principal shorebird study sites in north-western Australia. It regularly supports over 400,000 shorebirds, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, red knots, red-necked stints, grey-tailed tattlers, Terek sandpipers, pied oystercatchers, <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> Oriental plovers, red-capped plovers and Oriental pratincoles, with irregular high counts of other species. [...] Since 1981 almost yearly expeditions by the Australasian Wader Studies Group have been banding and counting shorebirds there as part of a long-term program of monitoring the populations using the East Asian - Australasian Flyway. Since 1992 most birds caught have also been leg-flagged in order to discover their precise migration routes and staging sites.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} birds were named after Leschenault, {{including}} <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius leschenaultii [...] ), white-crowned forktail (Enicurus leschenaulti [...] ) and sirkeer malkoha (Phaenicophaeus leschenaultii [...] ).|$|E
50|$|Size {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{distinguishing}} a lesser sand plover from a <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> with the lesser being slightly smaller. However, {{it is not easy to}} rely on size alone especially when seen individually. The length of the bill is another distinguishing feature, with the lesser generally having a shorter bill compared to a greater. The colour of the legs in a lesser sand plover is generally darker, ranging from black to grey, while in a <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> it is much paler, ranging from grey to yellowish.|$|E
5000|$|Bird Point, also located {{northwest}} of Robbins Island where {{a number of}} birds species permanently roost in the area. They include: fairy terns, little terns, Caspian terns, crested terns, pied oystercatchers and sooty oystercatchers. Many species of migratory birds come to nest here and include grey-tailed tattlers, <b>great</b> knots, lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> masked lapwings, Pacific golden plovers, red knots, red-capped plovers, red-necked stints, ruddy turnstones, sanderlings, waders, double-banded plovers, curlew sandpipers, common greenshanks, bar-tailed godwit and hooded plovers.|$|R
50|$|About 250,000 waders {{visit the}} Gulf shores and mudflats at peak {{migration}} time; {{these include the}} grey plover, the <b>greater</b> and lesser <b>sand</b> <b>plovers,</b> the crab plover, the Kentish plover and the broad-billed sandpiper. The coast, and particularly offshore islands are used by many seabirds. About twenty to thirty percent of the world's Socotra cormorants, about 200,000 birds, breed in the United Arab Emirates, but they are under threat from fishermen who fear for their livelihoods. Sooty gulls breed here, as do red-billed tropicbirds {{as well as several}} species of tern; white-cheeked, bridled and lesser crested tern.|$|R
40|$|Geolocators were {{deployed}} on waders in Australia {{for a third}} successive year, in Feb/Apr 2011 including on Eastern Curlew and Sanderling for the first time. Retrieval rates, in the 2011 / 12 austral summer, varied markedly between species. Technical performance of the geolocators was better than in previous years. However units on <b>Greater</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>Plovers,</b> migrating to breeding grounds in the Gobi Desert, China/Mongolia, again behaved erratically, and exhibited symptoms suggesting extraneous electromagnetic interference. Generally, for each species studied, the results confirm earlier indications that {{the first step of}} northward migration from Australia is a long non-stop flight. Subsequent movements to breeding areas are usually shorter with up to three stopovers in SE Asia or Siberia. Similarly southward migration strategies include at least one long nonstop flight, though this is usually the second (or later) leg of the journey. The timing of migration appears to be particularly related to breeding latitude. Eastern Curlews, which breed at relatively southern latitudes, depart from SE Australia from early March, reach the breeding grounds and lay eggs in April, set off on return migration in early June and, after a long stopover in the Yellow Sea, arrive back in SE Australia in early August. In contrast arctic-breeding Ruddy Turnstones do not depart from SE Australia until mid/late April and do not arrive back at their non-breeding locations until October, with the last individuals (which have taken a trans-Pacific route) not returning until late November/early December. Recorded migration speeds (assuming the birds take a great circle route) were quite variable, ranging from 32 to 84 km/h, presumably due to wind conditions. They generally averaged nearer to 50 km/h rather than the 60 â€“ 70 km/h which waders are known to be capable of achieving and which has been the basis of some past flight range calculations...|$|R
50|$|In all plumages, {{this species}} {{is very similar}} to the <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover,</b> Charadrius leschenaultii. Separating the species may be {{straightforward}} in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is more difficult to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the Middle Eastern race of <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> is the most similar to the lesser. The lesser usually has darker legs, a white forehead, and a more even white wing bar than the greater.|$|E
50|$|The lesser sand plover's {{feeds on}} insects, {{crustaceans}} and annelid worms, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, {{rather than the}} steady probing of some other wader groups.

50|$|It is {{a partial}} migrant. Birds leave the United States, except Florida, to winter south in Brazil. Some Mexican birds leave in winter for Peru. Furthermore, a small {{resident}} population is known from Brazil, it being named {{as a new}} subspecies, brasiliensis, in 2008. In 2012 it was established {{that this is a}} junior synonym, and the correct name for the subspecies is crassirostris.

5000|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>sand</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius leschenaultii) {{is a small}} wader in the plover {{family of}} birds. The {{spelling}} is commonly given as [...] "greater sandplover" [...] or [...] "greater sand-plover", but the official British Ornithologists' Union spelling is [...] "Greater Sand Plover". The genus name Charadrius is a Late Latin word for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek kharadrios a bird found in ravines and river valleys (kharadra, [...] "ravine"). The specific leschenaultii commemorates the French botanist Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour.|$|E
