30|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{have become}} a research focus owing to their various applications in self-cleaning [1, 2], corrosion resistance [3, 4] and anti-icing [5]. It has been proven both surface energy [6] and roughness [7, 8] are the crucial factors to obtain superhydrophobicity. Based on these two factors, coating [9, 10], chemical depositing [11] and many other approaches have been advanced to prepare artificial superhydrophobic surfaces. On account that the surface modification technics to lower surface energy are well-developed, method to construct the rough structures becomes a key issue. There are two forms of rough surfaces {{that can be applied}} to obtain superhydrophobicity, surfaces with disordered structures and ordered structures. The ordered structured arrays with designed parameters appear to be more effective in revealing the mechanism of superhydrophobic surfaces or endowing special functions [12, 13]. For example, it has been reported recently that micro arrays with specific parameters allow a reduction in contact time when water droplets impact on this kind of superhydrophobic surfaces [14, 15], which results in these surfaces with micro post arrays being promising for application prospects in anti-icing from freezing rain. Several methods to prepare superhydrophobic post arrays have been reported, including photolithography, electric <b>spark</b> wire <b>cutting</b> and laser texturing. Öner and co-workers [16] obtained superhydrophobic post arrays on silicon substrates with a variety of topographies by changing the photomasks in lithography process. Butt et al. [17] used lithography to prepare SU- 8 photoresist arrays with superhydrophobicity. Liu et al. [14] prepared superhydrophobic tapered posts on copper (Cu) substrates by using wire electro discharge machining followed by chemical etching and coating thin polymer. Van et al. [18] utilized laser texturing as well as surface energy modification to fabricate superhydrophobic square posts on stainless steel substrates. However, for the aforementioned methods, the machining efficiency of wire electro discharge machining for large-area array structures is very low, in addition, {{it is very difficult to}} fabricate post arrays with diameters of several tens of micrometers. Laser texturing not only requires expensive equipment but also is difficult to efficiently fabricate post arrays with diameter of several tens of micrometers. Photolithography is a highly efficient method to prepare superhydrophobic micro arrays, but currently, it can only be applied on silicon and photoresist substrates. Considering that metals are one of the most widely used materials, an effective method to fabricate superhydrophobic array structures on engineering metals has great significance for moving superhydrophobic surfaces towards real-world applications.|$|R

40|$|Explosions in U. S. {{coal mines}} have caused death and injury to miners and {{destruction}} of workings since the first reported explosion in 1810. These explosions are caused when buildups of explosive gas and/or dust in the mine are ignited {{by the presence of}} a flame or spark. Methane gas is inherently generated and held by adsorption in coal and is normally liberated during mining. Because this gas is explosive in the range of 5 %- 15 % by volume, fresh air is constantly supplied to the working face to prevent the methane/air mixture from reaching this explosive range. The required amount of ventilation air is based on estimates of gas release under normal conditions. Occasionally, unanticipated and unusually high emissions are encountered, which, despite normal ventilation controls, result in an explosive mixture that a <b>spark</b> from a <b>cutting</b> bit or electrical equipment can easily ignite. Investigations have shown that such emissions are often associated with anomalous geologic features or conditions.

40|$|The {{ignition}} {{of natural}} combustible material by hot metal particles {{is an important}} fire ignition pathway by which wildland and wildland-urban-interface spot fires are started. There are numerous cases reported of wild fires started by clashing power-lines or from sparks generated by machines or engines. Similarly there are many cases reported of fires caused by grinding, welding and <b>cutting</b> <b>sparks.</b> Up to this point, research on hot particle spot fire ignition has largely focused on particle generation and transport. A small {{number of studies have}} examined what occurs after a hot particle contacts a natural fuel bed, but until recently the process remained poorly understood. This work describes an investigation of the effect of particle size, temperature and thermal properties on the ability of hot particles to cause flaming ignition of cellulosic fuel beds. Both experimental and theoretical approaches are used, with a focus on understanding the physics underlying the ignition process. For the experimental study, spheres of stainless steel, aluminum, brass and copper are heated in a tube furnace and dropped onto a powdered cellulose fuel bed; the occurrence of flaming ignition or lack thereof is visually observed and recorded. This procedure is repeated a large number of times for each metal type, varying particle diameter from 2 to 11 mm and particle temperature between 575 and 1100 degrees C. The results of these experiments are statistically analyzed to find approximate ignition boundaries and identify boundary trends with respect to the particle parameters of interest. Schlieren images recorded during the ignition experiments are also used to more accurately describe the ignition process. Based on these images, a simple theoretical model of hot particle spot fire ignition is developed and used to explore the experimental trends further. The model under-predicts the minimum ignition temperatures required for small spheres, but agrees qualitatively with the experimental data. Model simulations identify the important physics controlling ignition for different sized particles and clarify many of the experimental trends. The results show a hyperbolic relationship between particle size and temperature, with the larger particles requiring lower temperatures to ignite the cellulose than the smaller particles. For very small spheres, the temperature required for ignition is very sensitive to particle size, while for very large spheres, ignition temperature shows only a weak dependence on that variable. Flaming ignition of powdered cellulose by particles < 11 mm in size requires particle temperatures of at least 600 C. Ignition has not been observed for 2 mm particles at temperatures up to 1100 C, but the statistical analysis indicates that ignition by particles 2 mm and smaller may be possible at temperatures above 950 C. No clear trend is observed with particle metal type, but copper particles require slightly higher ignition temperatures and seem more sensitive to experimental variation, likely due to their relatively high thermal conductivity. High-speed Schlieren images taken during the ignition experiments show that once particles land, they volatilize the powdered cellulose and the fuel vapor diffuses out into the surrounding air. Ignition occurs in the mixing layer between the vapor and the air, either during the initial expansion of the pyrolyzate away from the particle, or after a stable plume of volatiles has formed. Modeling results indicate that in the large-particle, high-conductivity limit, the particle's surface temperature remains close to its impact temperature over the timescales of ignition. As a result, particle thermal properties are unimportant and ignition occurs when heat generation in the mixing layer overcomes losses to the surrounding air. When the large-particle limit does not apply, the particle cools upon impact with the fuel bed. In addition to the losses to the surrounding air, the reaction zone experiences losses to the cooling particle and must generate a larger amount of heat for ignition to occur. Because cooling is so important, the initial bulk energy is more useful than impact temperature for predicting ignition by smaller particles. Along those lines, the additional heat of melting available to molten particles helps to resist particle cooling; as such, molten aluminum particles 3. 5 - 7 mm in diameter can ignite at lower temperatures than solid particles of the same size with similar thermal properties. Decreasing volumetric heat capacity does increase minimum ignition temperature somewhat, but this effect is reduced for larger particles. Emissivity {{does not appear to have}} a significant effect on ignition propensity, suggesting that, over the timescales of ignition, radiation heat transfer is small relative to other modes of particle heat loss...|$|R
