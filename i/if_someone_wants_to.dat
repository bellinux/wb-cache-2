2500|$|There was {{considerable}} negative {{reaction to the}} characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that [...] "the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas". Critic Scott Mendelson said [...] "To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement." [...] Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers [...] "not to support this film" [...] because [...] "you'll be taking [...] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around." [...] Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as [...] "good clean fun" [...] and insisted that [...] "We're just putting more personality in." [...] Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with [...] "It's really {{hard for us to}} sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1922 {{there were}} at least 7 million {{homeless}} children in Russia as a result of nearly a decade of devastation from World War I and the Russian Civil War. This {{led to the creation of}} a large number of orphanages. By the 1930s the USSR declared the abolition of homelessness and any citizen was obliged to have a propiska– a place of permanent residency. Nobody could be stripped of propiska without substitution or refuse it without a confirmed permission (called [...] "order") to register in another place. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move to another city or expand their living area, he had to find a partner who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> mutually exchange the flats.

5000|$|Some {{advocates of}} SOCE (such as NARTH) have spoken {{in favor of}} a patient's right to reject SOCE and embrace a lesbian, gay or {{bisexual}} identity. Richard A.

25|$|Riis {{said that}} he bought and {{injected}} the EPO himself, and team coach Walter Godefroot {{turned a blind eye}} to the drug use on the team. He denied a passage of Jeff d'Hont's book, where it is related that his hematocrit level was once tested by the team and registered 64%. He said <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> take his yellow jersey they could do so, it meant nothing to him.

50|$|Mirror {{movements}} {{are characterized by}} involuntary movements {{on one side of}} the body mirroring voluntary movements on the other. For example, <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> pick up a pencil with their left hand, then their right hand would also reach out for the same pencil. This mostly affects the top half of the body but can also affect the bottom half. Walking may become more difficult, as one leg will move at the same time as the other. Playing a musical instrument such as the piano may become very difficult, as the process involves doing different things with each hand.|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} some news {{releases}} claiming that Professor Henle in Germany has found the chemical identity of UMF, and that in future chemical analysis will be used instead of assays of antibacterial activity to indicate the level of UMF in manuka honey.

5000|$|The Palestinian activist Hanan Debwania wrote: Sabella is {{more than}} a voice for Palestinians; he is a {{spokesman}} for humanity, for his struggle of growing up in Jerusalem under occupation was a struggle not only for civil rights, but for human rights…I always say <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> feel occupation, he or she must visit the ghost city of Hebron.

5000|$|The {{following}} day, trade Hasan Abazi {{was arrested}} with fellow unionist Izet Mustafa who was released immediately by Serbian border police at a crossing near Gnjilane, Kosovo.

5000|$|One {{historical}} {{innovation that}} came out of new media studies is the use of Hypertext and its relationship with Index. The term [...] "hypertext" [...] was first used by Ted Nelson, who defined it in his self-published Literary Machines as [...] "non-sequential writing. [...] Before the rise of the internet in the 1980s <b>if</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> find specific information they would use an index usually in a book or article. This would create a very linear way of finding information. What hypertext did to change this was enabling the reader or user to instantly find information on very specific topics allowing for a nonlinear way of finding information. The idea of hypertext as a way of accessing information {{can be traced back to}} 1945.|$|R
50|$|The two-piece tiger tallies (hu-fu, 虎符 in Chinese) {{were used}} by a king or emperor to command and {{dispatch}} the army. The right piece was retained in the central government while the left piece was issued to the local officials or commanders. <b>If</b> <b>someone</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> dispatch the troops from a certain area, he had to show the right piece of the tiger tally {{in order to obtain}} authorization; both pieces of the tally had to match each other. The word hu-fu first appears in the biography of Hsin-ling in the Records of the Grand Historian, which {{tells the story of the}} stealing of a tiger tally to relieve the state of Zhao. During the Warring States period this kind of fu was changed from jade to bronze.|$|R

There were also virtually no empty and unused apartments in the cities: any flat where nobody was registered was immediately lent by the state at a symbolic price to others who needed better living conditions. If a person who had permanent registration could not pay for shelter, nobody had right to evict them, only to demand money through a court.|$|R
