40|$|The {{inherent}} {{variability of}} seed and fertilizer application from volumetric metering devices is not readily recognized. The Canadian Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute (P AMI) suggests a maximum {{coefficient of variation}} (CV) of 15 % among outlets for seeding grain or applying fertilizer. P AMI does not report down-the-row variability of individual outlets. Parameters that influence variability of volumetric measuring external fluted wheels such as rotational speed of the metering wheel, product delivery rate, seed size, and cell collection lengths were examined. In the first study, external <b>fluted</b> <b>wheel</b> meters on four grain drills were tested for seed delivery variability for wheat and soybeans, both among the metering outlets and down-the-row for individual meters. Tests on two additional drills, one an air drill {{and the other with}} external fluted metering, used two sizes of soybean seeds and two travel speeds. For wheat, down-the-row CV ranged from 12. 5 to 22. 5 % and the CV among metering units ranged from 12. 5 to 21 %. For soybeans, the CV ranged from 15. 5 to 41. 5 % with the air drill having the lower CV. A faster travel speed gave a lower CV for both drills metering soybeans. In a second study, when metering wheat, the seeding rate variability due to cell size and seeding rate were evaluated. Each meter was evaluated with cells 0. 48 or 0. 96 m in length and seeding rates of 60, 80, 90, and 100 kg/ha. The down-the-row CV ranged from 10 to 28 % with 0. 48 m length cells, and from 4 to 22 % with 0. 96 m length cells. Some of these CVs may be too high for a metering mechanism such as the <b>fluted</b> <b>wheel</b> to be used in SSCM...|$|E
40|$|Site Specific Crop Management is a {{technique}} by which agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizer and herbicides are adjusted to match the requirements of specific field areas. Agricultural machines must apply the correct application rate at each field location. One possibility is to add a controller to obtain variable rate capability from conventional metering mechanisms for uniform application. ^ Two control systems for variable rate capability with conventional grain drills were evaluated in this study. Both were operator controlled open loop systems. ^ One system used a set of rate switches. An electric linear actuator moved the meter adjustment lever and contacted limit switches for each rate setting of external <b>fluted</b> <b>wheel</b> meters. The other system used a rheostat to control the speed of an electric motor driving internal <b>fluted</b> <b>wheel</b> meters. ^ Seeding rate and rate change response were determined by operating the drills over a course of artificial turf mats. A four-parameter sigmoid model described the distribution profile. ^ The linear actuator system response time averaged 5. 6 s for a 20 kg/ha rate increase. The response time varied considerably for a 10 kg/ha increase and was inconsistent for decreased rates. ^ For rotary actuation, response times varied from 3 to 9 s depending upon the rate change magnitude. This control system performed well for rate increases and decreases. ^ Finally, theoretical guidelines were developed to characterize the transition area accompanying a change from one application rate to another. Response time was divided into (1) actuation lag and (2) actuator mechanical response. Actuation lag was greater for the linear actuator. Generally, the mechanical response was longer for decreasing rates. For a 10 kg/ha rate change, the 68 % confidence interval lower limit of the final rate overlapped the 68 % confidence interval upper limit of the initial rate. With a 20 kg/ha change, no rate overlap occurred. More variability {{was associated with the}} estimation of the inflection point of the sigmoid curve for 10 kg/ha than for 20 kg/ha. This indicates that the metering systems were less suitable for smaller rate changes. ...|$|E
