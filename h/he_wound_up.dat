5|$|Danilo Di Luca {{tried to}} {{attack from the}} pink jersey group a few times {{at the foot of}} the climb, but Menchov {{answered}} each time. When Ivan Basso and Carlos Sastre attacked, Menchov and Di Luca let them go, seeming fixed solely on one another. Sastre's attack proved to be the crucial one, as he seemed quite fresh for having been climbing for over seven hours, staying clear of the pink jersey and blowing past Popovych to claim the stage win. With the time gained on the road as well as bonus seconds at the line, Sastre moved up to third in the overall classification. Menchov outsprinted Di Luca to the finish line, gaining one second on the road and four bonus seconds to slightly pad his lead over Di Luca. Thomas Lövkvist, who had been in the white jersey as best young rider, was dropped very early on in this stage and finished 24 minutes behind the stage winner. <b>He</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> dropping all the way to fifth in the youth classification, with Quick Step rider Kevin Seeldraeyers, 15th overall, assuming the white jersey.|$|E

Mo Ryan concluded that anyone who was doubting whether Martin had forgotten about writing television scripts should now put their doubts to rest. The [...] "expert" [...] review from the A.V. Club by Todd VanDerWerff noted [...] "a definite sense of Martin's hand at work here. Characters that have never quite worked onscreen—like Sansa—suddenly feel much more alive. Characters that have been working—like Tyrion and Arya—get lots of fun stuff to play that never once feels labored." ...|$|E

Baseball historians Rob Neyer and Bill James ranked Joss' fastball third (1900–1904) and sixth (1905–1909) in the major leagues. George Moriarty explained that Joss had only one curveball because [...] "he believed that with a few well mastered deliveries he could acquire great control and success with less strain on his arm." [...] In an era filled with spitball pitchers, Joss achieved his success without ever altering the baseball. Joss threw with a corkscrew windup motion, described as [...] "an exaggerated pinwheel motion."

500|$|Acknowledging {{the failure}} of the ongoing Anarky series, Grant has conceeded that its themes, in {{particular}} his interest in exploring esoteric concepts such as philosophy of mind, likely resulted in [...] "plummeting" [...] sales. Breyfogle claimed the difficulty of combining escapist entertainment with social commentary as his explanation for the series' failure. Breyfogle wrote at the time: [...] "Anarky is a hybrid of the mainstream and the not-quite-so-mainstream. This title may have experienced exactly what every 'half-breed' suffers: rejection by both groups with which it claims identity." [...] Besides the themes, commentators have also found the escalation of Anarky's skills and special heroics as a source of criticism among readers. [...] "I liked the original concept behind Anarky: a teenage geek who reads The Will to Power one too many times and decides to go out and fix the world," [...] wrote a critic for Fanzing, an online newsletter produced by comic book fans and professionals. [...] "But the minute <b>he</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> getting $100 million in a Swiss Bank account, owning a building, impressing Darksied, getting a Boom Tube and was shown as being able to outsmart Batman, outhack Oracle and generally be invincible, I lost all interest I had in the character." ...|$|E
