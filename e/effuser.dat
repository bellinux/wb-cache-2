40|$|A {{system for}} calculating the {{physical}} properties of supersonic rotational flow with axial symmetry and supersonic rotational flow in a two-dimensional field {{was determined by}} use of the characteristics method. The system {{was applied to the}} study of external and internal flow for supersonic inlets with axial symmetry. For a circular conical inlet the shock that occurred at the lip of the inlet became stronger as it approached the axis of the inlet and became a normal shock at the axis. The region in which strong shock occurred increased with increase of the angle of internal cone at the lip of the inlet. For an inlet with a central body the method of characteristics was applied to the design of an internal channel shape that, theoretically, results in very efficient recompression in the inlet. It was shown that if an <b>effuser</b> is connected with the diffuser a body of revolution with very small shock-wave drag can be determined. (author) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a theoretical and experimental investigation into unsteady flows in pipes with cross-sectional area changes. One-dimensional unsteady flow theory {{using the method}} of characteristics is used for analysing the wave action in the pipes. Both homentropic and non-homentropic flows are investigated. For gradual area changes (<b>effuser,</b> diffuser) the generalized one-dimensional unsteady flow theories including friction are used. For sudden area changes quasi-steady flow theories at the area change are described to evaluate the boundary conditions. At a contraction the flow {{is assumed to be}} isentropic, whilst at an enlarge-ment it is assumed that the flow is adiabatic but not isentropic. In the latter instance, it is assumed that there is a pressure recovery according to the conservation equations; this theory is equivalent to the sudden enlarge-ment theory with pressure recovery at the plane of the area change. Steady flow experiments are described to test the validity of the above assumptions. These show excellent agreement with the theory for the contraction. In the case of the enlargement the tests show that the plane of recovery is some distance downstream of the area change, the distance depending on the dimensions of the area change and the pressure ratio. Extensive unsteady flow tests are described. Good agreement between the theoretical diagrams and experi-mental results is obtained from the gradual area changes and the sudden contraction. For the sudden enlarge...|$|E
40|$|Summary. [...] A {{series of}} tests Was {{undertaken}} on a simple, two-dimensional, variable Mach-m. ~mber <b>effuser,</b> or nozzle, designed for the range of supersonic flows up to I~{ach number 3. 0. The performance of the nozzle was assessed from {{the magnitude of the}} percentage variation in its exit Mach-number distribution. Studies of the effect on the performance of alterations to the position of the nozzle-block pivots and other geometrical features were made. On the basis of these studies, a final build of nozzle was developed which produced flow of a uniformity sufficient for intake and engine model testing over the Mach-number range from 1. 5 to 3. 0. 1. Ir~troduction. [...] A simple two-dimensional variable Mach-number effnser, or nozzle, to operate over the range from Mach number 1. 5 to Math number 2 - 8 may be required for intake and enginemodel testing at high speed at the National Gas Turbine Establishment. A larger tolerance on the uniformity of Math number in the working-section is permitted than is normal in a supersonic wind tunnel. Initially, several types of variable nozzle were considered for this use; they were the P, exible-wall nozzle, the asymmetric sliding-block nozzle 1, the scissors-type nozzle ", the hinged-plate nozzle ~, the slotted-wall nozzle and the sliding-bump nozzle. The complexity of the control system, the liability of the plate to failure due to the malfunctioning of the system, and the limitation of th...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was the design of a supersonic wind tunnel for use in determining the internal flow in engine intakes between Mach 1. 5 and Mach 3 and in ranges of pitch (+ 15 deg) and engine mass flow experienced in flight. It was shown that from a theoretical standpoint an open jet tunnel was the most effective for this particular purpose provided that its aerodynamic efficiency was comparable with that of any alternative type. Little data on this last point was available so that experimental work was. required to confirm the above choice. As preliminary tests showed that an efficient open jet tunnel was indeed possible, the experimental work was continued and an effective tunnel arrangement consisting of a simple. variable Mach number <b>effuser</b> and variable geometry diffuser was developed. This development work originally concerned the design of a practicable high-speed cell for an Engine Test Facility I and only later, using data accumulated in this investigation, a 6 in. x 6 in. tunnel capable of testing a 4 in. diameter inlet was constructed. A brief description of this tunnel is given. 1. 0. Introduction. At the present time, the usual method of estimating the performance of an engine in combination with a supersonic intake is by calculation from the known engine performance-and tbe performance of the intake as measured in tests on a scale model. In time, techniques and facilities may become available for the testing of the whole installation, in much the same manner as...|$|E
