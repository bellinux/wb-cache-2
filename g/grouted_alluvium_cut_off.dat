40|$|The pure global {{buckling}} and vibration of {{four sides}} simply supported {{as well as}} clamped anisotropic laminates having an arbitrary shape <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> region that is symmetric with respect to mid-plane have been studied by treating the remaining <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions as uniform plates with reduced stiffness. The reduced variation of stiffness of the plate is represented by Fourier series. Computational solutions of the energy principle for the Ritz method in a plate having arbitrary shape of typical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions under biaxial compressive loads are obtained. Some numerical results for the pure global buckling load prediction due to its reduced flexural stiffness for the circular <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions and elliptical <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions are presented. We find the normalized pure global buckling load ratio decreases as the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions size increases, and the non-dimensional fundamental frequency value decreases as the <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> regions size increases.

In {{order to determine the}} effects of disruption of irrigation in different growth stages of autumn’s rapeseed cultivars, an experiment was conducted in 2009 - 2010 at Isfahan agriculture research station. A split plot layout within a randomized complete block design 3 replications was used. Main plots were seven levels of <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation namely, D 1 = current irrigation or irrigation after 80 millimeter vaporize from class A basin to physiological maturity, D 2 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation from stem elongation phase and then on, D 3 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation from flowering and then on, D 4 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation from pod formation phase and then on, D 5 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in stem and flowering phase, D 6 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in stem and pod phase, D 7 = <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> the irrigation in flower and pod formation, and sub plots were two rapeseed cultivars, namely, Zarfam and Okapi. With increasing the number of irrigation, rapeseed yield will increase, but if the water lacks occurred, it is better not to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> irrigation in flower and stem phase, in order to get acceptable seed and oil yield.

50|$|Leachate from fly ash {{can contain}} heavy metals {{in excess of}} {{allowable}} RCRA standard. The flow of water through the fly ash and into ground water is controlled by using low-permeability clay layers and cutoff trenches/walls. Low-permeability clays have permeability {{on the order of}} 10−7 cm/s. Vertical flows through the foundation are controlled by siting fly ash ponds on areas of thick clay or rock layers that provide suitably low permeability through the base of the pond. Areas with high sub-surface permeability can be improved by importing suitable clay. Horizontal flows through the embankment are controlled using clay zones within the embankment. <b>Cut</b> <b>off</b> trenches and <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> walls are used to connect the embankment clay zones and the foundation clay layers. <b>Cut</b> <b>off</b> trenches are trenches that are dug into the selected low-permeability sub-surface layer and backfilled with clay to key the embankment clay zone into the sub-surface. <b>Cut</b> <b>off</b> trenches are generally used when the low permeability foundation layer(s) are near surface. <b>Cut</b> <b>off</b> walls are similar to <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> trenches, but are generally much deeper and narrower, and use either slurry or grout instead of clay.|$|R
