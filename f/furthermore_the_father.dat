5000|$|Outside of {{the racial}} context, the term is also used in {{explanation}} of workplace bullying, though in that case the circumstances are much different, {{so much so that}} the Native Women's Association of Canada considers this usage to be an improper conflation of the two scenarios. They maintain that intergenerational trauma of colonialism is the root cause of lateral violence in indigenous communities. [...] An example of this interpretation of intergenerational trauma would be the Corey and Cody Manyshots case which involved two Aboriginal youth kidnapping and sexually assaulting a teen. The father of the teens was involved in animal cruelty cases involving a Bichon Frise and elastic bands. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> threatened to attack reporters at his sons' trials. [...] Corey Manyshots was on bail for defacing the Dashmesh Cultural Centre, a Sikh temple in Calgary. [...] This interpretation through an intergenerational trauma perspective would understand that both Corey and Cody Manyshots were the subject of collective trauma from the colonial injustices passed down from generation to generation and have less a responsibility for criminal acts and reprehensible behaviors. [...] Critics such as Ezra Lavant, Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond and Joan Jack have written numerous articles stating that this interpretation is flawed, and insist that this ideology perpetuates violence among Aboriginals. The Government of Canada commissioned a study in 2008 by the Minister of Health, it reported that although there were root causes such as the residential school system and loss of culture in Aboriginals which could lead to increases in propensities towards domestic abuse and violence, the aggravation factor in an overwhelming number of the cases involved drugs or alcohol.|$|E

Why {{integrate}} economics into {{intellectual property}} teaching?: While {{there is a}} limit on time and courses that can be devoted to a discussion of economics in the intellectual property curriculum, there certainly is not a limit in interest. I have taught a number of intellectual property courses over the past decade which integrate discussion of economic concepts, including a seminar on the law and economics of intellectual property. The materials that follow provide one blueprint for how to think about the relationship between economics and intellectual property.

40|$|This essay {{has tried}} to find attitudes and {{experiences}} regarding involved fatherhood and parental leave. This has been accomplished through qualitative interviews with five fathers in Uppsala, Sweden. All the respondents were already on or {{were supposed to go}} on parental leave. In accordance with the aim of the study the interviews and the analysis proceeded from three topics: fatherhood and family situation; impacts from the daily environment; and effects based on their own fatherhood. These topics were constructed from the two theories that were used to frame the purpose of the study; the theories that were used were the modernistic gender contract (modernistiskt genuskontrakt) and hegemonic masculinity. The study mainly focused on finding what inspired the respondents to go on parental leave and how this differed between them. Apart from that, the study was supposed to find how and if the attitude of the respondents were affected by their local environment. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> study intended to find how parental leave could change the attitudes of the respondents towards work versus family relations. The results of the qualitative interviews compared to the literature review showed that the respondents mainly chose to go on parental leave to strengthen the gender equality in the family and to build a stronger relationship between themselves and their children. The division of parental leave between the partners was mainly chosen due to practical reasons. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> interviewed <b>fathers</b> got their largest influence from their own fathers and discussions within the family. Lastly, the parental leave gave <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> a stronger connection to their children and a deeper understanding of having the primary responsibility for their children. ...|$|R
50|$|On 7 October 1907 in Christchurch, New Zealand, kitchen maid Lillian Fanny Jane Hobbs {{gave birth}} to an infant in the {{lavatory}} of the restaurant where she worked. A coworker had noticed her pregnancy {{for the last three}} months, but Miss Hobbs appeared shortly after giving birth and stated that she was recovering from cholera. However, there were bloodstains found in the lavatory and the body of a newborn infant was found, wrapped in Miss Hobbs' skirt and clothing underneath a pile of clothes. When questioned by police, Miss Hobbs stated that she was not aware whether the newborn infant was dead or alive, as it had not cried since its birth. Miss Hobbs was tried before the Supreme Court for child murder but the defence argued that the young woman was experiencing anguish, psychological disorientation and intense pain during unassisted childbirth. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> infant's <b>father</b> was nowhere to be found.

50|$|Although Maynard was {{originally}} {{one of the}} city's largest landholders and strongest boosters, he is considered not to have prospered {{as well as his}} contemporaries. Among the reasons given for this are that his friendly relations with Chief Seattle and other natives made him suspect to his fellow settlers. His Democratic politics may have been a disadvantage in an increasingly Republican region and his civic minded gestures helped others who did not always help him in return. Maynard started out much older than his fellow city fathers, and thus died much sooner. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> surviving city <b>fathers</b> minimized his role in their reminiscences in response to Maynard's autocratic rule of early Seattle.

40|$|Sir Thomas Gray's Scalacronica {{is almost}} unique amongst medieval English chronicles in having {{been written by}} a knight, and it is {{therefore}} surprising that so little {{work has been done}} on it; this thesis attempts to remedy that omission. Gray's life is very well documented, as is that of his <b>father</b> (who was <b>the</b> source of much of the Scalacronica’s narrative of the reign of Edward II - and also its main subject). Thus, unusually with a medieval chronicle, it is possible to examine the work in the context of its author’s career, providing a valuable insight into the attitudes and learning of a member of the gentry classes in fourteenth-century England. The Scalacronica starts with a well known literary dream sequence in which Gray names some of his written sources. An analysis of this passage reveals much about Gray's learning and his methods as a historian - and about his literary pretensions. He also relied on stories gleaned from his father; the manner in which he integrated them with his written sources is equally revealing about his interests and priorities. As the elder Gray was close to the court of Edward II, his son's political commentary is particularly interesting, providing an alternative to the more usual pro-Lancastrian bias of medieval chroniclers. <b>Furthermore,</b> both <b>the</b> <b>father</b> and son were prominent in the administration of the Marches, so the Scalacronica has an obvious - but hitherto unrecognised - relevance to current historiographical debates {{on the role of the}} gentry. Finally, the Scalacronica has been widely regarded as a 'chivalric' chronicle, embodying the values of medieval romance. However, a close analysis of Gray's text reveals that while he admired and respected acts of martial heroism, his attitude to the trappings of fourteenth-century chivalric culture was highly disdainful, and even cynical...|$|R

40|$|International audienceObjectives. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of fathers' and mothers' physical activity involvement and perceptions of their children's physical competence upon children's perceptions of competence and children's time spent in physical activity. Two forms of parental socialization influence were assessed: the direct influence of parents' actual physical activity (PA) behaviour (role modelling) on children's physical activity and the indirect influence of parents' beliefs systems about their children's PA competence on children's physical activity through children's self perceptions. Method. Longitudinal, with data from 152 French children (M= 9. 5 yrs., SD = 0. 8 yrs.) and their parents collected at two times over a 12 -month period and examined through structural equation modelling (SEM). Results. SEM indicated that mothers' role modelling behaviour had a direct effect on children's time spent in PA and that mothers' beliefs about their child's competence had an indirect effect on children's PA by influencing children's perceived competence which, in turn, contributed to children's level of physical activity involvement. Fathers' beliefs directly influenced their child's PA as did the children's own self-perceptions of competence. Conclusions. Parents can affect their children's PA involvement in direct and indirect manners through their role modelling of physical activity and through their beliefs about their child's competence. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>the</b> influence of <b>fathers</b> and mothers may be manifested in different ways.
