40|$|Ground-based {{measurements}} of stores, growth, mortality, litterfall, respiration, and decomposition {{were conducted in}} an old-growth forest at Wind River Experimental Forest, Washington, USA. These measurements were used to estimate gross primary production (GPP) and net primary pro-duction (NPP); autotrophic respiration (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh) respiration; and net ecosystem production (NEP). Monte Carlo methods were used to calculate uncertainty (expressed as ± 2 standard deviations of 200 – 400 calculations). Live carbon (C) stores were 39, 800 g C m) 2 (34, 800 – 44, 800 g C m) 2).

Rh, including the respiration of <b>heart</b> <b>rots</b> in tree boles, was 577 g C m) 2 y) 1 (479 – 675 g C m) 2 y) 1).

These estimates contrast with the larger sink estimated at the same site using eddy-flux methods. Several hypotheses to explain this discrepancy were ex-plored, including (a) undetected biomass increas-es, (b) underestimates of NPP, (c) unmeasured losses, and (d) a temporal mismatch between the two sets of measurements. The last hypothesis appears the most likely.

2500|$|Before {{cutting a}} tree, the builder had {{to assess the}} log, its shape, length, areas of damage {{and the extent of}} <b>heart</b> <b>rot,</b> as well as ways to work the bow and stern. [...] A major {{requirement}} while working with such an enormous log must have been to minimize the number of times the log had to be turned over. The first stage, therefore, would be to externally flatten the bottom and slightly upturn the bow and stern and shape the hull sides, as well as drilling holes for thickness gauges as required. [...] The log would then be rolled over and placed on some sort of timber framework so that access to the bottom was still possible. The next stage would be to work the upper section of the log to produce a sheerline and then work the inside until thickness gauges were reached. In this case, {{because of the presence of}} extensive rot, hollowing was probably done by tools rather than by fire. The thickness of the sides would be achieved by eye or by sound, simply by tapping the log. For the bottom, however, the holes left by the thickness gauges were later plugged by tightly fitted and dried oak tree-nails to ensure they were completely watertight upon expansion of the timber. The log would then be finished internally, with all the rebates for fitting bow timbers, transom, washstrakes, and holes along the sheerline cut. As the final step, bow and stern timbers, which were separate pieces from the hull log, would be caulked with moss and the whole structure made watertight.|$|E

Your father's business was a new business; and I don't start new businesses: I let other fellows start them. They put all their money and their friends' money into starting them. They wear out their souls and bodies trying to make a success of them. They're what you call enthusiasts. But the first dead lift of the thing is too much for them; and they haven't enough financial experience. In a year or so they have either to let the whole show go bust, or sell out to a new lot of fellows for a few deferred ordinary shares: that is, if they're lucky enough to get anything at all. As likely as not the very same thing happens to the new lot. They put in more money and a couple of years' more work; and then perhaps they have to sell out to a third lot. If it's really a big thing the third lot will have to sell out too, and leave their work and their money behind them. And that's where the real business man comes in: where I come in. But I'm cleverer than some: I don't mind dropping a little money to start the process. I took your father's measure. I saw that he had a sound idea, and that he would work himself silly for it if he got the chance. I saw that he was a child in business, and was dead certain to outrun his expenses and be in too great a hurry to wait for his market. I knew that the surest way to ruin a man who doesn't know how to handle money is to give him some. I explained my idea to some friends in the city, and they found the money; for I take no risks in ideas, even when they're my own. Your father and the friends that ventured their money with him were no more to me than a heap of squeezed lemons. You've been wasting your gratitude: my kind <b>heart</b> is all <b>rot.</b> I'm sick of it. When I see your father beaming at me with his moist, grateful eyes, regularly wallowing in gratitude, I sometimes feel I must tell him the truth or burst. What stops me is that I know he wouldn't believe me. He'd think it was my modesty, as you did just now. He'd think anything rather than the truth, which is that he's a blamed fool, and I am a man that knows how to take care of himself.

50|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>rot</b> {{and other}} tree disease serve as factors of {{environmental}} change. This is magnified {{in areas that}} are not prone to large scale dynamic disturbances like wildfires or are dominated by old growth timber. In older growth forests, trees are unable to combat <b>heart</b> <b>rot</b> effectively because they grow at a much slower pace. Extensive rot causes these trees to be more susceptible to high winds and trunk fracture. As the old growth dies out, it allows new growth to take its place, altering the dynamic of the environment. Decaying trees also provide shelter to animals as well as microorganisms. Through this process of dynamic change, <b>heart</b> <b>rot</b> contributes to biologically diverse habitats.|$|E

50|$|The {{prevention}} of <b>heart</b> <b>rot</b> {{can be a}} very difficult task but, there are effective measures to minimize damage.

Providing a tree with the necessary nutrients, water and growing conditions will promote healthy growth and minimize rot. The bark is the tree's main defense against disease; reducing the amount of large wounds and bare wood, especially in older trees, helps prevent rot.|$|E
