She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E

[...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be glad. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> hear less grumbling when my tithe is paid. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do if there were not a modus in Tipton." ...|$|R
