25|$|As {{a set of}} {{development}} policies, ISI policies are theoretically grounded on the Singer-Prebisch thesis, on the <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> argument, and on Keynesian economics. From these postulates, it derives a body of practices, which are commonly: an active industrial policy to subsidize and orchestrate production of strategic substitutes, protective barriers to trade (such as tariffs), an overvalued currency to help manufacturers import capital goods (heavy machinery), and discouragement of foreign direct investment.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 Sharaf was {{designated}} and appointed as Consul General of the United Arab Republic to Hong Kong, {{after having been}} nominated by President Gamal Abdul Nasser, and receiving the approbation of H.M. Queen Elizabeth II to the nomination. At the time, Hong Kong was a British colony. In Hong Kong, he assisted {{in the establishment of}} the offices and secured the general landing rights for Egypt's national carrier United Arab Airlines at Kai Tak International Airport. Regular flights to Hong Kong were added in March 1969, as a stopover destination to the scheduled flights of the airline on its Cairo to Tokyo route. Sharaf witnessed first-hand, and wrote extensively on the implementation of export-oriented policies, the colony's rise as a regional financial center, and the-then <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> of container shipping, with emphasis on the industry's future on world trade and its implications and benefits for the Suez Canal. At the time, Hong Kong was of particular interest to any China watcher, as well as for following political and military developments in South-East Asia and the ongoing war in Vietnam. In 1967, the Vietnam war had claimed the life of the head of the Egyptian Mission at Hanoi, Gamal Eldin Omar Ibrahim (1916 – 1967). Sharaf and Ibrahim were colleagues and friends, and Sharaf was vocal about his friend's untimely death, as well as his opposition to the war in Vietnam. Gamal Eldin Omar, the Egyptian Charge d'affaires at Hanoi, was wounded seeking shelter from an American air strike on the city. He would die later of complications in a Hong Kong hospital on 6 December 1967.|$|E

40|$|Promoting {{domestic}} production of certain goods/services {{has always been}} spurred by, e. g. a country's need to create job opportunities, to generate internal sources of revenue for general development, and to wean the country from its dependence on imports of goods/services which may not only exacerbate its terms of trade with other countries, but also inhibit {{the achievement of the}} other objectives mentioned above. LDCs' efforts to promote <b>infant</b> <b>industries</b> have wide coverage in the literature, yet little {{attention has been paid to}} the role certain specific actors, controlling specific resources and performing specific activities play in the success of such a developmental process. Drawing on the industrial network approach, this article seeks to deepen our understanding of the impact of the exchange relationships between multinational companies and their indigenous suppliers in the process of promoting <b>infant</b> <b>industries</b> in LDCs. <b>Infant</b> <b>Industries</b> Network Exchange Relationships Multinational Companies Indigenous Suppliers Import-substitution Learning Competence Regulation Deregulation...|$|R

2500|$|Economist Daniel Klein {{believes}} {{using the}} term [...] "free market economics" [...] or [...] "free market economist" [...] to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the [...] "Smithian" [...] identity. Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed {{that the government should}} subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the context}} of Latin American development, the term [...] "Latin American structuralism" [...] refers to the era of import {{substitution}} industrialization in many Latin American countries from the 1950s until the 1980s. The theories behind Latin American structuralism and ISI were organized {{in the works of}} Raúl Prebisch, Hans Singer, Celso Furtado, and other structural economic thinkers, and gained prominence with the creation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UNECLAC or CEPAL). While the theorists behind ISI or Latin American structuralism were not homogeneous and did not belong to one particular school of economic thought, ISI and Latin American structuralism and the theorists who developed its economic framework shared a basic common belief in a state-directed, centrally planned form of economic development. In promoting state-induced industrialization through governmental spending through the <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> argument, ISI and Latin American structuralist approaches to development are largely influenced by a wide range of Keynesian, communitarian, and socialist economic thought. ISI is often associated and linked with dependency theory, although the latter has traditionally adopted a much broader Marxist sociological framework in addressing what are perceived to be the origins of underdevelopment through the historical effects of colonialism, Eurocentrism, and neoliberalism.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, Smith {{outlined}} the proper expenses {{of the government}} in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods [...] "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" [...] such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: [...] "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves [...] [...] [...] are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state" [...] (Wealth of Nations, V.i.d.18). Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because [...] "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge". In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial: ...|$|E

40|$|Government {{intervention}} in green <b>infant</b> <b>industries</b> may be justified {{as a strategy}} to increase the provision of public goods. How should government policies be designed to promote such industries? One way to analyse this question is to compare government {{intervention in}} green <b>infant</b> <b>industries</b> {{in which it has}} been successful with green <b>infant</b> <b>industries</b> in which it has been less successful. The Danish government has intervened intensively in the wind turbine industry and organic farming sector mainly for environmental reasons since 1992 and 1987 respectively, but with very different impacts. While the electricity market share of wind energy reached 20 % in 2007, organic food consumption lags behind with a food market share of approximately 8. 5 % in 2007. This paper compares the packages of policy instruments applied in the two industrial sectors and assesses whether differences in instrument choice may explain the significant differences in market shares. It is demonstrated that government intervention in the wind turbine industry has emphasised the use of policy instruments designed to increase demand for wind energy, whereas organic farming policy has put more emphasis on instruments motivating farmers to increase supply. This may be an important factor explaining variance in growth. Finally, the paper analyses whether the lessons from government policy aimed at promoting the wind turbine industry can be transferred to organic farming policy...|$|R

60|$|There is {{this to be}} said in defence of men {{of letters}} on the {{business}} side, that literature is still an <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> with us, and, so far from having been protected by our laws, it was exposed for ninety years after {{the foundation of the}} republic to the vicious competition of stolen goods. It is true that we now have the international copyright law at last, and we can at least begin to forget our shame; but literary property has only forty-two years of life under our unjust statutes, and if it is attacked by robbers the law does not seek out the aggressors and punish them, as it would seek out and punish the trespassers upon any other kind of property; it leaves the aggrieved owner to bring suit against them, and recover damages, if he can. This may be right enough in itself; but I think, then, that all property should be defended by civil suit, and should become public after forty-two years of private tenure. The Constitution guarantees us all equality before the law, but the law-makers seem to have forgotten this in the case of our literary industry. So long as this remains the case, we cannot expect the best business talent to go into literature, and the man of letters must keep his present low grade among business men.|$|E

One was apt to meet him in those horse-cars which {{formerly}} tinkled {{back and forth between}} the two cities, and which were often so full of one's acquaintance that they had all the social elements of an afternoon tea. They were abusively overcrowded at times, of course, and one might easily see a prime literary celebrity swaying from, a strap, or hanging uneasily by the hand-rail to the lower steps of the back platform. I do not mean that I ever happened to see the author of Two Years Before the Mast in either fact, but in his celebrity he had every qualification for the illustration of my point. His book probably carried the American name farther and wider than any American books except those of Irving and Cooper at a day when our writers were very little known, and our literature was the only <b>infant</b> <b>industry</b> not fostered against foreign ravage, but expressly left to harden and strengthen itself as it best might in a heartless neglect even at home. The book was delightful, and I remember it from a reading of thirty years ago, as of the stuff that classics are made of. I venture no conjecture as to its present popularity, but of all books relating to the sea I think it, is the best. The author when I knew him was still Richard Henry Dana, Jr., his father, the aged poet, who first established the name in the public recognition, being alive, though past literary activity. It was distinctively a literary race, and in the actual generation it has given proofs of its continued literary vitality in the romance of 'Espiritu Santo' by the youngest daughter of the Dana I knew.|$|E
