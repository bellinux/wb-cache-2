5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by <b>frictional</b> <b>losses</b> {{in the oceans}} and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E

2500|$|Munk was {{the first}} to show rigorously why one side of the Moon always faces the Earth (Munk and McDonald, 1960; and later papers up to 1975), a {{phenomenon}} known as tidal locking. Lord Kelvin had also considered this question, and had fashioned a non-quantitative answer being roughly correct. [...] The Moon does not have a molten liquid core, so cannot rotate through the egg-shaped distortion caused by the Earth's gravitational pull. Rotation through this shape requires internal shearing, and only fluids are capable of such rotation with small <b>frictional</b> <b>losses.</b> Thus, the pointy end of the [...] "egg" [...] is gravitationally locked to always point directly towards the Earth, with some small librations, or wobbles. Large objects may strike the Moon from time to time, causing it to rotate about some axis, but it will quickly stop rotating. All frictional effects from such events will also cause the Moon to regress further away from the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gravitational}} torque {{between the}} Moon and the tidal bulge of Earth causes the Moon {{to be constantly}} promoted to a slightly higher orbit and Earth to be decelerated in its rotation. [...] As in any physical process within an isolated system, total energy and angular momentum are conserved. [...] Effectively, energy and angular momentum are transferred from the rotation of Earth to the orbital motion of the Moon (however, most of the energy lost by Earth (−3.321 TW) is converted to heat by <b>frictional</b> <b>losses</b> in the oceans and their interaction with the solid Earth, and only about 1/30th (+0.121 TW) is transferred to the Moon). The Moon moves farther away from Earth (+38.247±0.004mm/y), so its potential energy (in Earth's gravity well) increases. It stays in orbit, and from Kepler's 3rd law it follows that its angular velocity actually decreases, so the tidal action on the Moon actually causes an angular deceleration, i.e. a negative acceleration (−25.858±0.003"/century2) of its rotation around Earth. The actual speed of the Moon also decreases. Although its kinetic energy decreases, its potential energy increases by a larger amount.|$|E

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> of the tip seal simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> is examined with the test apparatus. By measuring pressure distribution around the tip seal in a tip seal groove, the sealing mechanism of the tip seal is clarified and a design guideline of the tip seal groove is obtained...|$|R

The purpose {{of this research is}} to characterize the {{flow characteristics}} of sewage by experimental means. A sophisticated and flexible experimental apparatus was designed and constructed.

Results indicated that raw sewage could be characterized as a power-law fluid with the rheological exponent n being 0. 891 and the rheological coefficient k being 0. 00175. In addition, the <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> factor formula in laminar flow for raw sewage was deduced by theoretical analysis of the power-law fluid. Furthermore, an explicit empirical formula for the <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> factor in turbulent flow was obtained through curve fitting of the experimental data.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{computational method}} for the calculations of flow and heat transfer in compact heat exchangers is developed {{in collaboration with}} the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. In this method, the unsteady Navier-Stokes and energy equations are solved. In the simulations of flow and heat transfer over relatively simple heat exchanger fin geometries, a linearly scalable performance of the code is achieved on the massively parallel CMS, demonstrating the capability of this method to solve large scale heat transfer problems. Using this code, the heat transfer enhancement mechanisms and performance of parallel-plate fin heat exchangers are studied extensively. Geometry effects such as finite fin thickness and different fin arrangements (inline and staggered) have been investigated. The time-dependent flow behavior due to vortex shedding has been taken into consideration by solving the unsteady Navier-Stokes and energy equations. In the unsteady regime, in addition to the time-dependent calculations, companion steady symmetrized flow calculations have also been performed to clearly identify the effect of vortex shedding on heat transfer and <b>frictional</b> <b>loss.</b> Additional comparisons have been made to the theoretical results for fully developed flow between uninterrupted continuous parallel plates and those of restarted boundary layers with negligible fin thickness, in order to quantify the role of boundary layer restart mechanism as well as the geometry effects of finite fin thickness and fin arrangement. It is shown in the current study that at higher Reynolds numbers, the additional effect introduced by intrinsic three-dimensionality of the flow also {{plays an important role in}} determining the overall heat exchanger performance. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, when the actual flow is threedimensional, corresponding two-dimensional models overpredict overall heat transfer efficiency by as much as 25 %, while the overprediction of <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> is much less. More importantly, the overprediction of rms fluctuations in heat transfer and <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> in two-dimensional models is much larger, where the amplitude of fluctuations from two-dimensional models can be as much as 2 and 5 times of those from corresponding three-dimensional models for the heat transfer efficiency (Colburn j factor) and <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> (friction factor), respectively. These differences are attributed to the strong coherence of spanwise vortices in two-dimensional simulations 'and the weakening of spanwise vortices in the corresponding three-dimensional simulations due to the presence of streamwise vortices. In two-dimensional simulations, the coherent spanwise vortices enhance mixing and result in higher heat transfer efficiency. These span wise vortices at the same time lowers skin friction on the fin surface. On the other hand, it has been well established that two-dimensional simulations overpredict form drag due to higher Reynolds stresses in the wake. In current two-dimensional simulations of flow over parallel-plate fins, the overprediction of form drag is nearly counter-balanced by the underprediction of skin friction. Such mechanisms also shed light on enhancing heat transfer while avoiding the normally associated increased pumping power penalty. In the simulations of flow and heat transfer in more complex louvered fin geometries, current numerical results clearly show the different flow regimes as the Reynolds number is increased, which are generally in agreement with those observed in experimental flow visualizations. However, at low Reynolds numbers, current interpretation of the flow characteristics is somewhat different. At higher Reynolds numbers, the effect of flow unsteadiness is to increase overall heat transfer and associated <b>frictional</b> <b>loss.</b> Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 3...|$|R
