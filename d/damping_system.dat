Initially, it had been expected that a Mach1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure.

Too many passengers die or injure every year because of accidents. Most of the vehicle manufacturing companies are unable to control these accidents. We are coming across the many accidents which {{were the result of}} poor designing and maintenance. The vehicles should have active safety system which will avoid the accidents as much as possible and passive safety system which will reduce the damage and loss of lives. The spring <b>damper</b> <b>system</b> is a passive safety system which will decrease the impact of accident. In this systems spring will store the energy and damper will dissipate the energy. This spring <b>damper</b> <b>system</b> reduces the impact of accident by increasing the time of collision as the spring needs some time to compress it totally.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Performance {{analysis}} for electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) fluid-based impact <b>damper</b> <b>systems</b> is evaluated {{on the basis}} of the Herschel–Bulkley shear model. Generally, ER–MR dampers have been analyzed based on the simple Bingham-plastic shear model. However, the Bingham-plastic shear model cannot well describe the behavior of the damper under conditions of high velocity and high field input. Therefore, in this study, the Herschel–Bulkley shear model, in which the constant postyield plastic viscosity in the Bingham model is replaced with a power law model dependent on shear rate, is used to assess the performance of ER–MR impact <b>damper</b> <b>systems.</b> In doing so, an ER–MR impact <b>damper</b> <b>system</b> is proposed and its governing equation of motion is derived {{on the basis of}} the Herschel–Bulkley shear model. Then, computer simulation is done to analytically evaluate characteristics of the ER–MR impact <b>damper</b> <b>system</b> under impact loads for constant current input and embedding end-stop on-off control algorithm. As an important parameter in the Herschel–Bulkley shear model, effects of the flow behavior index, n, that is the degree of shear thinning or shear thickening, on the performance of the impact <b>damper</b> <b>system</b> are shown...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{presented}} work {{extends the}} task of synthesis with new methods, with particular focus on the method of active and passive synthesis of vibrating <b>damping</b> mechanical <b>systems.</b> This paper {{is concerned with the}} formulation and formalisation of the problem of active and passive synthesis of mechanical <b>damping</b> <b>systems.</b> Design/methodology/approach: The work proposes a combination of the synthesis method of vibrating systems with the method of determining the active force as the method for active synthesis of mechanical <b>damping</b> <b>systems</b> and the values of two-terminal damping in case passive synthesis of mechanical <b>damping</b> <b>systems.</b> Findings: The performed active and passive synthesis of restrained systems has demonstrated an ambiguity of synthesis of <b>damping</b> <b>systems.</b> The resulting structures and set system parameters {{are not the only ones}} that can be obtained in the case of the assumed frequencies.

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} sharp energy decay rates for nonlinearly <b>damped</b> abstract infinite-dimensional <b>systems.</b> Direct methods for nonlinear stabilization generally rely on multiplier techniques, and thus are valid under restrictive geometric conditions compared to the optimal geometric optics condition of Bardos et al. (1992) [10]. We prove sharp, simple and quasi-optimal energy decay rates through an indirect method, namely an observability estimate for the corresponding undamped system. One of the main advantage of these results is that they allow to combine optimal geometric conditions, as for instance that of Bardos et al. (1992) [10] and the optimal-weight convexity method of the first author (Alabau-Boussouira, 2010 [6], Alabau-Boussouira, 2005 [2]) to deduce very simple and quasi-optimal energy decay rates for nonlinearly locally <b>damped</b> <b>systems.</b> We also show that using arguments based on Russell's principle (Russell, 1978 [24]), one can deduce sharp energy decay rates from the exponential stabilization of the linearly <b>damped</b> <b>system.</b> Our results extend to nonlinearly <b>damped</b> <b>systems,</b> those of Haraux (1989) [14] and Ammari and Tucsnak (2001) [9] which concern linearly <b>damped</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|A general {{review of}} normal mode theory {{as applied to}} the {{vibration}} of linear damped lumped parameter bilateral systems is presented. It is shown that <b>systems</b> possessing classical <b>damping</b> may always be solved by the method developed by Rayleigh. However, for more general type non-classical damping the method proposed by F. A. Foss must be used, The main differences between classical and non-classical normal modes are noted. A non-classically <b>damped</b> <b>system</b> which does not possess a mode type solution is solved by La place Transform techniques. The effect of damping on the natural frequencies of a linear system is discussed.

40|$|Many {{shape memory}} alloy (SMA) {{material}} models have been proposed in the literature, but most are suited only to forward analysis and not to design. This project proposes a generalized friction element, the lambda box, to model the stress-strain curve of SMA during pseudoelasticity. Simulation is carried out to study the dynamic response of such a system under harmonic loading. Three kinds of systems were examined, in order of increasing complexity: the friction <b>damper</b> <b>system,</b> the hysteretic <b>damper</b> <b>system,</b> and the hysteretic lambda <b>damper</b> <b>system,</b> which dynamically {{is equivalent to the}} SMA <b>damper</b> <b>system.</b> Using the simulation results, various asymptotes on the design space are identified, and design methodologies for the three systems are proposed. As the determination of the system parameters is decoupled from the actual damper design, a design methodology to dimension and configure the SMA damper is then proposed, for two kinds of problems, initial design and retrofit design. by Siu Loong Leong.
