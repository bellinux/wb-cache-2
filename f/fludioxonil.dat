5000|$|As {{sclerotia}} are {{a survival}} {{structure in the}} life cycle for the pathogen, {{it is important to}} reduce and eliminate sclerotia in the soil. One effective way to reduce sclerotia is sclerotia germination stimulants. These germination stimulants can reduce sclerotia by 90%. One {{way to do this is}} using diallyl disulfide (DADS). This chemical is what triggers sclerotia to germinate. Upon using DADS in the soil, no Allium crops can be grown in that soil for a year to keep the treatment effective. If there are allium crops growing they will be able to complete their lifecycle and keep sclerotia in the soil. Therefore, DADS is applied artificially in the field with no Allium species, which in turn has sclerotia germinate and unable to find a host and die rather than lay dormant in the soil. This can also be done by applying a garlic extract or the use of certain petroleum-based products. Dipping seed garlic in water at [...] is effective, but higher temperatures may kill the cloves. It is also important to use fungicides with the chemical DADS. There are three fungicides that are registered for white rot. They are: Tebuconazole, <b>Fludioxonil</b> and Boscalid with Tebuconazole being the most effective. [...] All of these fungicides need to be applied right at planting, as later fungicide applications are not effective to control disease. It is also important to note that once an infection is found there are no chemical controls to stop or reduce disease during that season.|$|E
40|$|The {{fungicide}} <b>fludioxonil</b> {{is widely}} used in agriculture. Residua of this fungicide are occasionally detected in fruits and can therefore be ingested by humans. The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans expresses the target of <b>fludioxonil,</b> Nik 1 p, a type III histidine kinase involved in stress response. Inhibition of yeast and hyphae growth was hardly observable after treatment of C. albicans SC 5314 with <b>fludioxonil.</b> As a side effect, however, we observed a concentration-dependent induction of {{the expression of the}} genes CDR 1 and CDR 2, encoding ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. This was independent of the presence of the target of <b>fludioxonil</b> as induction was also observed in a Δnik 1 deletion mutant. Deletion of the CDR 1 gene aggravated the inhibition of germ tube formation by <b>fludioxonil,</b> indicating that, in the wild-type, the fungicide was discharged from the cell by Cdr 1 p. Cdr 1 p is also known as a resistance factor of C. albicans against the commonly used antimycotic fluconazole. Thus, the effect of concurrent exposure to <b>fludioxonil</b> and known cargoes of ABC transporters on their extrusion and the growth of C. albicans was examined. Pre-incubation with <b>fludioxonil</b> decreased the export rate of rhodamine 6 G. The resistance to fluconazole was increased by <b>fludioxonil,</b> independently of Nik 1 p.

40|$|AbstractThe {{fungicide}} <b>fludioxonil</b> is used {{to control}} plant-pathogenic fungi by causing improper activation of the Hog 1 -type MAPK. However, the appearance of <b>fludioxonil</b> resistant mutants, mostly caused by mutations in the group III histidine kinases, poses a serious problem. Moreover, such mutations cause also hyperosmotic sensitivity and the underlying mechanism has been elusive for a long time. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an experimental host, we show that those phenotypes are conferred by a constitutively active form of the group III histidine kinase. Our results explain the different reasons for <b>fludioxonil</b> resistance conferred by its deletion and missense mutation...|$|E
40|$|Fungi rapidly {{adapt to}} their {{environment}} involving signalling pathways, e. g. those {{under the control}} of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The fungicide <b>fludioxonil,</b> one of the most efficient fungicides especially against the grey mould agent, Botrytis cinerea, activates the MAPKs involved in osmoregulation, cell wall integrity, development and pathogenicity in this necrotrophic pathogenic fungus. In order to understand the perception and transduction of the <b>fludioxonil</b> signal and, more globally, the stress signalling pathway, a comparative phosphoproteomic analysis using <b>fludioxonil</b> was performed. In a preliminary study approximately hundred differentially phosphorylated proteins were identified in B. cinerea. Among those the phosducin-like protein protein PhnA. Since phosducins are involved in the G-protein signalling pathway, we wanted to understand the involvement of PhnA in <b>fludioxonil</b> signalling and the link to the MAPKs. We have therefore started its functional analysis by gene knock-out. The phnA deletion mutant did not produce necrosis in planta, and displayed reduced in vitro growth. Moreover it has strongly reduced conidia and sclerotia production. Thus phnA is involved in vegetative growth, in development and is a new pathogenicity factor in B. cinerea. We have identified serine 66 in the PhnA protein to be phosphorylated after exposure to <b>fludioxonil.</b> Through the construction of PhnAS 66 A and PhnAS 66 D mutants we are currently investigating the role of the phosphorylation status in PhnA function. In addition, the transduction of the <b>fludioxonil</b> signal to the MAPKs Sak 1 and Bmp 3 will be analysed. ...|$|E
40|$|Botrytis {{bunch rot}} of grapes is mainly {{controlled}} by applying fungicides at three crop stages: {{the end of}} flowering (BBCH 68), bunch closure (BBCH 77) {{and the beginning of}} veraison (BBCH 81). The phenylpyrroles derivative <b>fludioxonil</b> is among the most effective fungicides registered to control Botrytis cinerea.

Frequencies of B. cinerea strains which were resistant to fungicides were evaluated at harvest. The frequencies of resistant phenotypes were similar in all treatments except for a class of multidrug resistant strains (MDR 1) whose frequency increased after <b>fludioxonil</b> applications. None of the treatments tested induced defence responses in flowers/berries after fungicide application, suggesting that <b>fludioxonil</b> effectiveness was not related to a stimulation of plant defence processes.

In order to trace the transduction of <b>fludioxonil</b> to the MAPK pathways, we have started a phosphoproteomic approach and the functional analysis of key genes. A phosphoproteomic pilot project of the wild-type strain subjected to <b>fludioxonil,</b> lead to the identification of “fludioxonil” candidate signalling proteins such as the phosducin-like protein PhnA. In eukaryotes, phosducin allows the dimerization between the subunits Gβ and Gγ in the G-protein signalling pathway. In the phytopathogenic fungi Cryphonectria parasitica and Fusarium graminearum, phosducin is involved in pigmentation, sporulation, and pathogenicity while in Aspergillus nidulans this protein is involved in growth, development and mycotoxin production. We have initiated the functional analysis of phnA in B. cinerea. Its deletion revealed that phnA is involved in vegetative growth, pathogenicity, and in development. This functional analysis of phnA highlighted it as a new pathogenicity factor in B. cinerea. The role of PhnA-phosphorylation for its activity and the link to <b>fludioxonil,</b> G-protein, and cAMP signalling is under investigation by site-directed mutagenesis of the identified phosphorylation site...|$|E
40|$|Adaptation to {{changing}} environmental conditions takes place rapidly in all living organisms: cells must {{respond to a}} wide variety of signals.

In order to trace the transduction of <b>fludioxonil</b> to the MAPK pathways, we have undertaken a comparative proteomics and phosphoproteomics study of the B. cinerea osmosensing pathway challenged by the fungicide <b>fludioxonil.</b> We compared mutants of the sensor histidine-kinase Bos 1 and of the MAPK Sak 1 to the parental wild-type. Strains were exposed (or not) to <b>fludioxonil</b> for 15 min during exponential in vitro growth. Shotgun proteomics revealed considerable differences in protein content among the strains, but no treatment effect. These results indicate a strong transcriptional and/or translational regulation under Bos 1 and Sak 1 control, respectively, under standard conditions. One of the most relevant result is the abundance of 263 proteins controlled by Bos 1 and Sak 1 independently. Proteins of the oxidative stress response are under negative control of Bos 1, while some proteases are positively regulated. In addition, proteins involved in translation are specifically regulated by Bos 1. It appears that Bos 1 is important in different biological processes. Sak 1, on its turn, controls the abundance of proteins involved in oxidative stress response, early secretome, protein folding, primary metabolism and secondary metabolism.

A characteristic feature of the DtcsC mutant is its resistance to certain fungicides, like <b>fludioxonil.</b> Both hyperosmotic stress and treatment with <b>fludioxonil</b> result in a TcsC-dependent phosphorylation of SakA, the final MAP kinase in the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, confirming a role for TcsC in this signaling pathway.

To {{understand the relationship between}} osmoregulation and fungicide resistance, we cloned the os- 2 gene by using sib selection. os- 2 encodes a putative mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase homologous to HOG 1 and can complement the osmosensitive phenotype of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hog 1 mutant. We sequenced three os- 2 alleles and found that all of them were null with either frameshift or nonsense point mutations. An os- 2 gene replacement mutant also was generated and was sensitive to high osmolarity and resistant to phenylpyrrole fungicides. Conversely, os- 2 mutants transformed with the wild-type os- 2 gene could grow on media containing 4 % NaCl and were sensitive to phenylpyrrole fungicides. <b>Fludioxonil</b> stimulated intracellular glycerol accumulation in wild-type strains but not in os- 2 mutants. <b>Fludioxonil</b> also caused wild-type conidia and hyphal cells to swell and burst. These results suggest that the hyperosmotic stress response pathway of N. crassa is the target of phenylpyrrole fungicides and that fungicidal effects may result from a hyperactive os- 2 MAP kinase pathway...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to select effective fungicides for the control of Fusarium head bight (FHB) of wheat. We tested fourteen commercial fungicides against FHB in the laboratory and under field. <b>Fludioxonil</b> FS, <b>Fludioxonil</b> SC, and Benomyl + Thiram WP highly inhibited the mycelial growth ofFusarium graminearum on the medium while Oxine-copper WP, Thiophanate-methyl WP, and Copperhydroxide WP were not effective against FHB. To verify the disease control in field condition, we selected fourfungicides such as <b>Fludioxonil</b> SC, Captan WP, Difenoconazole + propiconazole EC, and Metconazole SC. Their control efficacy on FHB disease severity of wheat was examined after the fungicide treatment twice(30 th April and 10 th May, 2012) in the two field locations (Iksan and Gimje). With no treatment, FHBseverity was 45 % and 33. 7 % in Gimje and Iksan, respectively. FHB disease incidence after fungicidetreatment was between 0. 3 % and 2. 2 % in Gimje, showing over 95 % FHB disease control. FHB diseaseincidence of fungicide-treated sector in Iksan showed slightly higher than Gimje but the control value offungicides exhibited 87 − 90 %. No side effect of the chemicals was observed in fungicide treatment. Theseresults showed that four fungicides were effective in the FHB disease control in wheat...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>fludioxonil</b> + metalaxyl-M on the mycelial morphology, {{sporulation}} and fumonisin B 1 production by Fusarium verticillioides 103 F was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy {{analysis showed that}} the fungicide caused inhibition of hyphal growth and defects on hyphae morphology such as cell wall disruption, withered hyphae, and excessive septation. In addition, extracellular material around the hyphae was rarely observed {{in the presence of}} <b>fludioxonil</b> + metalaxyl-M. While promoting the reduction of mycelial growth, the fungicide increased sporulation of F. verticillioides compared to the control, and the highest production occurred on the 14 th day in the treatments and on the 10 th day in the control cultures. Fumonisin B 1 production in the culture media containing the fungicide (treatment) was detected from the 7 th day incubation, whereas in cultures without fungicide (control) it was detected on the 10 th day. The highest fumonisin B 1 production occurred on the 14 th day, both for the control and for the treatment. <b>Fludioxonil</b> + metalaxyl - M can interfere in F. verticillioides mycelial morphology and sporulation and increase fumonisin B 1 levels. These data indicate the importance of understanding the effects of fungicide to minimize the occurrence of toxigenic fungi and fumonisins...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} of this work was to estimate the disappearance parameters of azoxystrobin, cyprodinil and <b>fludioxonil</b> initial deposits, active ingredients of Amistar 250 SC, and Switch 62, 5 WG, at present, commonly used {{for the protection of}} fruits and veg-etables against diseases of fungal origin. The tests were carried out on tomato plants grown in commercial greenhouses sprayed with homogenous 0. 1 % aqueous solution of these plant protection products. It was found that on tomato leaves azoxystrobin, cyprodinil, and <b>fludioxonil</b> residues dropped by half on average within 13, 9, and 31 days after treatments, respectively.

40|$|Botrytis cinerea is a necrotrophic {{pathogen}} {{causing a}} major problem in the export and post-harvest of strawberries. Inappropriate use of fungicides leads to resistance among fungal pathogens. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the sensitivity of B. cinerea to various classes of fungicide and to determine the effectiveness of different concentrations of commonly used fungicides. We thus evaluated the effectiveness of six classes of fungicide in inhibiting the growth and development of this pathogen, namely, <b>fludioxonil,</b> iprodione, pyrimethanil, tebuconazole, fenpyrazamine, and boscalid. <b>Fludioxonil</b> was the most effective (EC₅₀ < 0. 1 μg/ml), and pyrimethanil was the least effective (EC₅₀ = 50 μg/ml), at inhibiting the mycelial growth of B. cinerea. Fenpyrazamine and pyrimethanil showed relatively low effectiveness in inhibiting the germination and conidial production of B. cinerea. Our results are useful for the management of B. cinerea and as a basis for monitoring the sensitivity of B. cinerea strains to fungicides...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{compensatory}} evolution in a <b>fludioxonil</b> resistant mutant of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. In an evolution experiment lasting for 27 weeks (about 3000 cell cycles) 35 parallel strains of this mutant evolved {{in three different}} environmental conditions. Our results show a severe cost of resistance (56 %) {{in the absence of}} <b>fludioxonil</b> and in all conditions the mutant strain was able to restore fitness without loss of the resistance. In several cases, the evolved strain reached a higher fitness than the original sensitive ancestor. Fitness compensation occurred in one, two or three discrete steps. Genetic analysis of crosses between different evolved strains and between evolved and ancestral strains revealed interaction between compensatory mutations and provided information on the number of loci involved in fitness compensation. In addition, we discuss the opportunities for the experimental study of evolutionary processes provided by the filamentous fungus A. nidulan...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{comprises}} a first {{functional analysis}} of an YPD 1 -homologue in filamentous phytopathogenic fungi {{and its role}} in the HOG signalling pathway. We generated a gene deletion mutant of the gene MoYPD 1 in Magnaporthe oryzae and characterized the resulting mutant strain. We have shown that MoYpd 1 p is a component of the phosphorelay system acting in the HOG pathway due to its Y 2 H protein interaction with the HKs MoHik 1 p and MoSln 1 p {{as well as with the}} response regulator MoSsk 1 p. Fungicidal activity of <b>fludioxonil</b> was reported to be based on the inhibition of MoHik 1 p resulting in hyperactivation of the HOG signalling pathway and lethality. Western analysis proved that both, osmotic stress and <b>fludioxonil</b> application resulted in the phosphorylation of the MoHog 1 p in a MoYpd 1 p-dependent manner. We therefore consider MoYpd 1 p to be essential for the regulation capability of the HOG pathway and the fungicide action of <b>fludioxonil,</b> but dispensible for viability. The results indicate that MoYpd 1 p functions as signal transfer protein between MoSln 1 p, MoHik 1 p, and MoSsk 1 p. Manipulations of the HOG signalling pathway affects the infection-related morphogenesis in M.  oryzae, since the mutant strain ΔMoypd 1 has a white and fluffy phenotype on complete media, is not able to form spores in various conditions and fails to colonize rice plants...|$|E
40|$|Black {{foot disease}} of grapevine {{is caused by}} Cylindrocarpon spp., with C. destructans being the main {{pathogen}} isolated from vine cuttings and young vineyards in Portugal. Few recommendations for black foot disease control are presently available, {{and they are not}} easy to implement within commercial nurseries. In this study, 14 fungicides were evaluated for their effect on the mycelial growth and conidium germination of four field isolates of C. destructans. Mycelial growth of the pathogen was inhibited by DMI fungicides, prochloraz (EC 50 values < 0. 09 mg l- 1) {{and to a lesser extent}} by difenoconazole (EC 50 values < 2. 25 mg l- 1), by the benzimidazole fungicide benomyl (EC 50 values < 0. 35 mg l- 1), and by the mixtures cyprodinil + <b>fludioxonil</b> and carbendazim + flusilazole, which gave EC 50 values < 0. 75 mg l- 1. Among these, only cyprodinil + <b>fludioxonil</b> (EC 50 values < 0. 15 mg l- 1), the strobilurin fungicides, azoxystrobin and trifloxystrobin (EC 50 values < 2. 27 mg l- 1) and the phenylsulphamide fungicide tolylfluanid (EC 50 < 0. 54 mg l- 1) were effective in reducing conidium germination. Results from in vivo studies, carried out on potted grapevine plants (cultivar Castelão) showed that benomyl, tebuconazole and the mixtures carbendazim + flusilazole and cyprodinil + <b>fludioxonil</b> significantly (α= 0. 05) improved plant growth (plant height and number of roots) and decreased disease incidence compared with non-treated plants...|$|E
