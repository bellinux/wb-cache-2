2500|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, Brig. Gen. William H. French's division of the II Corps prepared to move forward, subjected to Confederate artillery fire that was descending on the fog-covered city of Fredericksburg. General Burnside's orders to Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner, commander of the Right Grand Division, was to send [...] "a division or more" [...] to seize the high ground {{to the west of the}} city, assuming that his assault on the southern end of the Confederate line would be the decisive action of the battle. The avenue of approach was difficult—mostly open fields, but interrupted by scattered houses, fences, and gardens that would restrict the movement of battle lines. A canal stood about 200 yards west of the town, crossed by three narrow bridges, which would require the Union troops to funnel themselves into columns before proceeding. About 600 yards to the west of Fredericksburg was the low ridge known as Marye's Heights, rising 40–50 feet above the plain. (Although popularly known as Marye's Heights, the ridge was composed of several hills separated by ravines, from north to south: Taylor's Hill, Stansbury Hill, Marye's Hill, and Willis Hill.) Near the crest of the portion of the ridge comprising Marye's Hill and Willis Hill, a narrow lane in a slight cut—the Telegraph Road, known after the battle as the Sunken Road—was protected by a 4-foot stone wall, enhanced in places with log breastworks and abatis, making it a perfect infantry defensive position. Confederate Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws initially had about 2,000 men on the front line of Marye's Heights and there were an additional 7,000 men in reserve on the crest and behind the ridge. Massed artillery provided almost uninterrupted coverage of the plain below. General Longstreet had been assured by his artillery commander, Lt. Col. Edward Porter Alexander, [...] "General, we cover that ground now so well that we will comb it as with a <b>fine-tooth</b> comb. A chicken could not live on that field when we open on it." ...|$|E

60|$|Smoke had {{travelled}} in {{a leisurely}} fashion up to Mono Creek, fearing to tire his dogs {{before the big}} race. Also, he had familiarized himself with every mile of the trail and located his relay camps.

Von Schroeder, who had gone in purely for the sport, had no less than eleven dog-teams--a fresh one for every ten miles. Arizona Bill {{had been forced to}} content himself with eight teams. Big Olaf had seven, which was the complement of Smoke. In addition, over two score of other men were in the running. Not every day, even in the golden north, was a million dollars the prize for a dog race. The country had been swept of dogs.

50|$|On 6 June 2000, a sea-shell harvester's boat cast its nets {{along the}} bed of Saint-Brieuc Bay, {{off the coast of}} Erquy.

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A <b>fine-tooth</b> tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|E

40|$|Acoustic {{noise and}} {{associated}} vibration are potentially troubling characteristics of electric machines including variable-reluctance motors, induction machines, and permanent magnet synchronous motors. The severity {{of this problem}} depends on the types of motors and their applications. One exemplary case where the vibro-acoustic noise becomes especially detrimental is iron-core linear motors operating at high acceleration and targeted for high accuracy applications. In this doctoral research, we identify root causes of the vibro-acoustic noise of iron-core linear motors, and create magnetic designs paired with control algorithms to achieve high-acceleration with low noise and vibration. Vibro-acoustic noise issues of rotary machines have been researched over the years, {{but not as much}} work has been done for linear machines whose major causes of noise generation might be different from rotary motors due to the structural differences. This thesis focuses on the following aspects: 1) Investigate the causes and develop and verify theory for acoustic noise emitted from linear iron-core machines. 2) Design, construct, and test a new linear iron-core motor that can simultaneously provide high force and low noise. 3) Design and construct an experimental linear motor testbed to investigate the noise issue of conventional iron-core motors, and to demonstrate the new motor's desired performance of high force and low noise. We hypothesize and experimentally validate that the acoustic noise and associated vibration of linear iron-core permanent magnet motors are caused by high frequency force harmonics vibrating the moving stage. Such stage vibration can be transmitted through the system structure and can also radiate as acoustic noise, thereby disturbing precision machines. In order to reduce high frequency force harmonic content, our new motor has fine teeth, narrow slots with high slot aspect ratio, five phases, and a moving Halbach magnet array. With our new <b>fine-tooth</b> motor, we significantly reduce the vibro-acoustic noise of linear iron-core motors while substantially enhancing the shear stress density, compared to conventional 3 - 4 combination iron-core motors. The overall acoustic noise level in Pascals is reduced by 93 % during the acceleration period with non-skewed magnets. In terms of the sound pressure level (SPL), this is a significant noise reduction from 83 dB to 60 dB. The cogging-driven and velocity dependent noise, which is dominant in constant velocity regions, is also significantly reduced in our new motor design. Our <b>fine-tooth</b> motor design reduces the cogging force by a factor of 10 -to- 1 when using skewed magnets, thereby reducing cogging driven acoustic noise by 90 % in Pascals. We also present in this thesis the force performance of our new <b>fine-tooth</b> motor both in simulations and experiments. Our new motor shows predicted shear stress improvements of 28 % (from 0. 090 N/mm 2 to 0. 115 N/mm 2) at the prototype practical power level of 10 W/mm and 84 % (from 0. 167 N/mm 2 to 0. 308 N/mm 2) at an anticipated ultimate RMS (root mean square) current density limit in the coil wires of 50 A/mm 2, relative to a conventional motor. Understanding causes of the vibro-acoustic noise and how to mitigate it in both the design and post-design phases provides useful tools to achieve high-performance and quiet linear motion devices. This research will benefit many industrial applications which require both high throughput and high accuracy. by Jun Young Yoon. Thesis: Ph.
