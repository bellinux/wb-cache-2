This preparation was used here to investigate {{the first stage of}} cortical processing in the large postsynaptic <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks</b> as revealed by voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSDI). We identified the precise location and dimensions of two clearly distinguishable <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks,</b> one in the granular layer (GL) IV and one in the infragranular layer (IGL) V and VI and showed that they have different physiological properties. DiI fluorescent staining further revealed that thalamocortical axons project on to these two networks in the typical barrel like form, not only in the granular but also in the IGL. Finally we investigated the short-term dynamics of both the VSDI signal and the local field potential (LFP) in response to a train of eight-pulses at various frequencies in both these layers. We found evidence of differences in the plasticity between the first two response peaks compared to the remaining six peaks as well as differences in short-term plasticity between the VSDI response and the LFP. Our findings suggest, that at least early cortical processing takes place in two separate <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks</b> that may stand at the beginning of further parallel computation. The detailed characterization of the parameters of these networks may provide tools for further research into the complex dynamics of large <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks</b> and their role in cortical computation...|$|R

50|$|Kinematic wave routing allows {{flow and}} area to vary both {{spatially}} and temporally within a conduit. This {{can result in}} attenuated and delayed outflow hydrographs as inflow is routed through the channel. However this form of routing cannot account for backwater effects, entrance/exit losses, flow reversal, or pressurized flow, and is also restricted to <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> layouts. It can usually maintain numerical stability with moderately large time steps, {{on the order of}} 1 to 5 minutes. If the aforementioned effects are not expected to be significant then this alternative can be an accurate and efficient routing method, especially for long-term simulations.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, the <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> is {{extremely}} complex, {{able to receive}} 100,000 to 200,000 inputs in a single tree, due to {{the large amount of}} branching and the many dendritic spines protruding from the branches. Furthermore, synaptic hyperpolarization and depolarization remains somewhat isolated due to the resistance from the narrow dendritic spine stalk, allowing a polarization to spread without much interruption to the other spines. This spread is further aided intracellularly by the microtubules and extracellularly by glial cells. These polarizations act as waves in the synaptodendritic network, and the existence of multiple waves at once gives rise to interference patterns.|$|E
50|$|The holonomic brain theory, {{developed}} by neuroscientist Karl Pribram initially {{in collaboration with}} physicist David Bohm, {{is a model of}} human cognition that describes the brain as a holographic storage network. Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses. These oscillations are waves and create wave interference patterns in which memory is encoded naturally, and the waves may be analyzed by a Fourier transform. Gabor, Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram, which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform. In a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information. In this theory, a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> contains all the information stored over the entire network. This model allows for important aspects of human consciousness, including the fast associative memory that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the non-locality of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a specific location, i.e. a certain neuron).|$|E

30|$|Our {{systematic}} {{investigation of}} the gas flow conditions confirms that the very dilute precursor concentration {{is essential for the}} 2 D growth of SiNSs. Such a crystal growth condition is classified as a diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) environment, wherein the rate of crystal growth is dominated by the diffusion rate of the reactants [18]. The main feature of DLA environments is strong anisotropic, dendritic growth due to the low concentration of precursors [19]. Accordingly, cubic-structured Si in this study grew dendritically in [110] direction at the early stages and leads to two-dimensional growth of <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks</b> that is essential for the growth of SiNSs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Although <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks</b> within {{ecosystems}} {{have typically}} {{been considered a}} special case of network topology, they have attracted {{a great deal of}} attention in recent years. These systems exhibit unique features in that both the nodes and branches provide distinct habitats. Within a river discontinuum context, river confluences, which are nodes of <b>dendritic</b> river <b>networks,</b> are hypothesised to have particular hydrodynamic traits that create heterogeneous habitats through a unique disturbance regime, although this hypothesis has not yet been tested. We tested this hypothesis using a vegetation data set collected from 14 river basin systems in Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. We compared vegetation-patch diversity between confluence and single-flow areas using hierarchical Bayesian models. Our results demonstrated greater vegetation-patch diversity in confluence areas compared to single-flow areas. Our findings support the hypothesis that confluences result in highly heterogeneous habitats. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical report to demonstrate that river confluences have high vegetation-patch diversity. We conclude that network nodes play an important role in maintaining the biodiversity of river networks...|$|R

In situ, however, the environment for fibroblasts is the three-dimensional extracellular matrix. In the current research, we studied the morphology and motility of human fibroblasts embedded in floating collagen matrices at a cell density below that required for global matrix remodeling (i. e., contraction). Under these conditions, cells were observed to project and retract a <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> of extensions. These extensions contained microtubule cores with actin concentrated at the tips resembling growth cones. Platelet-derived growth factor promoted formation of the network; lysophosphatidic acid stimulated its retraction in a Rho and Rho kinase-dependent manner. The <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> also supported metabolic coupling between cells. We suggest that the <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> provides a mechanism by which fibroblasts explore and become interconnected to each other in three-dimensional space...|$|E

Under the assumption that stresses are developed in the network {{as a result of}} the friction resisting shrinkage-induced interdendritic fluid flow, the model predicts the stresses in the solid. The calculations reflect the expected effects of postponed dendrite coherency, slower solidification conditions, and variations of eutectic volume fraction and shrinkage. Comparing the calculated stresses to the measured shear strength of equiaxed mushy zones shows that it is possible for the stresses to exceed the strength, thereby resulting in reorientation or collapse of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>network...</b>|$|E

40|$|Follicular <b>dendritic</b> cell <b>networks</b> {{are said}} to be pivotal to both the {{formation}} of germinal centers (GCs) and their functions in generating antigen-specific antibody affinity maturation and B cell memory. We report that lymphotoxin �–deficient mice form GC cell clusters in the gross anatomical location expected of GCs, despite the complete absence of follicular <b>dendritic</b> cell <b>networks.</b> Furthermore, antigen-specific GC generation was at first relatively normal, but these GCs then rapidly regressed and GC-phase antibody affinity maturation was reduced. Lymphotoxin �–deficient mice also showed substantial B cell memory in their mesenteric lymph nodes. This memory antibody response was of relatively low affinity for antigen at week 4 after challenge, but by week 10 after challenge was comparable to wild-type, indicating that affinity maturation had failed in the GC phase but developed later.

40|$|Afilopodium {{protrudes}} by elongation of bundled actin filaments in its core. However, {{the mechanism}} of filopodia initiation remains unknown. Using live-cell imaging with GFP-tagged proteins and correlative electron microscopy, we performed a kinetic-structural analysis of filopodial initiation in B 16 F 1 melanoma cells. Filopodial bundles arose not by a specific nucleation event, but by reorganization of the lamellipodial <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> analogous to fusion of established filopodia but occurring {{at the level of}} individual filaments. Subsets of independently nucleated lamellipodial filaments elongated and gradually associated with each other at their barbed ends, leading to formation of cone-shaped structures that we term Λ-precursors. An early marker of initiation was the gradual coalescence of GFP-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (GFP-VASP) fluorescence at the leading edge into discrete foci. The GFP-VASP foci were associated with Λ-precursors, whereas Arp 2 / 3 was not. Subsequent recruitment of fascin to the clustered barbed ends of Λ-precursors initiated filament bundling and completed formation of the nascent filopodium. We propose a convergent elongation model of filopodia initiation, stipulating that filaments within the lamellipodial <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> acquire privileged status by binding a set of molecules (including VASP) to their barbed ends, which protect them from capping and mediate association of barbed ends with each other...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic and hydrologic {{analysis}} in urban catchments is typically {{accompanied by a}} number of uncertainties, such as a lack of required information for modeling purposes or complex loops inside a drainage network. In this article, Gibbs’ stochastic network model is utilized in order to achieve a <b>dendritic</b> <b>network</b> that corresponds to a fully looped network in terms of the peak of the runoff hydrograph at the outlet. A synthetic catchment with a drainage network composed of 8 × 8 grids is introduced to investigate the behavior of a fully looped network for a given rainfall event using the Storm Water Management Model. Dendritic networks are generated from the Gibbsian model for a given value of the parameter, β. The results showed that the shape of the hydrograph and the peak flow of a fully looped network are heavily dependent on the catchment slope. Moreover, the results showed {{that it is possible to}} find the corresponding dendritic networks generated by the Gibbsian model that match the fully looped network depending on the catchment slope in terms of peak flows.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to 3 D delineation of <b>dendritic</b> <b>networks</b> in noisy image stacks. We achieve a level of automation beyond that of stateof-the-art systems, which model dendrites as continuous tubular structures and postulate simple appearance models. Instead, we learn models from the data itself, which make them better suited to handle noise and deviations from expected appearance. From very little expert-labeled ground truth, we train both a classifier to recognize individual dendrite voxels and a density model to classify segments connecting pairs of points as dendrite-like or not. Given these models, we can then trace the dendritic trees of neurons automatically by enforcing the tree structure of the resulting graph. We will show that our approach performs better than traditional techniques on brighfield image stacks. ...|$|R
