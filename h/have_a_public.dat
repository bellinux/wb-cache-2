5|$|Federico Altieri began {{seeking to}} secure {{election}} to the papacy for himself. He had sought to both <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> persona favourable to Leopold I, while also working to curry the favour of Louis XIV. The zelanti faction and Flavio Chigi opposed him, which was enough to stop his victory.|$|E
5|$|RSTs {{may also}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> health benefit. In {{addition}} to undesirable side-effects in the individual, inappropriate antibiotic use {{is thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} drug-resistant strains of bacteria. By helping to identify bacterial infection, RSTs may help to limit the use of antibiotics in viral illnesses, where they are not beneficial.|$|E
5|$|At 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith {{ordered the}} ship's {{lifeboats}} uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship {{on the west}} side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about 13.5 nautical miles (15.5mi / 25km). Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000items of mail being carried aboard Titanic. Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew– Titanic did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> address system– and told them to go to the Boat Deck.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time the Playhouse was built, Coonley agreed to build a {{kindergarten}} in the nearby town of Downers Grove, which did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> school. Coonley purchased land on Grove Street and commissioned the architectural firm of Perkins, Fellows & Hamilton to design the building. The school, led by Lucia Morse, was launched as the Kindergarten Extension Association School in 1912. In 1916, the Cottage School was closed and a first grade program was launched at the Downers Grove kindergarten, which was renamed the Junior Elementary School. To accommodate older students, a second grade class was added in 1920 for students around seven years old, a third grade in 1926 for eight-year-olds, and a fourth grade for nine-year-old students shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Nailsea {{also has}} a ladies hockey club, which was formed in 1924. The club has two league teams: a youth team and a {{veterans}} team. The Scotch Horn Centre provides both an aerobic exercise and a free weights gym, as well as squash courts, and room for other indoor sports. Nailsea does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> swimming pool despite a long-running campaign by the Nailsea Swimming Pool Interest Group to build one. Other leisure facilities in the area include a swimming pool in nearby Backwell and a golf club in Tickenham.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out. Over the next few weeks, Vince {{made it clear that he}} favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E

5|$|Arha and Kossil <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> {{falling out}} in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them off until they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> system of power distribution.|$|E

They are not engaged in the chanceries, in order {{that they may be}} within easy reach of private individuals; they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.|$|E
25|$|Davitt died in Elpis Hospital, Dublin on 30 May 1906, aged 60, from blood poisoning. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland {{attended}} the funeral, a public {{indication of the}} dramatic political journey this former Fenian prisoner had taken. The plan had been not to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> funeral, and hence Davitt's body was brought quietly to the Carmelite Friary in Clarendon Street, Dublin. However, the next day over 20,000 people filed past his coffin. His remains were then taken by train to Foxford, County Mayo, and buried in the grounds of Straide Abbey at Straide (near Foxford), near where he was born.|$|E
25|$|Conflict between {{recreational}} users : Some {{forms of}} use of national parks interfere with other uses. For example, use of high-speed boats causes noise pollution, and conflicts with other uses such as boat trips, yachting, canoeing, and swimming. A controversial bylaw imposing a 10knot speed limit came into force on Windermere on 29 March 2005. The new speed limit for Windermere effectively prohibits speedboats and water skiing in the Lake District (of the 16 larger lakes in the Lake District, only Windermere, Coniston Water, Derwent Water and Ullswater <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>public</b> right of navigation; speed limits were imposed on the three lakes other than Windermere in the 1970s and 1980s).|$|E
