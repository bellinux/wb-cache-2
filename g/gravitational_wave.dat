5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} string axion dark matter with <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> in Chern–Simons gravity. We {{show that the}} {{parametric}} resonance of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> occurs due to the axion coherent oscillation. Remarkably, the circular polarization of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> is induced by the parity violating Chern–Simons coupling. In fact, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> should be enhanced ten times every 10 − 8 pc propagation {{in the presence of}} the axion dark matter with mass 10 − 10 eV provided the coupling constant ℓ = 10 8 km. Hence, after 10 kpc propagation, the amplitude of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> is enhanced significantly and the polarization of <b>gravitational</b> <b>waves</b> becomes circular. However, we have never observed these signatures. This implies that the Chern–Simons coupling constant and/or the abundance of string axions should be constrained much stronger than the current limits...|$|R

5|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) uses two 4-km Michelson-Fabry-Pérot interferometers for the {{detection}} of gravitational waves. In this application, the Fabry–Pérot cavity is used to store photons for almost a millisecond while they bounce up and down between the mirrors. This increases the time a <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> can interact with the light, which results in a better sensitivity at low frequencies. Smaller cavities, usually called mode cleaners, are used for spatial filtering and frequency stabilization of the main laser. The first observation of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Observations of binary pulsars provide strong {{indirect}} {{evidence for the}} existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above). Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research. Several land-based <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO. Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 Hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes. A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|When German science {{institutions}} reorganized after German reunification in 1990, Ehlers {{lobbied for}} the establishment of an institute of the Max Planck Society dedicated to research on gravitational theory. On 9 June 1994, the Society decided to open the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam. The institute started operations on 1 April 1995, with Ehlers as its founding director and as the leader of its department for the foundations and mathematics of general relativity. Ehlers then oversaw the founding of a second institute department devoted to <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> research and headed by Bernard F. Schutz.

25|$|The {{oscillations}} {{depicted in}} the animation are exaggerated {{for the purpose of}} discussion — in reality a <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> has a very small amplitude (as formulated in linearized gravity). However, they help illustrate the kind of oscillations associated with gravitational waves as produced, for example, by a pair of masses in a circular orbit. In this case the amplitude of the <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> is constant, but its plane of polarization changes or rotates at twice the orbital rate and so the time-varying <b>gravitational</b> <b>wave</b> size (or 'periodic spacetime strain') exhibits a variation as shown in the animation. If the orbit of the masses is elliptical then the gravitational wave's amplitude also varies with time according to Einstein's quadrupole formula.|$|E

25|$|A simple device theorised {{to detect}} the {{expected}} wave motion is called a Weber bar — a large, solid bar of metal isolated from outside vibrations.

Weber bars are not sensitive enough to detect anything but extremely powerful gravitational waves.|$|E
