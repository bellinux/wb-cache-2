50|$|The Bolson {{tortoise}} (Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus),</b> {{also called}} the Mexican giant tortoise or yellow-margined tortoise, is a species of tortoise from North America. Of the six North American tortoise species, it is the largest, having a carapace length of about 46 cm. It lives in a region of the Chihuahuan Desert known as the Bolsón de Mapimí, which is located in north-central Mexico.|$|E
50|$|Biologically rich, it {{includes}} 403 plant species. Noteworthy are the 39 cactus species and 200 species of birds, 5 species of amphibians, 36 species of reptiles and 28 species of mammals. Endemic species identified are nine for the Cactaceae family, {{one for the}} Cochlospermaceae family {{and one for the}} Fouqueriaceae family. Particularly charismatic are the Bolson tortoise (Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus),</b> the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), the Mexican fringe-toed lizard (Uma paraphigas), the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the American badger (Taxidea taxus), the puma (Puma concolor); and birds such as the golden eagle (Aquila crhysaetos).|$|E
50|$|The Turtle Conservancy {{is working}} to {{purchase}} {{a significant portion of}} the last remaining habitat of the Bolson Tortoise (Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus).</b> The largest of the North American terrestrial reptiles, this tortoise has been known to science only since 1959. The Bolson Tortoise inhabits a small area of Bolsón de Mapimí in the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. The Mapimí Biosphere Reserve was created to protect this species, but much of this land is used for agricultural development and cattle grazing, which is threatening the tortoise’s habitat. The acquisition of this land in north central Mexico will protect the tortoise along with all other native flora and fauna including an estimated 28 mammals, over 200 bird species, 5 amphibians, and 39 reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Nabis <b>flavomarginatus</b> is {{a species}} of damsel bug in the family Nabidae.This species has a Holarctic {{distribution}}.

In the Nearctic ecozone, it is common in Alaska, Canada and Greenland. In 1989 it was found {{for the first time in}} the continental body of the United States (Maine). In Greenland, it is the only species in the family Nabidae conspicuously on the former settlement area of the Vikings (their introduction through this in the early Middle Ages is speculated about).In Western and Central Europe N. flavomaculatus is boreomontane.It rises in the Alps to 2200 meters above sea level.|$|E
50|$|Turtle Conservancy began a {{collaborative}} effort - along with assistance from the Andrew Sabin Family foundation, Josiah T. Austin, and the Desert Tortoise Council - of acquiring 43,000 acres {{of land in the}} state of Durango, Mexico. Located in the Chihuahuan Desert, this land is noted for being prime habitat of Bolson Tortoise (Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus),</b> as well as other species of plants and animals essential to maintaining the biodiversity of the area. The goal of this project is to preserve the largest intact population of Bolson Tortoise remaining, and would be functioning as a long-term re-introduction plan with the Turner Endangered Species Fund. Founder Eric Goode traveled to Madagascar to meet with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) to discuss the status of the Critically Endangered Ploughshare Tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora). The following year, the IUCN held a Red List workshop in Madagascar to reclassify the endemic IUCN listed species, at which the Turtle Conservancy attended and assisted in drafting an Action Plan for Radiated Tortoise (Astrochelys radiata), Flat-tailed Tortoise (Pyxis planicauda), Madagascar Big-headed Turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), and the Critically Endangered Ploughshare Tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora).|$|E
40|$|The Bolson {{tortoise}} (Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus)</b> is {{the first}} species of extirpated megafauna to be repatriated into the United States. In September 2006, 30 individuals were translocated from Arizona to New Mexico with the long-term objective of restoring wild populations via captive propagation. We evaluated mtDNA sequences and allelic diversity among 11 microsatellite loci from the captive population and archived samples collected from wild individuals in Durango, Mexico (n = 28). Both populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and the captive population captured roughly 97. 5 % of the total wild diversity, making it a promising founder population. Genetic screening of other captive animals (n = 26) potentially suitable for reintroduction uncovered multiple hybrid G. <b>flavomarginatus</b> 6 G. polyphemus, which were ineligible for repatriation; only three of these individuals were verified as purebred G. <b>flavomarginatus.</b> We used these genetic data to inform mate pairing, reduce the potential for inbreeding and to monitor the maintenance of genetic diversity in the captive population. After six years of successful propagation, we analyzed the parentage of 241 hatchlings to assess the maintenance of genetic diversity. Not all adults contributed equally to successive generations. Most yearly cohorts of hatchlings failed to capture {{the diversity of the}} parental population. However, overlapping generations of tortoises helped to alleviate genetic loss because the entire six-year cohort of hatchlings contained the allelic diversity of the parental population. Polyandry and sperm storage occurred in the captives and future management strategies must consider suc...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Based on {{the types}} of Edessa rufomarginata (De Geer, 1773) and its synonyms, on {{morphology}} of the paramere and coloration, seven patterns are described for E. rufomarginata.

40|$|The Bolson tortoise, Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus,</b> occurs {{within a}} {{restricted}} geographical {{area in the}} Mexican Chihuahuan Desert. We analyzed the variation in surface microhabitat with relation to the burrow occupancy for this tortoise at the Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. In summer 2010, we monitored burrow activity (active, inactive, or abandoned) and measured environmental factors that might influence the burrow’s occupancy by tortoises (air temperature, relative humidity and substrate temperature, {{both inside and outside}} the burrow, and the plant cover around it). Discriminant analysis was used to identify the importance of these variables influencing burrow occupancy. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to quantify the relation between environmental factors in the sampled burrows. Results. Sixty-one burrows were identified at the Tortugas locality. The first function’s auto-value analysis indicates that this function explains 97. 9 % of the variation in burrow activity status; high occupancy scores were associated with low substrate temperature inside the burrow. Plant cover was inversely proportional to substrate temperature inside the burrow. These results suggest the importance the density of plants surrounding the tortoise’s burrow as a key factor influencing the burrow microclimate and occupancy by the tortoises. Conclusions. Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus</b> inhabits burrows, in part, based on microhabitat structure, with plant cover being a main factor influencing burrow occupancy. Our findings indicate that human land use and vegetation management are important for conserving Bolson tortoises, and for understanding habitat conditions necessary for the successful establishment of populations elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|A {{widespread}} biogeographic {{pattern in}} nature is that population abundance is not uniform across the geographic range of species: most occurrence sites have relatively low numbers, whereas {{a few places}} contain orders of magnitude more individuals. The Bolson tortoise Gopherus <b>flavomarginatus</b> is endemic to a small region of the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico, where habitat deterioration threatens this species with extinction. In this study we combined field burrows counts and the approach for modeling species abundance based on calculating {{the distance to the}} niche centroid to obtain range-wide abundance estimates. For the Bolson tortoise, we found a robust, negative relationship between observed burrows abundance and distance to the niche centroid, with a predictive capacity of 71 %. Based on these results we identified four priority areas for the conservation of this microendemic and threatened tortoise. We conclude that this approach may be a useful approximation for identifying key areas for sampling and conservation efforts in elusive and rare species...|$|E
40|$|The {{decrease}} of the habitat {{is one of}} the main factors that affect the survival of G. <b>flavomarginatus.</b> This study assesses the halophytic grasslands loss over a period of 30 years in the distribution area of the Bolson tortoise and the effects of climate change on the habitat suitability of these grasslands and its possible impact on this tortoise. Grassland loss was assessed by an analysis of symmetric differences and the habitat suitability model was carried out by the method of overlapping layers raster. Our results showed a grassland loss of 63. 7 %; however, our current habitat suitability model points out that much of the grassland loss has occurred where the environmental conditions are suitable. These results suggest that anthropic activity is a main factor in the habitat disturbance in the study area. Likewise, the models for years 2050 and 2070 under the criteria RCP 2. 6, RCP 4. 5, RCP 6. 0, suggest that anthropic activity will continue be the main cause of the grassland loss. Therefore, considering the association between the Bolson tortoise and grassland halophyte Hilaria mutica, which comprises around 60 % of its diet, the viability of the Bolson tortoise depends largely on strategies aimed at protecting the soil that allow the presence of this grassland...|$|E
