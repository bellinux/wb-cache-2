50|$|Processive antitermination {{was first}} {{discovered}} in a bacteriophage, but examples have since been found in bacterial operons. The E. coli rrn operons are regulated by an antitermination mechanism that is dependent on sites that {{are closely related to}} lambda boxA and located promoter proximal to the 16S and 23S structural genes in each operon. The sequences of the rrn BOXA sites are more similar to the bacteriophage consensus than is that of lambda, and they bind NusB-S10 more efficiently. Although stem-loop structures analogous to BOXB are found promoter proximal to the BOXA sites, they are not essential for antitermination. An rrn BOXA sequence confers full antitermination activity against Rho-dependent but not against intrinsic terminators. BOXA also increases the rate of transcription elongation by RNAP. Point mutations in BOXA induce premature transcription termination. rrn antitermination requires NusB in vivo, as shown by a NusB <b>depletion</b> <b>experiment.</b> NusA stimulates the elongation rate of rrn RNA chains carrying BOXA. A role for NusA is further suggested by the observation that the nusA10 (Cs) mutation inhibits both antitermination and the rate of transcription elongation in an rrn operon. The role of other Nus factors in rrn regulation in vivo is not clear. In vitro, an antitermination complex that includes NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG forms at the BOXA sequence of rrnG, but these components are not sufficient for antitermination by themselves. An additional factor or factors that can be supplied by a cellular extract are required, but their identities are unknown.|$|E

One {{of the most}} debated models explaining why self-control breaks down is the Strength Model, according to which self-control depends on a limited resource. Either previous acts of self-control or taking part in highly demanding cognitive tasks {{have been shown to}} reduce self-control, possibly due to a reduction in blood glucose levels. However, several studies yielded negative ?ndings, and recent meta-analyses questioned the robustness of the depletion effect in humans. We investigated, for the ?rst time, whether the Strength Model applies to a non-human primate species, the tufted capuchin monkey. We tested ?ve capuchins in a self-control task (the Accumulation task) in which food items were accumulated within individual 2 ̆ 7 s reach {{for as long as the}} subject refrained from taking them. We evaluated whether capuchins 2 ̆ 7 performance decreases: (i) when tested before receiving their daily meal rather than after consuming it (Energy <b>Depletion</b> <b>Experiment),</b> and (ii) after being tested in two tasks with different levels of cognitive complexity (Cognitive <b>Depletion</b> <b>Experiment).</b> We also tested, in both experiments, how implementing self-control in each trial of the Accumulation task affected this capacity within each session and/or across consecutive sessions. Repeated acts of self- control in each trial of the Accumulation task progressively reduced this capacity within each session, as predicted by the Strength Model. However, neither experiencing a reduction in energy level nor taking part in a highly demanding cognitive task decreased performance in the subsequent Accumulation task. Thus, whereas capuchins seem to be vulnerable to within-session depletion effects, to other extents our ?ndings are in line with the growing body of studies that failed to ?nd a depletion effect in humans. Methodological issues potentially affecting the lack of depletion effects in capuchins are discussed...|$|E

Here, we described the two human orthologues, previously named EFO 1 /ESCO 1 and EFO 2 /ESCO 2.

Based on this basic identity, four commonly used models in fishery stock assessment are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The estimated results from these four models, the negative binomial model (also called patch model), the Poisson distribution model, the Gaussian distribution model and the lognormal distribution model, are very robust, yielding virtually the same conclusion regarding the density and dredge efficiency.

METHODS: Abdominal injection of CCl 4 was adopted to duplicate a mouse acute liver injury model. Global {{gene expression analysis}} was performed to evaluate the potential genes involved in hepatic commitment under liver-injury conditions. The cytokines involved in hepatic differentiation of mBM-MSCs was functionally examined by <b>depletion</b> <b>experiment</b> using specific antibodies, followed by rescue experiment and direct inducing assay. The hepatic differentiation was characterized by the expression of hepatic lineage genes and proteins, as well as functional features. RESULTS: Cytokines potentially participating in hepatic fate commitment under liver-injury conditions were initially measured by microarray. Among the up-regulated genes determined, 18 cytokines known to closely relate to liver growth, repair and development, were selected for further identification. The fibroblast growth factor- 4 (FGF- 4), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and oncostatin M (OSM) were finally found {{to be involved in}} hepatic differentiation of mBM-MSCs under liver-injury conditions. Hepatic differentiation could be dramatically decreased after removing FGF- 4, HGF and OSM from the liver-injury conditioned medium, and could be rescued by supplementing these cytokines.

One association detected on chromosome 11 that was present in a small group of seven accessions (including DJ 123) improved RE above the level already present in many traditional rice accessions.

P uptake is positively correlated with the inorganic P released by NaOH and citrate-bicarbonate in low-P samples, with R 2 of 0. 52. In low-P samples, total organic P and phosphatase activity in the rhizosphere explained 37  % of plant P uptake. In low-P samples, phosphatase activity and pH explained 50  % of plant P uptake. These findings reveal that organic P forms and hydrolytic activity by roots are explaining P availability to plants. Whereas physico-chemical processes controlling inorganic P dynamics play a major role for low organic P/Olsen P ratios...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of developmental trade-offs occurring in the pupal stage of caddis flies, using both an experimental and correlational approach. Resources available at metamorphosis were manipulated by forcing caddis fly larvae, Odontocerum albicorne, to divert more silk, and hence protein, into their larval cases. The resultant adult forms had shorter wings and lighter thoraces (somatic investment) than control individuals, but abdomen mass (reproductive investment) was not affected. The results of this experiment {{could be due to}} mechanistic constraints of the developmental pathways during pupation, because resources from the breakdown of certain structures may be 'earmarked' for incorporation into specific adult structures. Equally, the observed response could represent a strategic preservation of reproductive reserves. O. albicorne is a short lived species which mates soon after adult emergence and so sacrificing somatic investment may have less drastic affects on fitness. To examine whether resource allocation pathways during development of the adult form are flexible in caddis flies, the same resource <b>depletion</b> <b>experiment</b> was performed on the caddis fly species, Glyphotaelius pellucidus. Adult life span is much longer in this species, which is an adaptation to loss of larval habitat for many months of the year. Here, somatic investment would be predicted to be of much greater importance in the life history, and so if the response to the nutrient deficiencies was strategic, somatic reserves would be expected to be preserved at the expense of reproductive potential. The pattern of resource allocation in the resultant adults was in line with predicted life history requirements, as abdomen mass was sacrificed so as to maintain thoracic mass...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the immune}} {{compartment}} of tumors facilitates {{the development of}} revolutionary new therapies. We used a Kras(G 12 D) -driven mouse model of lung cancer to establish an immune signature and identified a contribution of Gr 1 + neutrophils to disease progression. <b>Depletion</b> <b>experiments</b> showed that Gr 1 + cells (1) favor tumor growth, (2) reduce T cell homing and prevent successful anti-PD 1 immunotherapy, and (3) alter angiogenesis, leading to hypoxia and sustained Snail expression in lung cancer cells. In turn, Snail accelerated disease progression and increased intratumoral Cxcl 2 secretion and neutrophil infiltration. Cxcl 2 was produced mainly by neutrophils themselves {{in response to a}} factor secreted by Snail-expressing tumor cells. We therefore propose a vicious cycle encompassing neutrophils and Snail to maintain a deleterious tumor microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|Intra-tumor {{injection}} of immunotherapeutic agents {{is often the}} most effective, likely because of concomitant modification of tumor microenvironment. We tested an immunotherapeutic regimen consisting of CpG oligonucleotides and of adenovirus-mediated gene delivery of CCL 16 chemokine directly into orthotopically implanted prostate tumors by ultrasound-guided injection, followed by systemic administration of an anti-IL- 10 R antibody. This combination treatment induced rapid stromal rearrangement, characterized by massive leukocyte infiltration and large areas of necrosis, a scenario that eventually led to complete tumor rejection and systemic immunity in 75 % of the treated mice. In vivo T lymphocyte <b>depletion</b> <b>experiments</b> demonstrated that the efficacy of CCL 16 /CpG/anti-IL- 10 R combination treatment relies upon CD 8 T lymphocytes whereas CD 4 T cells are dispensable. The results underlie the feasibility of echo-guided local immunotherapy of tumors located in visceral organs that are not easily accessibl...|$|R
40|$|Rationale. In {{patients}} {{suffering from}} metastatic carcinoid tumors, chronic disturbances of serotonergic metabolism are frequently present. Serotonin {{is supposed to}} influence a range of cognitive functions. Objectives. The present study evaluated the cognitive performance of carcinoid patients. Methods. In 14 patients with proven carcinoid syndrome, neuropsychological functioning was studied. Visual search, sustained attention, set shifting ability and spatial working memory were assessed using tests from the CANTAB neuropsychological battery. This was compared {{with the performance of}} matched healthy controls. Results. Plasma tryptophan levels were lower than controls. Patients showed an enhanced ability to learn new stimulus-response associations. Sustained visual attention, however, was impaired. Conclusion. Cognitive patterns were different from those found in depressive patients and partly mimicked those found in tryptophan <b>depletion</b> <b>experiments.</b> Further investigation has to point out the role of serotonergic changes in the accomplishment of affective states...|$|R
