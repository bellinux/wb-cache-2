40|$|We {{studied the}} {{contribution}} of understory frugivorous birds to the seed inflow into a late successional Atlantic forest patch in southeastern Brazil. Five sampling units were established in the study site, each composed {{of a line of}} six mist nets and two adjacent plots containing six seed traps. Immigrant seed species were more frequent in seed traps during the rainy season, when fruit production was higher. On the other hand, the frequency of occurrence of immigrant seed species found in fecal samples of the understory frugivores was higher during the dry season. Although understory frugivorous birds were not responsible for the temporal pattern of the seed rain, they can {{play an important role in}} bringing <b>edge</b> <b>plant</b> species that will eventually colonize forest gaps, contributing to forest patch dynamics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Trap {{cropping}} {{and biological}} control {{can provide a}} sustainable means of controlling insect pests. Insects in the genus Lygus (Hemiptera: Miridae) are major pests on cotton and hor-ticultural crops throughout the United States, and pesticide resis-tance within Lygus populations necessitates more sustainable long-term management techniques. Here, we explore behavioral responses of Lygus bugs (L. rubrosignatus Knight) and an introduced parasitoid, Peristenus relictus (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), to a common field <b>edge</b> <b>plant,</b> Erigeron annuus, which {{has the potential to}} serve as a trap host. Erigeron annuus is attractive to Lygus in the field, with Lygus preferentially moving to Erigeron patches compared to more abundant cotton plants. To determine the role of odor cues in mediating this attraction, we collected volatiles from E. annuus with and without Lygus damage, and then tested the attractiveness of these volatiles vs. those of cotton to Lygus females and female P. relictus wasps using Y-tube and wind tunnel bioassays. We found that undamaged E. annuus emits high concentrations of a complex volatile blend (60 + compounds), with novel compounds induced and constitutive compounds up-regulated in response to damage. Additionally, both female Lygus bugs and female P. relictus wasps are highly attracted to E. annuus volatiles over those of cotton in almost every combination of damage treatments. Our results suggest that Erigeron annuus would be an effective trap plant to control Lygus in cotton, since it is highly attractive to both the pest and its natural enemy...|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies suggest}} the {{importance}} of boundary features on plant community dynamics. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of boundary features on <b>edge</b> <b>plant</b> assemblages in semi-natural dry grasslands. For this purpose we selected 16 grassland edges in the central portion of the Natura 2000 site Murgia Alta, in southeastern Italy. These sites were selected according to a combination of boundary features, i. e. the adjoining land use type (road or cereal crop), slope (grassland tilted towards matrix or flat) and stonewall (occurring or not). Within each site, cover value of vascular plant species was sampled along 0. 5 x 2. 5 m linear plot. A correspondence analysis has been used for the simultaneous ordination of species presence/absence data and the 16 edge plots. Grassland edges with stonewall were characterized either by forest ecotone species in case of sloped edges, or by species typical of sub-mesic calcareous grasslands in case of flat edges. Therefore, stonewall may have a protective role towards the studied communities of conservation concern in case of flat morphology. In case of unbounded edge, no change in species assemblage was clearly explained by adjoining land use type or slope. Assemblages dominated by either ruderal or xerothermic grassland species were observed in all cases of unbounded edges. Furthermore, several species associated with xerothermic conditions were characteristic of highly grazed pastures, suggesting an overlooked role of grazing intensity at the edge. The relevance of boundary features, with regard to their primary role in the definition of multiple and contrasting community dynamics, should be first taken into account when planning land modification, local management actions and for conservation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLandscape {{composition}} and configuration are considered important factors influencing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Evaluating {{the relative importance}} of each component is complicated because they are often correlated. Overcoming this problem could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms that drive biodiversity and help to determine effective actions. Usually, landscape-biodiversity relationships are studied at the local scale for a single habitat type (alpha diversity). However, for a better understanding of ecological processes at the landscape scale, it is also important to look at the overall diversity at the landscape level, including all habitat types. The present study was conducted to determine the relative effects of landscape {{composition and}} configuration on multi-habitat gamma diversity of carabid beetles and vascular plants in an agricultural region of western France. Twenty 1 km 2 landscapes were sampled for plants and carabids. Data from 10 sampling sites representing crop fields, grasslands and woody covers in each landscape were pooled to obtain the total multi-habitat gamma diversity. Results showed that both landscape composition and configuration influenced carabid communities, while only landscape composition affected plant communities. Carabid species richness increased with increasing length of edge between crops and grasslands. Plant richness was negatively and positively affected by the percentage of crops and grasslands respectively. Carabid species composition was more dissimilar between landscapes with increasing difference in percentage of woody covers and crops, and length of grassy-crop <b>edge.</b> <b>Plant</b> species composition was more dissimilar between landscapes with a greater difference in percentage of crops. These results suggest grassy-crop adjacencies may enhance processes of resource complementation between habitats for carabids, while habitat availability and quality are the main factors for plants. This approach provided new insights for sustaining overall biodiversity in agricultural landscapes: e. g. encourage adjacencies between grasslands and crop fields and continue to subsidise grasslands for plant diversity...|$|E
40|$|Aims: We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} anthropogenic boundaries on semi-natural grassland plant communities in terms of: (1) depth and magnitude of edge influence and (2) changes in plant community composition associated with boundary attributes. Location: Alta Murgia, Puglia, southeast Italy. Methods: Sampling sites were selected taking into account three boundary attributes thought to be most important in the study area, i. e. adjacent land use, presence/absence of stone wall at the patch boundary and occurrence of slope. Plant communities were surveyed along 40 -m transects perpendicular to the patch boundary. Each transect was divided in six plots at given distances from patch boundary. Data were collected related {{to a set of}} plant community descriptors referring to structure, composition, life history traits and ecological attributes. A novel methodology that relies on the definition of inner plots as relative interior habitat was introduced for assessment of the depth and magnitude of edge influence. DCA was then used to characterize edge communities. Results: Significant edge influence on grassland plant communities was limited to the adjacent boundary (< 2. 5 m). For the majority of descriptors, magnitude of edge influencewas higher in grasslands adjacent to crops rather than to roads, in sloping rather than flat edges, and in wall-bounded rather than unbounded patches. Plant assemblages dominated by either ruderal species or xerothermic grassland species were, in all cases, associated with unbounded edges, while distinct assemblages were observed in wall-bounded plots according to their different morphology. Wall-bounded sloping edges were characterized by woodland species, whereas their non-sloping analogues were associated with calcareous grassland species. Conclusions: Our findings provide new insights into the influence of anthropogenic boundaries on semi-natural dry grassland by assessing the depth and magnitude of edge influence, as well as the changes in composition of <b>edge</b> <b>plant</b> communities {{as a function of the}} combination of boundary attributes. While the method implemented enabled us to address many of the issues experienced in quantification of edge influence in herbaceous communities, it also allowed us to demonstrate the major role of boundary attributes in modulation of edge community patterns...|$|E
