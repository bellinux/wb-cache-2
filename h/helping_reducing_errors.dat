30|$|In the past, {{there have}} been {{difficulties}} in conducting three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructions using computed tomography (CT). The recent CT scan and 3 D programs, however, <b>help</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>errors</b> created by the patient’s movement, allow accurate measurements by minimizing errors caused by magnification or distortion of the image, limit images to rotating at a specific site and along a manipulating axis, and {{make it possible to}} observe deeper structures by excluding surface structures when needed, thus offering more benefits than two-dimensional measurements. Many studies have used CT images to examine positional changes of the condylar head after BSSRO operations. However, there are very few that examine positional changes of the condylar head after USSRO. Prospective research should be designed to reveal the high prevalence of positional changes in non-operated condylar heads, associated with increased risk of temporomandibular dysfunction post USSRO operation.|$|R
30|$|Another tactic {{in dealing}} with {{error-prone}} DNA synthesis is changing the way we synthesize premeditated DNA. Usually, the formation of synthetic DNA {{requires the use of}} PCR-based technologies, but microarrays are now also used to synthesize DNA [97]. In this case, DNA synthesis typically relies on spatial confinement of reactions to certain regions on a silica chip since this technology employs the addition of picoliters of reagents to the silica chip. Error rates can be reduced by controlling the locations on the chip where the reagents eventually end up. Another possibility could be directing reacting reagents through the use of photochemistry. In this way, light can be used to block or restrict reactions at potential error sites. Directing redox reactions only at desirable sites in the forming DNA is another approach. All these strategies can <b>help</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>error</b> rates from 1 in 200 bases to 1 in 600 bases [98].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Safety {{analysis}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been performed manually by the safety engineers. Since these analyses are based on an informal model of the system, {{it is unlikely that}} these analyses will be complete, consistent, and error-free. Using precise formal models of the system as the basis of the analysis may <b>help</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>errors</b> and provide a more thorough analysis. Further, these models allow automated analysis, which may reduce the manual effort required. The process of creating system models suitable for safety analysis closely parallels the model-based development process that is increasingly used for critical system and software development. By leveraging the existing tools and techniques, we can create formal safety models using tools that are familiar to engineers and we can use the static analysis infrastructure available for these tools. This paper reports our initial experience in using model-based safety analysis on an example system taken from the ARP Safety Assessment guidelines document. ...|$|R

It is {{a technique}} (not a technology) to replace and amplify real experiences with guided ones, often "immersive" in nature, that evoke or replicate substantial aspects of the real world in a fully interactive fashion. Simulation-based learning can be the way to develop health professionals&#x 2032; knowledge, skills, and attitudes, whilst protecting patients from unnecessary risks. Simulation-based medical education can be a platform which provides a valuable tool in learning to mitigate ethical tensions and resolve practical dilemmas.

It has been widely applied in fields such aviation and the military. In medicine, simulation offers good scope for training of interdisciplinary medical teams. The realistic scenarios and equipment allows for retraining and practice till one can master the procedure or skill.
