5|$|In North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, {{rainfall}} {{was generally}} light, {{with the exception}} of a few areas receiving over 3inches (75mm). Henri produced greater amounts of rain in Delaware and Pennsylvania, with a peak of 9.02in (229mm) in Hockessin. In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, over eightinches (203mm) of rain fell in around sixhours, while Doppler Radar estimated that Kennett Square received over 10inches (255mm) in a five-hour period. The heavy rainfall led to record discharge rates along the Red Clay Creek, which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26feet (8m). Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's orbit intersects {{with the}} {{ecliptic}} {{at the two}} nodes that are 180 degrees apart. Therefore, the new moon occurs close to the nodes at two periods of the year approximately six months (173.3 days) apart, known as eclipse seasons, and {{there will always be}} at least one solar eclipse during these periods. Sometimes the new moon occurs close enough to a node during two consecutive months to eclipse the Sun on both occasions in two partial eclipses. This means that, <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year,</b> there will always be at least two solar eclipses, and there can be as many as five.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Blanca was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in Baja California <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year.</b> Forming as a tropical depression on May31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of high sea surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm. It quickly degraded to a depression and dissipated early the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has had {{occurrences of}} {{actors and actresses}} {{nominated}} for two different Academy Awards in acting categories in a single year, with the first instance in 1938.

This rule was introduced in 1944 after Barry Fitzgerald received a Best Actor nomination and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance in Going My Way.|$|E

25|$|The {{actual number}} of {{complete}} or partial weeks of Ordinary Time <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year</b> can total 33 or 34. In most years, Ordinary Time comprises only 33 weeks, so the Church omits one week that otherwise would precede the resumption of Ordinary Time following Pentecost Sunday.

25|$|Proposition 13 reduces {{property}} tax revenue for municipalities in California. They {{are forced to}} rely more on state funding and therefore may lose autonomy and control. The amount of taxes available to the municipality <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year</b> largely depends {{on the number of}} property transfers taking place. However, since existing property owners have an incentive to remain in their property and not sell, there are fewer property transfers under this type of {{property tax}} system.|$|E

We provide supplementary analysis using CPS panels of worker-year pairs for the years 1998 / 1999 through 2012 / 2013.12 The panels provide a robustness check on our principal cross section results, examining how 1 -year changes in the unemployment rate within labor markets affect worker-specific transitions into and out of multiple jobs. These panels also enable us to examine how the MJH of husbands and wives are affected by changes over the past year in their spouse’s employment status.|$|R

25|$|In their book, The Fourth Turning, however, Strauss and Howe {{say that}} the precise {{boundaries}} of generations and turnings are erratic. The generational rhythm is not like certain simple, inorganic cycles in physics or astronomy, where time and periodicity can be predicted to the second. Instead, it resembles the complex, organic cycles of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular rhythm to the four seasons, which they say similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing. Just as winter may come sooner or later, and {{be more or less}} severe <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>given</b> <b>year,</b> {{the same is true of}} a Fourth Turning in any given saeculum.|$|E
