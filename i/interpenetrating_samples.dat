40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. A ratio of MSS channels 5 and 7 (5 / 7) and 5 to 6 (5 / 6) signals {{resulted in a}} correct recognition of 86. 9 % {{of the members of}} representative crop and soil conditions, compared with recognitions of 60. 0, 64. 1, 74. 1, and 81. 4 % for channels 4, 5, 6, and 7 taken individually. Based on this result a satellite channel ratio procedure has been developed that enhances line printer gray maps for more efficient experimental test site location in the CCT data. Because independent estimates are not available to judge acreage estmates derived from ERTS- 1 data against, except for a few crops, an interpenetrating sample constituting 3. 5 % of the county is ground truthed periodically. The crop of land uses and their acreages, respectively, as estimated from the <b>interpenetrating</b> <b>samples,</b> are: cotton, 129, 714; sorghum, 182, 783; mixed citrus, 53, 954; oranges, 16, 929; grapefruit, 13, 863; rangeland, 137, 845; and, improved pastures, 57. 169...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{consequences}} of conducting a continuous inventory that utilizes measurements on overlapping temporal intervals of varying length on compatible estimation {{systems for the}} components of growth are explored. The time <b>interpenetrating</b> <b>sample</b> design of the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program is used as an example. I show why estimation of the traditional components of growth, as presented by Meyer (1953, Forest Mensuration.), is less useful {{than it was in}} previous inventory designs and give a discrete analog to the time invariant redefinition of the components of change that were first given b...|$|R
40|$|In surveys, interviewers {{serve as}} the agents of data collection. Their task {{includes}} contacting the target persons, gaining their cooperation, and conducting the interviews {{according to the rules}} of standardized interviewing. Interviewers are not equally successful at doing their job. They differ both in the quality of the data collected and in the response rate they achieve (Biemer & Lyberg, 2003, pp. 110 – 11, p. 156 ff.). It is often difficult to distinguish to what extent these differences arise from differences among interviewers or from differences between the areas (and the target persons, living in these areas) assigned to the interviewers. Research using <b>interpenetrated</b> <b>sample</b> designs, however, has shown that interviewer effects can remain strong even when area effects are controlled (Campanelli & O’Muircheartaigh, 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|Data used in {{nationwide}} face-to-face {{surveys are}} almost always collected in multistage cluster samples. The relative homogeneity of the clusters selected in this way can lead to design effects at the sampling stage. Interviewers can further homogenize answers within the small geographic clusters that form the sampling points. The study presented here was designed to distinguish between interviewer effects and sampling-point effects using <b>interpenetrated</b> <b>samples</b> for conducting a nationwide survey on fear of crime. Even though one might, given the homogeneity of neighborhoods, assume that sampling-point effects would be especially strong for questions related to fear of crime in one's neighborhood, we found that, for most items, the interviewer was responsible for {{a greater share of}} the homogenizing effect than was the spatial clustering. This result can be understood if we recognize that these questions are part of a larger class of survey questions whose subject matter is either unfamiliar to the respondent or otherwise not well anchored {{in the mind of the}} respondent. These questions permit differing interpretations to be elicited by the interviewer. " (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Measurement {{error is}} defined as the {{difference}} between the finally recorded value from its true value. It occurs during data collection phase. The interviewer, the respondent, the questionnaire and the mode of the interview are the main sources of it. It is very serious {{in the sense that it}} increases the variance of the estimators. Ratio and regression method of estimators are affected in the presence of it. Both in correlated and uncorrelated data it underestimates the variance. For the unbiased estimation of variance we use repeated measurement techniques and <b>interpenetrating</b> sub <b>samples</b> procedures. If proper questionnaire design and appropriate sample frame work is used measurement error can be minimized...|$|R
40|$|Interviewer-based data {{collection}} {{is the norm}} for social and market research surveys in the United Kingdom {{and is likely to}} remain so for the foreseeable future. But what impact do interviewers have on survey resuhs. Interviewers are often seen as valuable allies in the {{data collection}} process for their role in minimising many potential sources of survey error (e. g., through motivating the respondent and controlling the response process). Yet, at the same time, interviewers can also be one of the principal causes of nonresponse error and response variance in quantitative surveys. In terms of nonresponse, it is widely known that different interviewers have different response rates, but comparatively {{little is known about the}} extent to which this is due to differences among interviewers and their characteristics as opposed to differences among the respondents in those areas allocated to the interviewers. What is also unclear is the extent to which such interviewer differences persist over time in longitudinal surveys, the extent to which interviewers differ in their effectiveness at reducing the refusal as opposed to the non-contact component of nonresponse, and the extent to which the fieldwork strategy of matching the same interviewers to the same respondents, 'interviewer continuity', is useful for raising response rates in longitudinal surveys. In terms of response variance, it is rare to find studies in which both the complex sampling variance and the complex interviewer variance are both computed or in which the effects of interviewer continuity on response quality is examined. This thesis investigates these issues by using the <b>interpenetrated</b> <b>sample</b> design experiment designed by C. O'Muircheartaigh (my supervisor) and myself for implementation in Wave 2 of the British Household Panel Study. The analysis is facilitated by the use of cross-classified multilevel modelling in addition to other techniques. The thesis also looks at the issue of 'interviewer continuity' qualitatively, through the impressions of the interviewers themselves...|$|R
