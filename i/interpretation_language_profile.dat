A metaschema, constructed using the Semantic <b>Interpretation</b> <b>Language</b> (SIL) (Simons 2004) maps XML-encoded documents to a common semantically rich RDF database. The RDF database in turn can be searched using RDFsearch engines providing the key functionality of a database management system (DBMS). Simons et al.

Search capability is provided across these data using SeRQL, a SQL-like query language built around the Sesame RDF database program.

40|$|Background: Many {{children}} who are identified with language delay in the early preschool years (age 2 - 3) {{will go on to}} develop age appropriate language skills by age 4 - 5, however some will continue to present with language impairment varying in nature and severity. It is inefficient to provide speech and language therapy to young {{children who}}se problems are likely to resolve (Dale et al, 2003). Identifying reliable predictive measures in the early years to distinguish children whose language will resolve from those who will persist with language impairment will prove valuable to clinicians, allowing for earlier intervention and preventative measures to be put in place. Significant correlations have been found between early gesture and language (Chiat & Roy, 2008). Gesture use and symbolic comprehension were explored in two subgroups of children (n= 22) aged 2 - 3 years (Time 1); expressive language delay only (ELD) and receptive & expressive language delay (RELD). Results indicated differences in both the frequency and type of gesture uses, thus suggesting different underlying skills in each subgroup. Due to the fluidity of <b>language</b> <b>profiles</b> around this developmental period, <b>language</b> <b>profiles</b> from Time 1 are likely to have changed when the children are aged 4 - 5, with some persisting and others being resolved. Conducting a longitudinal study enables us to investigate whether the early <b>language</b> <b>profiles</b> and early gesture measures from Time 1 are useful in predicting the presence and nature of language impairment 2 years later. Objectives: • To investigate whether early gesture use and symbolic comprehension are reliable indicators of later <b>language</b> <b>profiles.</b> • To investigate whether early <b>language</b> <b>profiles</b> are predictive of persisting language difficulties Methods: 15 children from the original Time 1 cohort, were followed up (age 4 - 5 years, Time 2) and assessed on measures of receptive and expressive language, speech, phonological and morphosyntactic processing and nonverbal abilities. They were divided into subgroups based on their language diagnoses. Correlations between gesture, symbolic comprehension and <b>language</b> <b>profiles</b> at T 1, against language scores and subgroups from T 2 were generated. Results: At Time 2, 7 / 9 of the T 1 ELD group had no impairment. 6 / 6 of the T 1 RELD group persisted with language problems with 4 / 6 of them continuing to present with receptive language impairments. Significant correlations were found between symbolic comprehension and both receptive and expressive language scores at T 2 and symbolic comprehension emerged as a strong predictor for later language impairment. Gesture scores were found to be weak predictors of language abilities at T 2. Conclusion: Identification of early <b>language</b> <b>profiles</b> proves to be a significant clinical marker for persistent language difficulties where receptive delays in children aged 2 - 3 are most likely to persist. Early measures of symbolic comprehension might also prove clinically useful in identifying {{children who are}} likely to persist with language impairment. Further larger scale, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the relationship between gesture and symbolic comprehension and language development in specific subgroups of children to further assess the usefulness of these measures in predicting language outcome...|$|R

40|$|Profiling {{tools are}} {{essential}} for understanding and tuning the performance of both parallel programs and parallel language implementations. Assessing {{the performance of a}} program in a language with high-level parallel coordination is often complicated by the layers of abstraction present in the language and its implementation. This thesis investigates whether it is possible to profile parallel Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) using existing host <b>language</b> <b>profiling</b> tools. The key challenge is that the host language tools report the performance of the DSL runtime system (RTS) executing the application rather than the performance of the DSL application. The key questions are whether a correct, effective and efficient profiler can be constructed using host <b>language</b> <b>profiling</b> tools; is it possible to effectively profile the DSL implementation, and what capabilities are required of the host <b>language</b> <b>profiling</b> tools? The main contribution of this thesis is the development of an execution profiler for the parallel DSL, Haskell Distributed Parallel Haskell (HdpH) using the host <b>language</b> <b>profiling</b> tools. We show {{that it is possible to}} construct a profiler (HdpHProf) to support performance analysis of both the DSL applications and the DSL implementation. The implementation uses several new GHC features, including the GHC-Events Library and ThreadScope, develops two new performance analysis tools for DSL HdpH internals, i. e. Spark Pool Contention Analysis, and Registry Contention Analysis. We present a critical comparative evaluation of the host <b>language</b> <b>profiling</b> tools that we used (GHC-PPS and ThreadScope) with another recent functional profilers, EdenTV, alongside four important imperative profilers. This is the first report on the performance of functional profilers in comparison with well established industrial standard imperative profiling technologies. We systematically compare the profilers for usability and data presentation. We found that the GHC-PPS performs well in terms of overheads and usability so using it to profile the DSL is feasible and would not have significant impact on the DSL performance. We validate HdpHProf for functional correctness and measure its performance using six benchmarks. HdpHProf works correctly and can scale to profile HdpH programs running on up to 192 cores of a 32 nodes Beowulf cluster. We characterise the performance of HdpHProf in terms of profiling data size and profiling execution runtime overhead. It shows that HdpHProf does not alter the behaviour of the GHC-PPS and retains low tracing overheads close to the studied functional profilers; 18...|$|R
40|$|Multilingual posts can {{potentially}} affect {{the outcomes of}} content analysis on microblog platforms. To this end, language identification can provide a monolingual set of content for analysis. We find the unedited and idiomatic language of microblogs to be challenging for state-of-the-art language identification methods. To account for this, we identify five microblog characteristics that can help in language identification: the <b>language</b> <b>profile</b> of the blogger (blogger), the content of an attached hyperlink (link), the <b>language</b> <b>profile</b> of other users mentioned (mention) in the post, the <b>language</b> <b>profile</b> of a tag (tag), and {{the language of the}} original post (conversation), if the post we examine is a reply. Further, we present methods that combine these priors in a post-dependent and post-independent way. We present test results on 1, 000 posts from five languages (Dutch, English, French, German, and Spanish), which show that our priors improve accuracy by 5 % over a domain specific baseline, and show that post-dependent combination of the priors achieves the best performance. When suitable training data does not exist, our methods still outperform a domain unspecific baseline. We conclude with an examination of the language distribution of a million tweets, along with temporal analysis, the usage of twitter features across languages, and a correlation study between classifications made and geo-location and language metadata fields...|$|R

Identifying the <b>language</b> <b>profile</b> of a user is often non-trivial because (i) users often do not specify all the languages known to them while signing up for an online service (ii) users of many languages (especially Indian languages) largely use Latin/Roman script to write content in their native language.
