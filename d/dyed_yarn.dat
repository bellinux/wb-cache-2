5|$|Mid-19th century Navajo rugs {{often used}} a three-ply yarn called Saxony, {{which refers to}} high-quality, {{naturally}} dyed, silky yarns. Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a woolen manufactured in England. With {{the arrival of the}} railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline <b>dyed</b> <b>yarn</b> known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|The {{dyeing process}} {{involves}} {{the preparation of}} the yarn {{in order to make it}} susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a mordant. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The <b>dyed</b> <b>yarn</b> is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of slight deviations {{within the same}} colour is called abrash (from Turkish abraş, literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, {{who did not have}} enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of <b>dyed</b> <b>yarn</b> to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.|$|E

To prepare the seven basic colors (red, green, yellow, black, dark blue, white, purple) and their tints used in carpetmaking, professional dyers use green walnut shells, the skin of pomegranates, indigo, leaves of the mulberry, quince and walnut plants, and roots of madder. For example, {{in order to achieve}} yellow and its hues, they use bulb onion peels, mulberry leaves collected in the late autumn, etc. To produce red and pink colors, madder is used, and to obtain dark blue, blue and green, indigo dye is used. At {{the very end of the}} <b>yarn</b> <b>dyeing</b> process a dyer adds salt, alum or vinegar into the dye solution to increase the intensity, fastness and durability of colours.

The alum-mordanted <b>dyed</b> woolen <b>yarns</b> were found comparatively less tolerable towards light in comparison to control-, iron-, or tin-mordanted <b>dyed</b> woolen <b>yarns</b> (Maulik and Agarwal 2014).
