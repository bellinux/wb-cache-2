5000|$|Outward clinch staples {{are blind}} staples, i.e. {{there is no}} anvil, and they are applied with a staple gun. When applied, each staple leg forms a curve bending outwards. This is in part caused by {{the shape of the}} crown, which is like an {{inverted}} [...] "V", and not flat as in ordinary staples. Also, the legs are sharpened with an <b>inside</b> <b>bevel</b> point, causing them to tend to go outwards when forced into the base material. These staples are used for upholstery work, especially in vehicles, where they are used for fastening fabric or leather to a foam base.|$|E
5000|$|The {{angle of}} {{administration}} is 5 to 15 degrees, almost against the skin. With bevel (opening) side up, insert about 1/8" [...] with entire <b>bevel</b> <b>inside</b> and inject while watching {{for a small}} wheal or blister to appear.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the working edges varies with size and purpose. Large twybils have short {{straight}} edges for splitting, like an axe or tomahawk. Small ones have a more curved edge, curving back beneath to a shape that {{is more like a}} short knife or oyster knife, another tool used with a similar splitting and prying action. Both styles are forged and sharpened symmetrically. The levering end is asymmetrical, with a single bevel as for a chisel. Large framing twybils are straight, with this bevel on the outside. Small ones are curved or hooked, with the <b>bevel</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} recently that a dynamic physical process occurring in the trachea / tube might account for the dissemination of bacteria and biofilm fragments into the lungs during mechanical ventilation, and the subsequent development of ventilator-associated pneumonia. In this study of tracheal tubes from consecutive adult intensive care patients, biofilms were detected radiographically in 45 of 50 tubes, and were found {{at the lower end}} of the tube more often than at the upper end (? < 0. 005). In 37 of 50 trachea / tubes, the maximum biofilm thickness was equal to or greater than the 0. 5 mm required for gas-liquid interaction in a tube with an i. d. of 8. 5 mm. In 23 of 50 tubes, wave-like patterns were found. Five tubes had no biofilm <b>inside</b> the <b>bevelled</b> tip and another six showed evidence of biofilm loss for a greater distance from the tip. These observations suggest that the dis-tribution of tracheal tube biofilm is caused at least in part by dynamic phenomena in the tracheal tube...|$|R
50|$|The shell {{grows to}} {{a height of}} 3 mm, its {{diameter}} 6 mm.The solid shell has a depressed conoid shape. The four whorls are smooth, flatly convex, slightly hollowed just below the suture. The apex is blunt. The suture is impressed. The periphery is round and barely angulate. The base of the shell is convex. The umbilicus is moderate. The oblique aperture is roundly elliptical. The outer lip is simple and <b>bevelled</b> <b>inside.</b> A shortthin glaze {{can be found on}} the base of the whorl. The arcuate columella is everted posteriorly, with a tiny notch where it joins the round basal lip at the end of the bordering lira of the umbilicus. The throat is smooth and iridescent.|$|R
5000|$|Modern beveled {{glass is}} machine made. The {{automation}} of this traditionally hand made craft was {{facilitated by the}} development of plastic based metal deburring wheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the difficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone smoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in Newcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in diameter and 8" [...] thick. The stone's quality was dictated by the consistency of the sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These large stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process. The type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was creating straight line, outside or <b>inside</b> curved <b>bevels.</b> Outside curves and straight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a thin slurry of silicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide grinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the wheel. Smoothing the ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and straight line bevels and a cone shaped polishing wheel of relatively fine grit aluminum oxide. Despite the advantages of the plastic smoothing wheels, the crispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally beveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was polishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and optical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination of outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was to have an even bevel width, even edge thickness with no facets in the bevel face and a crisp bevel edge. In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to see beveled oval door glass 5' in length with 2" [...] wide bevels on 3/8" [...] thick plate glass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.|$|R
40|$|Corner {{building}} {{is located in}} part of city Brno – Zidenice. Object is separate on two function parts – first one is the healthcare center with practitioner and specialist doctors offices, that part is situated in the first floor. Second part is the flats and the parking in the basement belong to those flats. Land lot has a shape of rectangle same as the building. Modul scheme of columns divides object into square parts. By gradually deleting these square parts created object into terraced apartment building. These terraces are pointed into the courtyard. Deleting one square part in first floor plan is made an atrium space accessible from waiting room of healthcare center. Terraces for each apartments in another floors are made by same way. Object makes private spaces for its users. Terraces are opened on east, north and west. Important and characteristic part of object is shape of fourth floor, where is wall <b>bevelled</b> <b>inside.</b> Point of this bevel is to make building optically smaller because of neighbouring buildings are lower than apartment house. In future we assume with increasing buildings. Next important part is irregularly arrangement of windows. Main function is to lighten room as much as possible, but even architectural expression of house. Irregular windows of different sizes are {{in some parts of}} house added with shiplap facade window system, which allows big format glass and ventilation. Behind these big windows is sliding patio doors...|$|R
