This procedure generally required the use of consular and diplomatic channels as the request had to be made to the foreign minister (Secretary of State in the United States) of the defendant's country by the foreign minister of the originating court.|$|R

50|$|Service {{of process}} in civil cases {{prior to the}} {{regulation}} was done by either under the Hague Service Convention or {{by means of a}} letter rogatory (also called a letter of request), a formal request from a court in one country to serve process to another in which the defendant is domiciled. This formal document usually required transmission from the originating Court to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in the state of origin, who then forwarded it, possibly through various embassies, to the MFA in the destination state. The foreign MFA would then pass the documents to the judicial authorities in that state, who would then go about the service procedures. Proof of service would then be returned via the same long winded channels. Member states of the European Union did conclude a convention amongst themselves regarding the subject (the Convention, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the service in the Member States of the European Union of judicial and <b>extrajudicial</b> <b>documents</b> in civil or commercial matters), which was signed on 26 May 1997, but never entered into force as it was ratified only by Spain.|$|R
