5|$|In the United States, the Ojibwe {{used the}} powdery gleba as a <b>hemostatic</b> agent to staunch {{the flow of}} nosebleeds: the spore powder was inhaled through the nostrils. It is now known that this {{practice}} {{can lead to the}} pulmonary disease lycoperdonosis, which causes symptoms similar to pneumonia. It is also used as a <b>hemostatic</b> agent in Chinese and Japanese folk medicines.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer peridium, Mycenastrum corium puffballs can {{withstand}} hard blows without breaking, and children have used them as replacements for balls. The puffballs {{have also been}} used medicinally in Mexico as a <b>hemostatic,</b> as a throat and lung tonic, and for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
25|$|Some medical {{conditions}} {{can also make}} patients susceptible to bleeding. These are conditions that affect the normal <b>hemostatic</b> (bleeding-control) functions of the body. Such conditions either are, or cause, bleeding diatheses. Hemostasis involves several components. The main components of the <b>hemostatic</b> system include platelets and the coagulation system.|$|E
25|$|QuikClot brand <b>hemostatic</b> agent, {{which is}} used to stop severe bleeding, {{contains}} a calcium-loaded form of zeolite found in kaolin clay.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{adsorbent}} chemicals, such as zeolites, {{and other}} <b>hemostatic</b> agents {{are also used}} for sealing severe injuries quickly (such as in traumatic bleeding secondary to gunshot wounds). Thrombin and fibrin glue are used surgically to treat bleeding and to thrombose aneurysms.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of coagulation in two pathways is mainly artificial, it originates from laboratory tests in which clotting times were measured after the clotting was initiated by glass (intrinsic pathway) or by thromboplastin (a mix of tissue factor and phospholipids). In fact thrombin is present {{from the very}} beginning, already when platelets are making the plug. Thrombin has a large array of functions, not only the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the building block of a <b>hemostatic</b> plug. In addition, {{it is the most}} important platelet activator {{and on top of that}} it activates Factors VIII and V and their inhibitor protein C (in the presence of thrombomodulin), and it activates Factor XIII, which forms covalent bonds that crosslink the fibrin polymers that form from activated monomers.|$|E
25|$|Rapid venom {{evolution}} {{can also}} {{be explained by the}} arms race between venom targeted molecules in resistant predators, such as the opossum, and the snake venom that targets the molecules. Scientists performed experiments on the opossums and found that there were multiple trials that showed replacement to silent substitutions in the von Willebrand Factor (vWF) gene which encodes for a venom-targeted <b>hemostatic</b> blood protein. These substitutions are thought to weaken the connection between vWF and a toxic snake venom ligand (botrocetin) which changes the net charge and hydrophobicity. These results are significant to the venom evolution because it is the first citation of rapid evolution in a venom-targeted molecule. This shows that an evolutionary arms race may be occurring in terms of defensive purposes. Alternative hypotheses suggest that venom evolution is due to trophic adaption, whereas these scientist believe, in this case, that selection would occur on traits that help with prey survival in terms of venom evolution instead of predation success. Several other predators of the pit viper (mongooses and hedgehogs) show the same type of relationship between snakes, which helps to support the hypothesis that venom has a very strong defensive role along with a trophic role. Which in turn supports the idea that predation on the snakes can be the arms race that produces snake venom evolution.|$|E
25|$|It is {{now well}} {{recognized}} that feeding ticks, sandflies, and, more recently, mosquitoes, have {{an ability to}} modulate the immune response of the animals (hosts) on which they feed. The presence of this activity in vector saliva {{is a reflection of}} the inherent overlapping and interconnected nature of the host <b>hemostatic</b> and inflammatory/immunological responses and the intrinsic need to prevent these host defenses from disrupting successful feeding. The mechanism for mosquito saliva-induced alteration of the host immune response is unclear, but the data have become increasingly convincing that such an effect occurs. Early work described a factor in saliva that directly suppresses TNF-α release, but not antigen-induced histamine secretion, from activated mast cells. Experiments by Cross et al. (1994) demonstrated that the inclusion of Ae. aegypti mosquito saliva into naïve cultures led to a suppression of interleukin (IL)-2 and IFN-γ production, while the cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 are unaffected by mosquito saliva. Cellular proliferation in response to IL-2 is clearly reduced by prior treatment of cells with mosquito salivary gland extract. Correspondingly, activated splenocytes isolated from mice fed upon by either Ae. aegypti or Cx. pipiens mosquitoes produce markedly higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 concurrent with suppressed IFN-γ production. Unexpectedly, this shift in cytokine expression is observed in splenocytes up to 10 days after mosquito exposure, suggesting natural feeding of mosquitoes can have a profound, enduring, and systemic effect on the immune response.|$|E
500|$|The samaras {{are also}} used in modern Chinese {{medicine}} under the name feng yan cao (...) , meaning [...] "herbal phoenix eye". They are used as a <b>hemostatic</b> agent, spermatorrhea and for treating patients with blood in their feces or urine. It was clinically shown {{to be able to}} treat trichomoniasis, a vaginal infection caused by the protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. In the West, an extract of the bark sold under the synonym A. glandulosa is sometimes used as an herbal remedy for various ailments including cancer.|$|E
500|$|This earthstar {{has been}} used in {{traditional}} Chinese medicine as a <b>hemostatic</b> agent; the spore dust is applied externally to stop wound bleeding and reduce chilblains. Two Indian forest tribes, the Baiga and the Bharia of Madhya Pradesh, have been reported to use the fruit bodies medicinally. The spore mass is blended with mustard seed oil, and used as a salve against burns. The Blackfoot of North America called the fungus [...] "fallen stars", considering them to be stars fallen to the earth during supernatural events.|$|E
500|$|Calvatia craniiformis, {{commonly}} known as the brain puffball or the skull-shaped puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. It is found in Asia, Australia, and North America, where it grows on the ground in open woods. Its name, derived from the same Latin root as cranium, alludes to its resemblance to an animal's brain. The skull-shaped fruit body is [...] broad by [...] tall and white to tan. Initially smooth, the skin (peridium) develops wrinkles and folds as it matures, cracking and flaking with age. The peridium eventually sloughs away, exposing a powdery yellow-brown to greenish-yellow spore mass (the gleba). The puffball is edible when the gleba is still white and firm, before it matures to become yellow-brown and powdery. Mature specimens have been used in the traditional or folk medicines of China, Japan, and the Ojibwe as a <b>hemostatic</b> or wound dressing agent. Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the brain puffball.|$|E
2500|$|A form of vWD {{occurs in}} {{patients}} with aortic valve stenosis, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding (Heyde's syndrome). This form of acquired vWD may be more prevalent than is presently thought. In 2003, Vincentelli et al. noted that patients with acquired vWD and aortic stenosis who underwent valve replacement experienced a correction of their <b>hemostatic</b> abnormalities, but that the <b>hemostatic</b> abnormalities can recur after 6 months when the prosthetic valve is a poor match with the patient.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II and the Second Sino-Japanese War {{respectively}} in 1945, {{she moved}} to Keio University in Shinanomachi in Tokyo. As resources were scarce, {{she and her husband}} Shosuke Okamoto changed to research on blood: [...] "If there was not enough we could simply use our own". They hoped to find a treatment for post-partum haemorrhage, a potent drug to stop bleeding after childbirth. They began by studying epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA). They then studied a related chemical, 1-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane-4-carboxylic acid (AMCHA), also known as tranexamic acid. The Okamotos found it was 27 times as powerful and thus a promising <b>hemostatic</b> agent and published their findings in the Keio Journal of Medicine in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Spinal motion {{restriction}} by {{securing the}} {{neck with a}} cervical collar and placing the person on a long spine board was of high importance in the pre-hospital setting, but {{due to lack of}} evidence to support its use, the practice is losing favor. Instead, it is recommend that more exclusive criteria be met such as age and neurological deficits to indicate the need of these adjuncts. This may be accomplished with other medical transport devices such as a [...] Kendrick extrication device, before moving the person. It is important to quickly control severe bleeding with direct pressure to the wound and consider the use of <b>hemostatic</b> agents or tourniquets if the bleeding continues. Conditions such as impending airway obstruction, enlargening neck hematoma, or unconsciousness require intubation. It is unclear, however, if this is best performed before reaching hospital or in the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1890s, the {{profound}} effect of adrenal extracts on many different tissue types had been discovered, {{setting off a}} search both for the mechanism of chemical signalling and efforts to exploit these observations {{for the development of}} new drugs. The blood pressure raising and vasoconstrictive effects of adrenal extracts were of particular interest to surgeons as <b>hemostatic</b> agents and as treatment for shock, and a number of companies developed products based on adrenal extracts containing varying purities of the active substance. In 1897, John Abel of Johns Hopkins University identified the active principle as epinephrine, which he isolated in an impure state as the sulfate salt. Industrial chemist Jokichi Takamine later developed a method for obtaining epinephrine in a pure state, and licensed the technology to Parke Davis. [...] Parke Davis marketed epinephrine under the trade name Adrenalin. Injected epinephrine proved to be especially efficacious for the acute treatment of asthma attacks, and an inhaled version was sold in the United States until 2011 (Primatene Mist). By 1929 epinephrine had been formulated into an inhaler for use in the treatment of nasal congestion.|$|E
