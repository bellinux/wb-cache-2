40|$|Despite the {{continuous}} development {{of materials and}} techniques of adhesive bonding, the basic procedure remains relatively constant. The technique is based on three components: <b>etching</b> <b>substance,</b> adhesive system, and composite material. The use of etchants during bonding orthodontic brackets carries the risk of damage to the enamel. Therefore, the article examines {{the effect of the}} manner of enamel etching on its thickness before and after orthodontic treatment. The study was carried out in vitro on a group of 80 teeth. It was divided into two subgroups of 40 teeth each. The procedure of enamel etching was performed under laboratory conditions. In the first subgroup, the classic method of enamel etching and the fifth-generation bonding system were used. In the second subgroup, the seventh-generation (self-etching) bonding system was used. In both groups, metal orthodontic brackets were fixed and the enamel was cleaned with a cutter fixed on the micromotor after their removal. Before and after the treatment, two-dimensional optical coherence tomography scans were performed. The enamel thickness was assessed on the two-dimensional scans. The average enamel thickness in both subgroups was not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|High bond {{strength}} is desirable; however, enamel damage during debonding must be avoided. At {{the same time}} premature loss of brackets during orthodontic treatment is undesirable. Therefore, adhesive {{bond strength}} is an important parameter for clinicians. Different types of enamel conditioning are supposed to affect bond strength. DIN 13990 - 1 /- 2 describes standardized tests intended to ensure comparability of results. The aims of this study were: 1. to get information about the suitability of DIN 13990 - 1 /- 2 and its recommendations 2. to test the bond strength of the adhesives Transbond XT, Beauty Ortho Bond and Fuji Ortho LC with various conditioning regimes Material and Methods In {{the first part of}} the study the enamel surface conditioning was performed as recommended by the manufacturers. In the second part of the study shear bond strength was tested after additional conditioning or after using a stronger <b>etching</b> <b>substance.</b> A total of 600 experiments were carried out, with groups of 10 specimens each subjected to identical treatments. Shear bond strengths of all adhesives were evaluated separately at the bracket-adhesive and adhesive-enamel interface (DIN 13990 - 1), as well as at the total (enamel-adhesive-bracket) interface (DIN 13990 - 2). Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested after storage for 15 min, after storage in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h and after 24 h followed by thermocycling. After storage, the bonded specimens were tested for SBS using a universal testing machine (Zwick Z 010; Ulm, Germany) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min in occluso-gingival direction. After debonding the fracture pattern was determined using an optical microscope at 10 x magnification and the failure pattern was assessed. Statistical software (SPSS, v. 19. 0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for analysis and graphical presentation of the shear experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Consideration was given to the different adhesives, enamel conditioning, interface types and storage modes. T-tests for independent samples were used. Results •	DIN 13990 - 1 /- 2 is suitable to test shear bond strength. Results are reproducible. •	The highest shear bond strengths were measured with Transbond XT, followed by Beauty Ortho Bond and Fuji Ortho LC. •	 500 cycles thermocycling did not have a significant influence on the adhesives tested. •	Shear bond strength after stronger etching than recommended by the manufacturer led to significantly higher shear bond strengths. •	Most enamel damages occurred with Transbond XT. Conclusion Transbond XT and Beauty Ortho Bond are suitable adhesives for clinical needs. Fuji Ortho LC does not meet our (arbitrarily defined) minimum requirements...|$|E
40|$|Micropetrotic {{areas of}} human bone were {{analyzed}} {{with reference to}} their distance from blood vessels and {{to the age of}} the subjects. Undecalcified bone sections were treated with various solvent, soaking and <b>etching</b> <b>substances</b> to establish the nature of the material occluding the osteocytic canalicular cavities, and were examined by means of microradiographic and microdurimetric methods and X-ray microanalysis to evaluate the degree of mineralization in the bone matrix. Since it was only after strong etching with HCl that the canalicular network became visible under light and scanning electron microscopy, {{it is clear that the}} debris filling the-canalicular network consists almost entirely of mineral substance. The degree of mineralization of micropetrotic bone is high because it is always a more mature type Of bone, but the mineral content of the matrix and the Ca/P ratio do not differ significantly from those of neighbouring bone where the canalicular network is fully pervious...|$|R

30|$|The hollow spheres {{have many}} {{advantages}} {{as described in}} the introduction, {{and one of them is}} the large internal void, which can be used as carriers, nano-scale reactors, and so on. For the achievement of these applications, how to put the desired substances into the interior of the hollow spheres is a very important problem. Beside the method using windows as passageway, we also can employ another very convenient method to solve this problem for the hollow spheres obtained in this paper. Before the fabrication of the hollow nanospheres, the desired substances can be firstly deposited on the PS array, and then begin to fabricate the hollow spheres. After the PS spheres are <b>etching</b> away, these <b>substances</b> are left in the interior. When the deposited substances used here is very little, there is almost no effect on the obtained hollow spheres. In addition, this method described here also can be used to achieve the fabrication of core-shell structures or ‘Janus’ or ‘Patchy’ particles, when etching process is removed.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The medical use of non-thermal {{physical}} plasmas is intensively {{investigated for}} sterilization and surface modification of biomedical materials. A further promising application is the removal or <b>etching</b> of organic <b>substances,</b> e. g., biofilms, from surfaces, because remnants of biofilms after conventional cleaning procedures are capable to entertain inflammatory {{processes in the}} adjacent tissues. In general, contamination of surfaces by micro-organisms is {{a major source of}} problems in health care. Especially biofilms are {{the most common type of}} microbial growth in the human body and therefore, the complete removal of pathogens is mandatory for the prevention of inflammatory infiltrate. Physical plasmas offer a huge potential to inactivate micro-organisms and to remove organic materials through plasma-generated highly reactive agents. METHOD: In this study a Candida albicans biofilm, formed on polystyrene (PS) wafers, as a prototypic biofilm was used to verify the etching capability of the atmospheric pressure plasma jet operating with two different process gases (argon and argon/oxygen mixture). The capability of plasma-assisted biofilm removal was assessed by microscopic imaging. RESULTS: The Candida albicans biofilm, with a thickness of 10 to 20 µm, was removed within 300 s plasma treatment when oxygen was added to the argon gas discharge, whereas argon plasma alone was practically not sufficient in biofilm removal. The impact of plasma etching on biofilms is localized due to the limited presence of reactive plasma species validated by optical emission spectroscopy...|$|R
