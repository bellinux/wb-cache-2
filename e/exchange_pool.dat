The {{impact of}} {{elemental}} cycling and biological fractionation in the soil–vegetation systemwas investigated for 6 Red Brown Earth soil profiles (Xeralfs and Xerults) from South Australia by comparing geochemical and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data from bulk soils, soil <b>exchange</b> <b>pool,</b> and vegetation (grapes). In all 6 soil profiles from 3 different sites, Ba/Ca ratios of vegetation, soil <b>exchange</b> <b>pool,</b> and bulk soils {{were found to}} be a more robust biological fractionation indicator than Sr/Ca ratios. In the base-poor soils of the Coonawarra–Padthaway area of South Australia, the degree of weathering of soil material, as estimated by titania and alumina contents, correlated very well with the biological fractionation indicator Ba/Ca. Soil horizons with greater clay and titania content also had higher degrees of biological fractionation. Similar Red Brown Earth soils 400 km north in the Clare Valley showed either no, or poor, biological fractionation signature in their bulk soil. The Clare Valley soils have a stronger colluvial component and are richer in base cations than the Coonawarra and Padthaway sites. The main source of bulk soil material in the base-poor soils of the Coonawarra–Padthaway areas is dust, which has greatly influenced the base cation concentration, Ba/Ca ratios, and the strontium isotope ratios. Soils from Clare Valley, by comparison, are less intensely weathered and are thus not as dependent on dust and biocycling for their base cations. Biological fractionation has not left a discernible signature on the composition of the bulk soil. The exchange pools at all 3 sites are dominated by wetfall–dryfall sources, which in this coastal area are dominated bymarine sources. For the base-poor soils of the Coonawarra–Padthaway area, the most likely major source of aeolian detritus is Murray Rive...|$|E

The {{determination of the}} relative concentrations and exchange rates is commonly achieved by numerical integration of the Bloch-McConnell equations. We derive an analytical solution of the Bloch-McConnell equations that describes the magnetization of coupled spin populations under radiofrequency irradiation. As CEST and off-resonant SL are equivalent, their steady-state magnetization and dynamics can be predicted by the same single eigenvalue: the longitudinal relaxation rate in the rotating frame R 1 rho. For the case of slowly exchanging systems, e. g. amide protons, the saturation of the small proton pool is affected by transverse relaxation (R 2 b). It turns out, that R 2 b is also significant for intermediate exchange, such as amine- or hydroxyl-exchange or paramagnetic CEST agents, if pools are only partially saturated. We propose a solution for R 1 rho that includes R 2 of the <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> by extending existing approaches, and verify it by numerical simulations. With the appropriate projection factors, we obtain an analytical solution for CEST and SL for nonzero R 2 of the <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool,</b> whilst considering the dilution by direct water saturation across the entire Z-spectra. This allows the optimization of irradiation parameters and the quantification of pH-dependent exchange rates and metabolite concentrations. In addition, we propose evaluation methods that correct for concomitant direct saturation effects. It is shown that existing theoretical treatments for CEST are special cases of this approach...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{stable isotope}} ratios are a {{relatively}} new tool that biogeochemists can use to investigate the biogeochemical cycle of calcium in terrestrial ecosystems, having seen widespread application {{only in the past}} 15 years. To advance the application of calcium isotopes in biogeoscience research, I conducted three investigations focused on interpreting calcium isotope ratios in streamwater and in the cation <b>exchange</b> <b>pool</b> of forest soils. In the first study, we observe a shift toward lower 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios in streamwater draining a New Hampshire watershed after an experimental clearcutting event. Isotope ratio measurements of ecosystem calcium pools indicate that enhanced leaching of the soil exchangeable pool produced the observed shift in 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios. A trend towards decreased 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios in soils in the years following the harvesting indicates that calcium leached from the soil exchangeable reservoir was likely replaced by calcium released by the decay of belowground biomass, maintaining pre-harvest levels of exchangeable calcium {{even in the face of}} a significant ecosystem disturbance. In a second study, we observed significant differences in the 44 Ca/ 40 Ca of the soil <b>exchange</b> <b>pool</b> between two neighboring tropical watersheds, although 44 Ca/ 40 Ca of calcium inputs (bedrock and atmospheric deposition) at the two sites were indistinguishable. Further, both sites had higher 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios compared with external inputs, a relatively rare observation globally. We propose that hurricane disturbance best explains the high 44 Ca/ 40 Ca at each site, and that the difference in 44 Ca/ 40 Ca between the two sites can be accounted for by the magnitude of disturbance at each site. Finally, a synthesis of our new data with previously published results shows that globally, soil exchangeable 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios can be higher, lower or equal to external inputs. Modeling work indicates that in addition to isotopic fractionation, the balance in fluxes between vegetation and soil is critical in determining how soil exchangeable 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios vary relative to external inputs. When plant uptake and return to the soil are equal, soil and external inputs 44 Ca/ 40 Ca are equal, while high soil 44 Ca/ 40 Ca ratios develop when uptake exceeds return. Soil develops low 44 Ca/ 40 Ca when biomass obtains calcium from sources other than the exchangeable reservoir...|$|E
40|$|As {{the kidney}} {{exchange}} programs are being established, one important question {{that remains to}} be answered is how should the exchanges be conducted in a dynamically evolving patient pool. We study the kidney exchange problem as a dynamic matching problem, in which patient and her paired-donor arrive under a Poisson arrival process. We associate a constant unit cost of waiting in the pool for each patient, given that the alternative is continuous dialysis. We characterize the dynamically optimal two-way and unrestricted kidney exchange rules that minimize the total cost associated with the <b>exchange</b> <b>pool</b> under certain assumptions. Under the optimal two-way matching rule, all exchanges are conducted as soon as they become available. On the other hand, under the optimal unrestricted matching rule, depending on the arrival frequencies of di¤erent pairs, one of the two threshold rules can be optimal. In the …rst threshold rule, B blood-type patient and A blood-type donor pairs (B-A type) are exclusively used to be matched with reciprocal A-B type pairs instead of possibly larger exchanges, as long as the number of B-A type pairs does not exceed some threshold number. The other threshold rule is the symmetric version of the …rst one and is obtained by treating the number of A-B type pairs as the state variable instead of the B-A type...|$|E
40|$|The {{allocation}} {{and management}} of scarce resources are of central importance {{in the design of}} policies to improve social well-being. This dissertation consists of three essays; the first two deals with the problem of allocating kidneys and the third one on power management in computing devices. Kidney exchange programs are an attractive alternative for patients who need a kidney transplant and who have a willing, but medically incompatible, donor. A registry that keeps track of such patient-donor pairs can nd matches through exchanges amongst such pairs. This results in a quicker transplant for the patients involved, and equally importantly, keeps such patients from the long wait list of patients without an intended donor. As of March 2014, there were at least 99, 000 candidates waiting for a kidney transplant in the U. S. However, in 2013 only 16, 893 transplants were conducted. This imbalance between supply and demand among other factors, has driven the development of multiple kidney exchange programs in the U. S. and the subsequent development of matching mechanisms to run the programs. In the first essay we consider a matching problem arising in kidney exchanges between hospitals. Focusing on the case of two hospitals, we construct a strategy-proof matching mechanism that is guaranteed to return a matching that is at least 3 / 4 the size of a maximum cardinality matching. It is known that no better performance is possible if one focuses on mechanisms that return a maximal matching, and so our mechanism is best possible within this natural class of mechanisms. For path-cycle graphs we construct a mechanism that returns a matching that is at least 4 / 5 the size of max-cardinality matching. This mechanism does not necessarily return a maximal matching. Finally, we construct a mechanism that is universally truthful on path-cycle graphs and whose performance is within 2 / 3 of optimal. Again, it is known that no better ratio is possible. In most of the existing literature, mechanisms are typically evaluated by their overall performance on a large <b>exchange</b> <b>pool,</b> based on which conclusions and recommendations are drawn. In our second essay, we consider a dynamic framework to evaluate extensively used kidney exchange mechanisms. We conduct a simulation-based study of a dynamically evolving <b>exchange</b> <b>pool</b> during 9 years. Our results suggest that some of the features that are critical in a mechanism in the static setting have only a minor impact in its longrun performance when viewed in the dynamic setting. More importantly, features that are generally underestimated in the static setting turn to be relevant when we look at dynamically evolving <b>exchange</b> <b>pool.</b> For example, the pairs' arrival rates. In particular we provide insights into the eect on the waiting times and the probability to receive an oer of controllable features such as the frequency at which matching are run, the structures through which pairs could be matched (cycles or chains) as well as inherent features such as the pairs ABO-PRA characteristics, the availability of altruistic donors, and wether or not compatible pairs join the exchange etc. We evaluate the odds to receive an oer and the expected time to receive an oer for each ABO-PRA type of pairs in the model. Power management in computing devices aims to minimize energy consumption to perform tasks, meanwhile keeping acceptable performance levels. A widely used power management strategy for devices, is to transit the devices and/or components to lower power consumption states during inactivity periods. Transitions between power states consume energy, thus, depending on such costs, it may be advantageous to stay in high power state during some inactivity periods. In our third essay we consider the problem of minimizing the total energy consumed by a 2 -power state device, to process jobs that are sent over time by a constrained adversary. Jobs can be preempted, but deadlines need to be met. In this problem, an algorithm must decide when to schedule the jobs, as well as a sequence of power states, and the discrete time thresholds at which these states will be reached. We provide an online algorithm to minimize the energy consumption when the cost of a transition to the low power state is small enough. In this case, the problem of minimizing the energy consumption is equivalent to minimizing the total number of inactivity periods. We also provide an algorithm to minimize the energy consumption when it may be advantageous to stay in high power state during some inactivity periods. In both cases we provide upper bounds on the competitive ratio of our algorithms, and lower bounds on the competitive ratio of all online algorithms...|$|E
40|$|Macrophage {{membrane}} cholesterol {{is present}} in two subcellular cholesterol <b>pools,</b> a rapidly <b>exchanging</b> compartment comprising {{about two-thirds of the}} total cholesterol, and a slowly exchanging compartment comprising one-third of the total. The morphological identification of the kinetically distinguishable pools proceeded by alteration of each compartment. Trypsin treatment markedly decreased the rate of cholesterol exchange without removing cholesterol from the membrane. Recovery of normal exchange rates took more than 7 hr and required protein synthesis. This suggested that a plasma membrane receptor is involved in positioning of lipoproteins for exchange, and is consistent with the plasma membrane localization of the rapidly exchanging compartment. Extensive pinocytosis by nondegradable dextran, dextran sulfate, or sucrose resulted in the accumulation of many secondary lysosomes, thus increasing the relative proportion of intracellular membranes. The measurable granule membrane area, cholesterol content, phospholipid content, and the relative size of the slowly exchanging cholesterol compartment all increased. The amount of intracellular membrane altered by extensive phagocytosis of latex particles also increased the size of the slowly exchanging cholesterol compartment. This suggested that the slowly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> of cholesterol represented the intracellular membranes primarily of lysosomal origin. Rabbit alveolar macrophages and thioglycollate-stimulated peritoneal macrophages contain many secondary lysosomes as a result of multiple bouts of in vivo phagocytosis and pinocytosis. In both of these cells the fast and slow pools are equal in size. The increased cholesterol content was attributable to the increase in the relative size of the slowly exchanging compartment. L-cells and melanoma cells also exchange their cholesterol with that of serum lipoproteins. Both cells contain few cholesterol-rich intracellular membranes, and had lower cellular cholesterol contents. In these cells the slowly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> was a minor contribution to cell cholesterol. Studies with these cells provided further evidence for the lysosomal membrane and plasma membrane localization of the slowly and rapidly exchanging cholesterol compartments...|$|R
40|$|Although Ca 2 + {{has long}} been known to {{play a vital role in}} {{excitation}} [...] contraction coupling in the heart, investigation of the details of this role has been hampered by the experimental difficulty of measuring Ca 2 + movements through the different compartments of the cell. A major problem has been to distinguish the relatively small amount of rapidly exchangeable cellular Ca 2 + from the large amount of vascular and interstitial Ca 2 +. We report here a method that overcomes this problem. Rat hearts were labeled by perfusion at 37 degrees C with medium containing 45 Ca 2 +. They were then cooled, and extracellular 45 Ca 2 + was removed by perfusion at 6 degrees C with Ca 2 +-free medium. Cellular 45 Ca 2 + that had been trapped in the hearts by cooling was then released by reperfusion at 37 degrees C with medium containing unlabeled Ca 2 +. The cellular origin of this 45 Ca 2 + was confirmed by using [3 H]sucrose: When hearts were also labeled with [3 H]sucrose, very little [3 H]-sucrose was released with the 45 Ca 2 + peak. The amount of exchangeable cellular Ca 2 + in hearts labeled for 5 min was 125 +/- 13 nmol/g of wet weight. The half-time for its release was less than 1 min. This cellular Ca 2 + contained at least two pools: a rapidly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> that required extracellular Ca 2 + for release (pool A, 38 % of total), and a more slowly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> that did not (pool B, 62 % of total).

In the course of priming eects large amounts of C, N and other nutrients can be released or immobilized in soil {{in a very short}} time. These eects have been measured in many field and laboratory experiments; however, {{only a few of the}} studies were aimed at an extended investigation of the mechanisms of such phenomena. The aim of this overview is to reveal possible causes and processes leading to priming actions using the references on agricultural ecosystems and model experiments. Multiple mechanisms and sources of released C and N are presented and summarized in Tables for positive and negative real and apparent priming eects induced after the addition of dierent organic and mineral substances to the soil. Soil microbial biomass plays the key role in the processes leading to the real priming eects. The most important mechanisms for the real priming eects are the acceleration or retardation of soil organic matter turnover due to increased activity or amount of microbial biomass. Isotopic <b>exchange,</b> <b>pool</b> substitution, and dierent uncontrolled losses of mineralized N from the soil are responsible for the apparent N priming eects. Other multiple mechanisms (predation, competition for nutrients between roots and microorganisms, preferred uptake, inhibition, etc.) in response to addition of dierent substances are also discussed.

40|$|A quasi-optimal {{technique}} ('quasi' in {{that the}} technique discards unreasonable optimums), realized by a dynamically evolving mixed integer program, is used to develop regional electric power maintenance and production schedules for a two to five year planning horizon. This sophisticated, yet computationally feasible, method is used to develop the bulk dispatch schedules required to meet electric power demands at a given reliability level while controlling the associated dollar costs and environmental impacts. The electric power system considered is a power <b>exchange</b> <b>pool</b> of closely coupled generation facilities supplying a region approximately the size of New England. Associated with a tradeoff between a given cost of production and the relevant ecological factors, an optimum production schedule is formulated which considers fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, gas turbine and pumped storage generation facilities; power demands, reliabilities, maintenance and nuclear refueling requisites; labor coordination, geographic considerations, as well as various contracts such as interregional power exchanges, interruptible loads, gas contracts and nuclear refueling contracts. A prerequisite of the model was that it be flexible enough {{for use in the}} evaluation of the optimum system performance associated with hypothesized expansion patterns. Another requirement was that the effects of changed scheduling factors could be predicted, and if necessary corrected with a minimum computational effort.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been studies on the {{cardinality}} constrained multi-cycle problems on directed graphs, some of which considered chains co-existing on the same digraph whilst others did not. These studies were inspired by the optimal matching of kidneys known as the Kidney Exchange Problem (KEP). In a KEP, a vertex on the digraph represents a donor-patient pair who are related, though the kidney of the donor is incompatible to the patient. When there are multiple such incompatible pairs in the kidney <b>exchange</b> <b>pool,</b> the kidney of the donor of one incompatible pair {{may in fact be}} compatible to the patient of another incompatible pair. If Donor A’s kidney is suitable for Patient B, and vice versa, then there will be arcs in both directions between Vertex A to Vertex B. Such exchanges form a 2 -cycle. There may also be cycles involving 3 or more vertices. As all exchanges in a kidney exchange cycle must take place simultaneously, (otherwise a donor can drop out from the program once his/her partner has received a kidney from another donor), due to logistic and human resource reasons, {{only a limited number of}} kidney exchanges can occur simultaneously, hence the cardinality of these cycles are constrained. In recent years, kidney exchange programs around the world have altruistic donors in the pool. A sequence of exchanges that starts from an altruistic donor forms a chain instead of a cycle. We therefore have two underlying combinatorial optimization problems: Cardinality Constrained Multi-cycle Problem (CCMcP) and the Cardinality Constrained Cycles and Chains Problem (CCCCP). The objective of the KEP is either to maximize the number of kidney matches, or to maximize a certain weighted function of kidney matches. In a CCMcP, a vertex can be in at most one cycle whereas in a CCCCP, a vertex can be part of (but in no more than) a cycle or a chain. The cardinality of the cycles are constrained in all studies. The cardinality of the chains, however, are considered unconstrained in some studies, constrained but larger than that of cycles, or the same as that of cycles in others. Although the CCMcP has some similarities to the ATSP- and VRP-family of problems, there is a major difference: strong subtour elimination constraints are mostly invalid for the CCMcP, as we do allow smaller subtours as long as they do not exceed the size limit. The CCCCP has its distinctive feature that allows chains as well as cycles on the same directed graph. Hence, both the CCMcP and the CCCCP are interesting and challenging combinatorial optimization problems in their own rights. Most existing studies focused on solution methodologies, and as far as we aware, there is no polyhedral studies so far. In this paper, we will study the polyhedral structure of the natural arc-based integer programming models of the CCMcP and the CCCCP, both containing exponentially many constraints. We do so to pave the way for studying strong valid cuts we have found that can be applied in a Lagrangean relaxation-based branch-and-bound framework where at each node of the branch-and-bound tree, we may be able to obtain a relaxation that can be solved in polynomial time, with strong valid cuts dualized into the objective function and the dual multipliers optimised by subgradient optimisation...|$|E

If 3 -way cycles are also allowed we find regimes in which waiting for a short period also increases the number of matches considerably. Finally, a significant increase of matches can be obtained by using even one non-simultaneous chain while still matching in an online fashion.

For the purpose of describing physiological and morphological changes during development, developing embryos of both species were grouped into 5 stages that were timed under standard conditions in the laboratory; Stage (1) Cleavage to Blastula, (2) Gastrula, (3) Eyespot & chromatophores, (4) Yolk in 4 lobes and (5) Yolk in 2 lobes. The total incubation periods of embryos from spawning to hatching of H. edwardsii and H. crenulatus were 62. 0 ± 3. 1 and 43. 0 ± 1. 8 days respectively at a constant temperature of 15 °C. Embryos of H. edwardsii (20 nL stage 1 to 35 nL stage 5) are larger than the embryos of H. crenulatus (7 nL to 18 nL). Ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of two distinct egg membranes in these embryos. Silver staining demonstrated a distinct patch {{on the surface of}} the embryos of both species, presumably corresponding to an area of high chloride permeability. This structure appeared at the gastrula stage and was present throughout the embryonic development until hatching when it disappeared. It is suggested that this structure corresponds to the "embryonic dorsal organ" and plays a role in either the uptake or excretion of salts. Salinity tolerance experiments revealed that the postgastrula stage embryos of both species are remarkably tolerant of periods of dilution, even down to 1 % seawater, for many hours and that they hyperosmoregulate throughout development. Pre gastrula embryos (stage 1) were nearly isosmotic in all salinities and were less tolerant of hyposaline exposure. Normal development and successful hatching occurred in 50 % seawater for both species provided the exposure commenced after gastrulation. Thus, the gastrula stage appears to be the critical stage when the capacity to osmoregulate commences. The four cations Na+, K+, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + (and associated anions) were major osmotic effectors in the embryos of H. crenulatus but contributed only about half of the total osmolality. Na+ and K+ were the main cations in these embryos. The average concentrations of all four cations were better regulated than was total osmolality indicating the involvement of other osmolytes in osmoregulation. Na+/K+ ATPase activity was undetectable in stage 1 embryos but rose steadily between gastrulation and hatching. A relatively larger increase in the activity of this ion transport enzyme at the Yolk in 4 lobe stage in embryos incubated in 50 % seawater supports its involvement in osmoregulation. Tritiated water and 22 Na efflux data indicated that relative to the size of the embryos, the egg membranes of H. crenulatus are very permeable to water and ions throughout development. There were two components of water and sodium exchange with the seawater in all embryos; a rapidly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> and a slowly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool.</b> This rapidly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> may represent the external embryonic membranes and compartments while the slowly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> is thought to represent the embryo/yolk. Half times for turnover of embryonic (slow pool) water and sodium ranged from 0. 25 to 1. 25 h and 1 to 6 h respectively, throughout development. As the embryos maintain a hyperosmotic state for much longer times than these they must be actively hyperosmoregulating. That is they must be in a dynamic steady state involving the active uptake of salts and excretion of osmotically entering water. Oxygen consumption rates of both H. edwardsii and H. crenulatus increased during development and the rate increase was greater at the end of the incubation period. Rates of oxygen consumption of embryos in acute exposure to dilute seawater varied with salinity and exposure time for all developmental stages. There was a significant increase in the total metabolic cost of development, in terms of oxygen consumed, for embryos developing in 50 % seawater compared with development in normal seawater. This could be attributed primarily to an extended development time rather than an increased metabolic rate at any stage...|$|R

40|$|Calcium is an {{essential}} if not normally a limiting base cation nutrient in forest ecosystems. The increase in acid deposition (acid rain) in modern times has caused concern about long term leaching of the base cation <b>exchange</b> <b>pool</b> in soils, potentially causing serious damage across northern forests (Likens et al. 1996). Strontium, also an alkaline earth element, is present in trace amounts in rocks and soils. It {{is thought to be}} incorporated into plant tissues similarly to calcium because of its ionic size and charge (Ash-Dasch et al. 2006). Strontium forms four stable isotopes in nature 84 Sr, 86 Sr, 87 Sr, and 88 Sr (webelements. com). Of these isotopes of strontium, only 87 Sr varies due to radioactive decay of naturally occurring 87 Rb (Ash-Dasch et al. 2006). Because of this decay different terrestrial geochemical reservoirs develop unique ratios of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr over time. Because calcium and strontium are assumed to have similar geochemical behaviors, the ratio of calcium to strontium (Ca/Sr) and the ratio between the isotopes of 87 Sr and 86 Sr has commonly been used to trace the sources of calcium in forest ecosystems (Ash-Dasch 2006; Blum et a. 2000). Previous work in this field has established that the uptake rates of Ca and Sr vary between plant species (Ash-Dasch et al. 2006). Correctly interpreting Ca/Sr and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data in order to trace calcium requires understanding the extent to which species discriminate between calcium and strontium during uptake. The discrimination factor (DF) between Ca and Sr can be estimated and applied to nutrient flow studies of calcium through different ecosystems. This study examines ten years of chemical data from several tree species in Ca-depleted forested watershed. Data came from a whole watershed calcium addition experiment in the Hubbard Brook Experimental-Forest, NH (Peters et al. 2004). The experiment was begun in October of 1999 and sample collection is ongoing. Results for data from 1999 - 2004 were published in Ash-Dash et al. 2006. Here, I will be updating the data set and calculating discrimination factors after including new data from 2004 through 2008. Following our calculations, a DF greater than 1 indicates a plant’s preference for calcium over strontium, and a DF less than one indicates a preference for strontium over calcium. Widespread calcium depletion has been documented across northeastern North America, including the watershed studied here. The depletion is due to increased acid deposition (Likens et a. 1998). The consequences of calcium depletion on northern forests are only partly understood. At the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest unexpected declines in biomass accumulation have been observed since the late 1980 ’s, which may relate to increased acid deposition and subsequent leaching of calcium from the nutrient pool (Likens et al. 1996). While some research (focused on global sulfur and nitrogen cycles) on acid rain has indicated that the effects of acid rain on forest nutrient cycles would be limited, there is evidence that the effects of changes in calcium cation pools on forest health could be much stronger(Likens et al. 1996). Spruce (Picea spp.) trees are particularly vulnerable to calcium deficiencies in the form of increased freezing injuries in low Ca environments (DeHayes 1999). The vulnerability of forests to calcium depletion and the damage already done tothem by acid rain are reasons why being able to trace ecological sources of calcium could aid in long term forest preservation and help inform environmental policy. Adding calcium to an entire watershed (whole-watershed addition) allows for observations to be made about many aspects of calcium’s role in ecosystem health, and how this nutrient cycles through the ecosystem (Peters et a. 2004). The ratio of calcium to trace amounts strontium, and the isotopic ratio of 87 Sr to 86 Sr in the source calcium added to the ecosystem {{can be used as a}} chemical marker to follow the added calcium as it flows through the ecosystem. In tracing that marker, observations can be made about relative uptake rates and absorption of calcium and strontium by various plant species. Because of divergent calcium chemistry between plants, characteristic preferences for calcium vs. strontium can then be applied to more reliably trace calcium sources over time in ecosystems...|$|E

One {{way to increase}} matching opportunities for patients is by waiting for many incompatible pairs to join the pool. We analyze an algorithm that periodically finds allocations and study how the period length, {{as well as the}} technology, affects the number of matched patients. We find that if only 2 -way cycles are conducted, matching online (as a new pair arrives) results in almost the same number of matches as the algorithm finds when the period length is “short”. However, if 3 -way cycles are also allowed, we find regimes in which waiting for a short period considerably increases the number of matches that the algorithm finds. Finally, we show that when matching online, by allowing just a single non-simultaneous chain the number of matches will increase significantly. Our theoretical findings are supported by data-driven computational experiments. ...|$|R

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{belongs to the}} myosin superfamily. Myosins are {{molecular}} motors that, upon interaction with actin filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical force. Each myosin has a conserved N-terminal motor domain that contains both ATP-binding and actin-binding sequences. Following the motor domain is a light-chain-binding 'neck' region containing 1-6 copies of a repeat element, the IQ motif, {{that serves as a}} binding site for calmodulin or other members of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. At the C-terminus, each myosin class has a distinct tail domain that serves in dimerization, membrane binding, protein binding, and/or enzymatic activities and targets each myosin to its particular subcellular location. The myosin-1a protein is expressed by enterocytes, the epithelial cells that line the luminal surface of the small intestine. In these cells the myosin-1a protein localizes specifically to the brush border. Experiments indicate that the brush border population of the encoded protein turns over rapidly, while its head and tail domains interact transiently with the core actin and plasma membrane, respectively. A rapidly <b>exchanging</b> <b>pool</b> of the myosin-1a protein binds to the actin core bundle, which turns over on a much slower timescale.|$|R
