2500|$|Many {{kinematic}} linkages, such as {{the well}} known [...] "Ross yoke", will exhibit near-sinusoidal motion. [...] However, other linkages, {{such as the}} [...] "rhombic drive", will exhibit more non-sinusoidal motion. [...] To a lesser extent, the ideal cycle introduces complications, since it would require somewhat higher piston acceleration and higher viscous pumping losses of the working fluid. [...] The material stresses and pumping losses in an optimized engine, however, would only be intolerable when approaching the [...] "ideal cycle" [...] and/or at <b>high</b> <b>cycle</b> rates. Other issues include the time required for heat transfer, particularly for the isothermal processes.

40|$|AbstractFatigue {{strength}} curves {{that are}} established from fatigue tests {{provide a basis}} for the fatigue assessment applying nominal stress approach. In the codes valid for steel structures, like the EC 3, the fatigue strength curves for constant amplitude loading have a knee point in the transition region. The fatigue strength curve beyond this knee point is commonly assumed to be a horizontal asymptote. However, the behaviour of the fatigue strength curve in the area of very <b>high</b> <b>cycles</b> and more importantly the existence of an endurance limit are much discussed. In the case of welded joints the experimental data beyond 107 load cycles is limited due to the possibilities in testing. Testing techniques with high frequencies are necessary to obtain experimental data with very <b>high</b> <b>cycles</b> in a reasonable period of time. In this scope a testing device with approximately 390 Hz operates by alternating current magnets and using resonance amplification, which was developed by a third party.
