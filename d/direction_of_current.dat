25|$|The 3D {{orientation}} of the clasts is called {{the fabric of the}} rock. Between the clasts, the rock can be composed of a matrix (a cement) that consists of crystals of one or more precipitated minerals. The size and form of clasts can be used to determine the velocity and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> in the sedimentary environment that moved the clasts from their origin; fine, calcareous mud only settles in quiet water while gravel and larger clasts are moved only by rapidly moving water. The grain size of a rock is usually expressed with the Wentworth scale, though alternative scales are sometimes used. The grain size can be expressed as a diameter or a volume, and is always an average value– a rock is composed of clasts with different sizes. The statistical distribution of grain sizes is different for different rock types and is described in a property called the sorting of the rock. When all clasts are more or less of the same size, the rock is called 'well-sorted', and when there is a large spread in grain size, the rock is called 'poorly sorted'.|$|E

500|$|The {{required}} <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> {{depended on}} {{the direction in which}} electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. [...] For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed {{to be in the same}} direction. [...] For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the positive electrode would be applied to the extremity. [...] This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. [...] A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. [...] The electromagnetic galvanometer was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. [...] In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. [...] Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. [...] Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. [...] In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. [...] In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head from ear to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. [...] The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.|$|E

2500|$|The {{negative}} sign of [...] arises to {{make the}} output current of one cascaded stage (as it appears in the matrix) equal to the input current of the next. [...] Without the minus sign the two currents would have opposite senses because the positive <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current,</b> by convention, is taken as the current entering the port. [...] Consequently, the input voltage/current matrix vector can be directly replaced with the matrix equation of the preceding cascaded stage to form a combined [...] matrix.|$|E
2500|$|In a line-commutated converter, the DC current {{does not}} change direction; it flows through a large {{inductance}} and can be considered almost constant. [...] On the AC side, the converter behaves approximately as a current source, injecting both grid-frequency and harmonic currents into the AC network. [...] For this reason, a line-commutated converter for HVDC is also considered as a current-source converter. [...] Because the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> cannot be varied, reversal of the direction of power flow (where required) is achieved by reversing the polarity of DC voltage at both stations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{rectifier}} is {{an electrical}} device that converts alternating current (AC), which periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows {{in only one}} direction.

[...] On the other hand, inside a bipolar transistor, currents can be composed of both positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons. [...] In this article, current arrows are shown in the conventional direction, but labels for the movement of holes and electrons show their actual direction inside the transistor.

2500|$|The HP {{device is}} {{composed}} of a thin (50 nm) titanium dioxide film between two 5nm thick electrodes, one titanium, the other platinum. Initially, there are two layers to the titanium dioxide film, one of which has a slight depletion of oxygen atoms. The oxygen vacancies act as charge carriers, meaning that the depleted layer has a much lower resistance than the non-depleted layer. When an electric field is applied, the oxygen vacancies drift (see Fast ion conductor), changing {{the boundary between the}} high-resistance and low-resistance layers. Thus the resistance of the film as a whole is dependent on how much charge has been passed through it in a particular direction, which is reversible by changing the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current.</b> [...] Since the HP device displays fast ion conduction at nanoscale, it is considered a nanoionic device.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>current</b> used in {{arc welding}} also plays an {{important}} role in welding. [...] Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. [...] In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration (around 60%) and, as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. [...] If the electrode is positively charged, it will melt more quickly, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. [...] Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Non-consumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current (DC), as well as alternating current (AC). [...] With direct current however, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. [...] Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. [...] One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, eliminating low-voltage time after the zero crossings and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
