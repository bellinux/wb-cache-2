5|$|Under colonial rule, {{plantations}} {{were established}} {{for the production of}} a variety of export crops. Slavery was abolished in 1896 and approximately 500,000 slaves were freed; many remained in their former masters' homes as servants or as sharecroppers; {{in many parts of the}} island strong discriminatory views against slave descendants are still <b>held</b> <b>today.</b> Wide paved boulevards and gathering places were constructed in the capital city of Antananarivo and the Rova palace compound was turned into a museum. Additional schools were built, particularly in rural and coastal areas where the schools of the Merina had not reached. Education became mandatory between the ages of 6 to 13 and focused primarily on French language and practical skills.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, the {{discovery}} of Pluto's moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto's mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small {{to account for the}} discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from Voyager 2s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto's discovery that this was a coincidence, a view still <b>held</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Unitarianism, Joseph Priestley {{suggested}} that the passages refer to Korah. William Graham (1772) {{suggested that}} it referred to the spies in Canaan.

25|$|From 1405 to 1738 the Isle of Man was {{controlled}} by the Stanley family, beginning with Sir John Stanley, who was given the title of King of Mann by Henry IV of England in 1405.

25|$|However, another view, {{probably}} the most widely <b>held</b> <b>today,</b> is that the migrants were relatively few, centred on a warrior elite. They then dominated a process of acculturation to their own language and material culture. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land-use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry {{of the people of}} Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies tend to support this prediction.|$|E
25|$|After {{settling}} in England, Equiano decided {{to marry and}} have a family. On 7 April 1792, he married Susannah Cullen, a local woman, in St Andrew's Church in Soham, Cambridgeshire. The original marriage register containing the entry for Vassa and Cullen is <b>held</b> <b>today</b> by the Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office in Cambridge. He included his marriage in every edition of his autobiography from 1792 onwards. Critics have suggested he believed that his marriage symbolised an expected commercial union between Africa and Great Britain. The couple settled {{in the area and}} had two daughters, Anna Maria (1793–1797) and Joanna (1795–1857).|$|E
25|$|Shelley {{promoted}} Keats {{as someone}} whose achievement {{could not be}} separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly <b>held</b> <b>today.</b> The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still <b>held</b> <b>today,</b> that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker has time to recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E
500|$|Strang {{rested his}} claim to {{leadership}} on an ordination by an angel {{at the very moment}} Joseph Smith died (similar to the ordination of Smith), requirements set forth in Doctrine and Covenant that the President had to be appointed by revelation and ordained by angels, and a [...] "Letter of Appointment" [...] allegedly from Smith, carrying a legitimate Nauvoo postmark and dated June 18, 1844, just nine days before Smith's murder. Smith and Strang were some 225miles (362km) apart at the time, and Strang offered witnesses to affirm that he had made his announcement before news of Smith's demise was publicly available. [...] Strang's letter is <b>held</b> <b>today</b> by Yale University. Every aspect of the letter has been disputed, including the postmark and the signature [...] One disaffected member of Strang's church implicated Strang and his law partner in fabricating his Letter of Appointment and the Voree Plates, though no proof of this was ever produced.|$|E
