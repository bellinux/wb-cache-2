5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's <b>green</b> <b>areas,</b> and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance of Bob Donnelly. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success. Davis authorized the project, and Delsener entered discussions with cable TV channel HBO to decide who would perform.|$|E

40|$|Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) is a stoloniferous and rhizomatous {{prostrate}} weed displaying high {{growth rates}} under non-limiting conditions. Radiation {{has been considered}} the major factor affecting C. dactylon patch extension and biomass growth, but {{little is known about}} the influence of water availability on those processes. C. dactylon <b>green</b> <b>area</b> and biomass growth were analysed in response to different soil water conditions. Four experiments comprising eight drought treatments were carried out during 2 years at different dates, to generate a wide range of soil water and evaporative demand conditions. Significant reductions in weed <b>green</b> <b>area</b> and biomass growth were found between treatments when low soil water conditions were imposed. Reductions in <b>green</b> <b>area</b> were of greater magnitude than reductions in biomass, suggesting a higher effect of drought on <b>green</b> <b>area</b> increment. There were significant (P < 0. 05) relationships between <b>green</b> <b>area</b> increment and cumulative incident radiation, although slopes [relative <b>green</b> <b>area</b> growth rates (RGAGR) ] differed among treatments. A strong logistic relationship was found between RGAGR and the ratio of plant-available soil water to potential evapotranspiration. The approach and parameters generated in this work can be used to predict C. dactylon growth changes under rain-fed conditions. Postprint (published version...|$|R

The supporters of a continuous <b>green</b> <b>area</b> were lucky that the municipality of Midden-Delfland became a reality: the cities of Delft, Vlaardingen and Schiedam wanted to build new houses here, and the Westland gardeners also wanted to expand. Now, Midden-Delfland is designated as a recreation area for people from the surrounding cities.|$|R
40|$|Sustainable urban {{development}} is a challenge that requires handling of different goals and conflicts, such as between a dense urban structure on one hand, {{and the need for}} ecosystem services on the other. The <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Ratio is a type of planning tool used to ensure a certain amount of vegetation and water in the built environment. The purpose of this report is to provide a knowledge basis to integrate ecosystem services in spatial planning. The goal is to provide an overview of the use of The <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Ratio in Sweden as well as the experience gained. The <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Ratio is used in at least 15 municipalities. There is currently no systematic evaluation of how the <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Ratio contributes to ecosystem services. Even if it might change the rules in planning, it is not obvious that this leads to a satisfactory built environment. The <b>Green</b> <b>Area</b> Ratio is a general type of planning tool and it therefore lacks an adoption to the site-specific needs of ecosystem services...|$|R
