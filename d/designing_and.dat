40|$|Abstract. Axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> <b>design</b> {{structure}} matrix (DSM) are two popular design methods at the moment, {{while most}} related researches only apply the basic ideas of axiomatic design or DSM to some cases. This paper first analyses the disadvantages of both axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. After deep investigations, the paper then puts forward {{that there are}} strong complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM. Based on the complementarities between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM, it is proposed that axiomatic design’s design matrix (DM) can be transformed into corresponding DSM for structural evaluation. In this way, axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM can benefit from each other. The logic of integration between axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM is interpreted in this paper. A computer aided conceptual design system has been developed to enable the integration of axiomatic <b>design</b> <b>and</b> DSM...|$|R
