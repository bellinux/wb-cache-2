She gives 140,00 pesos yearly in prizes for nationwide beautification contests. She set aside 150,000 pesos for an open-air museum in St. Ana Church <b>diggings.</b> For the restoration of the Intramuros gates, Imelda was given PHP 150,000 by the government.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board Gothenburg tried {{to cling to}} the rigging, but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold <b>diggings</b> were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{there was}} a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave <b>diggings</b> to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, {{the first to be}} officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{surveyed}} {{and described}} by R.G. Collingwood in his Archaeology of Roman Britain, 1930, where {{he noted the}} fort's uniquely skewed shape and extraordinary set of defensive ramparts on the western, uphill side. Pottery excavated in the 1950s suggested that the fort was constructed in 122 AD, {{at the same time}} as Hadrian's Wall. A survey in 2007–8 by English Heritage showed a large Roman civilian settlement or vicus to the north and west of the fort. Artefacts found include coins, pottery, glass, objects made of jet, and inscribed stones. In 2012, the University of Durham carried out a geophysics survey as part of an English Heritage project. In the absence of a full excavation, archaeologists have exploited the <b>diggings</b> of moles to uncover Roman artefacts by sifting earth thrown up by the animals in their molehills. Finds include fragments of terra sigillata (Samian ware, Roman table pottery); rim fragments of serving bowls and earthenware pots; a bead made of jet; some iron nails; and a bronze dolphin from the bath house, most likely the handle of an instrument like a strigil or razor.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} in the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Transylvania, with frequent stakings and grave <b>diggings</b> taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires.

Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood. In the second case, Arnold Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Damage to {{the ruins}} {{has taken place}} {{throughout}} the last century. The removal of gold and artefacts in amateurist <b>diggings</b> by early colonial antiquarians caused widespread damage, notably <b>diggings</b> by Richard Nicklin Hall. More extensive damage {{was caused by the}} mining of some of the ruins for gold. Reconstruction attempts since 1980 caused further damage, leading to alienation of the local communities from the site.|$|E

25|$|The first diamond discoveries between 1866 and 1867 were alluvial, on the {{southern}} banks of the Orange River. By 1869, diamonds were found at some distance from any stream or river, in hard rock called blue ground, later called kimberlite, after the mining town of Kimberley where the diamond <b>diggings</b> were concentrated. The <b>diggings</b> were located {{in an area of}} vague boundaries and disputed land ownership. Claimants to the site included the South African (Transvaal) Republic, the Orange Free State Republic, and the mixed-race Griqua nation under Nicolaas Waterboer. Cape Colony Governor Sir Henry Barkly persuaded all claimants to submit themselves to a decision of an arbitrator and so Robert W Keate, Lieutenant-Governor of Natal was asked to arbitrate. Keate awarded ownership to the Griquas. Waterboer, fearing conflict with the Boer republic of Orange Free State, subsequently asked for and received British protection. Griqualand then became a separate Crown Colony renamed Griqualand West in 1871, with a Lieutenant-General and legislative council.|$|E

25|$|It {{would be}} a journey worthy of its own chapter of sternwheeler history and a fitting swan song for the pioneer steamer because, {{although}} {{it was an amazing}} accomplishment, it was made too late.

25|$|Hussein's {{support for}} Netanyahu soon backfired. Israel's actions during the 1996 Qana {{massacre}} in Southern Lebanon, the Likud government's decision to build settlements in East Jerusalem, {{and the events}} at the Temple Mount where clashes between Palestinian and Israeli police ensued after Israeli tunnel <b>diggings</b> around the Mount, generated an uproar of criticism for Netanyahu in the Arab World. On 9March 1997 Hussein sent Netanyahu a three-page letter expressing his disappointment.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in Central Otago. Whilst hundreds of kilometres away, {{the northern edge of}} modern-day Calton Hill was a short stretch of the primary goldrush highway. Thousands of people began trekking past with their swags following the Caversham Valley as the only road south to the <b>diggings</b> of the Central Otago Gold Rush. John Sidey would supply the miners with meat from his farm and other carted supplies.|$|E
25|$|The gold rushes brought many {{immigrants}} to Australia from the British Isles, continental Europe, North America and China. The Colony of Victoria's population grew rapidly, from 76,000 in 1850 to 530,000 by 1859. Discontent arose amongst diggers almost immediately, {{particularly on the}} crowded Victorian fields. The causes of this were the colonial government's administration of the <b>diggings</b> and the gold licence system. Following a number of protests and petitions for reform, violence erupted at Ballarat in late 1854.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{material}} culture artifacts {{found in the}} region {{date back to the}} Neolithic Age. On the other hand, Azerbaijani archaeologists have found that the history of Nakhchivan dates back to the Stone Age (Palaeolithic Age). As a result of archaeological <b>diggings,</b> archaeologists discovered a great number of materials, which belong to the Stone Age, in different corners of Nakhchivan, particularly in Gazma Cave (Sharur District). Additionally, these materials were useful to study the Paleolithic age in Azerbaijan.|$|E
25|$|The {{life of a}} miner in {{the mother}} lode of California might have been {{somewhat}} of a shock to Fairfax, who grew up as a gentleman farmer, but he stuck with the endeavor for a while. He prospected extensively, only to lose whatever money he made {{as fast as he}} got hold of it. There were stories of him working for others, pushing a wheelbarrow, or tending a mule pulling a cart of gravel and sloshing about in the mud of the <b>diggings.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Rocha Peixoto, in 1909, some rocks of the citadel {{had been used to}} pave some streets in Póvoa de Varzim, notably Rua Santos Minho Street and Rua das Hortas. Occasionally, groups of scouts of the Portuguese Youth and others in the decades of the 1950s and 1960s, made <b>diggings</b> in search for {{archaeology}} pieces. This was seen as archaeological vandalism but continued even after the Cividade was listed as a property of Public Interest in 1961.|$|E
25|$|The Mansfield {{group was}} led by Sergeant Michael Kennedy, with three policemen; Constables Thomas McIntyre, Thomas Lonigan, and Michael Scanlon. They set up a camp at an {{abandoned}} <b>diggings</b> at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area. Kennedy and Scanlan went searching for the Kellys, while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camp. The Kellys {{were living in a}} hut close by at Bullock Creek. They heard gunfire and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses.|$|E
25|$|Between 1356 and 1383, king Charles V {{built a new}} wall of fortifications {{around the}} city: an {{important}} portion of this wall discovered during archaeological <b>diggings</b> in 1991-1992 can be seen within the Louvre complex, under the Place du Carrousel. He also built the Bastille, a large fortress guarding the Porte Saint-Antoine at {{the eastern end of}} Paris, and an imposing new fortress at Vincennes, east of city. Charles V moved his official residence from the Île de la Cité to the Louvre, but preferred to live in the Hôtel Saint-Pol, his beloved residence.|$|E
25|$|The early 1850s saw {{the return}} of many miners from the gold <b>diggings</b> to Prahran, {{resulting}} in increased development and the gazetting as a municipality in 1855. The population of Prahran {{at the time of}} the first council elections was about 8,000. Meanwhile, Government land sales within the area bounded by Kooyong Road, Gardiners Creek and Wattletree Road were held in 1854 and a small settlement grew around Malvern and Glenferrie Roads. The area known as Gardiner (later Malvern) was proclaimed a Roads Board District in 1856 and became a municipality in 1871, taking the name Malvern in 1878.|$|E
25|$|By 1888 Buchanan {{was moving}} cattle off Wave Hill and to another holding, Sturt's Creek Station, {{where he was}} {{fattening}} the cattle for butchering on-site. This was providing prime fresh beef, at 6d per pound, to {{the men at the}} nearby gold <b>diggings</b> and at the port at Wyndham. The station manager in 1891 was Sam Johnston also known as Greenhide Sam who was described as as thorough a bushman as can be found in all of Australia. It was Johnston that also provided the name of the station when he suggested it after being struck by the sharp undulations of the plateau.|$|E
25|$|Yea {{expanded}} {{under the}} influx of hopeful prospectors, both as a natural overnight stopping place on the route from Melbourne to other goldfields, but especially when gold was discovered in the local area in the late 1850s. The gold-mining localities near Yea included the 'Providence' <b>diggings</b> just across the Yea River from the town, in the Ghin Ghin area, the Ti Tree Creek, and the 'Higinbotham' area on the Murrindindi Creek. None except the Providence and Ti Tree Creek yielded profitable gold on any commercial scale for more than about 5 years, the Providence was effectively closed by 1889 and the Welcome mine on Ti Tree Creek by the mid 1890s.|$|E
25|$|The tall ancient manna gum forests near Whitefriars College {{are home}} to ducks (who nest {{on the tops of}} old stags) crimson rosellas, galahs and other parrots (who nest in old hollows), rare large {{powerful}} owls and rainbow lorikeets.

There are signs of wombat <b>diggings</b> on the hill face but they are rarely seen. The occasional swamp wallaby and eastern grey kangaroo visit the gorge. In warm weather skinks, blue tongue lizards and copperhead snakes can be seen. Other rarely seen species include marbled geckos and white-lipped snakes.|$|E
25|$|Jarvis {{was visited}} by {{scientists}} during the International Geophysical Year from July 1957 until November 1958. In January 1958 all scattered building ruins {{from both the}} nineteenth century guano <b>diggings</b> and the 1935–1942 colonization attempt were swept away without a trace by a severe storm which lasted several days and was witnessed by the scientists. When the IGY research project ended the island was abandoned again. By the early 1960s a few sheds, a century of accumulated trash, the scientists' house from the late 1950s and a solid, short lighthouse-like day beacon built two decades before were the only signs of human habitation on Jarvis.|$|E
25|$|Restieaux left England in the Barque Cromwell {{soon after}} the Chartist Riots in London and arrived in South Australia in August 1848 or 1849. He worked on sheep {{stations}} and engaged in exploration for gold in South Australia and Victoria. At one time he spent {{two weeks in the}} company of 3 bushrangers, who were on the run from the police after a robbery of gold. It is possible that this was the party of bushrangers, led by John Francis, who held up the Private Escort Company's regular escort of gold from the McIvor <b>diggings</b> at Heathcote and Kyneton on the morning of 20 July 1853.|$|E
25|$|The first gold {{discovered}} in Montana was at Gold Creek near present-day Garrison in 1852. A series of major mining discoveries {{in the western}} third of the state starting in 1862 found gold, silver, copper, lead, coal (and later oil) that attracted {{tens of thousands of}} miners to the area. The richest of all gold placer <b>diggings</b> was discovered at Alder Gulch, where the town of Virginia City was established. Other rich placer deposits were found at Last Chance Gulch, where the city of Helena now stands, Confederate Gulch, Silver Bow, Emigrant Gulch, and Cooke City. Gold output from 1862 through 1876 reached $144 million; silver then became even more important. The largest mining operations were in the city of Butte, which had important silver deposits and gigantic copper deposits.|$|E
25|$|By the 1870s and 1880s {{the mines}} at Kimberley were {{producing}} 95% of the world's diamonds. The widening search for gold {{and other resources}} were financed by the wealth produced and the practical experience gained at Kimberley. Revenue accruing to the Cape Colony from the Kimberley diamond <b>diggings</b> enabled the Cape Colony to be granted responsible government status in 1872, since {{it was no longer}} dependent on the British Treasury and hence allowing it to be fully self-governing in similar fashion to the federation of Canada, New Zealand and some of the Australian states. The wealth derived from Kimberley diamond mining, having effectively tripled the customs revenue of the Cape Colony from 1871 to 1875, also doubled its population, and allowed it to expand its boundaries and railways to the north.|$|E
25|$|Hell Hole Dam was {{partially}} completed {{at the time}} of extremely heavy storms in December 1964. The D/S rockfill portion was up ~220' above the river bottom, but the impervious core and adj zones were only up ~35'. Debris from extreme storm runoff U/S from the dam blocked the diversion outlet and water rapidly accumulated behind the partially constructed dam. As the water came up it was seeping thru the rockfill-and when it crested the entire mass collapsed in a matter of minutes. A surge went down the canyon-washing out 2 older suspension bridges below the Long Canyon influx and at the Spanish Dry <b>Diggings</b> crossing near Greenwood. It then washed out the State Highway 49 bridge over the American River just below Auburn. Folsom Dam reservoir absorbed the surge below that point.|$|E
25|$|One {{thing the}} two groups did agree on was {{that they wanted to}} {{discourage}} any more miners from coming up the following year. Though obliged to report their earnings, they all intended to report that the <b>diggings</b> were not very good and that more should be known of the country before any discoveries were reported. With the exception of Patrick Kelly and Vital LaForce, who stayed at Fort St. James, the other miners all returned to Quesnel with the news that the venture had only been marginally successful. However, suspicions were raised when the men announced they were returning to Vital Creek for the winter and even more eyebrows were raised when it was discovered that LaForce and Kelly had spent an astounding $2500 at the Fort St. James trading post.|$|E
25|$|Each {{barangay}} in Valenzuela {{have their}} own feast. Most of them launch celebrations during May and April to honor patron saints and bounty harvest. Every April 26, a santacruzan is performed along with Sta. Cruz Festival in Barangay Isla. A santacruzan is a novena procession commemorating St. Helena's mythical finding of the cross. St. Helena {{was the mother of}} Constantine the Great. According to legends, 300 years after the death of Christ, at the age of 75, she went to Calvary to conduct a search for the Cross. After some archeological <b>diggings</b> {{at the site of the}} Crucifixion, she unearthed three crosses. She tested each one by making a sick servant lie on all three. The cross where the servant recovered was identified as Christ's. St. Helena's feast day falls on August 8 but the anniversary of the finding of the Cross is on May 3, in the Philippines, this celebration took the form of the Mexican Santa Cruz de Mayo.|$|E
25|$|About an {{hour later}} the British {{trenches}} had been occupied and a mine gallery was discovered off a blind sap (a trench with a dead-end) with 16 British troops inside behind a barricade; the British surrendered once they had been discovered. The Germans had great difficulty consolidating their new positions, in the dark, under artillery-fire and counter-attack and in the 8th Company area, the troops formed a human chain to pass hand-grenades forward. As dawn broke the new positions had been dug down to head height but linking the new <b>diggings</b> to the lips of craters was done with great difficulty because the explosions had thrown {{a great deal of}} earth onto the crater edges and British troops were throwing grenades into the craters. Communication trenches were too shallow and soldiers had to crawl along them once dawn had broken and many were hit by bullets. The captured trenches had much British equipment in them which was used by the Germans to repulse counter-attacks.|$|E
25|$|On 2 January, Nivelle {{instructed}} the Aéronautique Militaire to co-operate with the British to investigate German defensive systems that spies and repatriated civilians had reported. Not until 26 January, did a British intelligence summary report {{a new line}} of defence between Arras and Laon. In February, attempts to send more aircraft to reconnoitre the line were hampered by mist, snow, rain, low cloud and an extremely determined German air defence. British air reconnaissance discovered <b>diggings</b> between Drocourt and Vitry en Artois at the end of January and on 15 February, found a line between Quéant and Etaing. The British were able to trace the new line (named the Drocourt–Quéant Switch) south to Bellicourt on 15 February and St Quentin on 25 February, the day after the first German withdrawal on the Ancre. British aircraft losses on these flights were severe due to the presence of Jagdstaffel 11 (the Richthofen Circus) near Douai; six British reconnaissance aircraft were shot down on 15 April, along with two escorts.|$|E
