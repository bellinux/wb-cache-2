5|$|In {{his last}} years Evans {{compiled}} a list, since lost, {{of all his}} inventions—eighty in total, as alluded to {{in the title of}} his last publication to his lawyers. Some of his unfinished ideas that are known include a scheme for the gas lighting of cities in the United States, a means for raising sunken ships, a machine gun, a self-oiling shaft bearing, various types of <b>gearshift</b> for steam carriages, a dough-kneading machine and a perpetual baking oven. In one proposal in 1814, as the British Navy threatened Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812, Evans ventured to build a steam-powered frigate, but the scheme didn't get far.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{applied for}} and {{received}} UN refugee status on September 15, 1999, and {{after several months}} of waiting, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Francis {{to move to the}} U.S. Bok flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13, 1999, and from there he flew to Fargo, North Dakota. His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church, both worked together to provide an apartment for Francis in Fargo and helped him find a job. Bok worked several jobs, making pallets and plastic knobs for the <b>gearshift</b> of cars. He heard of a large population of Dinka in Ames, Iowa, and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo. It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group based in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Evans was {{a visionary}} who {{produced}} designs and ideas {{far ahead of}} their time. He {{was the first to}} describe vapor-compression refrigeration and propose a design for the first refrigerator in 1805, but it would be three decades until his colleague Jacob Perkins would be able to construct a working example. Similarly, he drew up designs for a solar boiler, machine gun, steam-carriage <b>gearshift,</b> dough-kneading machine, perpetual baking oven, marine salvage process, quadruple-effect evaporator, and a scheme for urban gas lighting, ideas and designs which would not be made reality until some time after his death. Evans had influential backers and political allies, but lacked social graces and was disliked by many of his peers. Disappointed and then angry at the perceived lack of recognition for his contributions, Evans became combative and bitter in later years, which damaged his reputation and left him isolated. Despite the importance of his work, his contributions were frequently overlooked (or attributed to others after his death) so he never became a household name alongside the other steam pioneers of his era.|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} {{model of the}} <b>gearshifting</b> mechanism may speed up {{the development of a}} new gearboxes. However, such model should be verified against other models as well as validated against experiments to ensure reasonable accuracy. In this contribution, results from the previous developed mathematical model of a generic synchronizer (<b>gearshifting</b> mechanism) against the model developed at Scania is presented. The mathematical model is based on constrained Lagrangian formalism (CLF) and the generic synchronizer is consist of engaging sleeve, synchronizer ring and the gearwheel with dimensions relevant to that of a heavy truck...|$|R

25|$|Models {{equipped}} with PDK also include an optional 3-spoke steering wheel with <b>gearshift</b> paddles {{as an alternative}} to the standard steering wheel with shift buttons.|$|E
25|$|Japanese-spec {{vehicles}} with the twin turbo {{had a choice}} of manual or semi-automatic transmission called SportShift, that allowed the driver to push the automatic <b>gearshift</b> selector to the left, and then allow the driver to shift the automatic like a manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|The {{controls}} of the Tg500 {{were similar to}} those of the KR200 except for the Tg500's single starting mode for the engine and its H-pattern <b>gearshift</b> with reverse gear and no auxiliary lever. A tachometer was offered as an optional replacement for the clock.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} a novel 2 -speed {{transmission}} system specifically designed for electric axle applications. The design of this transmission permits seamless <b>gearshifts</b> and {{is characterized by a}} simple mechanical layout. The equations governing the overall system dynamics are presented in the paper. The principles of the control system for the seamless <b>gearshifts</b> achievable by the novel transmission prototype - currently under experimental testing at the University of Surrey and on a prototype vehicle - are analytically demonstrated and detailed through advanced simulation tools. The simulation results and sensitivity analyses for the main parameters affecting the overall system dynamics are presented and discussed. © 2011 SAE International...|$|R

25|$|The Caterham is {{the purest}} and most honest street car I've ever driven. Period. No power steering. No power brakes. No drive-by-wire. Just a direct {{connection}} {{between you and the}} contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and <b>gearshift</b> inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic. And I can see exactly what's happening, at least at {{the front end of the}} car, as the wheels turn and judder.|$|E
25|$|The Trabant 1100 (also {{known as}} the P1100) was a 601 with a better-performing 1.05-liter, 45HP VW Polo engine. With a more-modern look (including a {{floor-mounted}} <b>gearshift),</b> it was quieter and cleaner than its predecessor. The 1100 had front disc brakes, and its wheel assembly was borrowed from Volkswagen. It was produced between from 1989 to 1991, in parallel with the two-stroke P601. Except for the engine and transmission, many parts from older P50s, P60s and 601s were compatible with the 1100.|$|E
25|$|The KR175 {{used the}} {{standard}} Kabinenroller steering system, with a steering bar connected {{directly to the}} track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small, measured inputs. The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The <b>gearshift</b> lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|E

40|$|Cytoskeletal motors perform {{critical}} force {{generation and}} transport functions in eukaryotic cells. Engineered modifications of motor function provide direct tests of protein structure-function relationships and potential tools for controlling cellular processes or for harnessing molecular transport in artificial systems. Here, we report {{the design and}} characterization of a panel of cytoskeletal motors that reversibly change gears-speed up, slow down or switch directions-when exposed to blue light. Our genetically encoded structural designs incorporate a photoactive protein domain to enable light-dependent conformational changes in an engineered lever arm. Using in vitro motility assays, we demonstrate robust spatiotemporal control over motor function and characterize the kinetics of the optical <b>gearshifting</b> mechanism. We have used a modular approach to create optical <b>gearshifting</b> motors for both actin-based and microtubule-based transport. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Valiants, {{which were}} {{assembled}} {{and sold in}} Mexico from 1963 through 1976, were essentially the same A-body models as their US counterparts with minor differences. The Mexican Valiant lineup included a unique 2-door hardtop produced from 1967 to 1969 called the Acapulco named after the costal resort city. Based on a V200 Signet, the Acapulco was only sold locally in Latin America. The most notable features included a cobra snakeskin vinyl roof and emblems of Acaplulco in the interior and on the trunk lid. Other features included bucket seats, upgraded interior and remote controlled passenger side mirrors. The car was powered by 2bbl 225 Slant-6 which was being used concurrently in the Australian market; the manual transmission was operated by a four-on-the-floor Hurst <b>gearshift.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pironi had {{opted to}} use a harder rear-left tyre than his rear-right and by lap three he was {{struggling}} with {{the handling of the}} car. In addition, he was having problems with his brakes. A slight mistake allowed Piquet to overtake him for fourth place. Alain Prost, running in 12th place was forced to retire on lap five with engine problems. Both Keke Rosberg and Derek Daly suffered brake failure causing them to crash, neither were hurt. A missed <b>gearshift</b> by Jones on lap 13 saw him drop three places to fifth. Laffite, who had moved up to second as a result made a few attempts to pass Reutemann for the lead, but was unable to find a way past.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{dual-mode}} ignition, the KR200 had a steering bar reminiscent of {{that of an}} aircraft. To steer the KR200, the driver would swivel the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel. The mechanism was connected directly to the track rods of the front wheels, providing an extremely direct response best suited to small amounts of movement, unlike other common steering mechanisms which involved reduction gearing. The <b>gearshift</b> lever had a secondary lever on it which, when actuated, would {{put the car in}} neutral regardless of what gear it had been in before, although the transmission would have to be shifted back to first before the car would be able to move from a standstill.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gearshifting</b> effort, long a {{complaint}} about the Testarossa, was eased {{with a new}} single-plate clutch, sliding ball bearings, and better angle for the shifter. The braking system included larger front rotors and cross-drilling all around. Quicker steering, lower-profile tires, and new shock settings improved handling. Most importantly, engine and gearbox position was rethought, which improved the centre of gravity, aiding the handling and making the car less fearsome on the limit.|$|R

25|$|Benaderet {{moved to}} Los Angeles station KHJ in 1936. She made her network radio debut upon being hired by Orson Welles for his Mercury Theatre {{repertory}} company heard on The Campbell Playhouse. The following year she received her first big {{break in the}} industry on The Jack Benny Program, where she played Gertrude <b>Gearshift,</b> a wisecracking Brooklyn-accented telephone operator who gossiped about Jack Benny with her cohort Mabel Flapsaddle (Sara Berner). Intended as a one-time appearance, the pair became a recurring role starting in the 1945-46 season, and in early 1947, Benaderet and Berner momentarily took over the actual NBC switchboards in Hollywood for publicity photos. She performed {{in as many as}} five shows daily, causing her rehearsal dates to conflict with those of The Jack Benny Program and resulting in her reading live as Gertrude from a marked script she was handed upon entering the studio.|$|E
500|$|Derrickson chose Nepal as a {{location}} to feature an [...] "Eastern city" [...] {{that would not}} be familiar to most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason to}} shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound <b>gearshift</b> into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E

30|$|Another {{reflection}} {{from the}} first and final parts is that the simulated vehicle accelerates more quickly than the real one. This is mostly because of the vehicle model: the real vehicle has an active torque limiter when running unladen to protect the engine and transmission from damage, and the <b>gearshifts</b> are not instantaneous but come with a power disruption. Neither of these effects have been modelled in the vehicle. Recall that the OC-format does not stipulate acceleration in any way.|$|R
50|$|The Panamera Turbo S engine {{features}} larger turbochargers {{than the standard}} Panamera Turbo’s 4.8-litre V8, as well as high-pressure fuel injection, and aluminium-alloy pistons. The piston rings are coated in a low-friction surface to help eke out even more performance. The Panamera Turbo S accelerates to 62 mph in 3.8 seconds with launch control engaged. Roll-on acceleration should be more impressive, changes to the PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) gearbox allow for faster <b>gearshifts,</b> and the alleged 27.7mpg fuel economy is no worse than the less powerful Panamera Turbo.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{powershift}} automated manual transmission, i. e. an automated manual transmission with a torque gap filler, which essentially integrates, in a typical manual transmission layout, a torque gap filler assembly {{with the aim of}} reducing the torque gap that occurs during <b>gearshifts.</b> The torque gap filler consists of an additional mechanical link between the engine and the transmission output shaft, thus enabling the engine power to flow through this parallel path also when the launch clutch is disengaged, with clear benefits in terms of both sportiness and passenger comfort. This paper is the first part of a two-part study which, after a general description of the trans- mission architecture and its working principle, examines a practical implementation of the torque gap filler concept; the additional mechanical components and their integration into a traditional automated manual transmission are presented. Then, kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis of the transmission are proposed. The evolution of the transmission speeds are studied in the whole working range of the vehicle; the equations of motion are derived and used to show the effect of the torque gap filler on the torque transmitted to the wheels and consequently on the vehicle acceleration during <b>gearshifts.</b> The companion paper (Part 2) covers control issues and provides experimental validatio...|$|R

The Limited model included leather seats and trim, air conditioning, AM/FM radio, adjustable steering wheel, dual remote outside mirrors, full length center console with armrest, and many more features.|$|E
5000|$|Despite sharing {{its name}} with the {{previous}} system, the second version of INVECS was a radical development, based on Porsche's Tiptronic semi-automatic transmission technology. As with Porsche's version it allowed for either a fully automatic mode, or a clutchless semi-automatic mode if the driver wished to control the up- and down-shift points. It also offered the same Adaptive Shift Control software which monitored and [...] "learned" [...] the driver's habits over time and adjusted the smoothness or aggression of the <b>gearshifts</b> to suit his or her driving style. It was first implemented in the new Mitsubishi FTO in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The 996 GT3-R {{were made}} {{available}} to privateer teams. In the 24 Hours Nürburgring of the year 2000, a factory-backed effort of the local Phoenix team managed to beat the Zakspeed Chrysler Viper that dominated this race from 1998 to 2000. The improved 996 GT3-RS version of 2001 was entered in countless races {{in the years to}} follow, scoring not only many class wins, but also overall wins at Daytona and Spa in 2003. In 2004, the 996 GT3-RSR was made available, with numerous improvements to the RS, including a sequential gearbox, which allows for faster <b>gearshifts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Subaru {{produced}} only 400 cars; 300 4dr saloon versions and 100 5dr hatchback models. The GB270 {{was available in}} either WR Blue Mica (4dr) or Urban Grey Metallic (5dr). The name {{was derived from the}} 2.5-liter turbocharged engine which produced [...] and 420 Nm of torque. These upgrades meant a 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 4.9 seconds was possible and 146 mi/h km/h top speed could be achieved. The top speed of the GB270 was slightly lower than that of other Imprezas because it featured a Prodrive Quickshift 5-speed gearbox that offered faster <b>gearshifts</b> compared to the standard 6-speed gearbox.|$|R
