40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore: student {{perceptions}} of threshold concepts and capabilities in postgraduate business education, and the potential impacts of intensive modes of teaching on student understanding of threshold concepts and development of threshold capabilities. Design/methodology/approach - The student experience of learning was studied in two business units: strategic management, and accounting. The method involved two phases. In the first, students and unit coordinators identified and justified potential threshold concepts and capabilities. In the second, themes were rationalized. Findings - Significantly more so in <b>intensive</b> <b>mode,</b> the opportunity to ask questions was reported by student participants to support their development of the nominated threshold capabilities. This and other factors reported by students to support their learning in <b>intensive</b> <b>mode</b> are consistent with supporting students to traverse the liminal space within the limited time available in <b>intensive</b> <b>mode.</b> Research limitations/implications - Respondents from future cohorts will address the small participant numbers.

To do this, the traditional offering for that course was offered in the compressed timeframe without change to curriculum, learning outcomes, teachers or format of the course.

40|$|Background: Intensive or {{block mode}} {{teaching}} is where course materials are delivered over a shorter {{period of time}} compared to standard courses, by means of compressed teaching formats. Cost and time saved with the <b>intensive</b> <b>mode</b> teaching are encouraging more universities to offer this type of learning. However, {{the high level of}} student satisfaction is the major factor driving the implementation of this teaching mode within tertiary education institutions. Yet, while student satisfaction is an important indicator of the benefit of this teaching mode, there is a scarcity of information regarding the educational benefit on student performance compared with traditional modes of delivery. Aims: This study aimed to investigate and compare student overall performance between traditional and <b>intensive</b> <b>mode</b> in an introductory pharmacology course for second year pharmacy students at Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia. Methods: The introductory pharmacology course (2018 PHM) is offered to second year pharmacy students in either traditional or intensive modes. The traditional mode is delivered in semester one over a period of 13 weeks, using 3 hours of lectures per week. The <b>intensive</b> <b>mode</b> is delivered during the summer semester over a period of 3 weeks, using 13 hours of lectures per week. Both modes are supported by an equivalent number of tutorials, workshops and laboratories. A retrospective qualitative and quantitative study was conducted to compare the educational benefit of both modes on student learning. Student satisfaction was obtained from the student evaluation of course (SEC) reports which detailed their preference and attitude towards the intensive course mode. Student performance was also compared as measured by overall course grade over a period of three years (2010 - 2012). Student demographic variables (age, sex and grade average point or GPA) were examined to determine if the groups were comparable on potential confounding factors. Ethical approval was granted by the Griffith University Human Ethics Committee (PHM/ 05 / 10 /HREC). Results: The majority of students from the intensive teaching course indicated positive responses (> 4 on a 5 point likert scale) in the SEC reports. There {{was no significant difference between}} the age of students or the number of males and females in both teaching modes during the three years (p > 0. 05). Students who enrolled in the <b>intensive</b> <b>mode</b> had a significantly lower mean GPA compared to their peers from the traditional course for all three study years (traditional vs intensive mean ᠓D: 2010 - 5. 05 ᠰ. 85 vs 4. 05 ᠰ. 50; 2011 - 4. 90 ᠰ. 93 vs 4. 17 ᠰ. 50; 2012 - 4. 89 ᠰ. 98 vs 4. 25 ᠱ. 0; p 0. 05 for all years). Conclusion: Consistent with previous work, the results of this study confirm that intensive modes of delivery increase student preference towards the course.

40|$|<b>Intensive</b> <b>mode</b> {{teaching}} and learning refers to educational activities that occur on fewer days, and longer each day, than a “traditional” unit or module in the discipline. In traditional education, a full-time student would study between four and eight subjects or units per term or per semester at school, TAFE or university.
