50|$|The first humans {{arrived on}} the {{territory}} of modern Lithuania in the 10th millennium BC after the glaciers receded {{at the end of}} the last glacial period. According to the historian Marija Gimbutas, these people came from two directions: the Jutland Peninsula and from present-day Poland. They brought two different cultures, as evidenced by the tools they used. They were traveling hunters and did not form stable settlements. In the 8th millennium BC, the climate became much warmer, and forests developed. The inhabitants of what is now Lithuania then traveled less and engaged in local hunting, gathering and <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishing.</b> During the 6th-5th millennium BC, various animals were domesticated and dwellings became more sophisticated in order to shelter larger families. Agriculture did not emerge until the 3rd millennium BC due to a harsh climate and terrain and a lack of suitable tools to cultivate the land. Crafts and trade also started to form at this time. Speakers of North-Western Indo-European might have arrived with the Corded Ware culture around 3200/3100 BC.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the estimation of}} a <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fish</b> habitat using the Phabsim System (Physical Habitat Simulation System). The Phabsim System is used as an estimation technique of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fish</b> habitat. In the estimation of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fish</b> habitat, HSC(Habitat Suitability Criteria) are applied. There are three HSC. In this study, the binary format {{which is one of}} the three HSC is employed. To calculate the water flow phenomenon, a 2 -D shallow water equation is employed. The quasi-linear approximation of advection velocity is given by the Adams-Bashforth formula, which has second order accuracy. For the numerical approach, the FEM (finite element method) is used. For the spatial discretization, the Galerkin finite element procedure is applied. For the temporal discretization, the Crank-Nicolson method is applied. In the following, we compute the flow in the Koaze River in Saitama, Japan using the FEM. Next, using the result of FEM and data on sight, we evaluate the <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fish</b> habitat by the Phabsim System. It is clear that this analysis is useful for the estimation of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fish</b> habitat...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{biology of}} human {{migration}} {{can be observed}} from the co-evolutionary relationship with infectious diseases. While many pathogens are brief, unpleasant visitors to human bodies, others {{have the ability to}} become life-long human passengers. The story of a pathogen’s genetic code may, therefore, provide insight into the history of its human host. The evolution and distribution of disease in Africa is of particular interest, because of the deep history of human evolution in Africa, the presence of a variety of non-human primates, and tropical reservoirs of emerging infectious diseases. METHODS: This study explores which pathogens leave traces in the archaeological record, and whether there are realistic prospects that these pathogens can be recovered from sub-Saharan African archaeological contexts. RESULTS: Three stories are then presented of germs on a journey. The first is the story of HIV’s spread on the back of colonialism and the railway networks over the last 150 [*]years. The second involves the spread of Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite which shares its history with the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the origins of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishing.</b> Finally, we discuss the tantalising hints of hominin migration and interaction found in the genome of human herpes simplex virus 2. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from modern African pathogen genomes can provide data on human behaviour and migration in deep time and contribute to the improvement of human quality-of-life and longevity.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes</b> {{like that of}} other groups, has been widely utilized by zoogeographers, but with widely divergent acumen and success. At one extreme are those non-ichthyologists who have uncritically utilized for evidence certain groups whose distribution happens to support whatever theory they may be espousing. At the other extreme {{is the work of}} careful ichthyologists like DE BEAUFORT (1913) and REGAN (1922) whose thorough knowledge of the groups with which they are working demands the most careful consideration of their conclusions. However, no zoogeographer who utilizes the evidence of diverse groups can be familiar at first hand with all of them, and the difficulty facing such workers is that of seeking out the really dependable evidence in those groups he does not know well. Aside from the difficulty of selecting dependable authorities or systematic works, the zoogeographer desiring to use the evidence of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes</b> has another troublesome matter to contend with. This is the differing tolerance of salt-water exhibited by different groups of <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes.</b> As one example, and one which has frequently troubled zoogeographers, we may mention the Galaxiidae, <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes</b> of Southern South America, Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, whose distribution has been held by some to be evidence for continental drift or southern intercontinental land-bridges. Ichthyologists now know that these fishes are, as a group, salt-tolerant and possibly either anadromous or catadromous, and that they are not really strong evidence for continental connections simply because it seems possible that they may cross ocean barriers...|$|R

40|$|Certain fishes {{have evolved}} a visual system {{different}} from that common to all other types of vertebrate. In place of the rose-colored rhodopsin, their rods contain a purple photolabile pigment which I have suggested be called porphyropsin (Wald, 1937 a). This peculiarity was first noted {{in a number of}} <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes</b> by Ktihne and Sewall (1880), and later was confirmed spectrophotometrically by K 6 ttgen and Abelsdorff (1896). Following the work of the latter authors it has been believed that fish retinas in general contain porphyropsin. Recently, however, a number of marine fishes have been shown to possess visual systems identical with those of frogs and mammals, in which rhodopsin participates in a retinal cycle with the carotenoids retinene and vitamin A (Wald, 1936 - 37; 1937 - 38). This suggested the curious possibility that porphyropsin is restricted to <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes.</b> And in fact a preliminary survey indicates that the retinas of most permanently marine fishes contain rhodopsin, those of permanently <b>fresh-water</b> <b>fishes</b> porphyropsin; while those of euryhaline I fishes contain either predominantly or exclusively that photopigment ordinarily associated with the environment in which the fish is spawned (Wald, 1938 - 39) ...|$|R
40|$|Since first appearance, {{reviews and}} {{accounts}} of The <b>Fresh-Water</b> <b>Fishes</b> of Great Britain (1828 – 1838) have been surprisingly few. All {{agree that this}} rare work is remarkable for its illustrations. Its importance as a whole {{in the history of}} ichthyology, however, is largely unknown, or ignored. This article therefore constitutes the first study of the textual and contextual significance of The <b>Fresh-Water</b> <b>Fishes</b> of Great Britain. By examining in chronological order where, and by whom, the work was first reviewed and referenced until the 1860 s, the extraordinary contributions that its author, Sarah Bowdich, made to ichthyology {{at the forefront of the}} field in the late 1820 s can better be appreciated. Indeed, this multiple evidence demonstrates Sarah Bowdich’s merits as an ichthyologist of the first order, and as the first woman ichthyologist. But establishing the significance of The <b>Fresh-Water</b> <b>Fishes</b> of Great Britain for the history of ichthyology then raises a further question. Why has it and its author been so ignored or forgotten? By returning for answers to the fields of ichthyology already considered, the article proposes that Sarah Bowdich’s different angles on Fish offer lines of investigation that are still important for the field today...|$|R
