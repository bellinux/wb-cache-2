40|$|This {{nationwide}} {{study was}} conducted to clinically evaluate treatment with implant-retained overdentures when applied on a large scale and to determine to what degree treatment results could be predicted from patient and treatment characteristics at baseline. A total of 429 patients who had received implant overdenture treatment were clinically investigated by two dentists. Implant survival was high, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>implants</b> placed in the mandible. Results for the maxilla appeared far less promising. Complications that were observed predominantly concerned inflammation of the peri-implant tissues and poor oral hygiene. The quality of the overdentures, as assessed on three conventional prosthetic parameters, was generally good. Nevertheless, overdentures on oral implants appear to require considerable maintenance. No statistically significant correlation could be found between patient and treatment characteristics at baseline and the clinical treatment outcome. So, although treatment outcome with implant-retained overdentures appeared favorable, clinical results were not individually predictable...|$|E

Inertial sensors undergo a massive use as externally applied sensor devices for movement tracking in sports, work and as a signal input for assistance devices.

40|$|Abstract—Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in applying wireless sensor networks for health status monitoring both on and within the human body. Low power consumption is crucial in such applications, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> <b>implanted</b> devices. UWB transmission is one way of making low power transmission possible. A further reduction in power consumption can be achieved through efficient signal compression schemes. Since signals resulting from the measurements of physical phenomena are correlated compression prior to transmission can reduce the bit-rate an thus the power consumption significantly. In this paper a compression schemes for a 2 -node sensor network is studied. Differential pulse code modulation is applied for removal of temporal correlation and distributed quantization is used for exploitation of inter-sensor correlation. An example on optimization of encoders and decoders based on the statistical properties of an ECG signal is performed. Significant compression is shown to be achieved at low complexity. I...|$|R

40|$|Porous {{metallic}} biomaterials {{have been}} extensively studied for many bone tissue engineering applications because porous structures provided space for bone in-growth and vascularisation.

One consideration to accelerate the healing process is surface treatment, including application of bioactive coatings, e. g. hydroxyapatite and biomimetic creation of surface. Surface treatments on biomaterials will determine surface chemistry and topography, whereas these surface characteristics influence osseointegration process. To respond on the challenges of producing biocompatible and mechanical compatible biomaterials and lack of review studies on surface modifications on porous structures, a comprehensive literature review on surface modifications of various porous metallic materials is presented.

40|$|Plaque {{accumulation}} on abutments or implant surfaces induces {{an inflammatory}} {{reaction in the}} gingiva/alveolar mucosa just as around teeth. The longevity of oral implants can be jeopardized by either peri-implantitis and/or an occlusal overload. In the partially edentulous patient in whom pockets around teeth act as a reservoir for the colonization of the pockets around <b>implants,</b> the risk <b>for</b> inflammatory reactions of the peri-implant soft tissues seems especially more plausible than in the fully edentulous patient. This is <b>especially</b> true <b>for</b> <b>implants</b> with a very rough surface (e. g., plasma-sprayed), because of the positive relationship between surface roughness and supra- as well as subgingival plaque formation. Several medium-term (from 5 to 10 years) clinical studies support this hypothesis, through the observation of ongoing bone loss and subsequent decreasing success/survival percentages. Occlusal overload increases the risk for microfractures at the implant-bone interface in two-stage implants, which can result in significant marginal bone loss and even failure.

However, the large amount of Ni in the alloy may cause allergic reactions and toxic effects thereby limiting its applications. In this work, the surface of NiTi alloy was modified by nitrogen plasma immersion ion implantation (N-PIII) at various voltages. The materials were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The topography and roughness before and after N-PIII were measured by atomic force microscope. The effects of the modified surfaces on nickel release and cytotoxicity were assessed by immersion tests and cell cultures. The XPS results reveal that near-surface Ni concentration is significantly reduced by PIII and the surface TiN layer suppresses nickel release and favors osteoblast proliferation, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> samples <b>implanted</b> at higher voltages. The surfaces produced at higher voltages of 30 and 40 kV show better adhesion ability to osteoblasts compared to the unimplanted and 20 kV PIII samples.

In this approach, scaffolds which allow cells to invade the construct and guide the cells grow into specific tissue play a pivotal role. Electrospinning has gained popularity recently as a simple and versatile method to produce fibrous structures with nano- to microscale dimensions. These electrospun fibers have been extensively applied to create nanofiber scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. Specifically for bone and cartilage tissue engineering, polymeric materials have some attractive properties such as the biodegradability. Ceramic scaffolds and implant coatings, such as hydroxyapatite and silica-based bioglass have also been considered as bone graft substitutes for bone repair because of their bioactivity and, in some cases, tunable resorbability. Besides tissue engineering scaffolds, <b>for</b> clinical application, <b>especially</b> <b>for</b> load-bearing artificial <b>implants,</b> metallic materials such as titanium are {{the most commonly used}} material. Osseointegration between bone and implants is very essential <b>for</b> <b>implant</b> success. To achieve better osseointegration between bone and the implant surface, three dimensional porous structures can provide enhanced fixation with bone by allowing tissue to grow into the pores. In this study, pre- 3 D electrospun polymer and ceramic scaffolds with peptide conjugation and 3 D titanium scaffolds with different surface morphology were fabricated to testify the osteoblast and mensechymal stem cell attachment and differentiation. The overall goal of this thesis is to determine if the peptide functionalization of polymeric scaffolds and physical parameters of ceramic and metallic scaffold can promote osteoblast maturation and mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in vitro to achieve an optimal scaffold design for greater osseointegration. The results of the studies showed with functionalization of MSC- specific peptide, polymer scaffolds behaved with higher biocompatibility and MSC affinity.
