5|$|Slightly {{more than}} 5 million people work in Switzerland; about 25% of {{employees}} {{belonged to a}} trade union in 2004. Switzerland has a more flexible job market than neighbouring countries and {{the unemployment rate is}} very low. The unemployment rate increased from a low of 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009. The unemployment rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 without further decrease in 2015 and 2016. Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004. The foreign citizen population was 21.8% in 2004, about the same as in Australia. GDP per <b>hour</b> <b>worked</b> is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Overall Americans worked {{more than}} their {{counterparts}} in other developed post-industrial nations. While the average worker in Denmark enjoyed 30 days of vacation annually, the average American only had 16 annual vacation days. In 2000 the average American worked 1,978 hours per year, 500 hours more than the average German, yet 100 hours less than the average Czech. Overall the US labor force was the most productive in the world (overall, not by <b>hour</b> <b>worked),</b> largely due to its workers working more than those in any other post-industrial country (excluding South Korea). Americans generally hold working and being productive in high regard; being busy and working extensively may also serve as the means to obtain esteem.|$|E
25|$|Denmark has {{the fourth}} highest ratio of {{tertiary}} degree holders in the world. The country ranks {{highest in the}} world for workers' rights. GDP per <b>hour</b> <b>worked</b> was the 13th highest in 2009. The country has a market income inequality close to the OECD average, but after public cash transfers the income inequality is very low. According to the International Monetary Fund, Denmark has the world's highest minimum wage. As Denmark has no minimum wage legislation, the high wage floor has been attributed to the power of trade unions. For example, {{as the result of a}} collective bargaining agreement between the 3F trade union and the employers group , workers at McDonald's and other fast food chains make the equivalent of US$20 an hour, which is more than double what their counterparts earn in the United States, and have access to five weeks' paid vacation, parental leave and a pension plan. Union density in 2015 was 68%.|$|E
25|$|In calculating income {{based on}} wage and <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> (income equals wage multiplied by <b>hours</b> <b>worked),</b> it is {{typically}} {{assumed that the}} number of <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> is easily changed, but the wage is more static. This makes wage a parameter, <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> an independent variable, and income a dependent variable.|$|R

Since patterns of <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> by self-employed persons themselves and their unpaid family members differ fundamentally, both groups are treated separately in the AZR. The calculations of <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> differ methodologically from those for employees because a large part {{of the components of}} <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> are not relevant here (see Sect.  2.1).|$|R

By the end of 2014, UK growth had become the fastest in the Group of Seven (G7) and in Europe, and employment was at its highest since records began.

Sweden is a world leader in privatized pensions and pension funding problems are small compared to many other Western European countries. Swedish labor market has become more flexible, but it still has some widely acknowledged problems. The typical worker receives only 40% of his income after the tax wedge. The slowly declining overall taxation, 51.1% of GDP in 2007, is still nearly double of that in the United States or Ireland. Civil servants amount to a third of Swedish workforce, multiple times the proportion in many other countries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms in the early 1990s, especially in manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|The UK {{had been}} one of the strongest economies in terms of inflation, {{interest}} rates and unemployment, all of which remained lower until the 2008–09 recession. In August 2008 the IMF warned that the country's outlook had worsened due to a twin shock: financial turmoil and rising commodity prices. Both developments harmed the UK more than most developed countries, as it obtained revenue from exporting financial services while running deficits in goods and commodities, including food. In 2007, the UK had the world's third largest current account deficit, due mainly to a large deficit in manufactured goods. In May 2008, the IMF advised the UK government to broaden the scope of fiscal policy to promote external balance.

We study the issue in a neoclassical-growth and labor-search model. We find that our model has a unique steady state. Moreover, we analytically solve the effects of labor market regulation, represented by higher unemployment compensation and labor’s bargaining shares, on the employment and <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> per worker. Finally, using the US as a benchmark, we translate higher unemployment compensation and labor’s bargaining shares in Europe into the data and quantify our model. We find that a more regulated labor market can lead to sizable differences in <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> per person between Europe and the US, with the decomposition into employment and <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> per worker being close to the data. search and matching, labor market regulation, employment and <b>hours</b> <b>worked...</b>|$|R

30|$|What {{forces have}} driven output growth and {{fluctuations}} in Spain {{over the last}} three decades? What has been the impact of the evolution of taxes and total factor productivity (TFP) on aggregate <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> and output? We study these questions through the lens of growth accounting and the neoclassical growth model. Our results show that the evolution of aggregate <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> in Spain has been consistent with the evolution of taxes, whereas lack of TFP growth has had a minor impact on <b>hours</b> <b>worked.</b> A shortcoming of our model is that it fails to account for about 20 % of the movements in <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> in booms and recessions. The model, however, does account for the declining trend in <b>hours</b> <b>worked</b> over the period 1975 – 2015.|$|R
