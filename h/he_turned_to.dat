5|$|Balzac's first {{project was}} a {{libretto}} for a comic opera called Le Corsaire, based on Lord Byron's The Corsair. Realizing {{he would have}} trouble finding a composer, however, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> other pursuits.|$|E
5|$|From the 1888 harvest, Monet {{produced}} three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) {{against the}} backdrop of hills along the left bank of the Seine and a few Giverny houses to the right. Then, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> his left to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Hoffmann {{started working}} {{to find a}} less irritating {{substitute}} for salicylic acid. It is generally accepted that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> this idea because his father was suffering {{the side effects of}} taking sodium salicylate for rheumatism.|$|E

He would {{but think}} it some cur lying under the wall I might howl once if <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the right, twice if <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> the left, {{and you could}} then cross the ground in that direction, and I could meet you on the way without losing sight of him for long." ...|$|R
5|$|A {{few minutes}} later {{he was at the}} {{northern}} end of a pedestrian precinct, Royal Exchange Passage (formally called Royal Exchange Buildings), near the junction with Threadneedle Street, where a further police cordon stopped him from proceeding. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> walk south along Royal Exchange Passage instead, where, minutes before he arrived, officers had clashed with up to 25 protesters. Riot police from the Met's TSG, accompanied by City of London police dog handlers, had arrived there from the cordon in Threadneedle Street to help their colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Garfield placated the Stalwarts by {{endorsing}} Chester A. Arthur of New York, a Conkling loyalist, as {{nominee for}} vice president, {{but it was}} to Blaine and his delegates that Garfield owed his nomination. When Garfield was elected over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Blaine to guide him in selection of his cabinet and offered him the preeminent position: Secretary of State. Blaine accepted, resigning from the Senate on March 4, 1881.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway was 19 {{years old}} when in 1918, shortly after he was posted to the Italian Front as a Red Cross {{ambulance}} driver, he sustained a severe wound from mortar fire. For the next six months, he recuperated in a Milan hospital, where {{he fell in love}} with nurse Agnes von Kurowsky. Shortly after his return to the US, she informed him that she was engaged to an Italian officer. Soon after, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> journalism.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Juster had {{received}} a Ford Foundation grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> writing what became The Phantom Tollbooth, his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. The book received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into a film, opera, and play, and translated into many languages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Vice Admiral Friedrich von Pöck, {{the head of}} the Marinesektion (Admiralty), ordered four torpedo cruisers. Pöck was unable to secure funding for new ironclads, and so <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> less {{expensive}} vessels to modernize the fleet. The ships would fill several roles, including scouting for the ironclad fleet and leading flotillas of torpedo boats. The first three of the new vesselsthe were built to the same basic design.|$|E
5|$|After the Ducks were {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the 2008 playoffs, he again contemplated retirement, but quickly made the decision to return for the 2008–09 season. He regained captaincy of the Ducks, and played in his fifth All-Star Game during the season in which he scored 59 points in 82 games. In what proved to be his final season, 2009–10, Niedermayer scored 48 points in 80 games. He announced his retirement as a player on June 22, 2010, but remained with the Ducks organization as a consultant to general manager Bob Murray. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> coaching in 2012–13 season, serving as a Special Assignment Coach with the Ducks.|$|E

5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford one on his salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Always {{one of the}} {{smallest}} children in his class and without stable supervision at home, Fleury adopted an aggressive posture and later described himself as a bully. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> hockey as an outlet when he borrowed an old pair of skates and a broken stick to play his first game at the age of five. From that point on, he played hockey at every opportunity, often accompanying his father to the arena in Russell in the pre-dawn hours. He was described by his teachers as a determined youth, who would repeat any activity he failed at until he got it right.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, so <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart. Director Stephen Frears was unfamiliar with his previous work and had to be convinced by other production staff to cast him.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the carpet}} quarrel, Gilbert had vowed to write no {{more for the}} Savoy. When The Gondoliers closed in 1891, Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> old friends George Dance, Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece, The Nautch Girl, which ran for a {{satisfying}} 200 performances in 1891–92. Carte then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy's The Vicar of Bray, which ran through the summer of 1892. Next came Grundy and Sullivan's Haddon Hall, which held the stage until April 1893. While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy, his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America. In 1894, for example, Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America.|$|E
5|$|Dallas {{joined the}} Port Curtis Militia in 1913, and was {{commissioned}} as a lieutenant {{prior to the}} outbreak of World WarI. Believing he had little chance of gaining {{a place in the}} recently established Australian Flying Corps, he applied to join the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), but was rejected. Undaunted, he travelled from Queensland to Melbourne, where he impressed Minister Without Portfolio J.A.Jensen. Jensen gave the young aspirant a letter of introduction to the Australian High Commissioner in London, Sir George Reid. Dallas paid his own passage to England and, once there, applied once more to the RFC. Rejected again, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and was accepted, topping the entrance examination over 83 other students. He was commissioned a flight sub-lieutenant and began training at Hendon in June 1915, gaining Pilot's License #1512 on 5August.|$|E
5|$|In 1088, Robert's {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of England began to falter, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> Henry, proposing that his brother lend him some of his inheritance, which Henry refused. Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000. Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the Cotentin, but it extended across the Avranchin, with control over the bishoprics of both. This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, Hugh d'Avranches and Richard de Redvers, and the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel, whose lands spread out further across the Duchy. Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale {{his choice}} of any {{property}} the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him {{and he wanted to}} make something other than a war picture. While the novel itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> an unknown actor named Boris Karloff. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein was an instant hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.|$|E
5|$|Over time {{he became}} {{increasingly}} involved in various dissident organizations. In December 1959 {{he became a}} vice president of the Union of Polish Writers (Związek Literatów Polskich, ZLP). He also published in the magazine Świat (1951–1969). In 1962 he was the last president of the literary discussion society, Klub Krzywego Koła. In 1966 he was {{a vice president of}} the PEN Club. While in the late 1940s and 1950s he focused mostly on journalistic activity, later <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> writing popular history in book format. In the 1960s he wrote his most famous works, historical books about history of Poland – the Kingdom of Poland in the times of the Piast dynasty, the Jagiellonian dynasty, and the era of elected kings (the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth). His book on Jagiellonian Poland was recognized as the best book of the year by the readers.|$|E
5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> his childhood {{experiences in the}} outdoors as a resource, but {{could not find a}} way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E
