He also {{was working on the}} design for the Soyuz spacecraft that was intended to carry crews to LEO and to the Moon. As well, Korolev was designing the Luna series of vehicles that would soft-land on the Moon and make robotic missions to Mars and Venus. Unexpectedly, he died in January 1966, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> various plans brought to fruition.|$|E
25|$|Valentino went {{on strike}} for financially based reasons. At {{the time of his}} lawsuit against the studio, Valentino was earning $1,250 per week, with an {{increase}} to $3,000 after three years. This was $7,000 per week less than Mary Pickford made in 1916. He was also upset over the broken promise of filming Blood and Sand in Spain, and the failure to shoot the next proposed film in either Spain or at least New York. Valentino had hoped while filming in Europe <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> family, whom he had not seen in 10 years.|$|E
500|$|Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson {{revealed}} that captain Roy Keane {{would return to}} his midfield role after playing in central defence in their win over Juventus: [...] "It took Roy about 15 minutes to settle into Tuesday's game but once he started to make sure <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> opponent, he grasped the role very quickly, in the end, he could have played with a bowler hat and white gloves on {{it was so easy}} for him. He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted. We have always looked at the League Cup as an extra to blood young players, but the format now has encouraged teams to have a go. We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E

2500|$|After a long {{investigation}} {{that fails to}} locate Chigurh, Bell decides to retire and drives away from the local courthouse feeling overmatched and defeated. [...] For {{the rest of the}} book, Bell describes two dreams he experienced after his father died. [...] In one, he met his father in town and borrowed some money from him. [...] In the second, Bell was riding his horse through a snow-covered pass in the mountains. [...] As he rode, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> father up ahead of him carrying a moon-colored horn lit with fire, and he knew that his father would ride on through the pass and fix a fire out in the dark and cold {{and that it would be}} waiting for him when he arrived.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the deaths}} of Wagner and Abbott, Barbara Haviland {{continued}} to compile data for world records. In 1997 Kim Hutsell acquired the rights from Cynthia Abbott to World Size Records to continue the project as a stand-alone book, those rights were subsequently sold to Don Pisor. The first edition therefore incorporated many of the earlier entries, as well as additional data compiled for World Size Records by Barbara Haviland. The format of the new publication differed from World Size Records in several important ways. Significantly, the minimum size threshold was lowered from [...] to [...] In another change, the registry listed taxa alphabetically by species name within families, instead of within genera {{as they had been}} previously. This system allows for easy comparison between closely related genera, is more resilient to the frequent taxonomic changes that occur at the genus level, and gets around the issue that many shell dealers prefer to lump numerous genera for the sake of simplicity. R. Tucker Abbott had himself intended to use this arrangement in the fifth edition of his World Size Records, but died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>his</b> plans through. Another difference was the presentation of sizes in millimetres to the nearest tenth instead of centimetres to the nearest hundredth, moving the publication in line with standard usage in conchology. Finally, references were added for each specimen to aid in identification. The opening paragraph of the first edition set out the project's goals and invited submissions: ...|$|E
