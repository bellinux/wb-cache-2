5|$|Earthquakes in Alabama are sporadic, {{and tend}} to cause little to no damage. During a 91-year period, there were 19earthquakes, varying from near-imperceptible to damaging. The first known {{activity}} in Alabama, the New Madrid earthquakes of 1812, registered Mercalli intensities of VII (Very strong) throughout the northern and central portions of the state. On February 4, 1886, the first recorded earthquake from Alabama hit {{the western part of}} the state, <b>jolting</b> people in Sumter and Marengo counties.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins <b>jolting</b> back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E

25|$|A heavy fog {{across the}} East Coast on January 16, 1953, caused four ferry {{accidents}} in the New York Harbor. One of these accidents {{was when the}} Gold Star crashed into the United States Lines freighter American Veteran, injuring 13 people. In another heavy fog four days later, the Joseph F. Merrill crashed into an Ellis Island ferryboat, <b>jolting</b> several passengers but injuring no one.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} {{airborne}} FACs was a timely one. The other four TACPs of the 620th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron had joined its original two parties in ground forward air control as the U.S. military scrambled to form TACPs. Their utility was limited because the FAC had {{to remain with}} his MRC108 radio jeep while ordering air strikes, making a very visible target for enemy shellfire. The radios were fragile, and they were easily damaged by <b>jolting</b> and vibration. By 11 July 1950, {{only three of the}} radio jeeps were still working.|$|E
25|$|The first {{track was}} {{completed}} in 1835, and freight service began immediately. The solid granite roadbed proved to be much too rigid, <b>jolting</b> the engine and cars nearly to pieces. Repairs on the locomotives (there were two at the time) would sometimes take most of the night, {{trying to get them}} ready for the next day's service. The much poorer Boston and Worcester Railroad could not afford a granite bed and so was built with modern wooden ties. This turned out to be far superior, so the owners of the Boston and Lowell decided they would upgrade their entire roadbed to wood when they added a second track.|$|E

25|$|The right brigade of the 7th Division {{advanced}} against {{light resistance}} to the first objective (red line) but came under fire from machine-guns in the 21st Division area. As the neighbouring division came up the 91st Brigade was able to resume its advance towards In Der Ster Cabaret until fire from Joiner's Rest held them up. Reinforcements allowed the final objective (blue line) to be taken. A defensive flank was formed along <b>Jolting</b> Houses road and Jetty Trench, meeting the 21st Division {{to the west of}} Reutel. The left brigade had an easy advance to the first objective. As the attack continued some troops crossed into the area of the 1st Australian Division, causing a gap but the German defenders were not able to exploit this and the final objective was reached. Occupation of the In Der Ster plateau gave the two divisions observation over {{the lower part of the}} valley, enfilading ground on which any counter-attack from the south against the 1st Australian Division must move.|$|E

40|$|Cooperative {{interactions}} {{offer the}} inherent possibility of cheating {{by each of}} the interacting partners. A key challenge to behavioural observers is to recognize these conflicts, and find means to measure reliably cheating in natural interactions. Cleanerfish Labroides dimidiatus cheat by taking scales and mucus from their fish clients and such dishonest cleaning has been previously recognized {{in the form of}} whole-body <b>jolts</b> by clients in response to cleaner mouth contact. In this study, we test whether <b>jolts</b> may be a general client response to cheating by cleaners. We experimentally varied the ectoparasite loads of yellowtail damselfish (Microspathodon chrysurus), a common client of the cleaning goby Elacantinus evelynae, and compared the rates of <b>jolts</b> on parasitized and deparasitized clients. As predicted if <b>jolts</b> represent cleaner cheating, deparasitized clients <b>jolted</b> more often than parasitized clients, and overall <b>jolt</b> rates increased over time as client parasite load was presumably reduced by cleaning activity. Yellowtail damselfish in the wild <b>jolted</b> significantly less frequently than those in captivity, which is consistent with a loss of ectoparasites during capture. Our results suggest that <b>jolts</b> by clients of cleaning gobies are not related to the removal of ectoparasites. Client <b>jolts</b> may therefore be a generally accurate measure of cheating by cleanerfish...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{comparisons}} to Tool, many critics such as Andree Farias and Andy Argyrakis of Christianity Today and Robert Rich of The Daily Texan have stated Chevelle {{as having a}} unique sound to their music. The Daily Texan described their music as [...] "a kind of controlled chaos, a beautiful darkness, a gentle rampage of aural velocity", and drew away from the band's {{comparisons to}} Tool by stating [...] "Tool have always embraced their experimental side and released scathing social commentaries and criticisms, while Chevelle write radio-friendly tunes with subtly deep meanings, but with overtones easily grasped by any listener." [...] Andree Farias of Christianity Today has reviewed Chevelle's first three albums, praising them as [...] "commanding vocals over <b>jolting</b> guitars and chest-thumping bass beats." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1899 Ravel {{composed}} {{his first}} piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ("Pavane for a dead princess"). It was originally a solo piano work, {{commissioned by the}} Princesse de Polignac. In the same year he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics. Henri Gautier-Villars ("Willy") described the piece as [...] "a <b>jolting</b> debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School" [...] and called Ravel a [...] "mediocrely gifted debutant... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard." [...] Another critic, Pierre Lalo, thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven. Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously. This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! {{is not as}} much fun as it should be. Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's <b>jolting</b> sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite {{a mostly}} {{negative}} reception, Miracle at St. Anna received some praise. Eric D. Snider, writing for Film.com praised the film, writing, [...] "This {{is beyond the}} scope of anything Lee has done before, and he rises to the challenge remarkably well, with battle scenes nearly as visceral and <b>jolting</b> as those in Saving Private Ryan and a multi-layered story involving the U.S. Army, the Nazis, and the Italian resistance movement." [...] Snider criticized the film's frame story, which he described as [...] "unnecessary and definitely corny." [...] James Verniere of the Boston Herald awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, calling it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and a [...] "classic American WWII movie that both acknowledges the rousing tradition of such war epics as The Longest Day (1962) and The Big Red One (1980) and adds something new: paying tribute to the World War II African-American soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. Roger Ebert, writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, criticized the editing but praised the film overall, describing it as [...] "epic" [...] with [...] "one of the best battle scenes I can remember, on par with Saving Private Ryan...Miracle at St. Anna contains richness, anger, history, sentiment, fantasy, reality, violence and life.

500|$|AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{considers}} [...] "Love You To" [...] to be Harrison's [...] "first {{and best}} foray into Indian music", while Bruce Eder, also writing for AllMusic, views it as [...] "exquisite". In his song review {{for the same}} website, Richie Unterberger is unimpressed with the track; while acknowledging that [...] "Love You To" [...] was [...] "Undoubtedly... another indication of the group's rapidly broadening barriers", he cites a lead vocal that [...] "drone on in a rather lugubrious way", Harrison's slightly [...] "disheveled" [...] sitar playing, and lyrics that constitute [...] "a rather muddled mix of free love advocacy, meditations on the transience of life on Earth, and chip-on-the-shoulder wariness of people out to exploit him". Although he finds the melody [...] "sourly repetitious", Ian MacDonald writes that the track is [...] "distinguished by the authenticity of its Hindustani classical instrumentation and techniques", and admires Harrison's understanding of the genre. In a 2009 review for Paste magazine, Mark Kemp described Revolver as the album on which the Beatles [...] "completed their transformation from the mop tops of three years earlier into bold, groundbreaking experimental rockers", and added: [...] "Harrison's 'Love You To' is pure Indian raga – sitar and tablas punctuated by the occasional luminous guitar riff <b>jolting</b> through the song's paranoid, drug-fueled lyrics like a blinding ray of sun into a dark forest." ...|$|E
