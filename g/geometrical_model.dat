As such they formed the model for later astronomical developments. The physical basis for Ptolemaic models invoked layers of spherical shells, though the most complex models were inconsistent with this physical explanation.|$|E

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper In today's medicine, {{especially in}} the field of orthopedic surgery, {{it is very important to}} use geometrically accurate and anatomically correct <b>geometrical</b> <b>models</b> of human bones for the pre-operative planning and implants creation. In order to create such models, two new methods for <b>geometrical</b> <b>modeling</b> were developed and presented in this paper. These methods enable creation of femur anatomical axis and femur shaft <b>geometrical</b> <b>models,</b> and they are: GCM (Gravity Center Method), and CPM (Curve Projection Method). Both methods enable creation of <b>geometrical</b> <b>models</b> which are based on data acquired from the medical imaging devices (CT, MRI, X-Ray). The basic difference between these two methods and all the others is in the manner of generating the points through which anatomical axis model (3 D curve) passes or goes near.

Steno was invited {{to live in the}} Palazzo Vecchio; in return he had to gather a cabinet of curiosities. Steno went to Rome and met Pope Alexander VII and Marcello Malpighi, whom he admired. On his way back he watched a Corpus Christi procession in Livorno and wondered if he had the right belief. In Florence Steno focused on the muscular system and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steno proposed a <b>geometrical</b> <b>model</b> of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.|$|E
500|$|In his Almagest, the {{astronomer}} Ptolemy (fl. ca. 150 AD) developed geometrical predictive {{models of the}} motions of the stars and planets and extended them to a unified physical model of the cosmos in his Planetary hypotheses. [...] By using eccentrics and epicycles, his <b>geometrical</b> <b>model</b> achieved greater mathematical detail and predictive accuracy than had been exhibited by earlier concentric spherical models of the cosmos. [...] In Ptolemy's physical model, each planet is contained in two or more spheres, but in Book 2 of his Planetary Hypotheses Ptolemy depicted thick circular slices rather than spheres as in its Book 1. [...] One sphere/slice is the deferent, with a centre offset somewhat from the Earth; the other sphere/slice is an epicycle embedded in the deferent, with the planet embedded in the epicyclical sphere/slice. [...] Ptolemy's model of nesting spheres provided the general dimensions of the cosmos, the greatest distance of Saturn being 19,865 times the radius of the Earth and {{the distance of the}} fixed stars being at least 20,000 Earth radii.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geometrical</b> <b>models</b> of {{nucleic acids}} {{are used to}} predict {{tertiary}} structure. This is important because designed nucleic acid complexes usually contain multiple junction points, which introduces geometric constraints to the system. These constraints stem from {{the basic structure of}} nucleic acids, mainly that the double helix formed by nucleic acid duplexes has a fixed helicity of about 10.4 base pairs per turn, and is relatively stiff. Because of these constraints, the nucleic acid complexes are sensitive to the relative orientation of the major and minor grooves at junction points. <b>Geometrical</b> <b>modeling</b> can detect strain stemming from misalignments in the structure, which can then be corrected by the designer.|$|R
