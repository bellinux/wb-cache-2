The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe outbreak of malaria. 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000.

5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine biologist, and Barton for his mechanical skill.

Uncut was more critical and wrote in a mixed review that although the album was heavily politically focused, [...] "slam-dancing is still possible". In a negative review, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice called the album a [...] "dud" [...] and asserted that Armstrong's lyrics eschew [...] "sociopolitical content" [...] for [...] "the emotional travails of two clueless punks—one passive, one aggressive, both projections of the auteur", adding that [...] "there's no economics, no race, hardly any compassion." ...|$|E

MusicOMH wrote that the chemistry between 50 Cent and Olivia [...] "is almost as explicit as the lyrics ... the bass line is made for grinding to". Author Ethan Brown, in a review of The Massacre, called the track [...] "uninspiring" [...] and [...] "nearly identical" [...] to his previous collaboration with Lil' Kim on [...] "Magic Stick".

Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media commented that Knowles twist on the song is [...] "vocally impeccable, but it reads more like recital fodder rather than a true confessional." [...] Leah Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly wrote that on the I Am disc there were some [...] "lovely ballads" [...] including [...] "Disappear", the [...] "soaring 'Halo' and 'Ave Maria'".

500|$|Typical pay in the 1840s and 1850s {{would be}} 4d {{per day for}} younger girls, rising to 8d–1s per day for full-grown women engaged in skilled bucking work. (Wages varied by region owing to differing levels {{of supply and demand}} for workers; in Kea and Wendron the average wage for women and girls was as high as 18s in 1841.) As they were {{employed}} as casual labour, bal maidens were not tied to any particular mine, and it was not unusual for them to transfer to other mines offering better pay or conditions. Some mines may have paid a monthly loyalty bonus in an effort to retain their workers. The workers could be fined for bad language, failure to work hard enough, absenteeism and other misdemeanours. As their pay was dependent on the profitability of the mine, it was not unusual early in the 19th century for bal maidens to work for long periods (in at least one case, a laundry woman, 11 months) without pay, and to receive their pay in arrears once the mine returned to profit. While some younger bal maidens would attend school before starting work and, in 1841, around a quarter of bal maidens attended Sunday schools, illiteracy was rife. When [...] Charles Foster Barham's reported to the 1842 Royal Commission into the Employment of Children at the Mines he found that less than half of bal maidens he interviewed were able to read to any extent. Some mines subsidised basic education for the children of their employees. Mining families generally valued education so highly that they would often try to send at least one child to school, but any education children did receive tended to be curtailed once they became old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the mines.|$|E
