2500|$|The third {{meeting was}} on 10 December and Law, raging because Asquith {{had not yet}} {{presented}} a concrete way to exclude Ulster, made little progress. Law brushed aside Asquith's suggestions and insisted that only the exclusion of Ulster was worth considering. He later wrote that [...] "My feeling, however, is that Asquith has no hope whatsoever of making such an arrangement and that his present idea is simply to let things drift in the meantime.. I do not understand why he took the trouble of seeing me at all. The only explanation I can give <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{he is in a}} funk about the whole position and thought that meeting me might keep the thing open at least".|$|E
2500|$|A nervous Bhansali, who had met {{the media}} after a long time, said he was very afraid of {{handling}} a mic after so long. He thanked UTV Chairman Ronnie Screwvala for his unrelenting support. Bhansali made headlines {{for the day when}} he said that Aishwarya Rai was [...] ".. his muse, his jaan, and I get terribly excited when I make a film with her because she is very, very special. Some people are timeless and Aishwarya will be there for another 20 years". About the lead actor he said, [...] "I have never enjoyed working with any other actor as much as I have enjoyed working with Hrithik, just for the kind of talent he has, for the kind of person he is". He also revealed the reason why he became the musical director of the movie, [...] "The reason behind doing the music of the film <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I understand the characters and understand what they would express musically more than any other music director. Some deep thoughts are my concern, so whatever little music I knew, it was a sort of experiment. But I am happy with what I have done,".|$|E
2500|$|Mark Dunn, a {{spokesman}} for Dion, accused the Tories of making fun of the Liberal leader's hearing issues. Dion responded to Harper's comments, saying Harper had [...] "no class", saying [...] "I {{did not understand the}} question", and [...] "Maybe it's because I have a hearing problem, maybe because [...] my second language, but I did not understand the question". Both the Conservatives and the CTV have come under criticism for their handling of the footage, but they have stated they stand by their actions. Duceppe has called Harper's comments a [...] "double standard", saying that many English-speaking politicians have little or no ability to speak French, yet francophones are somehow always expected to be perfect, and that the attack was an attempted [...] "low blow". [...] But Duceppe also took the opportunity to criticise Dion, suggesting he understood the question. [...] "The real question <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Dion understood the question. [...] The real problem wasn't the language, it was the substance," [...] Duceppe said, [...] "He had nothing to say". Layton also defended Dion, saying he has [...] "struggled with questions, too".|$|E

60|$|ELIZABETH And then--thanks to you--Mrs. Chilvers has {{had such}} {{excellent}} training in politics. It <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> decided us.|$|R
6000|$|... "What did I say;--jolly as a sandboy? There {{is nothing}} wrong in <b>that.</b> What <b>I</b> meant <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this world <b>is</b> a very good sort of world, and that a man can get along in it very well, if he minds his p's and q's." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} hosted by Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Corbyn said he invited [...] "friends" [...] from Hamas and Hezbollah {{to an event}} in parliament, {{referred}} to Hamas as [...] "an organisation dedicated towards {{the good of the}} Palestinian people and bringing about long term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region" [...] and said that the British government's labelling of Hamas as a terrorist organisation is [...] "a big, big historical mistake." [...] Asked on Channel 4 News in July 2015 why he had called representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah [...] "friends", Corbyn explained, [...] "I use it in a collective way, saying our friends are prepared to talk," [...] and that the specific occasion he used it was to introduce speakers from Hezbollah at a Parliamentary meeting about the Middle East. He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: [...] "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do? No. What it means <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you may profoundly disagree ... There {{is not going to be}} a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Corbyn {{has been}} vocal on Middle East foreign policy. He {{is a member}} of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, campaigning against {{conflict}} in Gaza and what the organisation considers to be [...] "apartheid in Israel". At a meeting hosted by Stop the War Coalition in 2009, Corbyn said he invited [...] "friends" [...] from Hamas and Hezbollah to an event in parliament, referred to Hamas as [...] "an organisation dedicated towards the good of the Palestinian people," [...] and said that the British government's labelling of Hamas as a terrorist organisation is [...] "a big, big historical mistake."

He has called for the lifting of sanctions as part of a negotiated full settlement of issues concerning the Iranian nuclear programme, and the starting of a political process to decommission Israel's nuclear arsenal.|$|E
60|$|Burr. What noise <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I {{hear your}} cousin Trice's voice.|$|E
30|$|Ade: Yeah. They <b>are</b> like <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they <b>are</b> <b>that</b> kind of people.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{was going}} to observe, my dear Madam,"--here the {{resolute}} Clump once more interposed with a bland air--"what I {{was going to}} observe when you gave utterance to sentiments which do you so much honour, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> you alarm yourself needlessly about our kind friend, and sacrifice your own health too prodigally in her favour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is right}} enough, Mrs. Gregory, and I do not {{disguise}} from {{you that the}} fifth of the business is worth {{a great deal more}} than £75, even for a sleeping partner; but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not the question: it is not for the money, but for your interest and partnership, as it <b>were,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it fair <b>that</b> you should still have a share in it." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the worst}} of it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Lucy is in love with Mr. Mackenzie.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was time}} to speak out. 'No, Mr. Tillington,' I said, with decision. 'I will not let you know. One of my reasons for going <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I had better see no more of you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The issue {{between you}} and me, understand, <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> slavery is wrong, and {{ought not to be}} outspread; and you think it is right, and ought to be {{extended}} and perpetuated. [A voice, [...] "Oh, Lord!"] That is my Kentuckian I am talking to now.|$|E
60|$|I {{have now}} {{expressed}} what few words I wish {{to say on}} my own bottom. As {{to what has been}} done in the following pages by the young man who has been employed to look over these memoirs and put them into shape, it is not for me to speak. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they might have read more natural-like had no other cook had a finger in the pie. The facts, however, are facts still. These have not been cooked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am going, sir, to {{make what}} may seem a most {{extraordinary}} request, and indeed it <b>is</b> one <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> out of your power to grant; but, if you give your approval, it will to some extent lessen my responsibility." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Everything I {{had done}} until <b>that</b> time had <b>been</b> wildly successful," [...] he {{recalled}} in 1987, [...] "so that the commercial {{failure of the}} film caught me by surprise. <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> artistically it's a very good film. I've rarely seen a role that showed that kind of vulnerability in a man. It's a special film to me, and if I had to find fault, it would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> some of the music could have included more popular songs of the period." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Ewaine aroused {{himself and}} said: [...] "Lady, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{much of my}} friends and companions of the court of King Arthur. For now nigh to a year hath passed and in all of that time I have heard no single word of any of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It is not finished,' he said, 'and what I {{have written}} does not {{altogether}} satisfy me; {{but you can}} judge from what you have heard how it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of that lady, and how impossible it is that I can in any way banish her from my mind, or willingly from my vision.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have hoped}} so, dear Miss Todd"--he {{had taken a}} moment to consider, and {{thought that he had}} better drop the Sarah {{altogether}} for the present. [...] "In myself, I can safely say that it has been so. With you, I feel that I am happy, and at my ease. Your modes of thought and way of life are all such as I admire and approve,"--Miss Todd again bowed--"and--and--what I mean <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we both live very much after the same fashion." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This <b>is</b> {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{everybody at}} some point and time {{should be concerned about}} as a resident of Houston and as a citizen of the world" [...] Bun B ...|$|R
5000|$|I am unable, when I turn to myself, to {{recognize}} {{any of my}} faculties or my capacities. The inner sensation which I have of myself informs me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have sensory awareness, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suffer, and so on; but it provides me with no knowledge whatever of what I am - {{of the nature of}} my thought, my sensations, my passions, or my pain - or the mutual relations that obtain between all these things ... I have no idea whatever of my soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} {{stand in the}} way of your happiness, Gyp. But it must BE happiness. Can it {{possibly}} <b>be</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> so. You know what they said of him out there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, all I {{have to say}} {{upon that}} subject <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> no man--not even Judge Douglas--can prove it, {{because it is not}} true. I have no doubt he is [...] "conscientious" [...] in saying it. As to those resolutions that he took such a length of time to read, as being the {{platform}} of the Republican party in 1854, I say I never {{had anything to do with}} them, and I think Trumbull never had. Judge Douglas cannot show that either of us ever had anything to do with them....|$|E
60|$|Having thus got {{the idea}} of duration, the next thing natural for the mind to do, is to get some measure of this common duration, whereby it might judge of its {{different}} lengths, and consider the distinct order wherein several things exist; without which {{a great part of}} our knowledge would be confused, and a great part of history be rendered very useless. This consideration of duration, as set out by certain periods and marked by certain measures or epochs, <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> which most properly we call TIME.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now,' said Mr Pecksniff, {{crossing}} his two forefingers in {{a manner}} which was at once conciliatory and argumentative; 'I will not, upon the one hand, {{go so far as}} to say that she deserves all the inflictions which have been so very forcibly and hilariously suggested;' one of his ornamental sentences; 'nor will I, upon the other, on any account compromise my common understanding as a man, by making the assertion that she does not. What I would observe <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> some practical means might be devised of inducing our respected, shall I say our revered--?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] Hilda answered, [...] "as to his direct influence; but don't you think, indirectly, he is {{leavening}} England? A man so wholly out of {{tune with}} the prevailing note of English life could only affect it, of course, by means of disciples and popularisers--often even popularisers who but dimly and distantly apprehend his meaning. He must be interpreted to the English by English intermediaries, half Philistine themselves, who speak his language ill, and who miss {{the greater part of}} his message. Yet only by such half-hints--Why, what <b>was</b> <b>that?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> saw something!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> as <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> She has {{not said}} so to me openly; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it <b>is</b> <b>that.</b> Her mother died early,--and her {{brothers}} and her sisters. It is a sad tale, my lord." ...|$|R
60|$|Alon. Then, as I told you, run {{quickly to}} the corrigidor, and desire him to come hither in person to examine a malefactor. [WILDBLOOD sneezes within.] Hark! what noise <b>is</b> <b>that</b> within? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> one sneezes.|$|R
6000|$|There is {{yet another}} prefatory remark which it seems {{desirable}} I should make. It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it proper to confine myself to the work done, without saying anything about the doers of it. Meddling with questions of merit and priority is a thorny business {{at the best of}} times, and unless in case of necessity, altogether undesirable when one is dealing with contemporaries. No such necessity lies upon me, and I shall, therefore, mention no names of living men, lest, perchance, I should incur the reproof which the Israelites, who struggled with one another in the field, addressed to Moses--'Who made thee a prince and a judge over us.' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{introduction}} is {{made that}} it may bring me {{to what has been}} the foundation of all my further concern in public affairs, and will produce a sufficient reason for my adhering to those whose obligations upon me were too strong to be resisted, even when many things were done by them which I could not approve; and for this reason it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it necessary to distinguish how far I did or did not adhere to, or join in or with, the persons or conduct of the late government; and those who are willing to judge with impartiality and charity, will see reason to use me the more tenderly in their thoughts, when they weigh the particulars.|$|E
6000|$|... [203] Artists who {{glance at}} this book may be {{surprised}} at this permission. My chief reason <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it more necessary that the pupil's eye should be trained to accurate perception of the relations of curve and right lines, by having the latter absolutely true, than that he should practice drawing straight lines. But also, I believe, though I am not quite sure of this, that he never {{ought to be able}} to draw a straight line. I do not believe a perfectly trained hand ever can draw a line without some curvature in it, or some variety of direction. Prout could draw a straight line, but I do not believe Raphael could, nor Tintoret. A great draughtsman can, as far as I have observed, draw every line but a straight one.|$|E

5000|$|In early 2015, federal NDP MP Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst) criticized Cardy's {{leadership}} and its conduct {{in the election}} campaign saying that Cardy had moved the provincial party {{too far to the}} centre. “The problem, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> with the provincial party, with Dominic, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he <b>was</b> too much to the right to even be in the centre, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people read into that," [...] said Godin who added: “I think it did hurt the party. People were looking for the NDP, they were doing really well, and voters wanted change from the existing parties that we have now, who are serving the big corporations and forgetting about the people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> what happened.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{who does}} manage the hospital?" [...] asked the warden. [...] "Oh, let them find that out; that's another question: {{the action is}} brought against you and Chadwick; that's your defence, and a perfect and full defence it <b>is.</b> Now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> very satisfactory." ...|$|R
