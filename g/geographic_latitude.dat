500|$|A {{spherical surface}} {{like that of}} the Earth {{provides}} a simple example. The location of any point on the surface can be described by two coordinates: the <b>geographic</b> <b>latitude</b> and longitude. Unlike the Cartesian coordinates of the plane, coordinate differences {{are not the same as}} distances on the surface, as shown in the diagram on the right: for someone at the equator, moving 30 degrees of longitude westward (magenta line) corresponds to a distance of roughly [...] On the other hand, someone at a latitude of 55 degrees, moving 30 degrees of longitude westward (blue line) covers a distance of merely [...] Coordinates therefore do not provide enough information to describe the geometry of a spherical surface, or indeed the geometry of any more complicated space or spacetime. That information is precisely what is encoded in the metric, which is a function defined at each point of the surface (or space, or spacetime) and relates coordinate differences to differences in distance. All other quantities that are of interest in geometry, such as the length of any given curve, or the angle at which two curves meet, can be computed from this metric function.|$|E

Humidity is known to impact lipid δD values at moderate humidity levels, but not at particularly high (>80%) or low (<40%) humidity levels, and a broad trend of enriched δD values, meaning smaller εl/w, is seen in arid regions.

2500|$|Solar {{energy was}} {{particularly}} attractive for two reasons. First was the abundance {{and strength of}} the sun's rays on Israeli land. Israel's <b>geographic</b> <b>latitude</b> location is on the 30th parallel north, where the annual incident solar irradiance is 2000 kWh per sq.m. [...] Second, Israeli land lacks oil, and the conflicts with its neighbors made the procurement of a stable source of energy a national priority.

40|$|In {{this article}} we present {{examples}} of a wider study of space-time correlation of electron precipitation event of the Van Allen belts with the position and time of occurrence of strong (M> 6. 5) earthquakes. The study {{is based on the}} analysis of observations of electron bursts (EBs) with energies 70 - 2350 keV at middle <b>geographic</b> <b>latitudes,</b> which were detected by DEMETER satellite (at an altitude of ~ 700 km). The EBs show a relative peak-to-background increase usually < 100, they have a time duration ~ 0. 5 - 3 min, energy spectrum with peaks moving in higher energies as the satellite moves towards the equator, and highest energy limit <~ 500 keV. The EBs are observed in the presence of VLF waves. The flux-time profile of the EBs varies in East Asia and Mediterranean Sea at the similar <b>geographic</b> <b>latitudes,</b> due to the differentiation of the magnitude of the earth's magnetic field. The most important result of our study is the characteristic temporal variation of electron precipitation variation which begins with incremental rate several days / a few weeks before major earthquakes, then presents a maximum, and finally become weaker, with a minimun or a pause of the electron precipitation some hours before the onset of the earthquake.
