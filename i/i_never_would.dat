500|$|Vargas Llosa has mainly {{lived in}} Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly {{three months of}} the year in Peru with his {{extended}} family. He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: [...] "I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling". He then added: [...] "I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have reached this podium or become a known writer".|$|E

500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

During the second day she performed well in the long-jump and javelin events, getting near personal bests which put her into the third-place position going into the final event, the 800 metres. She would finish third in her heat and win the bronze medal scoring 6653 behind winner and upstart Nafissatou Thiam, with Jessica Ennis-Hill finishing second.

He [...] "suffered numerous broken bones and intracranial bleeding", and over a four-hour period, he had no blood pressure, heartbeat or pulse for about 20 minutes. A few days later the trauma triggered a near-fatal heart attack. While he was recovering from his injuries, he collaborated with John Bishop on the book There Are No Accidents: In All Things Trust in God. He broadcast his first live program on EWTN on October 24, 2004.

2500|$|Heston {{turned down}} the lead {{opposite}} Marilyn Monroe in Let's Make Love to appear in Benn W. Levy's play The Tumbler, directed by Laurence Olivier. Called a [...] "harrowingly pretentious verse drama" [...] by Time, the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960. Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play {{to work with him}} as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, [...] "I feel I am the only one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have learned otherwise. I think I've ended up a better actor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitler {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933.

[...] Nevertheless, Mein Kampf was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s. During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front. [...] By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages. By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Crumb {{first saw}} the film in February 1972, {{during a visit to}} Los Angeles with fellow {{underground}} cartoonists Spain Rodriguez, S.Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, and Rick Griffin. According to Bakshi, Crumb was dissatisfied with the film. Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead. Crumb later {{said in an interview that}} he felt that the film was [...] "really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some kind of weird, unfunny way.... I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively." [...] Crumb also criticized the film's condemnation of the radical left, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song [...] "The End", as [...] "red-neck and fascistic" [...] and stated, [...] "They put words into his mouth that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have had him say." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some sources {{state that}} Abel was ordained by Joseph Smith, while other records {{indicate}} that he was ordained to the priesthood by Zebedee Coltrin. Despite the incongruity of the sources, Abel's ordination to the Seventy was performed by Coltrin. In his own words Coltrin recounts [...] "I said <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> again Annoint another person who had Negro blood in him. [...] unless I was commanded by the Prophet to do so." [...] It is apparent that Coltrin acted voluntarily, but did so with another motive than to solely have him anointed. Coltrin made the claim that Abel had been ordained to the Seventy {{in exchange for his}} work on the Nauvoo Temple, but that later Joseph Smith had [...] "dropped" [...] Abel from the Quorum. John Taylor stated that Abel had been given the priesthood, but that it had later been removed. [...] Furthermore, another version of this encounter states that Joseph declared blacks could be baptized, but not have the priesthood. Neither version has proper evidence supporting it. In the end, the meeting of 1879 was not directly about Abel and his holding the priesthood, but resulted in the reaffirmation of the policy banning blacks from having the priesthood.|$|E
2500|$|This {{offensive}} shootout {{became the}} first puntless game in NFL playoff history. For the second game in a row, Colts punter Hunter Smith took the day off while quarterback Peyton Manning completed 22 of 30 passes for 304 {{yards and three touchdowns}} (to Reggie Wayne, Brandon Stokley and Tom Lopienski), while Edgerrin James ran for a career postseason high 125 yards and two scores. On the Kansas City side, Dante Hall caught a touchdown and returned seven kickoffs for 207 yards and another score, and Priest Holmes, who set the regular-season rushing touchdown record in 2003, rushed for 176 yards, caught five passes for 32 yards, and scored twice. Kansas City's 33-year-old quarterback Trent Green threw for 212 yards and a touchdown while also rushing for 18 yards in his first career postseason game. A touchdown pass called back by a penalty and Holmes' third-quarter fumble, which set up a Colts' field goal, turned out to be too much for the Chiefs to overcome. Kansas City defensive coordinator Greg Robinson resigned the following week in disgrace. [...] "He is the master," [...] defensive end Eric Hicks said of Manning. [...] "That was an amazing performance. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> have thought a quarterback would play two games in a row like that. They took us behind the woodshed and just beat us.
