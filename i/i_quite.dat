25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time I beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E
500|$|One of Zoe's {{first and}} main storylines was being stalked by fellow student Will Hackett (Oliver Farnworth). Lister later {{commented on the}} storyline, {{deciding}} it was her most memorable: [...] "The most memorable for me {{was the one with}} my weird boyfriend Will who stalked me. Like I said, it was a bit weird, but <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> liked it as a storyline." [...] During a fire safety promotion undertaken with co-star Lena Kaur, who plays Leila Roy, Lister referenced the storyline, commenting: [...] "It's much easier to test your smoke alarm once a week and plan your escape from fire than it is to escape from a psycho!".|$|E
500|$|During {{a promotional}} {{interview}} in September, {{the month before}} the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with Damon Albarn and Alex James from Blur, and {{was quoted in the}} 17 September edition of The Observer saying he hoped [...] "the pair of them would catch AIDS and die because I fucking hate them two." [...] The quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that [...] "my whole world came crashing down in on me then". However, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, Blur's guitarist Graham Coxon explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. [...] "At least they were outright about it. They weren't pretending to like us and then slagging us off, which is what we'd been used to. In that way, <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> appreciated them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{complexity}} of the script of the pilot episode and the show's concept was cited as a potential issue for the series. Salke evaluated that viewers will enjoy the [...] "clever mythology that overlap and affect each other in very interesting ways", despite the series' Sliding Doors-like script. Upon reading the script, Isaacs {{felt that it was}} [...] "incredibly hard" [...] and complicated to comprehend. [...] "Do you always know what reality you're in? [...] That's become a [...] It was hard but <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> like hard work." [...] Isaacs later suggested that it might be too brooding for mainstream American television, and that it could potentially be the [...] "U-bend of scripts". He stated that every pilot comes from people who have [...] "amazing prestige", and that there are lots of [...] "talented people, but the head of the network chooses only one." [...] Despite such concerns, Gordon asserted that the concept of Awake was a concept that you could understand if you sat down and paid attention to it properly.|$|E
500|$|In 1822, {{the first}} animal {{protection}} law was enacted in the British parliament, {{followed by the}} Cruelty to Animals Act (1876), the first law specifically aimed at regulating animal testing. The legislation was promoted by Charles Darwin, who wrote to Ray Lankester in March 1871: [...] "You ask about my opinion on vivisection. <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> {{agree that it is}} justifiable for real investigations on physiology; but not for mere damnable and detestable curiosity. It is a subject which makes me sick with horror, so I will not say another word about it, else I shall not sleep to-night." [...] In response to the lobbying by anti-vivisectionists, several organizations were set up in Britain to defend animal research: The Physiological Society was formed in 1876 to give physiologists [...] "mutual benefit and protection", the Association for the Advancement of Medicine by Research was formed in 1882 and focused on policy-making, and the Research Defence Society (now Understanding Animal Research) was formed in 1908 [...] "to make known the facts as to experiments on animals in this country; the immense importance to the welfare of mankind of such experiments and the great saving of human life and health directly attributable to them".|$|E
500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and I like that because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Homer's Night Out" [...] finished fourteenth {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of March 19–25, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.9. It was the second highest rated show on the Fox network that week. [...] "Homer's Night Out" [...] received generally positive reviews from critics. In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 4/5 and named it one of his two favorite episodes of the season. He added that it [...] "allows us to see that Homer really does love Marge a lot without having to blatantly stamp sentimentality all over it. The episode is strange, goofy and fun." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said that [...] "the concept of Marge’s anger at Homer got old, but this episode managed to offer a reasonably entertaining affair. It was fun to see Homer treated like a party god, and this offered a few nice moments. The overall level of quality remained good throughout the show, but it didn’t rise to any great heights." [...] David Packard at DVD Verdict said {{in a review of}} The Simpsons [...] "Gone Wild" [...] DVD that [...] "this episode sports some of the awkward animation and voice work that is prevalent in episodes from the first season. That aspect isn't an issue to me; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> enjoy season one as it shows the early efforts of the series getting its legs in making the transition from its origin on The Tracey Ullman Show. The problem I have with this episode is that it's not particularly funny. I chuckled a few times, but the episode doesn't have the rollicking gags and sly humor of the two episodes to follow." ...|$|E

Afterwards it was {{announced}} that local rivals Bristol Rovers were interested in a ground-share at the County Ground while the Memorial Stadium was redeveloped; fans and TrustSTFC opposed the move with vice-chairman Andy Ratcliffe stating: [...] "I think it’s a double-edged sword to be honest. <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> understand the attraction from the club’s point of view. Obviously it would be extra revenue and that has to be welcome. Against that, I think there is potential for flash points and I think the police and traders would have serious concerns." ...|$|E

He noted Wallace's point that geological knowledge was imperfect, and commented [...] "put generation for creation & <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> agree".

Emanuel also made an [...] "interesting point" [...] about questioning proponent's objectivity when it came to strong emotional or political issues that they hold. Seitz also contends that many others are reluctant to speak out for fear of being stigmatized as [...] "closet Dr. Strangeloves", physicist Freeman Dyson of Princeton for example stated [...] "It's an absolutely atrocious piece of science, but <b>I</b> <b>quite</b> despair of setting the public record straight."
