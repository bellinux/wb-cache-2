40|$|A {{method for}} the {{detection}} and measurement of surface defects is described: it includes {{the use of a}} <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> system and the application of digital image processing and automated computer analysis for quantitative information. Calibration tests on defects of known sizes have been carried out and the possibility of applying the method to studying the state of artwork conservation is examined...|$|E
40|$|Moire contouring, {{scanning}} interferometry, and <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> {{were examined}} {{to determine their}} practicality and potential to meet performance requirements for a model deflection sensor. The system envisioned is to be nonintrusive, and is {{to be capable of}} mapping or contouring the surface of a 1 -meter by 1 -meter model with a resolution of 50 to 100 points. The available literature was surveyed, and computations and analyses were performed to establish specific performance requirements, as well as the capabilities and limitations of such a sensor within the geometry of the NTF section test section. Of the three systems examined, <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> offers the most promise. Unlike Moire, it is not hampered by limited contour spacing and extraneous fringes. Its transverse resolution can far exceed the limited point sampling resolution of scanning heterodyne interferometry. The availability of the ruby laser as a high power, pulsed, multiple wavelength source makes such a system feasible within the NTF...|$|E
40|$|An {{electro-optical}} {{system for the}} detection and quantitative measurements of surface or subsurface defects is presented; {{it is based on}} a <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> technique and digital image processing for an automatic analysis of fringe patterns. Several approaches have been followed on models, so that the defects can be unambiguously detected and possibly quantitatively analyzed. Some examples of applications in deterioration investigations of ancient artworks are reported...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of laser diodes and monomode fibre optics into an Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometer (ESPI) {{has led to}} the development of a novel <b>holographic</b> surface <b>contouring</b> system. Height contours are obtained by switching between two laser wavelengths. Contour intervals from 0. 5 - 5 mm have been generated by modulating the injection current of a single laser diode source and are demonstrated on an automotive disc brake hub...|$|R
40|$|A dual-wavelength {{femtosecond}} laser pulse source and its application for digital <b>holographic</b> single-shot <b>contouring</b> are presented. The synthesized laser source combines sub-picosecond time scales {{with a wide}} reconstruction range. A center wavelength distance of the two separated pulses of only 15 nm with a high contrast was demonstrated by spectral shaping of the 50 nm broad seed spectrum centered at 800 nm. Owing to the resulting synthetic wavelength, the scan depth range without phase ambiguity is extended to the 100 -?m-range. Single-shot dual-wavelength imaging is achieved by using two CMOS cameras in a Twyman-Green interferometer, which is extended by a polarization encoding sequence to separate the holograms. The principle of the method is revealed, and experimental results concerning a single axis scanner mirror operating at a resonance frequency of 0. 5 kHz are presented. Within the synthetic wavelength, the phase difference information of the object was unambiguously retrieved and the 3 D-shape calculated. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that single-shot two-wavelength contouring on a sub-ps time scale is reported...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a double-exposure <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> technique by {{the movement of}} the object beam through fibre optics. Single-mode optic fibres are used to transfer both object and reference beams. Between two exposures the object illumination beam is displaced. The contouring fringes can be visualised on the object surfaces. The fringe patterns are automatically processed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) method, which produces a 3 D perspective plot. Examples are given for different objects. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Design of a {{distributed}} holographic {{interferometric sensor}} {{for measuring the}} surface displacement of a large segmented reflector is proposed. The reflector's surface is illuminated by laser light of two wavelengths and volume holographic gratings are formed in photorefractive crystals of the wavefront returned from the surface. The sensor is based on <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> with a multiple frequency source. It is shown that the most stringent requirement of temporal stability affects both the temporal resolution and the dynamic range. Principal factor which limit the sensor performance include the response time of photorefractive crystal, laser power required to write a hologram, {{and the size of}} photorefractive crystal...|$|E
40|$|<b>Holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> of {{high-speed}} microelectromechanical system optical scanner mirrors operating at resonance frequencies close to 1 kHz is performed with ultrashort-pulse lasers containing two spectral components. These particular pulses are obtained by shaping {{the spectrum of}} sub- 30 fs pulses of a Ti:sapphire laser system by an acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter. The separation of the two spectral components is adjustable within the 50 -nm gain bandwidth. Single-pulse dual-wavelength contouring is achieved by an extended Twyman-Green type interferometer including two CMOS cameras. The deformation obtained from a single-wavelength interferogram is combined with the coarse-shape information deduced from the phase difference map of the two interferograms captured at different wavelengths to yield a combined reconstruction...|$|E
40|$|The acousto-mechanical-transformer {{behavior}} of the Tympanic Membrane (TM) is determined by its geometry (shape and thickness) and mechanical properties. The questions of “How the TM couples acoustic energy to the ossicles? ” and “How TM shape and vibration affect this series of events? ” {{have yet to be}} fully answered. Holographic studies of 1 D vibrations of the TM have been reported by several groups; however, 3 D measurements of TM motions are few. In this study, we use full-field-of-view holographic techniques to measure near simultaneously the shape and 3 D sound-induced displacement of cadaveric human TMs. Combinations of shape and 3 D displacement measurements are used to characterize motions tangent and normal to the TM plane. Methods We developed a digital holographic system capable of full-field measurements of shape and three-dimensional sound-induced motion of the TM. The spatial resolution of the measuring system is> 1, 000, 000 points per the 70 mm 2 TM area, and the temporal resolution is determined by the 50 kHz limit of the acousto-optic modulator used to strobe the phasic illumination. The method of dual-wavelength <b>holographic</b> <b>contouring</b> was used to measure the shape of the T...|$|E
