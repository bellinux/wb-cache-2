25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being pretty fast, he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E

David Chater of The Times was positive towards the episode, stating [...] "just in case you think you're having an exhausting time {{in the run-up to}} Christmas, spare a thought for Lucas North [...] his lover is a liar, a murderer and a traitor", and also noted that [...] "the <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Spooks is that they will always stop and explain how serious things are".|$|E

Series creator Matt Groening stated: [...] "Since the very beginning, I’ve always wanted {{to have on the}} most iconic personalities of our time, and she's it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, Groening further commented on Gaga's appearance; [...] "The <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> having Lady Gaga is that she came in a number of times and always with a different getup.

500|$|The {{previous}} single from X, [...] "Talk", was {{a tribute}} to the German band Kraftwerk; similarly, [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was intended by Coldplay to acknowledge American band R.E.M.

[...] The band felt the track resembled R.E.M.'s 1991 single, [...] "Losing My Religion". [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] was left out of the album track list when the band sent an early version of X to their record label, Parlophone, but was included when the album was finalised.|$|E
500|$|The game is {{the sequel}} to Cannon Fodder, which drew {{criticism}} for its juxtaposition of war and humour and its use of iconography closely resembling the remembrance poppy. The cover art's poppy was ultimately replaced with a soldier, in turn replaced by a hand grenade for Cannon Fodder 2, regarding which Amiga Power joked: [...] "the <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> an explosive charge wrapped in hundreds of meters wound-inflicting wire is that it doesn't have the same child-frightening, 'responsible adult' freaking, society-disrupting effect as an iddy-biddy flower." [...] The One felt the new historical and science-fiction themes an attempt to avoid similar controversy as befell Cannon Fodder. Amiga Power itself had become embroiled in the controversy due to its planned use of the poppy on its cover (also abandoned) and perceived inflammatory commentary its editor Stuart Campbell. Campbell later left the magazine to join Sensible Software as a programmer and worked on the sequel as his first game.|$|E

500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{was also}} {{considered}} one of the best episodes of the first season by the production crew. According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> 'Ice' is {{that we were able to}} convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring the hell out of the audience was definitely the key to the episode". Anderson said that [...] "it was very intense. There was a lot of fear and paranoia going on. We had some great actors to work with".|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life.

He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> me.

[...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline".

500|$|When {{the studio}} hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct Thor and , respectively, it made sure both {{directors}} {{were open to}} the idea of a shared universe and including Avengers set-up scenes in their films.

You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only affect your movie, but may have a ripple effect that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic." [...] Anthony added, [...] "The <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the Marvel , just like the publishing , it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters." [...] He added that, for directors to [...] "fit" [...] in at Marvel, they must understand how to [...] "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.|$|E

[...] "It involves first-step quickness to the ball, which will increase his range. [...] soften his hands a little bit. [...] hand-eye coordination to the ball needs to be a little better. That comes with repetition, repetition, repetition." [...] Braun finished 2007 last of all eligible third basemen in fielding percentage (.895, with 26 errors; only the fourth third baseman since 1916 to play 100 games or more in a season and have a fielding percentage under [...]900), range factor (2.11), and zone rating (.697).

I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at the time and I was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'.

I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her.
