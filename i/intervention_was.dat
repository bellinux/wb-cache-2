5|$|At {{the centre}} of power, the kings {{employed}} a succession of clergy as chancellors, responsible for running the royal chancery, while the familia regis, the military household, emerged {{to act as a}} bodyguard and military staff. England's bishops continued to form an important part in local administration, alongside the nobility. Henry I and Henry II both implemented significant legal reforms, extending and widening the scope of centralised, royal law; by the 1180s, the basis for the future English common law had largely been established, with a standing law court in Westminster—an early Common Bench—and travelling judges conducting eyres around the country. King John extended the royal role in delivering justice, and the extent of appropriate royal <b>intervention</b> <b>was</b> one of the issues addressed in the Magna Carta of 1215.

5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry {{to protect them from}} the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions. Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{application}} of evidence-based lifestyle <b>interventions</b> <b>is</b> suboptimal, but little <b>is</b> known what <b>interventions</b> <b>are</b> actually used. This study {{aimed to explore}} the range of lifestyle interventions used in Dutch ambulatory health care settings. METHOD: We conducted interviews (n = 67) in purposefully selected hospitals, general practices, and community care organizations. Interviews focused on identifying activities to help patients stop smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, increase physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and lose weight. We also asked who developed the interventions. All reported activities were registered and analyzed. RESULTS: Four categories of health promotion activities emerged: giving advice, making referrals, offering counseling, and providing lifestyle interventions organized separately from the care process. In total, 102 lifestyle <b>interventions</b> <b>were</b> reported. Forty-five <b>interventions</b> <b>were</b> developed by researchers, of which 30 were developed by the Dutch Expert Center on Tobacco Control.

2500|$|Applied {{behavior}} analysis (ABA) is {{a scientific}} discipline concerned with developing techniques {{based on the}} principles of learning and applying these to change behavior of social significance. Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The <b>intervention</b> <b>is</b> effective {{to the extent that the}} behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.
