50|$|<b>Flestolol</b> is a short-acting beta {{adrenergic}} receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Acylation of glycidol (2) {{with the}} acid {{chloride}} 1 produces the ester 3. Reaction of that intermediate with amine 4, obtained by reaction of 1,1-dimethylethylenediamine with urea, gives <b>flestolol</b> (5).|$|E
40|$|The {{steady state}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>flestolol,</b> a short acting beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, were studied in six healthy subjects following intravenous infusion of six different doses; 18, 24, 35, 50, 75 and 100 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1, for 60 min. Steady state blood levels increased linearly with dose for all six subjects. The overall mean half-life was 6. 5 min. The {{total body clearance}} averaged 208 ml min- 1 kg- 1 indicating significant extrahepatic metabolism of the drug. There were no {{significant changes in the}} half-lives or the total body clearances after the six doses, suggesting that the kinetics of <b>flestolol</b> are linear over the dose range studied...|$|E
