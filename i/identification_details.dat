50|$|The {{cemetery}} {{also contains}} a Chinese ceremonial burner, (a heung lew or xiang lu), {{thought to be the}} only one of its type and age in Queensland, which was used for burning symbolic papers and offerings for the dead. There were many Chinese in Mount Morgan from its inception working in mining, trade and market gardening. Most Chinese in Australia in the 19th century were sojourners, working here to earn money and then return home. Traditionally, Chinese who died overseas were buried locally and their remains exhumed and repatriated when this could be arranged by their families. Because of this custom, some burials were accompanied by a bottle containing <b>identification</b> <b>details,</b> rather than by erecting a headstone. Many such burials were not, in fact, relocated and the burner was used both for funerary offerings and for special festival offerings. The shrine {{is one of the few}} physical reminders of the Chinese community of Mount Morgan, who played an important role in developing the town. It is not known if there are still accompanying burials.|$|E

50|$|The adult {{crowned eagle}} is quite strikingly plumaged. Its crown is dark to rufous-tinged brown with a prominent, oft-raised black-tipped double crest, which {{can give the}} head a {{somewhat}} triangular appearance. The upperparts of an adult are a blackish brown-grey color, with a variable tinge of blue. The throat is brown while the belly and breast are white overlaid densely with blackish bars and blotches, variably marked with cream or rich buff-rufous coloration. The wing primaries are white at the base, broadly tipped with black and crossed by two black bars. The tail is black with brownish-grey bands. The thighs and legs are barred and closely spotted with black and white. The underwing coverts of adults are a bold chestnut coloration, spotted lightly with black. The adult crowned eagle has eyes that can range from yellow to almost white, a cere and feet of an ochre-yellow color and black talons. In the wild, misidentification of an adult is improbable thanks to the species' bearing and voice. The strongly barred outer wings and tail are all diagnostic in flight. Further simplifying <b>identification,</b> <b>details</b> such as the crest, the bird's upright perching posture and large size are unique to this animal. While they do differ somewhat in size, the genders' sexual dimorphism by size is relatively modest and eagles {{are unlikely to be}} sexed by this alone. However, the male may be distinguished by his more rapid wing beats (4 or 5 per second) from the more sluggish female (3 or 4 per second).|$|E

40|$|Many {{financial}} organisations (i. e. {{banks and}} insurance companies) have databases on {{individuals and their}} major transactions. These databases have different uses such as obtaining a historical record of an individual. Often the (legal) circumstances mean that a unique identifier for each individual does not exist or cannot be used. Instead personal <b>identification</b> <b>details</b> (names, addresses, dates of birth etc.) must be used to "index" and retrieve records. This is an inexact method and often results in ambiguous situations where multiple records are returned for an enquiry. Disambiguating these situations we term the profile resolution problem.

40|$|Abstract A taxonomic {{revision}} of the Asian species of Stuckenia, a segregate of Potamogeton, is presented. Six species are recognized and their morphological descriptions, nomenclature and typification of relevant names are given. Distribu-tions of all species are described and lists of representative specimens and distribution maps provided. Lectotypes are designated for 24 names and nomencla-tural types are listed for 22 additional names. The correct name for the species known as Potamogeton recurvatus is Stuckenia pamirica (Baagöe) Z.

40|$|Healthcare {{institutions}} adapt {{cloud based}} archiving of medical images and patient records {{to share them}} efficiently. Controlled access to these records and authentication of images must be enforced to mitigate fraudulent activities and medical errors. This paper presents a zero-watermarking scheme implemented in the composite Contourlet Transform (CT) —Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) domain for unambiguous authentication of medical images. Further, a framework is proposed for accessing patient records based on the watermarking scheme. The patient <b>identification</b> <b>details</b> and a link to patient data encoded into a Quick Response (QR) code serves as the watermark. In the proposed scheme, the medical image is not subjected to degradations due to watermarking. Patient authentication and authorized access to patient data are realized on combining a Secret Share with the Master Share constructed from invariant features of the medical image. The Hu’s invariant image moments are exploited in creating the Master Share.

3000|$|According to the {{anti-phishing}} working {{report in}} the second half of 2014, 123, 972 unique phishing attacks were found worldwide between July to December 2014 [8]. E-commerce, banks, and money transfer companies are the most targeted industries by these attacks. Seventy-five percent of phishing websites used five top-level domains namely [...].com, [...].tk, [...].pw, [...].cf, and [...].net. The median uptime of phishing websites {{in the second half}} of 2014 increased to 10  h and 6  min (i.e., half of all phishing attacks stay active for slightly more than 10  h) [8]. Internet services providers (ISPs) were the most targeted industry sector during the first three quarters of 2015, surpassing the banking and financial service sectors coming in second and third during the 9 -month period [9]. The attackers targeted Internet services providers because ISP account contains the <b>identification</b> <b>details</b> of users, credit card information, and secret information regarding the domain name [10, 11]. An attacker can also send the spam mail from the hacked user’s account. One of the major problems of 2015 is the Business Email Compromise (BEC) scam [9].

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} an {{experimental}} method {{to determine the}} electric parameters of a seven-phase low-voltage multiphase drive. The drive is a belt driven starter-alternator for powerful cars with Hybrid Electrical Vehicles (HEV) functions. The resistive and inductive parameters are necessary to obtain the six characteristic time constants of the control modeling. Classical direct measurements lead to imprecise results because of very low values for the windings electric resistance (a few mΩ) and inductance (a few μH). Effects of the imprecision on the measurements are {{all the more important}} that time constants are obtained by a ratio of cyclic inductances by resistance, with cyclic inductances being a linear combination of seven measured inductances. The methodology for <b>identification</b> <b>detailed</b> in this paper is based on a stator current vector control, in a multi-reference frame.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper proposes an {{essential}} maintenance strategy for riveted railway bridges {{based on an}} accurate remaining fatigue life estimation technique. The strategy mainly consists of structural appraisal based critical members and connections identification, remaining fatigue lives estimation of critical connections and time dependent member replacement or strengthening scheme. In the stage of critical member <b>identification,</b> <b>detailed</b> structural appraisal has to be conducted giving priority to visual inspection for condition, FE analysis, and material testing, experimental static and dynamic load testing. Accurate fatigue life estimation techniques of both members and connections consist of measured stress histories and recently developed new fatigue models. A verification of the proposed strategy is conducted by comparing the predicted replacement scheme with sequence of experimental failure and fatigue life of selected test specimens. Finally, the proposed strategy was applied to a case study railway bridge to obtain time dependent member replacement scheme and obtained results are compared with previous estimations. Hence, validity and merits of proposed strategy were confirmed...|$|R
