50|$|The {{salinity}} of {{the water}} body is also a determining factor {{in the kinds of}} species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity</b> in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of wetland (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species. Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{salinity}}</b> in oceans is {{a driver}} of the world's ocean circulation, where density changes due to both salinity changes and temperature changes at {{the surface of the}} ocean produce changes in buoyancy, which cause the sinking and rising of water masses. Changes in the salinity of the oceans are thought to contribute to global changes in carbon dioxide as more saline waters are less soluble to carbon dioxide. In addition, during glacial periods, the hydrography is such that a possible cause of reduced circulation is the production of stratified oceans. Hence it is difficult in this case to subduct water through the thermohaline circulation.|$|E

50|$|Ambulocetus, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. They were vaguely crocodile-like mammals, possessing large brevirostrine jaws. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Sea in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral mollusks. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed a range of water with different <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity,</b> with some specimens having no evidence of sea water consumption and others that did not ingest fresh water {{at the time when}} their teeth were fossilized.

50|$|In oceanography, isopycnals {{are used}} to display the {{vertical}} distribution of water density. In a body of water, as the depth increases, so does the density. Varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity,</b> temperature, and pressure act to modify the density of water, and the denser water always lies below the less dense water. This creates distinguishable layers of water differing physical properties. This phenomenon is called stratification. The strata are {{held in place by}} the large differences in physical and chemical properties between layers that prevent mixing. Turbulence can cause upset boundaries between the layers, causing them to bend, which would cause the isopycnals to appear uneven. The ways in which the isopycnals are transformed can be used by oceanographers to identify the force that caused the underwater disturbance.|$|R
50|$|Anadara subcrenata {{is found}} around {{the coasts of}} Japan and South Korea, buried in soft sediments in the subtidal zone. It favours mud or muddy sand. Some {{authorities}} maintain that the larvae, known as spats, need some hard materials such as stones and shells on which to attach themselves by their byssal threads. Other authorities claim that the larvae do not need hard substrates on which to settle. Anadara subcrenata is tolerant of low salinities and favours waters in the range 29-32 ppt. While the larvae are planktonic, they have a preference for even lower salinities of between 24.6 and 30 ppt and tend to congregate in estuarine waters with this <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity.</b> The clam thrives in waters varying in temperature between 5 °C and 28 °C. It also tolerates the low dissolved oxygen levels of tidal waters sweeping in over mud flats. It may be aided in this by the haemoglobin and erythrocytes found in its blood.|$|E
5000|$|Lagoons are shallow, often {{elongated}} {{bodies of}} water separated from a larger body of water by a shallow or exposed shoal, coral reef, or similar feature.

Richard A. Davis Jr. restricts [...] "lagoon" [...] to bodies of water with little or no fresh water inflow, and little or no tidal flow, and calls any bay that receives a regular flow of fresh water an [...] "estuary". Davis does state that the terms [...] "lagoon" [...] and [...] "estuary" [...] are [...] "often loosely applied, even in scientific literature." [...] Timothy M. Kusky characterizes lagoons as normally being elongated parallel to the coast, while estuaries are usually drowned river valleys, elongated perpendicular to the coast.

50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, the inner marshes were drained {{to make them}} into fields for crops and then later {{pastures}} for livestock.

Finally, however, the fields were abandoned and began to break up. Once more the tide was allowed in, and the natural process of regeneration slowly began. Its progress was hindered, however, by the invasion of the exotic flora referred to previously.Faced with this problem, the local population undertook an environmental improvement project in the marsh. It aimed to encourage the correct use of the marsh through birdwatching.

Review of HBR immediate response in acute exposure and acclimation to changes <b>of</b> <b>salinity,</b> thermal stressors and air exposure were examined to test dierent hypothesis. In intertidal Mediterranean and tropical limpets, the decrease in metabolic rate with a decrease in salinity was dierent in animals experiencing dierent <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity</b> !uctuation in their respective microhabitats. Intertidal limpets respond to temperature increases, increasing HBR and metabolic rate. Furthermore, when reaching the highest temperature experienced in #eld, HBR shows extreme responses as secondary bradicardia. Finally, when exposed to dry/saturated air cycles, lower shore intertidal limpets show regular alternation of normal HBR and acardia, whilst the upper shore limpet showed transient acardia only during exposure to dry air.

40|$|A {{proposed}} new method for predicting the occurrence <b>of</b> dryland <b>salinity</b> is to 1) map current outbreaks <b>of</b> dryland <b>salinity</b> at a broad regional scale; 2) process {{the results of}} investigations at various scales of inquiry; and 3) develop predictive tools using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In New South Wales, Australia, the clearing of native vegetation has led to increased groundwater recharge, with a subsequent rise of water tables, thereby resulting in dryland salinity. Areas where increased recharge was observed throughout the State correspond to broad areas of vegetation clearing. Relationships also exist between the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>salinity</b> and the interaction of particular land attributes and environmental features that result in groundwater levels approaching the land surface.

40|$|Diatoms are key {{indicators}} of water health. By observing {{their response to}} varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity,</b> {{it is possible to}} determine how polluted water affects diatom abundance and diversity. In this study, diatom response was analyzed after a three week exposure to varying strengths of conductivity ranging from 40 µS/cm to 3, 500 µS/cm. It was hypothesized that initial diatom assemblages would change when exposed to different salinities due to different salt tolerances among species. Diatoms were obtained from an oligotrophic section of Spring Creek, Center County, PA, and treatments were created by introducing sodium chloride into stream water. Species abundance and diversity shifts over time were observed. A shift in assemblage did occur; high conductivity treatments were marked with an overwhelming presence of Nitzschia palea, Nitzschia capitellata, and Nitzschia dissipata as compared to low conductivity treatments. This experiment resembles what occurs when acid mine drainage or Marcellus Shale groundwater enters a system and significantly increases salinity, or when enormous amounts of Diatoms have been widely accepted as {{key indicators}} of water quality in assessing stream or lake health.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a retrospective study of serum biochemistry and hematologic findings from displaced, out-of-habitat bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) exposed to various low salinity environments in waters {{along the southern}} United States including southeastern Atlantic and northern Gulf of Mexico. Serum sodium, chloride, and calculated osmolality were significantly lower and below reference ranges in displaced animals compared to free-ranging case control animals. This suggests clinical hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and hypo-osmolality due to an uptake of low saline water from the environment. In addition, {{significant differences were found}} in other serum chemistry variables, although none were outside of normal reference ranges for non-controlled free-ranging animals. Multiple linear regressions demonstrated the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity</b> had a greater pathophysiologic response than the duration of fresh water exposure.

These findings suggest that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity</b> is a critical factor when assessing and managing care for dolphins chronically exposed to low salinity water.

40|$|Salinity is {{a problem}} of {{irrigation}} agriculture and is recognized as a serious threat to crop production in the Western States. All water used for irrigation, whether diverted from surface stream or pumped from wells, contains dissolved salts in amounts varying from a few hundred pounds to several tons per acre-foot (8, 23). Salts accumulating in the root zone of the soil, as water is removed by crop and by surface evaporation eventually, may restrict crop yields. Extensive areas of land in the Western States, which were at one time productive under irrigation, have been abandoned because of the development of saline or alkali conditions (15, 23). This outright abandonment of lands not only materially reduce total crop production but increases the burden on lands that are productive, by way of increased taxes, and per-acre cost of reclamation and construction. Depreciated land values and unfavorable social and economic changes often result. In addition to losses from abandonment of lands resulting from intense saline or alkali conditions, there are losses from reduced crop yields caused by lesser <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>salinity.</b> The latter go unrecognized and unheeded over large areas of irrigated land.
