Around 496 {{they were forced to}} leave, led by Huémac I (476-572), and many of them moved to Tula. The others migrated to Tlillan-Tlapallan. The Toltecs and Chichimeca were constantly at war. Huémac <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace with the Chichimeca and form a permanent monarchy. In the treaty, the Tlatoani to succeed Huémac was to be Chalchiuhtlanetzin, who was Chichimeca. The date that the treaty was created is disputed, but was probably 510 or 567. Either way Huémac continued living after Chalchiuhtlanetzin was crowned.|$|E
