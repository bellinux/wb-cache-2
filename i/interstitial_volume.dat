METHODS [...] A single blind histomorphometric assessment was done of cortical <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> fraction from biopsy specimens taken intraoperatively and at one, six, and 12 months after transplantation from three prospectively randomised groups of patients: (A) conventional dose cyclosporin; (B) conventional dose cyclosporin plus nifedipine; (C) low dose cyclosporin plus azathioprine. RESULTS [...] <b>Interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> increased with time in all groups. No differences in <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> were present at operation or at one month, but at six months <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> was significantly less in group B than group A (p < 0. 001) or group C (p < 0. 05). More grafts failed in group A than group B leaving only small numbers for comparison at 12 months. At 12 months the differences persisted but did not reach significance. These results strongly reflected the clinical findings, where glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in group A than groups B or C at six and 12 months; no differences in glomerular filtration rate were found at one month.

Here we studied whether proteinuria promoted glomerular-tubule disconnection in individual nephrons and whether this phenomenon was prevented by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) and control rats were studied at 4 and 8 months. Two additional groups of PHN rats received lisinopril (40 mg/L) or a {{calcium channel blocker}} (lacidipine, 3 mg/kg) from day 7 after surgery to 8 months. At sacrifice, kidneys were serially sectioned to identify glomerular- tubule abnormalities in individual nephrons and changes in <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume.</b> In PHN rats, the time-dependent increase in proteinuria was paralleled by tubular atrophy leading to glomerular-tubule disconnection and <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> enlargement. Marked apoptosis was invariably found in atrophic tubules {{in contrast to the}} absent or very mild terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining in tubules normally connected to glomeruli in PHN animals. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor prevented hypertension, proteinuria, the formation of atrophic tubuli, glomerular-tubule disconnection and limited the fractional <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> expansion. Although lacidipine limited hypertension, it did not reduce proteinuria or prevent tubular atrophy and disconnection. Multivariate analysis showed that the appearance of atubular glomeruli and the increase in <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> were better predicted by proteinuria than blood pressure.

40|$|Under {{physiological}} conditions, <b>interstitial</b> fluid <b>volume</b> is tightly {{regulated by}} balancing microvascular filtration and lymphatic {{return to the}} central venous circulation. Even though microvascular filtration and lymphatic return are governed by conservation of mass, their interaction can result in exceedingly complex behavior.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} calculations {{relating the}} effective diffusivity of monoclonal antibodies in tissue (Deff) {{to the actual}} diffusivity in the interstitium (Dint) and the <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> fraction phi. Measured diffusivity values are effective values, deduced from concentration profiles with the tissue treated as a continuum. By using homogenization theory, the ratio Deff/Dint is calculated {{for a range of}} <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> fractions from 10 to 65 %. It is assumed that only diffusion in the interstitial spaces between cells contributes to the effective diffusivity. The geometries considered have cuboidal cells arranged periodically, with uniform gaps between cells. Deff/Dint is found to generally be between (2 / 3) phi and phi for these geometries. In general, the pathways for diffusion between cells are not straight. The effect of winding pathways on Deff/Dint is examined by varying the arrangement of the cells, and found to be slight. Also, the estimates of Deff/Dint are shown to be insensitive to typical nonuniformities in the widths of gaps between cells. From our calculations and from published experimental measurements of the effective diffusivity of an IgG polyclonal antibody both in water and in tumor tissue, we deduce that the diffusivity of this molecule in the interstitium is one-tenth to one-twentieth its diffusivity in water. We also conclude that exclusion of molecules from cells (an effect independent of molecular weight) contributes as much as interstitial hindrance to the reduction of effective diffusivity, for small <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> fractions (around 20 %). This suggests that the increase in the rate of delivery to tissues resulting from the use of smaller molecular-weight molecules (such as antibody fragments or bifunctional antibodies) may be less than expected...|$|E

METHODS: All cases of membranous nephropathy, diagnosed by renal biopsy at University Hospital of South Manchester between 1984 and 1987, were studied retrospectively. The biopsy specimens (n = 26) were reviewed and analysed morphometrically to measure <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> {{as a proportion of}} the total volume of renal cortex, and numbers of interstitial myofibroblasts (cells positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin within the interstitium). Clinical data, with a follow up of seven to eight years, was available for 24 patients, and renal outcome was correlated with pathological changes in the initial diagnostic biopsy specimen. RESULTS: The number of myofibroblasts and <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> were inversely correlated with creatinine clearance at the initial biopsy, {{and at the end of}} follow up. Percentage sclerosed glomeruli or stage of glomerular disease, assessed by electron microscopy, did not correlate with renal function at initial biopsy or during follow up.

Of 15 biopsy specimens showing no or mild interstitial fibrosis, four showed a notable increase in the number of interstitial myofibroblasts.

50|$|Fluid {{balance is}} {{an aspect of}} the {{homeostasis}} of living organisms in which the amount of water in the organism needs to be controlled, via osmoregulation and behavior, such that the concentrations of electrolytes (salts in solution) in the various body fluids are kept within healthy ranges. The core principle of fluid balance is that the amount of water lost from the body must equal the amount of water taken in; for example, in human homeostasis, the output (via respiration, perspiration, urination, defecation, and expectoration) must equal the input (via eating, drinking, and parenteral intake). Euvolemia is the state of normal body fluid volume, including blood <b>volume,</b> <b>interstitial</b> fluid <b>volume,</b> and intracellular fluid volume; hypovolemia and hypervolemia are imbalances.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of fluid (water) volume {{in the body}} is crucial for tissue homeostasis. The interstitial fluid, which comprises almost 20 % of the body fluid, is stored in the loose connective tissue and its volume is actively regulated by components of this tissue. The loose connective tissue provides a path for fluid flow from capillaries to the tissue and lymphatics. This fluid is partially stored in the interstitium and the remainder is directed to the lymphatics. The fibroblasts in the loose connective tissue actively compact the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) through mechanotransduction via integrins. This in turn, maintains the interstitial fluid pressure and keeps the ground substance underhydrated. The interstitial fluid pressure {{is part of the}} forces that regulate the efflux of fluid from capillaries and keep the ground substance underhydrated. The underhydrated ground substance has a potential to take up fluid 3 -fold the plasma volume. Therefore, the active contraction of the ECM via fibroblasts is crucial to prevent the risk of evacuation of fluid from capillaries. During pathologies, such as inflammation and carcinogenesis, the interstitial fluid pressure and hence the <b>interstitial</b> fluid <b>volume</b> is altered. The results presented in this thesis show that the signaling events downstream of αVβ 3 integrin, collagen-binding β 1 integrins, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, that induce cell-mediated matrix contraction, included paired function of PI 3 K and PLCγ, cofilin activation, actin turnover, and generation of actomyosin forces. Furthermore, the results highlight new potential roles for fibrin and αVβ 3 integrins, for instance during clearance of edema. Notably, fibrin extravasation at inflammatory sites induced αVβ 3 integrin-dependent matrix contraction, leading to normalization of the altered <b>interstitial</b> fluid <b>volume.</b> It also reprograms the expression of ECM-related genes and hence induces ECM turnover. Taken together, these results provide further insight into the regulatory mechanism through which the loose connective tissue actively regulates the <b>interstitial</b> fluid <b>volume...</b>|$|R

To address the effect of the circular topology, a comparison with linear analogs was also carried out. In the interpretation of the chain structural properties, the geometry of the post array is considered as a combination of a channel approximating the <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> with the diameter dc and a slit approximating the passage aperture with the width wp. The number of interstitial volumes occupied by a chain monotonically increases with the decreasing ratio dc/wp regardless of the way the geometry of the post array is varied. However, depending on how the array geometry is modified, the chain span along the posts displays a monotonic (constant post separation) or a non-monotonic behavior (constant passage width) when plotted {{as a function of the}} post diameter. In the case of monotonic trend, the width of interstitial spaces increases with the increasing chain occupation number, while, in the case of non-monotonic trend, the width of interstitial spaces decreases with the increasing chain occupation number. In comparison with linear topology, for circular topology, the stiffness affects more significantly the relative chain extension along the posts and less significantly the occupation number. The geometrical parameters of the post arrays are stored in the single-chain structure factors. The characteristic humps are recognized in the structure factor which ensue from the local increase in the density of segments in the circular chains presented in an <b>interstitial</b> <b>volume</b> or from the correlation of parallel chain fragments separated by a row of posts.

In the pre-dialysis state, interstitial colloid osmotic pressure was reduced compared to normal controls (12. 7 ± 3. 5 versus 15. 8 ± 2. 7 mmHg, mean values ± SD) and transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient increased (15. 3 ± 3. 0 versus 12. 8 ± 2. 7 mmHg).

In this paper, a totally automatic algorithm is proposed that relies on mathematic morphology tools. The proposed algorithm has been assessed in a large number of biopsies leading to simi-lar results to those obtained by the manual approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|Closed access until 23 July 2018. Streambed drying is {{becoming}} more common due to climate change and increasing anthropogenic water resource pressures. Subsurface sediments are a potential refuge for benthic macroinvertebrates during drying events in temporary streams. Sediment characteristics are important controls {{on the distribution of}} macroinvertebrates in subsurface habitats, but difficulties making observations impedes quantification of vertical movements. Species traits (e. g. subsurface habitat affinity) also influence vertical movements of macroinvertebrates into the subsurface sediments, but most species-specific responses remain uncharacterised. Transparent artificial mesocosms were used to directly observe the vertical movements of individuals of three aquatic insect nymphs and two crustaceans. Mixtures of three types of transparent sediment of varying particle size were combined to produce six treatments with differing <b>interstitial</b> pore <b>volumes</b> and, hence, differing subsurface porosity. Macroinvertebrate vertical movements were measured during incremental reductions in water level from 5 cm above to 20 cm below the sediment surface. These species comprised a variety of trait categories including feeding group, species affinity to temporary streams and subsurface habitats. Active and passive vertical movements were determined by conducting experiments with both live individuals and their cadavers. Sediment treatment influenced the vertical movements of individuals as reducing subsurface porosity decreased vertical movements for most species. Vertical movement into subsurface sediments in response to water level reduction was the result of active, not passive, movements for all species. Species identity influenced the vertical movements made by individuals. Nemoura cambrica had the highest affinity for temporary streams and subsurface habitats and its vertical movements were unaffected by sediment treatment, generally reaching depths between 20 and 25 cm. Most individuals of species with a weaker subsurface affinity (i. e. the benthic grazer Heptagenia sulphurea and the filter-feeder Hydropsyche siltalai) became stranded as water levels were reduced in all sediment treatments. Vertical movements of Gammarus pulex and Asellus aquaticus were restricted primarily by pore volume, these taxa becoming stranded most commonly in sediments with smaller <b>interstitial</b> <b>volumes.</b> Our results highlight the need for {{the development and implementation of}} river management strategies that increase streambed porosity, allowing macroinvertebrates to access to the saturated subsurface habitat during stream drying...|$|R
40|$|The {{regulation}} {{of water and}} electrolyte metabolism {{has been the subject}} of much investigation. Many factors have been implicated, one being that volume plays a role in the {{regulation of}} sodium in the body. It has been suggested that there may be receptors somewhere in the body, which are sensitive to changes in the volume of fluid or in the concentration of electrolytes. It has not been clearly established yet whether they are sensitive to blood volume, plasma colloid osmotic pressure, <b>interstitial</b> fluid <b>volume,</b> or some other factor. The importance of the adrenal cortex in influencing sodium metabolism is well established...|$|R
