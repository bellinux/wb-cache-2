40|$|Genes {{producing}} antisense RNA {{are becoming}} important tools for the selective inhibition of gene expression. Experiments in different biological systems, targeting different mRNAs have yielded diverse results {{with respect to}} the success of the technique and its mechanism of action. We have examined the potential of three antisense genes, whose transcription is driven by a Drosophila metallothionein promoter, to inhibit the expression of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or a microtubule associated protein (205 <b>K</b> <b>MAP)</b> in cultured Drosophila cells. Expression of ADH was significantly reduced upon induction of the anti-ADH genes. The ADH mRNA does not appear to be destabilized by the presence of antisense RNA but rather exists at similar levels in hybrid form. Hybrids are detected with both spliced and unspliced ADH RNA. In contrast to these results, antisense genes producing antisense RNA in great excess to 205 <b>K</b> <b>MAP</b> mRNA, which is itself far less abundant than the ADH mRNA, failed to show any inhibition of 205 <b>K</b> <b>MAP</b> expression...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Antisera {{prepared}} {{against a}} 210, 000 mol wt microtubule-associated protein (210 <b>k</b> <b>MAP)</b> {{isolated from the}} human cell line, HeLa, were used to survey a variety of cells and tissues {{for the presence of}} immunologically related proteins. The antisera were employed to test extracts of the cells and tissues, using a sensitive indirect immunofluorescence technique applied to polyacrylamide gels. Cross-reactive material of 210, 000 mol wt was found in 10 kinds of cells and tissues derived from humans and four lines of cells from monkeys. Indirect immunofluorescent staining was also carried out on fixed cells and showed that the crossreactive material was localized to interphase and mitotic microtubules as assayed in nine human and seven monkey cell lines. No protein that cross-reacted with 210 <b>k</b> <b>MAP</b> antisera was detected in cells and tissues derived from two rodents, an ungulate, a marsupial, or a chicken. Therefore, the 210 <b>k</b> <b>MAP</b> isolated from HeLa cells is present {{in a wide variety of}} cells and tissues of humans and other primates but is antigenically distinct from MAPS present in lower organisms. Using antisera prepared against HeLa microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), we have previously demonstrated the association of 210, 000 mol wt (210 k) and 125 k MAPs with HeLa microtubules polymerized in vitro and with colcemid-sensitive cytoplasmic fibers and mitotic spindles in vivo (1). Other experiments with these antisera have revealed that the 210 k and 125 k MAPs possess antigenic determinants not present on MAPs previously isolated from mammalian brain tissue. In this study, in an effort to determine whether or not the 210 <b>k</b> <b>MAP</b> isolated from HeLa cells is unique to HeLa, we tested a variety of cells and tissues for the presence of 210 <b>k</b> <b>MAP</b> using the same indirect immunofluorescent staining assays we employed for HeLa cells...|$|E

40|$|We have sequenced cDNA clones {{encoding}} the Drosophila 205 K microtubule- associated protein (MAP), {{a protein}} {{that may be}} the species specific homologue of mammalian MAP 4. The peptide sequence deduced from the longest open-reading frame reveals a hydrophilic protein, which has basic and acidic regions that are similar in organization to mammalian MAP 2. Using truncated forms of the 205 <b>K</b> <b>MAP,</b> a 232 -amino acid region could be defined that is necessary for microtubule binding. The amino acid sequence of this region shares no similarity with the binding motif of MAP 2 or tau. We also analyzed several embryonic cDNA clones, which show the existence of differentially spliced mRNAs. Finally, we identified several potential protein kinase target sequences. One of these is distal to the microtubule-binding site and fits the phosphorylation consensus sequence of proteins phosphorylated by the mitosis specific protein kinase cdc 2. Our data suggest that the 205 <b>K</b> <b>MAP</b> uses a microtubule-binding motif unlike that found in other MAPs, and also raise the possibility that the activities of the 205 <b>K</b> <b>MAP</b> may be regulated by alternative splicing and phosphorylation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports about}} on going {{developments}} in the map production process of the Dutch Kadaster (who also hold the mapping agency). In March 2013, the Dutch Kadaster will produce the 1 : 50 <b>k</b> <b>map</b> series fully automatically from 1 : 10 k data for the first time. From that moment on, this new product will replace the existing 1 : 50 <b>k</b> <b>map.</b> It {{is the first time}} that a complete topographic map is generalised with no human interaction and that the resulting map is good enough to replace the existing map. The implementation is a 100 % automated generalisation workflow that produces a countrywide map series at scale 1 : 50 k from 1 : 10 k data within 50 hours. Therefore a 1 : 50 <b>k</b> <b>map</b> delivery is foreseen with every 1 : 10 k data update, i. e. five times a year. The research that achieved the fully automated generalisation workflow was explained in several publications (Stoter et al, 2009; 2011; 2012). The automated workflow for the generalisation of 1 : 50 k maps from TOP 10 NL data is currently being extended to produce the 1 : 100 <b>k</b> <b>map</b> series. This workshop paper focuses on the generalisation problem for which one third of the sub models were developed: generalisation of the road network. The Dutch data models at 1 : 10 k and 1 : 50 k have two properties that characterise this process. At first 1 : 10 k data contains road polygons for every road wider than 2 meters that represent the real widths of the roads, while 1 : 50 k maps contain road centerlines that cover complete roads and that have an attribute indicating the width of the road. The second property that characterises the generalisation of roads is that data at all scale form a planar partition, i. e. no gaps or overlap are allowed. Therefore every polygon that is removed should be replaced by something else. OTB ResearchOTB Research Institute for the Built Environmen...|$|E

40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} {{the presence of a}} 210 K (K = 103 Mr) microtubule-associated protein (MAP) in blood platelets and have studied its relationship to tubulin and to the cytoskeleton, using a well-characterized polyclonal antibody for the analysis. When platelet lysates were en-riched for tubulin by an assembly cycle at 37 °C, the 21 OK MAP was also enriched, as detected by Western blotting, while the antigen was not detected in pellets from cold-treated samples that lacked stabilized tubulin. Immunofluorescence of resting platelets showed that the 210 K antigen colocalized with the microtubule coil in ring-like structures. On the other hand, in preparations of platelet cytoskeletons, the 210 K antigen was pres-ent in samples from platelets in which the coil was disassembled (cold-treated without taxol pre-treatment) as well as from platelets in which the coil was preserved (at 37 °C without taxol, or 4 °C with taxol pretreatment). In chilled platelets with disassembled microtubule coils, indirect immu-nofluorescence using antibodies to 210 K or tubu-lin gave a diffuse signal throughout the platelet cytoplasm. However, immunofluorescence of the 210 K antigen in both resting and cold-treated platelets displayed discrete or patchy staining as compared to the continuous staining with anti-tubulin. We conclude that 210 <b>K</b> <b>MAP</b> is present in platelets, that it copurifies with tubulin and that it is localized along the micro tubule coil.
