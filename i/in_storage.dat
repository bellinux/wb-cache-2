40|$|Storages of {{succulent}} {{agricultural produce}} are special biological systems. There proceed complex processes through which heat, moisture {{and carbon dioxide}} are released to the environment. They provide favorable conditions for micromycetes to develop. The employed means of microclimate control fa-cilitate the spread of micromycetes in the environment and into the deeper layers of bulk piles. In the paper data on the efficiency of technological protection means suppressing the dispersion and development micromycetes <b>in</b> <b>storages</b> are presented. Automatic control of ventilation systems, painting of storage walls and cleaning were found to reduce air contamination with micromycetes <b>in</b> a <b>storage.</b> Meanwhile, a suitable chemical composition of air is very important <b>in</b> tight <b>storages,</b> i. e. cold stores. <b>In</b> <b>storages</b> with active ventilation, biologi-cal activity of produce depends on ventilation mode. On the surface of stored vegetables, the development and spreading of micromycetes was most strongly favoured by temperature fluctuations in produce piles, which provoked air condensation processes...|$|R

5|$|Neck rot is a {{fungal disease}} {{affecting}} onions <b>in</b> <b>storage.</b> It {{is caused by}} Botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. The symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. Large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. In time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. This disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is <b>in</b> <b>storage.</b> Antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether the influence of fish pond and fish storage tank conditions change the content of phthalic acid esters (di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) and di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP)) in the carcass of the Common carp. Samples obtained from the autumn harvest of two fish ponds (R 1 and R 2) in 2007 and 2010 from the South Moravia and after a seven-week-long <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tanks were analyzed. It was found that in the samples (2007) from both fish ponds after <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tanks the content of DBP increased, for R 1 from 0. 56 ± 0. 39 mg. kg- 1 to 0. 83 ± 0. 26 mg. kg- 1 and for R 2 from 0. 31 ± 0. 08 mg. kg- 1 to 0. 35 ± 0. 11 mg. kg- 1 of original weight. Concerning DEHP, in samples obtained from the fish pond R 1 after <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tanks the mean concentration increased from 0. 26 ± 0. 23 mg. kg- 1 to 0. 72 ± 0. 16 mg. kg- 1 and from R 2 it decreased from 0. 71 ± 0. 17 mg. kg- 1 to 0. 12 ± 0. 18 mg. kg- 1 of original weight. The experiment conducted in 2010 should have confirmed or disconfirm this trend. The average value of the DBP contents for R 1 increased slightly from 0. 15 ± 0. 04 mg. kg- 1 after harvest to 0. 18 ± 0. 05 mg. kg- 1 of original weight after the <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tank and for R 2 from 0. 09 ± 0. 03 mg. kg- 1 after harvest to 0. 16 ± 0. 06 mg. kg- 1 of original weight after <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tank. Similarly, an increasing tendency also occurred for DEHP, for R 1 the value of 0. 08 ± 0. 02 mg. kg- 1 after harvesting increased to 0. 14 ± 0. 04 mg. kg- 1 of original weight after <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tank and for R 2 from 0. 09 ± 0. 03 mg. kg- 1 after harvesting to 0. 16 ± 0. 06 mg. kg- 1 after <b>storage</b> <b>in</b> fish <b>storage</b> tank. For all samples in both lakes in 2007 as well as in 2010 both phthalates showed slightly increasing trend except for DEHP in samples collected in 2007 from the fish pond R 2...|$|R

As a result of the lessons learned from the Battle of Midway in June, the ship's fighter complement was strengthened to 21 Zeros, and the other aircraft reduced to 12 D3As and 9 B5Ns. By the end of the year, six more Zeros replaced an equal number of D3As. Although it was possible to fit all these aircraft into the hangars, eight or nine were usually stored on the flight deck to reduce cramping below decks.|$|E
