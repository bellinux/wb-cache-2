40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{increased}} the area affected by forest fires each year in boreal North America 1, 2. Increases in burned area and fire frequency are expected to stimulate boreal carbon losses 3 – 5. However, the impact of wildfires on carbon emissions is also affected by the severity of burning. How climate change influences the severity of biomass burning has proved difficult to assess. Here, we examined the depth of ground-layer combustion in 178 sites dominated by black spruce in Alaska, using data collected from 31 fire events between 1983 and 2005. We show that the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> increased as the fire season progressed when the annual area burned was small. However, deep burning occurred throughout the fire season when the annual area burned was large. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> increased late in the fire season in upland forests, but not in peatland and permafrost sites.

40|$|Abstract. We {{evaluated}} {{the utility of}} the composite burn index (CBI) for estimating fire severity in Alaskan black spruce forests by comparing data from 81 plots located in 2004 and 2005 fire events. We collected data to estimate the CBI and quantify crown damage, percent of trees standing after the fire, depth of the organic layer remaining after the fire, <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> in the surface organic layer (absolute and relative), and the substrate layer exposed by the fire. To estimate pre-fire organic layer depth, we collected data in 15 unburned stands to develop relationships between total organic layer depth and measures of the adventitious root depth above mineral soil and {{below the surface of the}} organic layer. We validated this algorithm using data collected in 17 burned stands where pre-fire organic layer depth had been measured. The average total CBI value in the black spruce stands was 2. 46, with most of the variation a result of differences in the CBI observed for the substrate layer. While a quadratic equation using the substrate component of CBI was a relatively strong predictor of mineral soil exposure as a result of fire (R 2 = 0. 61, P < 0. 0001, F = 60. 3), low correlations were found between the other measures of fire severity and the CBI (R 2 = 0. 00 – 0. 37). These results indicate that the CBI approach has limited potential for quantifying fire severity in these ecosystems, in particular organic layer consumption, which is an importan...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{burning in}} the Alaskan {{interior}} is already a major disturbance and source of carbon emissions, {{and is likely to}} increase in response to the warming and drying predicted for the future climate. In addition to quantifying changes to the spatial and temporal patterns of burned areas, observing variations in severity is the key to studying the impact of changes to the fire regime on carbon cycling, energy budgets, and post-fire succession. Remote sensing indices of fire severity have not consistently been well-correlated with in situ observations of important severity characteristics in Alaskan black spruce stands, including <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> of the surface organic layer. The incorporation of ancillary data such as in situ observations and GIS layers with spectral data from Landsat TM/ETM+ greatly improved efforts to map the reduction of the organic layer in burned black spruce stands. Using a regression tree approach, the R 2 of the organic layer depth reduction models was 0. 60 and 0. 55 (pb 0. 01) for relative and absolute depth reduction, respectively. All of the independent variables used by the regression tree to estimate burn depth can be obtained independently of field observations. Implementation of a gradient boosting algorithm improved the R 2 to 0. 80 and 0. 79 (pb 0. 01) for absolute and relative organic layer depth reduction, respectively. Independent variables used in the regression tree model of burn depth included topographic position, remote sensing indices related to soil and vegetation characteristics, timing of the fire event, and meteorological data. Post-fire organic layer depth characteristics are determined for a large (N 200, 000 ha) fire to identify areas that are potentially vulnerable to a shift in post-fire succession. This application showed that 12 % of this fire event experienced fire severe enough to support a change in post-fire succession. We conclude that non-parametric models and ancillary data are useful in the modeling of the surface organic layer fire depth. Because quantitative differences in post-fire surface characteristics do not directly influence spectral properties, these modeling techniques provide better information than the use of remote sensing data alone...|$|E

30|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> char and {{relating}} this <b>depth</b> to duration <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> has fluctuated as to {{its usefulness}} in fire investigations since the mid- 1950 ’s. Kirk’s (1969) text was the first reference that indicated investigators could use this data {{for more than just}} direction of damage when he explained “investigators make measurements with the idea of determining the length of time the fire burned at this point”. However, Kirk cautioned that investigators should not place “more than casual emphasis” on placing a direct relation between char <b>depth</b> and time <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> due to the number of variables that could influence the findings and the lack of reliably controlled test data available (Kirk 1969). Despite this warning, several textbooks and journal articles discuss that an investigator can prescribe a 45  min duration <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> for every 1 -inch <b>of</b> char <b>depth</b> (Stickney 1984; Kennedy and Kennedy 1985; Swab 1985). However, others argued that many variables such as the type of wood, variations in burning within the compartment, firefighting operations and orientation of the wood influenced the rate of charring and suggested that investigators only use the locations <b>of</b> greater <b>depths</b> as relative longer exposures to heating that should not necessarily be tied to a duration <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> (Kirk 1969; DeHaan 1983; Ettling, 1990).|$|R
40|$|The {{black carbon}} (BC) aerosol {{is a major}} climate-forcing agent. Its high {{capacity}} for light absorption {{and its role in}} key atmospheric processes lead to a range of impacts in the Earth System. Black carbon is also a major constituent of fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and is linked to a broad array of adverse health effects. Increased fossil fuel and biomass burning have contributed to a significantly larger input of BC to the atmosphere, but the lack of measurement constraints on BC have limited the development of mitigation strategies. My thesis aims to improve our understanding of BC emission sources by utilizing radiocarbon (14 C) to quantify the fossil fuel and biomass combustion contribution to the BC emissions and their spatiotemporal variations. I developed a method allowing me to efficiently separate and collect BC and organic carbon (OC) from PM 2. 5 and perform 14 C measurements of these ultra-small samples with high accuracy and low carbon blanks. I used this method to measure the isotopic composition of BC and OC emitted from boreal forest wildfires and showed that fires were the dominant contributor to the variability in carbonaceous aerosols in Alaska during the summer. The Δ 14 C of BC from boreal fires was 131 ± 52 ‰ in 2013, corresponding to a mean fuel age of 20 years. and consistent with a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> in organic soil horizons of 20 cm (range: 8 – 47 cm). To explore urban emission of BC, I measured fossil and biomass contributions to BC and OC in Salt Lake City, Utah. Combined with information of endmember 14 C composition, my results indicated that fossil fuels were the dominant source during winter, contributing on average 88 % (range: 80 – 98 %) of BC and 58 % (range: 48 – 69 %) of OC. Combining innovative techniques, extensive field measurements and detailed laboratory analysis, I explored both the natural and anthropogenic sources of BC. By providing BC aerosol direct measurements and isotopic characterization, this work contributes to a growing body of knowledge on BC source contribution and dynamics necessary for the development of successful strategies for mitigating BC’s effects on the Earth System and human health...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{temperatures}} and drier conditions, related to climate change, {{have resulted in}} changes to the fire regime in interior Alaskan boreal forests, including increases in burned area and fire frequency. These fire regime changes alter carbon storage and emissions, especially in the thick organic soils of black spruce (Picea mariana) forests. While there are ongoing studies of the size and severity of fire using ground- and remote-based studies in mature black spruce forests, {{a better understanding of}} fire regime changes to immature black spruce forests is needed. The goal of this dissertation research was to assess impacts of changing fire frequency on soil organic layer (SOL) carbon consumption during wildland fires in recovering Alaskan black spruce forests using a combination of geospatial and remote sensing analyses, field-based research, and modeling. The research objectives were to 1) quantify burning in recovering vegetated areas; 2) analyze factors associated with variations in fire frequency; 3) quantify how fire frequency affects <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>burning,</b> residual SOL depth, and carbon loss in the SOL of black spruce forests; and 4) analyze how fire frequency impacts carbon consumption in these forests. Results showed that considerable burning in the region occurs in stands not yet fully recovered from earlier fire events (~ 20 % of burned areas are in immature stands). Additionally, burning in recovering black spruce forests (~ 40 yrs old) resulted in SOL depth of burn similar to that in mature forests which have burned. Incorporating these results into a modeling framework (through adding an immature black spruce fuel type and associated ground-layer carbon consumption values) resulted in higher ground-layer carbon consumption (and thus total carbon consumed) for areas that burned in 2004 and 2005 than that of a previous version of the model. This research indicated that the dominant controls on fire behavior in this system were fuel type and amount, not fuel condition, and that changes in vegetation associated with more frequent fire (shift to deciduous and shrub vegetation which does not traditionally burn as readily) may represent a long-term negative feedback on burned area. These new results provide insight into the fire-climate-vegetation dynamics within the region and could be used to both inform and validate modeling efforts to better estimate soil carbon pools and emissions as climate continues to change...|$|E

30|$|Frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning.</b> In the {{commercial}} fire paradigm, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> is {{dictated by the}} reason for burning. When burning to remove moribund or unacceptable grass material, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> will depend upon the accumulation rate of excess grass litter (Trollope 1999). Field experience indicates that grass litter should not exceed 4000 kg ha− 1; therefore, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> {{should be based on}} the rate at which this phytomass of grass material accumulates in response to rainfall and grazing pressure of domestic livestock and wild ungulates. This approach has the advantage that the frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> is related to the stocking rate of grazers and to the amount of rainfall the area receives. Generally, in high rainfall areas (> 700 mm yr− 1), this will result in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> being every 2 yr to 4 yr. In lower rainfall areas, the frequency will be much lower. In fact, the threshold of a grass fuel load > 4000 kg ha− 1 will generally exclude fire in these regions, particularly where the condition of the rangeland is degraded and excessive grass fuel loads never accumulate. In the case <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> to control the encroachment of undesirable plant species, the frequency <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> will depend upon the ecological characteristics of the encroaching species, and will and can vary from a single burn to frequent burning.|$|R
