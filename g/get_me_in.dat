2500|$|Neither Clark nor Lucas had full {{confidence}} in either their superiors or the operational plan. Along {{with most of}} the Fifth Army staff they felt that Shingle was properly a two corps or even a full army task. A few days prior to the attack, Lucas wrote in his diary, [...] "They will end up putting me ashore with inadequate forces and <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a serious jam... Then, who will get the blame?" [...] and [...] " [...] has a strong odour of Gallipoli and apparently the same amateur was still on the coach's bench."

2500|$|Northamptonshire's Charl Pietersen took 7 for 10 at Svanholm Park, Brøndby as Denmark {{fell to the}} competition's second lowest {{score in}} its history, for 56 all out. 24 of those runs were extras, with no Dane scoring more than 8 with the bat. Pietersen, who was playing in his debut match for the Northants first team said, [...] "The ball was {{swinging}} about and they were perfect conditions for bowling. I just concentrated on getting {{the ball in the}} right areas and the conditions did the rest. I'm grateful for the opportunity I've been given by Northants. I'm here to learn and try to get myself in the first team on a regular basis. No cricketer wants to play second-team cricket and I'm no different.

2500|$|After {{manufacture}} at Republic's Farmingdale, Long Island, plant, the two XF-84Hs were disassembled {{and shipped}} via rail to Edwards Air Force Base for flight testing. First flown on July 22, 1955, the XF-84F had incredible acceleration but soon its impracticality was discovered. It was unsuited to combat {{due to the}} engine's 30 minute warm up time but the most serious concerns were vibration generated from the 12-foot propeller diameter and mechanical failures of the prop pitch gearing. The prototypes flew a total of 12 test flights from Edwards, accumulating only 6 hours and 40 minutes of flight time. Lin Hendrix, one of the Republic test pilots assigned to the program, flew the aircraft once and refused to ever fly it again, claiming [...] "it never flew over [...] indicated, since at that speed, it developed an unhappy practice of 'snaking', apparently losing longitudinal stability". [...] Hendrix also told the formidable Republic project engineer, [...] "You aren't big enough and there aren't enough of you to <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> that thing again". The other test flights were fraught with engine failures, and persistent hydraulic, nose gear, and vibration problems. Test pilot Hank Beaird took the XF-84H up 11 times, with 10 of these flights ending in forced landings.|$|E

He knows that I was unfriendly with the dog so, putting things together, I don't see as he could help suspecting me, and only my word the other way. It seems to me as if somebody must have done it to <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a row, for I don't know that the dog had bit anyone else. If it is anyone, I expect it's Tom Thorne.

The shop must send it with all charges paid, to the address which I have had written in English character on the edge of this paper. She is the lady of the house in which I was billeted in a village for three months. Though she was advanced in years and belonged to a high family, yet in the whole of those three months I never saw this old lady sit idle. Her three sons had gone to the war. One had been killed; one was in hospital, and a third, at that time, was in the trenches. She did not weep nor wail at the death or the sickness but accepted the dispensation. During the time I was in her house, she ministered to me {{to such an extent that}} I cannot adequately describe her kindness. Of her own free-will she washed my clothes, arranged my bed, and polished my boots daily for three months. She washed down my bedroom daily with hot water, having herself heated it. Each morning she prepared me a tray with bread, butter, milk and coffee. When we had to leave that village that old lady wept on my shoulder. It is strange that I had never seen her weep for her dead son, but she wept for me. Moreover, at parting she would have had me take a fi-farang [five franc] note for expenses on the road."

6000|$|A {{few months}} were {{sufficient}} {{to show how}} right I had been about his circulation. It didn't move one, as I had said; it stopped short in the same place, fell off in a sheer descent, like some precipice gaped up at by tourists. The public in other words drew the line for him as sharply as he had drawn it for Minnie Meadows. Minnie has skipped with a flouncing caper over his line, however; whereas the mark traced by a lustier cudgel has been a barrier insurmountable to Limbert. Those next times I had spoken of to Jane Highmore, I see them simplified by retrocession. Again and again he made his desperate bid--again and again he tried to. His rupture with Mr. Bousefield caused him, I fear, in professional circles to be thought impracticable, and I am perfectly aware, to speak candidly, that no sordid advantage ever accrued to him from such public patronage of my performances as he had occasionally been {{in a position to}} offer. I reflect for my comfort that any injury I may have done him by untimely application of a faculty of analysis which could point to no converts gained by honourable exercise was at least equalled by the injury he did himself. More than once, as I have hinted, I held my tongue at his request, but my frequent plea that such favours weren't politic never found him, when in other connections there was an opportunity to give me a lift, anything but indifferent to the danger of the association. He let them have me in a word whenever he could; sometimes in periodicals in which he had credit, sometimes only at dinner. He talked about me when he couldn't <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>in,</b> but it was always part of the bargain that I shouldn't make him a topic. [...] "How can I successfully serve you if you do?" [...] he used to ask: he was more afraid than I thought he ought to have been of the charge of tit for tat. I didn't care, for I never could distinguish tat from tit; but as I have intimated I dropped into silence really more than anything else because there was a certain fascinated observation of his course which was quite testimony enough and to which in this huddled conclusion of it he practically reduced me.|$|E

60|$|All these useless regrets were <b>getting</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a bad way; {{but at last}} I shook {{myself and}} tried to put such things {{out of my mind}} and take hold of {{conditions}} as they existed and do my level best to wrest victory from defeat. I was badly shaken up and bruised, but considered myself mighty lucky to escape with my life. The plane hung at a precarious angle, so that it was with difficulty and considerable danger that I climbed from it into the tree and then to the ground.|$|R
