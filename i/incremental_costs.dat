Rio de Janeiro also approved funding of US$240 billion from the Program for Growth Acceleration (PAC) of the federal government. Other revenue-generating activities include sponsorship sales, ticketing program, licensing and merchandising. These revenues will be supplemented by IOC-secured commercial and broadcast contributions. Capital expenditure on infrastructure by the government or the private sector includes already committed and ongoing investments of US$3.9 billion on projects such as airport and subway expansions and construction of the metropolitan road arc. The OCOG budget does not assume any capital contributions to the construction of permanent or legacy venues, other than for Games overlay, including the construction of temporary venues. The balance of OCOG expenditures will be funded by the public sector, involving a combination of government commitments from Federal, State and Municipal levels. The OCOG budget and operating expenses are projected at US$2.8 billion, with its Olympic-related budget, including capital investments in transportation, sports venues and <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> being US$11.6 billion.

The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> associated with SOX compliance.

40|$|Background: Radiology {{is rapidly}} advancing, {{with a global}} {{transition}} to digital imaging technology to improve productivity and enhance communication. The major challenge confronting radiology practices is to demonstrate cost savings and productivity gains when a picture archiving and communication system (PACS) is established. Aim: To undertake an <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> analysis of PACS compared with conventional radiology to determine productivity gains, if any, at two private hospitals in Durban. Method: An <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> analysis for chest radiographs, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging brain scans with and without contrast were performed. The overall <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> for PACS in comparison with a conventional radiology site was determined. The net present value was also determined to evaluate the capital budgeting requirements for both systems. Results: The <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> of both capital and the radiology information system for installing PACS shows an expected increase. The <b>incremental</b> PACS image <b>cost</b> shows a reduction. Conclusion: The study provides a benchmark for the cost incurred when implementing PACS. It also provides a decision framework for radiology departments that plan to introduce PACS and helps to determine the feasibility of its introduction. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Coase (1960) (referred to by Toth et al.., 2001; and Helm, 2005, p.4) {{argued that}} social costs could be {{accounted}} for by negotiating property rights according to a particular objective. Coase's model assumes perfectly operating markets and equal bargaining power among those arguing for property rights. For climate change, the property rights are for emissions (permits or quotas). However, {{it should be noted that}} other factors affect the climate other than just emissions, e.g., the ocean, forests, etc. (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, pp.28–29). In Coase's model, efficiency, i.e., achieving a given reduction in emissions at lowest cost, is promoted by the market system. This can also be looked at from the perspective of having the greatest flexibility to reduce emissions. Flexibility is desirable because the marginal costs, that is to say, the <b>incremental</b> <b>costs</b> of reducing emissions, varies among countries. Emissions trading allows emission reductions to be first made in locations where the marginal costs of abatement are lowest (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). Over time, efficiency can also be promoted by allowing [...] "banking" [...] of permits (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.30). This allows polluters to reduce emissions at a time when it is most efficient to do so.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently the {{potential}} development of green architecture {{in our country}} is huge, but inaccurate control of green building’s <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> is the key reason for restricting its development. After analyzing influencing factors of green building’s <b>incremental</b> <b>cost,</b> four influencing factors are put forward:technical measures, project regions,fixed position and time to research feasibility. On basis of the factors, the ways are proposed to reduce green building’s <b>incremental</b> <b>cost,</b> which provides theoretical basis {{for the development of}} green architecture. introduction China has promoted green building thoroughly,but people still have misunderstanding about green building’s cost at present: cost of building will increase much when connecting with “green”. Green building signifies high cost. Professionals in architecture and real estate also overestimate green building’s cost that even reaches up to 300 %. The reason that causes misunderstanding is the choice of pilot projects with relatively high price in previous green real estate; the theory of high technological mansion is propagated greatly. Although the primary investment cost of green building is higher than normal building, we should also notice the profit brought by green building except <b>incremental</b> <b>cost.</b> （ 1 ）direct benefit-energy conservation and expense-saving produced by incrementa...|$|R

40|$|The Convention on Biological Diversity {{stipulates}} {{the principle}} of <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> for the international financing of biodiversity conservation. The international debate about the exact meaning of the concept and about its practical application focuses {{on the issues of}} baseline determination and treatment of incremental domestic benefits. This paper uses some standard tools of partial equilibrium demand analysis to illustrate theoretical solutions to the indeterminacy of the Convention. The allocation of resources resulting from an <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> scheme is compared with a 'domestic optimum', and with a hypothetical 'global optimum'. Regarding the behaviour of the country hosting biodiversity, a distinction is proposed between 'quantity-' and 'transfer-' taking behaviour. The issue of price distortions in the baseline is also addressed. It is shown that both the host country (H) and the Rest of the World (ROW) will have incentives for agreeing on a transfer of resources that entails only partial deduction of domestic incremental benefits. This transfer, despite failing to reach the utilitarian global optimum, still represents a Pareto improvement over the pre-convention status quo. By imposing a particular multiplicative functional form on the utility of both host and ROW, additional results can be obtained. In particular, the optimal transfer implies a clawback factor decreasing with relative income differentials, and <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> financing dominates the domestic optimum even when price distortions are present in the host country. If removal of price distortions is a precondition for <b>incremental</b> <b>cost</b> funding, the analysis illustrates the magnitude of incentives necessary for the host to give up the distorted baseline.
