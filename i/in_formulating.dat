5|$|NEPA {{has been}} emulated, {{in one form}} or another, by more than one hundred other countries, and many states have also {{established}} “mini NEPAs.” When national government agencies first started to prepare EISs, there were no professional associations dedicated to the planning and problem solving that NEPA demanded. Subsequently, Caldwell's efforts <b>in</b> <b>formulating</b> NEPA, and later promoting it, led to formation of the National Association of Environmental Professionals (NAEP), a national professional association of persons who prepare EISs.|$|E
5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, a veil of white cirrus clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds <b>in</b> <b>formulating</b> his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E

30|$|Three {{levels of}} SBM and RSM (RSM/SBM) price spread can be identified. First, in the starter and the grower diets, {{with a price}} spread lower than 48 %, RSM {{remained}} <b>in</b> the <b>formulated</b> diets. Second is the price spread of greater than 70 % in which inclusion of RSM becomes least important and appears very rarely <b>in</b> the <b>formulated</b> diets (i.e., only one time). Third, there exists a price spread of boundaries between 48 and 70 %, in which RSM appeared frequently <b>in</b> the <b>formulated</b> diets. The price spread differed slightly <b>in</b> the finisher <b>formulated</b> diets. With a price spread of less than 53 %, RSM remained <b>in</b> all <b>formulated</b> diets. At a price spread range between 53 and 69 %, RSM appeared frequently in the diets. At a price spread greater than 69 %, the inclusion of RSM in the diet became less advantageous, and it appeared only one time <b>in</b> the <b>formulated</b> diets.|$|R

5|$|In 2006, the Livestock Conservancy began {{investigating}} the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendant of colonial Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type for Spanish horses. In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted <b>in</b> <b>formulating</b> a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E
5|$|The {{third season}} follows Michael inside Sona and Lincoln {{on the outside}} in Panama. Sona is a prison that has been run by the inmates and guarded only from the outside due to a riot the year before. Burrows is quickly {{contacted}} by Gretchen Morgan (a Company operative {{who was in charge}} of operations in Panama) who kidnapped his son LJ and Sara, the woman Michael loves. He is told that The Company wants Scofield to break James Whistler out of Sona. The season follows Michael and Whistler's trials <b>in</b> <b>formulating</b> an escape plan, as Michael has to deal with extreme tension and as Lincoln deals with The Company's operative Gretchen Morgan. Sucre gets a job at the prison to aid Michael in his escape plan. When Lincoln attempts to rescue Sara and LJ following a clue provided by Sara, Gretchen claims to have beheaded Sara and sends Lincoln a head in a box as a warning. As the season ends, the pair manage to escape along with Mahone, and another inmate, Luis, leaving behind several accomplices including T-Bag and Bellick. Sucre's identity is discovered by a prison guard and he is thrown into Sona just after the escape. LJ and Sofia (who was captured for a guarantee that Whistler would go with her) are traded for Whistler, and Michael seeks revenge against Gretchen for Sara's death.|$|E
