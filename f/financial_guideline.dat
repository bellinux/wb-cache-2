Non-completion is of greater concern for both the candidate personally and the university, whereas extended candidature leading to completion may be a problem only for the university, carrying financial penalties within the RTS. However, there clearly may also be financial and personal costs for candidates who take more time. Although candidature completion and attrition are not directly addressed in this study, completion and time taken are closely linked in the literature, and both will be addressed briefly here...|$|R

This study identifies systematic differences between the US and International accounting and reporting for agricultural assets and products. The study also finds that international and US agricultural accounting recognition and reporting guidance result in dissimilar reporting due to guidance interpretation. Valuation variances and definition differences including the requirement to change the agricultural asset recognition method from historical cost to fair value continue to be the basis of major reporting differences. Current US guidance on recognizing and reporting agricultural assets is more conservative than the international guidance. Overall, the US agricultural recognition and reporting guidance contains less information and is therefore less beneficial to financial statement users...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} project was to {{investigate}} the further development of an airport Decision Support Suite (DSS) - the Airport Business Suite (ABS). A financial model was developed and implemented by incorporating new approaches and methodologies to Airport Strategic Planning, with various <b>financial</b> <b>guidelines</b> and practices suggested by aviation authorities, and commonly accepted financial accounting methods. The resulting program allows for financial modelling of standalone years, while the more advanced functionality of being able to model an airport's financial performance {{over a number of years}} was limited to a Spreadsheet Model. The proposed model was found to produce satisfactory results. The aim was not to produce results with a high degree of accuracy (since the forecast is always wrong), but rather to model a number of generic relationships which could be applied to any airport or situation, which would allow the user to quickly explore the financial effects of various policy options and assumptions.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the idea of}} setting up a start-up business in North America (US or Canada) that complies to Islamic <b>financial</b> <b>guidelines,</b> {{with a view to}} attract funding from Muslim people around the world. These funds would be the nucleus of a conglomerate of companies investing in a diversity of projects around the globe, {{not the least of which}} would relate to infrastructure, educational and economic development of the mother countries from where these funds originate. The main premise of this proposal is that large sums of untapped financial resources exist in the Islamic world, that are not utilized, or under-utilized, on the basis of Islamic prohibition of several financial transactions prevalent in the global market, such as interest-earning debt. The result is that large sums of money are either kept in non-interest-earning bank accounts or not deposited in banks at all, by Muslim people. This thesis explores the challenges to be overcome in attempting to establish a start-up in North America that complies with Islamic jurisprudence, along with some recommendations for directing the investments of these funds. by Mohammad Makhlouf.
