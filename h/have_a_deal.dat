500|$|In 2008, the UK {{broadcast}} {{moved to}} rival channel Channel 5 following the BBC's {{decision not to}} keep the show after being asked to pay £300m over eight years by FremantleMedia (three times the show's usual fee). Both Channel 5 and FremantleMedia were owned at that time by the German RTL Group. The first episode to be shown on Channel 5 in February 2008 was watched by 2.2million viewers (an audience share of 14.2%), a drop of 300,000 from the BBC's average. However, the move boosted Channel 5's usual share for the 5.30pm slot by {{three and a half}} times. On 4 February 2009, Neighbours 5:30pm showing was seen by 1.94million viewers and by 2012, the teatime showing had averaged 1million viewers. UK viewers are able to catch up with episodes with Channel 5's video catch up service, Demand 5, similar to the catch up service in Australia. Channel 5 also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with YouTube, allowing viewers to watch episodes for free on the video sharing site after they have been transmitted. From 4 January 2016, Channel 5 began broadcasting episodes on the same day as Australia. Channel 5's commissioning editor Greg Barnett explained that closing the transmission gap would reduce spoilers and the number of viewers watching the show illegally online. From mid-2016, the show also began airing every week-night on Nickelodeon as part of their Nick at Nite programming block, broadcasting the same episode that was earlier seen on Channel 5. In March 2017, it was reported that negotiations to continue Neighbours on Channel 5 had become [...] "very fraught", and it was possible that the show could stop airing in Britain. The following month, it was reported that a deal had been reached between FremantleMedia and Channel 5, keeping the show on British television for at least another four years.|$|E

[...] By comparison, the largest TV deal in Australian sport, that of the Australian Football League (Australian rules), is worth A$1.26billion from 2012 to 2016.
