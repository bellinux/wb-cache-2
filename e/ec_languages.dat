The <b>EC</b> <b>language</b> can deal with simple queries and with more complex ones, as approximate searches. We have done two classes of experiments. The first one shows that the structure {{does not change the}} statistical behaviour of the system with regard to the frequency of the words. The second kind of experiments tends to show the statistical behaviour of the database when we use different structural elements in the queries...|$|R
40|$|In {{the discussions}} about {{language}} policies {{for a more}} integrated European Community, the issue of linguistic nationalism is at the centre. The notion of ‘national’ languages tied to the nation?state has never been accepted by Europe's linguistic minorities, but it now comes into potential conflict with any idea of a supranational European identity. The relationship between language and territory in defining <b>EC</b> <b>language</b> policies is crucial. Old and recent language legislation has tended to evoke the principle of territoriality in outlining linguistic rights. Taking Spain as an example, it will be argued that this is only partially appropriate for the language situations of the ‘new’ Europe. It will be suggested that {{the emergence of a}} Europe of the Regions offers an opportunity to question and reject the traditional models of the language?nation relationship...|$|R

It has an action language style syntax {{similar to that}} of the EC variant Modular-E. Its semantics is given in terms of possible worlds which constitute possible evolutions of the domain, and builds on that of EFEC, an epistemic extension of EC. We also describe an ASP implementation of PEC and show the sense in which this is sound and complete. Comment: Technical repor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} notions of {{approximation}} and passage to the limit in an axiomatic setting. Our axiomatisation {{is subject to the}} following criteria: the axioms should be natural (so that they are available in as many contexts as possible) and non-order-theoretic (so that Research supported by SERC grant RR 30735 and <b>EC</b> project Programming <b>Language</b> Semantics and Program Logics grant SC 1000 795 they explain the order-theoretic structure).

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} theoretical approaches of EC has been Barsalou’s (1999) framework of perceptual symbol systems. This account suggests that humans use their sensory neural structures to create multisensory representations of their environment (for overviews on <b>EC</b> and <b>language,</b> see Pulvermüller, 2013; Zwaan, 2014). This thread of research revealed that humans reuse those brain structures that are active during perception when mentally imagining an object or action (Barsalou, 1999, 2003, 2008; for an overview on this aspect, see Anderson, 2010). Barsalou’s (1999) model explicitly breaks with the idea of Fodor’s (1975) abstracted forms of symbolic representations as a description of the human conceptual system (see Glenberg, Witt, & Metcalfe, 2013, for a contrast between abstract and embodied theories of cognition). Based on the embodied view of human cognition, educational researchers have started to develop interventions aimed at making learning contents easier to grasp by directly appealing to multisensory processing (for an overview, see de Koning & Tabbers, 2011). A variety of examples of EC-based interventions will be presented in the following sections.|$|R
40|$|Issues in {{the debate}} in Ireland over Irish {{language}} instruction in the schools are reviewed {{in light of the}} establishment of the European Economic Community. In the first chapter, three points of view are compared: results of research on Irish, attitudes of the general public, and those of language interest groups. The second chapter provides a brief overview of public language policy from 1922 - 1950 and outlines results of a 1983 survey of attitudes toward Irish language use and the teaching of Irish to children. Chapter 3 looks at issues of individual and collective rights concerning language usage and attitudes toward use of Irish in primary, secondary, and postsecondary education. The two subsequent chapters address primary school and secondary school Irish curricula and instruction in greater detail. In the final chapter, related concerns are discussed, including the growing cultural diversity in Europe, European Community (EC) policy on multilingualism, <b>EC</b> standards for <b>language</b> usage, languages and the labor market, an...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the {{microprogram}} {{level of the}} microprogramed processors, microprogram-realized algorithms. The purpose of the work: the development of language means for adaptation of the microprogram level and corresponding algorithmic and program support. Developed have been the system of parameters, the algorithms of optimization of the multilevel models parameters values, the algorithms for determination of invariants and information characteristics. The development of the language means for adaptation of comters series <b>EC</b> and the <b>language</b> of synthesis of the design automatic system microcode of plug-in cards for PK represent the practical results. The investigation results have been introduced in the APO "Electron" and in the Kasansky Computer Plant.

40|$|The present {{longitudinal}} study evaluates {{the effect of}} effortful control (EC) as a core dimension of temperament on early language competence. We assume that first and second language competence is influenced by EC, and that immigrant children with low EC are thus at risk of an unfavorable language development. The sample consisted of n = 351 dual language learners (DLLs) with an immigrant background and n = 78 monolingual children. Language competence was measured with a standardized language test at age 4. 9 years and at age 6. 3 years. EC was captured with the Child Behavior Questionnaire, completed by teachers. Results of regression analyses revealed a significant effect of <b>EC</b> on second <b>language</b> development. DLLs with lower EC {{were found to have}} not only lower language competence at {{the beginning and the end}} of kindergarten but also a less favorable language development. Comparisons between the effect of EC on first and second language provide evidence that EC plays a bigger role in subsequent second language competence compared to first language competence. Overall, the results emphasize the small yet significant role of EC in the second language development of DLLs...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{executive}} control (<b>EC)</b> during bilingual <b>language</b> processing {{is thought to}} enhance these abilities, conferring a ‘bilingual advantage’ on EC tasks. Recently, the reliability and robustness of the bilingual advantage has been questioned, with many variables reportedly affecting the size and presence of the bilingual advantage. This study investigates one further variable that may affect bilingual EC abilities: the similarity of a bilingual’s two languages. We hypothesize that bilinguals whose two languages have a larger degree of orthographic overlap will require greater EC to manage their languages compared to bilinguals who use two languages with less overlap. We tested three groups of bilinguals with language pairs ranging from high- to low-similarity (German-English (GE), Polish-English (PE), and Arabic-English (AE), respectively) {{and a group of}} English monolinguals on a Stroop and Simon task. Two components of the bilingual advantage were investigated: an interference advantage, such that bilinguals have smaller interference effects than monolinguals; and a global RT advantage, such that bilinguals are faster overall than monolinguals. Between bilingual groups, these effects were expected to be modulated by script similarity. AE bilinguals showed the smallest Stroop interference effects, but the longest overall RTs in both tasks. These seemingly contradictory results are explained by the presence of cross-linguistic interference in the Stroop task. We conclude that similar-script bilinguals demonstrated more effective domain-general EC than different-script bilinguals, since high orthographic overlap creates more cross-linguistic activation and increases the daily demands on cognitive control. The role of individual variation is also discussed. These results suggest that script similarity is an important variable to consider in investigations of bilingual executive control abilities...|$|R
40|$|While most {{researchers}} acknowledge that error correction (EC) {{is most effective}} in meaningful contexts, few studies have addressed collaborative <b>EC</b> or longitudinal <b>language</b> development during oral conversations - especially conversations where new knowledge is continually integrated. By observing how the tutor helped two college-age beginning students of Chinese learn three inter-related and chronologically-offset target grammatical structures (TG) during nine weeks of hourly one-on-one tutorial sessions, the study investigated: (a) the types of assistance the tutor provided in spoken conversation; (b) changes in this assistance within and across sessions; and (c) how errors towards TG were eliminated. Analysis of protocols (transcripts marked up with visual cues), learners' questionnaires, and graphs revealed that: (a) the tutor provided two types of contingent assistance: regulation in participation (RinP), and EC on emergent errors; (b) EC was effective and its explicitness depended only on the learner's Zone of Proximal Development - same finding for RinP; (c) during the goals-oriented activity, language, serving both social (active and accurate meaning-exchange) and cognitive (tutor's EC and RinP, and learners' meta-comments) functions, was responsible for learners' transformation from other-regulation to self-regulation - language serving a cognitive function on an inter-personal level gradually became intra-personal; (d) RinP was instrumental in transferring not only the responsibility for participation (elaboration, initiation, and elicitation of TG) but also, through EC consequent to elicitation of TG, the responsibility for grammar-accuracy; and, (e) TG lacking an English counterpart required not only learners' cognitive understanding of the TG form but also where (which contexts) to use it - here, RinP efficiently co-constructed contexts for elicitation of TG and its differentiation, through EC. In line with Vygostkian principles, the tutor's collaborative RinP improved learners' participation while the collaborative EC improved the learners' grammar accuracy within that improving participation. Implications include: (a) grammar accuracy is not an end-product but depended on not only task-difficulty and subject-matter but also degree to which similar TG were differentiated; and, (b) all errors, salient and not, must be corrected from the beginning - ignoring errors deemed "unimportant" was myopic...|$|R
