5000|$|The {{original}} Prestel system, {{designed for}} cost effectiveness and simplicity, employed a rudimentary graphic capability known as serial mosaics. Through juxtaposition {{of the special}} mosaic characters, crude but recognizable graphic representations could {{be made on the}} screen. This graphic scheme had <b>its</b> <b>limitations.</b> <b>To</b> change colors between two mosaic graphic characters or between any two characters in general, a color change command was required. This command signal, however, physically occupied a blank space on the screen.The French sought to overcome this limitation when they joined the videotex world in the mid-1970s. They called their system Antiope. While based on the same mosaic graphics that were employed by the British, Antiope added a new feature, parallel attributes, or the ability to change the color from one cell to another without the need for a blank space.At approximately the same time, the Canadians adapted standard computer graphic commands into a set of functions called alphageometrics. These alphageometric functions did away with the block mosaic graphics used by the British and French and replaced them with drawing instructions, such as: DRAW LINE, DRAW ARC, DRAW POLYGON, etc. Through use of these geometric commands much higher resolution could be achieved than with the mosaic commands. This alphageometric scheme was integrated into the Canadian videotex system which the Canadians referred to as [...] "Telidon".|$|E

This study attempts to utilize the mathematical programming in optimizing the bow form of twin hulls for minimum total resistance as well as in analyzing the optimization by physical model tests. The total resistance is assumed to be composed of wave-making and frictional components, which are formulated using Michell’s thin-ship theory and ITTC- 1957 friction line, respectively. The optimized hull form is analyzed by means of a computational flow solver before going through the experimental analysis.
