25|$|Gediminas {{was born}} in about 1275. Because written sources of the era are scarce, Gediminas' ancestry, early life, and {{assumption}} of the title of Grand Duke in ca. 1316 are obscure {{and continue to be}} the subject of scholarly debate. Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either his predecessor Grand Duke Vytenis' son, his brother, his cousin, or his <b>hostler.</b> For several centuries only two versions of his origins circulated. Chronicles — written long after Gediminas' death by the Teutonic Knights, a long-standing enemy of Lithuania — claimed that Gediminas was a <b>hostler</b> to Vytenis; according to these chronicles, Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne. Another version introduced in the Lithuanian Chronicles, which also appeared long after Gediminas' death, proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis' son. However, the two men were almost the same age, making this relationship unlikely.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the fast food habits of the <b>hostlers</b> in relation to their consumption and awareness and to study the role of their parents and advertisement. Food is considered an important representation of all ethnic groups. Although, the trend change and its impact exits on whole society, whether it belongs to lower middle class and/or elite class. But beside this thing till today there is no proper definition of the fast food. Hostel life is entirely different from the in-home especially in terms of eating habit. So, by keeping this view in mind the study was conducted in Lovely Professional University hostels to know about the consumption and awareness of the <b>hostlers</b> about the fast food eating pattern. The study emphasizes on the ambiguity in the knowledge, awareness and prudent consumption behavior amongst the university <b>hostlers.</b> It provides converging evidence of a direct causal link between food advertising, parent’s role and behavioral pattern of the <b>hostlers</b> about the fast food consumption. The study was conducted during the October-November 2011 in the Lovely Professional University hostels. At present 18, 000 students residing in the university hostels as information obtained from the university authority from which 10. 06 % of the total samples i. e., 1811 were targeted and non-parametric test (chi-square) was applied to check the goodness of fit, at 95 % level of significance. The survey provides converging evidence of a direct causal link between food advertising, parent’s role and behavioral pattern of the <b>hostlers</b> about the fast food consumption. Understanding <b>hostlers</b> eating attitude and behavior is important in terms of their health which clearly demarks that the adoption of fast food culture among university <b>hostlers</b> in Lovely Professional University is common. The study signifies the direct ambiguity in the knowledge, awareness and prudent consumption behavior amongst the university <b>hostlers...</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} <b>hostlers</b> at the {{municipal}} shops whose duties consist of {{seeing that the}} automobiles were properly supplied with gasoline and oil, and were washed when necessary, the intervals between washings averaging about three months. In case a car was wanted at the city hall in a hurry by a department head, it was delivered {{by one of the}} <b>hostlers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We changed horses {{usually in}} a village; {{and it was very}} curious to see what queer-looking <b>hostlers</b> and stable boys came out with the new teams. Generally the <b>hostlers</b> were all ready, waiting for the {{diligence}} to come; but sometimes they would be all asleep, and the conductor and the postilion would make a great shouting and uproar in waking them up.|$|R
25|$|Smith {{entered the}} 2007 season {{learning}} under a third offensive coordinator in three seasons. Norv Turner {{was hired as}} the head coach by the San Diego Chargers. Jim <b>Hostler</b> replaced Turner. Hostler's system involved a mixture of the offensive system installed by Turner with elements of the West Coast offense installed by Mike McCarthy for the 2005 season. During the offseason, the 49ers added wide receivers Darrell Jackson, Ashley Lelie, and rookie Jason Hill as new offensive targets for Smith.|$|E
25|$|Smith entered {{training}} camp {{competing for the}} starting quarterback job with Shaun Hill, who won both of the games he started in 2007, before suffering a back injury against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and journeyman J. T. O'Sullivan. Smith would be learning under a fourth different offensive coordinator in four seasons; Jim <b>Hostler</b> was fired and replaced by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator and St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator/head coach Mike Martz. Unlike the previous three seasons, where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained, Martz's system was completely different. Smith lost the starting job in {{training camp}} to O'Sullivan, who was elevated to starting quarterback, partly due to his familiarity with Martz's offense {{when he was a}} member of the Detroit Lions.|$|E
25|$|The {{company had}} a strict policy {{that they would}} not {{purchase}} any horses that were broke. The company wanted their horses trained exclusively for staging, a process that generally took three months, even then they were never truly broken and had to be expertly handled. A <b>hostler</b> would lead the teams out to the stages only once the baggage had been secured and the passengers and driver were safely seated. Once harnessed to the stage, the reins were given to the driver and he could release the brake. The stage horses often leaped and reared {{at the start of a}} trip, but settled into a smooth trot once they were underway. The whip rarely had to be used to encourage them, as they knew the next station meant a good feed and a warm stable.|$|E
60|$|So Mr. George and Rollo dismounted, and the <b>hostlers</b> {{came out}} from the stable to {{unharness}} the horses.|$|R
60|$|The boys applied whip and spur, {{the waiters}} shouted, the <b>hostlers</b> cheered, and away they went, fast and furiously.|$|R
60|$|So {{they decided}} upon the open one; and then, while the <b>hostlers</b> were {{harnessing}} the horses, Mr. George and Rollo went {{forward to the}} bridge.|$|R

In 1868, a letter issued by the Council of Riga in 1323 was published that contained a small note mentioning Vytenis as [...] "the brother and predecessor" [...] of Gediminas. After the letter came to light, textbooks almost universally represented Vytenis and Gediminas as brothers. However, historian Tomas Baranauskas believes the word [...] "brother" [...] has been interpreted too literally, and that the two were in fact cousins.|$|E
500|$|The breach {{between the}} two men did not last long. In late September or early October Hare was visiting Burke when Mrs Ostler (also given as <b>Hostler),</b> a washerwoman, came to the {{property}} to do the laundry. The men got her drunk and killed her; the corpse was with Dr Knox that afternoon, for which the men received £8. A week or two later one of McDougal's relatives, Ann Dougal (also given as McDougal) was visiting from Falkirk; after a few days the men killed her by their usual technique and received £10 for the body. Burke later claimed that about this time Margaret Hare suggested killing Helen McDougal on the grounds that [...] "they could not trust her, as she was a Scotch woman", but he refused.|$|E
500|$|To {{stop the}} opponent's onslaught, U.S. fighter-bombers {{were called in}} to strafe North Vietnamese and VC formations, while U.S. {{soldiers}} on the ground used small-arms and artillery fire {{to break up the}} attack at point-blank range. Meanwhile, a U.S. Army UH-1 Huey and an O-2 Skymaster were shot down while circling the compound. By the time the first attack was stopped, {{the opposite end of the}} compound also came under fire, and by early morning tactical air-support became difficult, as North Vietnamese troops were in close proximity with U.S. and allied forces. A U.S. Army CH-47 Chinook then arrived to begin the process of evacuation, but it took several hits from anti-aircraft fire. The helicopter then burst into flames, exploded, and blocked the runway. U.S. soldiers of the 70th Engineer Battalion first tried to remove the wreckage with a forklift (their only operating vehicle, the bulldozers having been disassembled in preparation for airlift out); the forklift caught fire from the burning plane, and the engineers then assembled one of their bulldozers to push the downed helicopter off the runway; North Vietnamese troops mortared the bulldozer but SP5 Don <b>Hostler</b> cleared the wreckage and then tracked the dozer back into Camp Conroy and shut it down. [...] By 10:00 they had cleared the obstacles which would prevent other fixed-wing aircraft from using the airfield. Almost simultaneously, a single U.S. Air Force A-1 Skyraider flown by Major James N. Swain Jr. was shot down outside the camp perimeter.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, SDSU {{opened the}} newly renovated social {{sciences}} complex, Storm and Nasatir Halls. Originally built in 1957, the 137,700 square foot complex received a complete makeover to house eight academic departments from the College of Arts & Letters, newly upgraded classrooms, faculty offices, research facilities, two large lecture halls, and a food service facility. Total {{cost for the}} construction neared $74 million, began in 2012, and was completed in 2014. Included in the opening were two new named facilities: Charles <b>Hostler</b> Hall (a 435-seat lecture auditorium) and the J. Keith Behner and Catherine M.

60|$|Within {{the great}} {{enclosure}} thrived a fair sized town, for, with his ten hundred fighting-men, the Outlaw of Torn required many squires, lackeys, cooks, scullions, armorers, smithies, farriers, <b>hostlers</b> {{and the like}} {{to care for the}} wants of his little army.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} in the trend of social networking, celebrations, over a couple of decades weather in the hostel or at home. Snacking has become an important aspect of activity. Today teen prefer snacks more than a proper meal. Skipping of meal and nibbling in between meal is a common practice. The main meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) are missed and total proportions of calories are consumed from the snacks eaten. Hence, this disordered eating behavior when continued may further lead to development of serious syndrome i. e., night eating syndrome. A purposive random sample comprising 188 males and 192 females (N= 380), adolescents (18 - 22 years) were selected including <b>hostlers</b> and day scholars. The subjects were administered with self-organized questionnaire so to analyze the pattern of NES among them. Out of total 380 respondents, the numbers of <b>hostlers</b> were 211 and day scholars 169, while boys were 188 and girls were 192 in number. Results indicated that nearly half the percentage of adolescents snacked at night, out of which very few respondents met the criteria of NES, in which the number of <b>hostlers</b> were quite more than the day scholars, i. e., 76. 3 %...|$|R

2500|$|The first station {{represents}} Jerusalem. After {{the prologue}} there follows a dance, the direction for {{which has been}} added in by a later hand, seemingly {{in an attempt to}} make the piece more exciting. The play proper begins with Saul, dressed in rich apparel, boasting of his power and of the fear which he inspires, doing so [...] "a little in the Herod style". The priests Caypha and Anna give him letters to take to Damascus, where he is to suppress heresy (i.e. the worship of Jesus). Saul then gathers together his knights and servants, who agree to follow him. There follows a comic scene, not present in other versions of the Conversion, between one of Saul's servants and an <b>hostler,</b> who ready a horse which Saul then rides off on. Poeta re-enters to [...] "mak a conclusyon" [...] of this first station, and again the stage direction [...] "daunce" [...] has been written in a later hand.|$|E
2500|$|John Keats {{was born}} in Moorgate, London, on 31 October 1795 to Thomas Keats and his wife, born Frances Jennings. There is little {{evidence}} of his exact birth place. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29October, baptism records give the date as the 31st. He was the eldest of four surviving children; his younger siblings were George (1797–1841), Thomas (1799–1818), and Frances Mary [...] "Fanny" [...] (1803–1889) who eventually married Spanish author Valentín Llanos Gutiérrez. Another son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as a <b>hostler</b> at the stables attached to the Swan and Hoop Inn, an establishment he later managed, and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed that he was born at the inn, a birthplace of humble origins, {{but there is no}} evidence to support his belief. The Globe pub now occupies the site (2012), a few yards from the modern-day Moorgate station. He was baptised at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, and sent to a local dame school as a child.|$|E
5000|$|Many service {{industries}} also developed, notably saddlers, tailors, carpenters, <b>hostlers,</b> metal and tin workers. In addition butchers, fishmongers, and {{fresh fruit and}} vegetable merchants lined the streets facing the market building.

60|$|Away ran the <b>hostlers</b> and the boys. The {{lanterns}} glimmered, {{as the men}} ran to and fro; the horses' hoofs clattered on {{the uneven}} paving of the yard; the chaise rumbled as it was drawn out of the coach-house; and all was noise and bustle.|$|R
50|$|A man expresses an {{interest}} in a woman. The <b>hostler's</b> wife lures her to him with an offer of fine wine. After he has his will of her, she demands his name. He may be an earl's son, an earl's younger (and landless) son, or a highland squire.|$|R
