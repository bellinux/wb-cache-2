5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

25|$|I {{am doing}} {{everything}} in my power to discourage the use of gases and other chemicals in any war between nations. While, unfortunately, the defensive necessities of the United States call for study of the use of chemicals in warfare, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> the Government of the United States to do anything to aggrandize or make permanent any special bureau of the Army or the Navy engaged in these studies. I hope the time will come when the Chemical Warfare Service can be entirely abolished.|$|E
60|$|I {{ran down}} the hill in the thick Swiss {{darkness}} to the little bridge, and along the uneven cobbled street. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to think, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to know. <b>I</b> wanted to arrest my activity, to keep it confined to the moment, to the adventure.|$|R

60|$|Remembering {{the remarks}} {{which had been}} made about her by her friend Edith, I could not but admit {{that she was a}} very fine girl, {{combining}} a great many attractive qualities, but I rebelled against every conviction I had in regard to her. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to think about her admirable qualities. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to believe that in time they would impress me more forcibly than they <b>did</b> now. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> people to imagine that I would come to be so impressed. If I stayed there I might almost look upon her in the light of a duty.|$|R

500|$|Rapp {{immediately}} {{recommended to}} the Emperor that the Guard be deployed for action {{at which the}} Emperor {{is said to have}} retorted: [...] "I will most definitely not; <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have it blown up. I am certain of winning the battle without its intervention." [...] Determined not to commit this valuable final reserve so far away from France, Napoleon rejected another such request, this time from Marshal Ney. Instead, he called the commander of the [...] "Young Guard", Marshal Mortier and instructed him to guard the field of battle without moving forward or backward, {{while at the same time}} unleashing a massive cannonade with his 400 guns.|$|E
500|$|George {{warned in}} the Senate, [...] "I {{do not want}} a {{president}} of the U.S. to conclude an executive agreement which will make it unlawful for me to kill a cat in the back alley of my lot at night and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> the President of the U.S. to make a treaty with India which would preclude me from butchering a cow in my own pasture." [...] Senator George was ideal as an opponent as he was a hero to conservatives of both parties for his opposition to the New Deal and his survival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unsuccessful effort to purge him when he sought re-election in 1938. [...] "Democrats and Republicans alike respected him and recognized his influence." ...|$|E

5000|$|There were {{offers to}} play the role of a {{musician}} but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to <b>do</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to <b>do</b> it (musician role) because <b>I</b> had <b>done</b> it (with Rock On) beyond my expectations. I had surpassed the expectations. There was always talk about Rock On 2, so I wanted to preserve it.|$|R
60|$|I {{answered}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> a room, but the remark about breakfast {{made me feel}} that I should like a cup of coffee, and perhaps I might get it here. It {{might have been a}} more natural thing {{to go back to the}} boat and ask Abner to make me the coffee, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to go back to the boat. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to wake Walkirk. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have him with me on shore. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to have him talk to me. My present intention was to go to the yacht as soon as it was reasonable to suppose that its passengers were awake, to see Mrs. Raynor, and say to her what I had to say. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel in the proper spirit for this; but, in the spirit in which I found myself, the less I was trammeled by advice, by suggestions of prudence, and all that sort of thing, the better it would be for me. So I was very glad that my under-study was asleep on the grocery boat, and hoped that he would remain in that condition until I had had my talk with Sylvia's mother.|$|R
500|$|By 1966, Cardinale {{was being}} {{cited as the}} most popular film star in Italy, even more than Mastroianni and Loren. Life stated that [...] "the Cardinale appeal {{is a blend of}} solid {{simplicity}} and radiant sensuality. It moves men {{all over the world to}} imagine her both as an exciting mistress and wife." [...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If I have to give up the money, I give it up. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to become a cliché." ...|$|E
500|$|Dworkin's {{short fiction}} and novels often {{incorporated}} elements from {{her life and}} themes from her nonfiction writing, sometimes related by a first-person narrator. Critics have sometimes quoted passages spoken by characters in Ice and Fire as representations of Dworkin's own views. cf. Dworkin, however, wrote [...] "My fiction is not autobiography. I am not an exhibitionist. I do not show myself. I am not asking for forgiveness. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to confess. But I have used everything I know—my life—to show what I believe must be shown {{so that it can}} be faced. The imperative at the heart of my writing—what must be done—comes directly from my life. But I do not show my life directly, in full view; nor even look at it while others watch." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{political}} climate of {{the country at the}} time, on April 1, 2003, Madonna pulled the video and released a statement explaining why: [...] "I have decided not to release my new video. It was filmed before the war started and I do not believe it is appropriate to air it at this time. Due to the volatile state of the world and out of sensitivity and respect to the armed forces, who I support and pray for, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to risk offending anyone who might misinterpret the meaning of this video." [...] After pulling the original video, it was then released an edited version that premiered on April 16, 2003 on VH1, immediately after a special program called Madonna Speaks. This version features Madonna singing in front of a backdrop of ever-changing flags of different countries.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his success}} in {{advancing}} Nixon's career, Chotiner was respected, but was not universally popular among the Vice President's backers. Frank Jorgensen, one of Nixon's first backers in the Voorhis race, said of the attorney, [...] "I knew that Murray was very impatient with people who didn't have the IQ that he had. He had the habit of {{a man like that}} of tramping on them. He'd move ahead. He'd just leave the wreckage behind him, but he would get the job done." [...] Nixon family friend and Whittier College trustee Herman Perry stated, [...] "When Murray develops a little more of the techniques of public relations, I {{will be one of the}} first to recognize it and one of the first to give him credit... The one thing <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> him to do is be the quarterback and call the plays on the team on which I play." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne just gets his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship with everybody from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really want to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|After {{being named}} Most Valuable Player (MVP) {{at the prestigious}} Boston Shootout and {{acknowledged}} as the leading participant at the Nike camp, Howard was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering UNLV as well. Following his time at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement: [...] "Contact my coach. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all {{times of the day}} and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, {{when it comes time to}} make my decision, I'll take those things into account." [...] Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects. [...] Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit. [...] By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica {{had four}} matches to gain four points on Sporting. The first {{was at the}} Estádio da Madeira with Nacional. Knowing that Sporting had lost points to Académica, Benfica hoped to narrow the gsp between them to two points. After an uneventful first half, in the 56th minute Nenê scored the opening goal for Nacional. Eight minutes later, Rúben Micael {{extended}} the lead, with Reyes reducing it in the 67th minute. Benfica pressed unsuccessfully for the equaliser before Nacional scored again with Miguel Fidalgo. Sánchez Flores realised that winning the league title was now impossible. On 9 May, Benfica met Trofense at home. Valdomiro scored first for the visitors in the 31st minute before Benfica scored twice in two minutes, reaching half-time with a 2–1 lead. In the second half, Paulinho tied the score for Trofense. Sporting won that day, so Benfica trailed by seven points with two match days left and could not qualify for the Champions League. Sánchez Flores said, [...] "I know when to arrive and when to leave. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> {{to be a problem}} for the club." [...] Playing out the schedule, Benfica first visited the Municipal de Braga. They won 3–1, ending a five-year winless streak there. The victory was against Jorge Jesus, widely reported as Sánchez Flores' successor. A week later, Benfica ended their campaign with a 3–1 win against Belenenses. Sánchez Flores analysed the club's season: [...] "They asked me to improve the team and I did. But we all know what happened last year; we should set realistic goals. Second place was possible, but we failed in the final third. I won a title and fought for another." [...] A short time later, he and the club terminated his contract.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2016, President Duterte {{confirmed}} the Maute group's {{affiliation with the}} Islamic State. Amidst fierce fighting in Butig on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: [...] "Ayaw ko makipag-away sa inyo.
