500|$|The Japanese {{force on}} Tarakan learned of Derrick's death {{and tried to}} exploit it for {{propaganda}} purposes. They printed a leaflet which began [...] "We lament {{over the death of}} Lieutenant General Terick CinC of Allied Force in Tarakan" [...] and later included the question [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the death in action of your Commander in Chief...?" [...] This leaflet reached few Australian soldiers, and had little impact on them. [...] "Tokyo Rose" [...] also broadcast taunts over [...] "Terick's" [...] death.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell {{was the only way to}} get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E

Juno is horrified by this revelation, with Mark asking Juno [...] " [...] How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me? [...] ", revealing Mark is starting to develop feelings for Juno. Vanessa arrives home, and Mark tells her he does not feel ready {{to be a father}} and there are still things he wants to do first. Juno watches the Loring marriage fall apart, then drives away and breaks down in tears {{by the side of the}} road.

500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals. According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally open-mouthed in astonishment. Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time! ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|Artist V. Jeevananthan {{compared}} Aval Appadithan {{to other}} films whose central theme was women, such as Charulata (1964), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), and Panchagni (1986), while also labelling them as [...] "classics {{that put the}} spotlight on women." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy. The last lines of the film where Manju asks [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> 'women's liberation'", [...] Arun's wife answers, [...] "I don't know", [...] to which Manju says [...] "that is why you are happy", send the message that one will inevitably get into trouble if one exhibits assertive behaviour.|$|E
500|$|The truth finally emerges that Manju {{was merely}} baiting Thyagu {{to teach him}} a lesson. When Thyagu starts believing that Manju has fallen for him, he {{attempts}} {{to take advantage of}} her at a party banquet, but she rebukes and slaps him, after which Thyagu runs away in fright. However, this revelation comes too late for her, as Arun, who is disillusioned with her behaviour, has already married a small town girl (Saritha). When Manju tells her aunt about the attempt to humiliate Thyagu and its ramifications, her aunt tells Manju that she deserved it for leaving behind a golden opportunity to start a new life. In a final discussion in Thyagu's car, Manju asks Arun's wife, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> women's liberation?". Arun's wife replies, [...] "I don't know". Manju replies with a cynical, [...] "that is why you are happy". The film ends with Manju standing on the road as the car carrying Thyagu and the married couple pulls away from her. A voice-over says, [...] "She died today. She will be reborn tomorrow. She will die again. She will be reborn again. That is how she is".|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Jackson's death, and in the {{aftermath}} of it, multiple reports surfaced that AEG Live purposely tried to hide Jackson's health concerns during preparations for his would-have-been concerts. Concerns included Jackson's frail appearance due to lack of eating that had reportedly caused Jackson to be unable to perform from lack of strength and that AEG had used body doubles in rehearsals to stand in for Jackson. After Jackson's death, AEG stated that there was no truth to any of the rumors and that Jackson was thin but in good enough condition to perform. On 23 October 2009, days before the film's release, fans of Jackson launched a protest campaign against the film entitled [...] "This Is not It". The campaign's focus was to convince people that Jackson's health was neglected by AEG, among others, and that AEG was partly responsible for Jackson's death and now the company is making a profit off Jackson's death. The group started a website and created their own 'trailer' for the movie to showcase their point-of-view on the documentary. The protestors also inaccurately claimed that Jackson was 108 pounds (49 kg) at his death, contradicting Jackson's autopsy, which had stated that Jackson weighed 136 pounds (61kg). Shortly after the protest became news, The Guardian conducted a poll on their website asking users [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Michael Jackson's posthumous film This Is It?", 51.4% agreed with one of the two options: [...] "I agree with the fans who are boycotting it—it's shameless profiteering".|$|E

2500|$|In early 1989, Whitley {{approached}} Sony Music Nashville chairman Joe Galante {{with the}} intention of releasing [...] "I Never Go Around Mirrors" [...] as a single. Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song; however, he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat. The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called I Wonder <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> Me, and was to result in his next album release.|$|E

The album was released three months after his death, on August 1, 1989. The album produced two more No.1 hits, with the title track and [...] "It Ain't Nothin'." [...] "I'm Over You" [...] also saw the Top 5 in early 1990, reaching No. 3.|$|E
2500|$|The Reagan Doctrine was {{especially}} significant because it represented a substantial {{shift in the}} post–World War II foreign policy of the United States. Prior to the Reagan Doctrine, U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Cold War was rooted in [...] "containment", as originally defined by George F. Kennan, John Foster Dulles, and other post–World War II U.S. foreign policy experts. In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Whitley grew up {{in nearby}} Sandy Hook, Kentucky. Whitley began his career there in 1970, {{performing}} in Ralph Stanley's band. Establishing himself as a lead singer in bluegrass music, Whitley moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1983 and began his recording career there. His first Top 20 Country Hit single, [...] "Miami, My Amy", was released in 1986. While touring for his album L.A. to Miami, he married country singer Lorrie Morgan. In 1988, his first three singles from his studio album Don't Close Your Eyes, the title song, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All" [...] and [...] "I'm No Stranger to the Rain" [...] were number-one hits. On May 9, 1989, he suffered alcohol poisoning {{at his home in}} Nashville, and died as a result. His death came in the wake of several years of alcoholism. His later two singles, [...] "I Wonder <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> Me" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Nothin'", were released after his death.|$|E
