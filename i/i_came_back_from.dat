500|$|In December 1968, Iommi {{abruptly}} left Earth to join Jethro Tull. Although his stint {{with the}} band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way. When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 31, 1967, in a taped {{interview}} with locally influential (and nationally syndicated) {{talk show host}} Lou Gordon of WKBD-TV in Detroit, Romney stated: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Viet Nam , I'd just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get." [...] He then shifted to opposing the war: [...] "I no longer {{believe that it was}} necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia." [...] Decrying the [...] "tragic" [...] conflict, he urged [...] "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." [...] Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was [...] "morally right and necessary".|$|E

2500|$|He said he {{was left}} {{exhausted}} and depressed by his dealings with Kasenetz and Katz. [...] "In the mornings I {{would go into the}} office and start writing and after I had finished one song in a day, which was very high output for me, they'd {{come up to me and}} say: 'Give us another song!' And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> New York." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page {{talked about}} his love of Indian music, saying: [...] "I went to India after <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a tour with the Yardbirds {{in the late sixties}} just so I could hear the music firsthand. Let's put it this way: I had a sitar before George Harrison got his. I wouldn't say I played it as well as he did, though …" [...] The East Indian scales used on the track [...] "Friends" [...] (Led Zep III) [...] "Kashmir" [...] (Physical Graffiti) are {{considered}} fine examples of the influence of the sitar in rock music. The Doors extensively used Indian and near eastern scales in their psychedelic soundscapes. Robbie Krieger's guitar part on [...] "The End" [...] was heavily influenced by Indian ragas and features melodic and rhythmic qualities that suggest a sitar or veena. Fleetwood Mac's Gold Dust Woman features the instrument, as well. Many pop performances actually involve the Electric Sitar, a solid body guitar-like instrument quite different from the traditional acoustic Indian instrument.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] he answered; [...] "of {{an evening}} as <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> fishing <b>I</b> can see numbers of them walking there. When the vesper bell rings {{they all go}} in. That is the chapel {{adjoining}} the convent on this side." ...|$|R
