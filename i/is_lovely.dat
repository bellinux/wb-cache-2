Kreisberg said, [...] "Both Arrow and Flash are helping to set those things up, in both big ways and small ways, which <b>is</b> <b>lovely...</b> There's {{going to be a lot}} happening leading up to the crossover, which is serving as a [...] pilot for Legends." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2007, Jones became romantically {{involved}} with mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins. They first met in 2005 when she appeared on Blue Peter {{and he was}} struck by how good she was with kids: [...] "You kind of think people like that are all going to be false, but she really wasn't at all, and I like that. She really <b>is</b> <b>lovely,</b> a typical Neath girl." [...] It was reported they met after Jenkins sang [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli on an episode of Strictly Come Dancing, broadcast on 21 October 2007. Jenkins's spokesman has said: [...] "They're old friends and they've been on several dates. But people shouldn't consider buying hats just yet." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, music contributor David Browne wrote that the song [...] "is imbued {{with the sense of}} regret and letting go that we've heard from the band before, but with added musical muscle." [...] Michael Hubbard of MusicOMH wrote: [...] "'A Message' and 'The Hardest Part' sound like companion pieces, both big songs." [...] Critic Kelefa Sanneh of Rolling Stone noted that the song gets [...] "less catchy as it goes along". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters wrote that [...] "The Hardest Part" [...] is a [...] "pleasant slice of R.E.M. style pop." [...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun reported that the song sounded [...] "like the Smiths meets REM." [...] David Cheal of The Daily Telegraph noted, [...] "...'The Hardest Part' <b>is</b> <b>lovely,</b> straightforward, instantly accessible pop-rock".|$|E
500|$|For {{her second}} Hollywood role, Thompson starred with John Travolta in Mike Nichols's Primary Colors (1998), playing a couple based on Bill and Hillary Clinton. Thompson's character, Susan, is {{described}} as that of an [...] "ambitious, long-suffering wife" [...] who {{has to deal with}} her husband's infidelity. The film was critically well received but lost money at the box office. According to Kevin O'Sullivan of the Daily Mirror, Americans were [...] "blown away" [...] by her performance and accent, and top Hollywood producers became increasingly interested in casting her. Thompson rejected many of the offers, expressing concerns about living in Los Angeles behind walls with bodyguards, and stated [...] "LA <b>is</b> <b>lovely</b> as long as you know you can leave". She also admitted to feeling tired and jaded with the industry at this point, which influenced her decision to leave film for a year. Thompson followed Primary Colors by playing an FBI agent opposite Rickman in the poorly received thriller Judas Kiss (1998).|$|E

500|$|Hee Seo ( [...] ; born 13 March 1986) is a South Korean {{principal}} dancer for American Ballet Theatre (ABT), one of {{the three}} leading classical ballet companies in the United States. [...] She became the company's first Korean ballerina to be promoted to principal dancer in ABT's 75-year history and is one of only three principal dancers in the company who have worked their way up the ranks from the American Ballet Theatre Studio Company. She is also {{one of the}} youngest dancers in ABT history to be promoted to principal at the age of twenty-six. The New York Times has described her style and dancing to [...] "exude an unhurried purity that sums up all that <b>is</b> <b>lovely</b> about ballet" [...] and by Vogue as [...] "unspeakably [...] ". Several critics have noted her style as [...] "lyrical and open" [...] and she has been critically acclaimed for her [...] "humility" [...] and [...] "unique feminine strength".|$|E
500|$|Diana uses Paul's son and stepson to {{help her}} plan along. Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) gives Diana inside info about Paul embezzling as he {{believes}} he is doing the right thing. Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) tries to bond with Diana by giving her company information and Diana discovers the extent of Paul's money problems and knows that she has enough details to ruin him. Paul realises that Diana knows the truth and offers to join forces with her to bring down Rosemary instead. Diana becomes friends with Paul's wife, Rebecca (Jane Hall), and she realises that she can [...] "shatter Paul's marriage" [...] as Rebecca does not suspect anything is wrong. Badler said [...] "There is all this history between Paul and Diana and now {{they seem to be}} dancing around each other. There's every chance they could catch fire again. Diana is so charming and when people meet her they think she <b>is</b> <b>lovely</b> – but she really is not. And that's what makes her even more of a superbitch." ...|$|E
500|$|By contrast, the {{remaining}} work, the Cello Concerto in E minor, had a disastrous premiere, {{at the opening}} concert of the London Symphony Orchestra's 1919–20 season in October 1919. Apart from the Elgar work, which the composer conducted, {{the rest of the}} programme was conducted by Albert Coates, who overran his rehearsal time at the expense of Elgar's. Lady Elgar wrote, [...] "that brutal selfish ill-mannered bounder ... that brute Coates went on rehearsing." [...] The critic of The Observer, Ernest Newman, wrote, [...] "There have been rumours about during the week of inadequate rehearsal. Whatever the explanation, the sad fact remains that never, in all probability, has so great an orchestra made so lamentable an exhibition of itself. ... The work itself <b>is</b> <b>lovely</b> stuff, very simple – that pregnant simplicity that has come upon Elgar's music {{in the last couple of}} years – but with a profound wisdom and beauty underlying its simplicity." [...] Elgar attached no blame to his soloist, Felix Salmond, who played for him again later. In contrast with the First Symphony and its hundred performances in just over a year, the Cello Concerto did not have a second performance in London for more than a year.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Marge's mother Jackie is particularly nightmarish in her first real appearance. The final sequence on the rooftop with Lisa and Bart <b>is</b> <b>lovely,</b> and Homer's comment to Marge is a magical wrap-up to a good episode." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the episode [...] "maintained a nicely irreverent tone most of the time— irreverent {{enough to make it}} amusing, at least," [...] and added: [...] "The interaction of the Simpson and Bouvier families at dinner was terrific, and Bart’s experiences on skid row made their point while they still managed to be pointed and clever. 'Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was another winner." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute", another season two episode, were the first episodes that [...] "asked [...] to truly care about the characters, and they work beautifully." [...] Both Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal and Jacobson thought the most memorable line of the episode was Jackie's line to Marge: [...] "I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll just say one thing— you never do anything right." [...] A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was Homer's [...] "Oh Lord, be honest– are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?".|$|E
2500|$|Some critics did praise {{various aspects}} of the film, however, {{particularly}} in regard to Bluth's animation. These reviews, however, were almost exclusively mixed. Common Sense Media said, [...] "the background animation of capricious weather conditions <b>is</b> <b>lovely,</b> as are the top-notch original songs by Barry Manilow and Mark Watters". Deseret News said: [...] "Bluth's strength continues to be colorful, classical-style animation, and there are some gorgeous moments here — especially some underwater sequences". The Austin Chronicle said: [...] "The Pebble and the Penguin features some beautifully animated sequences [...] The characters are great and the voice talents of Martin Short...and James Belushi...are terrific". Variety said the film has a [...] "heartwarming story, some lively songs and professional animation", adding that it is [...] "a sweet, enjoyable romantic tale more likely to succeed as an afternoon diversion on home video than on the big screen". The New York Times wrote [...] "The tunes Mr. Manilow has written for the movie are, like his familiar pop standards, bouncy and catchy", and commented that [...] "the animation is fine". Washington Post Staff Writer Hal Hinson wrote that [...] "A flourishing opening number—titled 'Here and Now'—proves that Short can belt out a song with the best of them", adding that the [...] "Bluth studio style of animation is passable, and, {{in the case of a}} Brecht-Weill flavored production number, occasionally inspired." ...|$|E
