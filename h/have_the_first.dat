5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these bowls were picked in a {{hierarchical}} system {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order.

Bowls would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 53 team over a 62 team, but could not select a 44 team over a 62 team.|$|E
