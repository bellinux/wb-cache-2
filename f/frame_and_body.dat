25|$|The G class {{featured}} imported General Motors-Electro-Motive Division technology (prime mover, alternator and traction motors) on {{a locally}} designed <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body.</b> Major advances introduced {{with the class}} included cab air conditioning, onboard toilet, Trimount type high adhesion bogies, and Super Series wheel creep control to enable heavier loads to be hauled. The locomotives were designed to be of minimum mass, allowing a higher fuel load. The body consists of two side trusses with load bearing supports, roofbows and integral cabs. The side panels are made of fibreglass for the minimum weight, with various accessories mounted in removable roof hatches.|$|E
25|$|The N class {{feature a}} <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> locally designed, but with {{imported}} Electro-Motive Division {{technology in the}} prime mover, generator and control unit, along with locally produced components such as the bogie frames by Bradford Kendall. The class {{was the first in}} the world to use the EMD D43 traction motor, similar to but smaller than that used in the C and G classes. Head end power is provided by a separate engine unit in a special compartment located at the number 1 end of the locomotive behind the electrical cabinet. The 240kW generator provides 415V 3-phase AC power for train lighting, air conditioning and other carriage requirements.|$|E
500|$|The Storm was {{primarily}} meant to satisfy Israeli military needs, but capable {{long and short}} versions are produced for the local civilian market. Like the Jeep, it has a conventional front-engine design with a driver and passenger seated behind the engine, and room for cargo or passengers behind them. It is powered by an AMC 3.983 litre 6-cylinder in-line petrol with fuel injection developing [...] at 4,700rpm, fitted with Vortox 2-stage air cleaner or a Volkswagen 2.5 litre 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel developing 88kilowatts (118hp) at 4,200rpm. The front axle is fully floating and the rear axle is semi-floating, while a reinforced <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> as well as good angles of approach and departure (40째 and 37째 for short frame, 40째 and 26.5째 for long frame) add to the Storm's off-roading capability.|$|E
5000|$|The first Tucker {{produced}} was {{a prototype}} sedan, {{known as the}} [...] "Tin Goose". Fifty-eight <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> were built at the factory. From these parts, 36 sedans were finished before the factory was closed. After the factory closed but before liquidation of his assets, Tucker retained a core of employees, who assembled an additional 14 sedans {{for a total of}} 50. A 51st car was partially completed. A few of the remaining <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> were built into complete cars specifically #1052 and #1057 (the 1949 prototype with design changes), but the fate of others is unknown.|$|R

25|$|Owing {{to space}} {{constraints}} at Darlington works, the Tornado tender <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> were built off-site, {{with the body}} being significantly built locally in Darlington. The tender wheelsets were assembled by an East Lancs Railway-based company. The tender <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> wheelset were united by December 2007, and the tank attached to it by February 2008.|$|R
2500|$|All {{three were}} uni-body cars, dubbed the [...] "Y-body" [...] platform, {{combining}} the <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> {{into a single}} construction, making them comparatively lighter and smaller. All three put into production new technology pushed by John DeLorean which GM {{had been working on}} for several years prior, but the Tempest was by far the most radical. A flexible steel shaft rotating at the speed of the engine delivered power from the front-mounted engine through a [...] "torque tube" [...] to a rear-mounted trans-axle. This innovation not only delivered close to a 50/50 front-rear weight distribution that drastically improved handling, it enabled four-wheel independent suspension which enhanced it even more. It also all but eliminated the large floor [...] "hump" [...] common to front-engined rear-drive cars.|$|E
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz 300 W186 Adenauer company {{flagship}} used a {{much larger}} <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body,</b> and was an entirely different car.|$|E
50|$|Although the 1934 Chrysler Airflow had {{a weaker}} than usual <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> {{framework}} welded to the chassis to provide stiffness, in 1960, Chrysler moved from body-on-frame construction to a unit-body design {{for most of}} its cars.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim is {{to develop}} the {{scientific}} substantiation technical regulation of measures and conditions in electric trains, series ER 1, ER 2 beyond the extended period of operation life (over 50 years). Methodology. To achieve this goal the scientific publications analysis on the survivability of {{the basic elements of}} supporting constructions that are loaded with dynamic alternating loads was carried out. The results analysis of vibration bench tests of bogie frames of electric trains ER 1, ER 2, which were obtained by using the developed technique for such tests with authors, was carried out too. Technical solutions with appropriate measures under which it is possible to extend the operation life of bearing structures of electric trains ER 1 and ER 2 were developed over 50 years. Findings.

50|$|By {{the mid-1950s}} the {{vehicles}} were worn out {{and in need}} of replacement, after up to 70 years of hard service. Instead of creating a whole new class, under <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> were repaired or replaced as required, retaining the same numbers. When this happened the vestibule connections on applicable vans were eliminated and boarded over.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{cars were}} [...] "hopped up" [...] with engine {{modifications}} such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts.

5000|$|The Station Sedan used a {{combination}} of steel <b>framing</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> parts along with structural wood panels to create a [...] "woody" [...] station wagon-like car. Unlike other woody wagons of the day, which used wooden passenger compartments mounted to chassis of a particular car, the Station Sedan used a steel subframe and steel passenger doors onto which hard wood panels were mounted. The only wooden door on the vehicle was the rear gate assembly.|$|R
25|$|Of the 4,500 GTs {{originally}} planned, approximately 100 {{were to be}} {{exported to}} Europe, starting in late 2005. An additional 200 were destined for sale in Canada. Production ended in 2006 without reaching the planned lot. Approximately 550 were built in 2004, nearly 1,900 in 2005, and just over 1,600 in 2006, for {{a grand total of}} 4,038. The final 11 car bodies manufactured by Mayflower Vehicle Systems were disassembled, <b>and</b> the <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> panels were sold as service parts.|$|R

5000|$|Classic Army AEG's are {{characterized}} by their many metal parts and realism, in that most parts that are metal on the real-steel counterpart are also metal on the replica (although they are usually not cross-compatible). These metal components usually include the <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body,</b> {{as well as the}} firing mechanism (called a [...] "gearbox").

50|$|The PPV was {{designed}} for two adult riders, and with <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> the total weight could approach three times that of a conventional single-rider bicycle. However, the PPV was fitted with just one brake, of a type intended to be just one of two brakes on a conventional single-rider bicycle (an Atom drum brake built in to the front wheel). Thus, even at relaxed speeds on level ground, the PPV brakes were dangerously inadequate.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{the slave}} {{cylinder}} on manual transmissions was moved {{outside of the}} transmissions bellhousing to allow for easier replacement, and in 1995 the Dana 30 larger U-joints were used axle U-joints (297x) and rear pinion U-joint (1330). For the 1992 model year, the YJ switched over to an electronic speedometer, outmoding the cable speedos on older YJs. 1995 was the only model year to have a fully galvanized <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

This allows the Land Cruiser to be more nimble off road. This model was popular as a personal off road transport, but because the Land Cruiser was marketed almost exclusively as a commercial and government vehicle and because these were never sold in the largest auto market in the world, the US, few were built, compared to other Land Cruiser models.|$|E

The most significant technology under consideration was the lithium ion batteries. The batteries used for the BB2.5 were A123 Systems 32113 cylindrical cells.
