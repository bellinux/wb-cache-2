5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe DNA and its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|Novakovic enjoyed {{filming the}} storyline {{because there was}} so much drama. When she was asked if she had any sympathy for Natasha during filming, she told Digital Spy that she had to because she needed to {{understand}} how her character is feeling. Novakovic also hoped viewers would have sympathy for Natasha too. The lie starts to <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and Natasha is forced to make up stories about why she does not {{want to go to the}} doctor. She later buys fake ultrasound scan photos over the internet, but Summer becomes suspicious about them and discovers they are from overseas and are fake. Summer realises that Natasha has been lying about being pregnant and reveals the truth in front of Andrew and Natasha's father, shocking Natasha. Andrew does not take the news well and Michael blames himself for his daughter's actions. Novakovic hoped the experience would change Natasha and she would start to grow up. The actress added that Natasha cannot cope by herself and if she continues lying to everyone, they may turn against her.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E

25|$|Lung disease {{results from}} {{clogging}} of the airways due to mucus build-up, decreased mucociliary clearance, and resulting inflammation. Inflammation and infection cause injury and structural {{changes to the}} lungs, leading {{to a variety of}} symptoms. In the early stages, incessant coughing, copious phlegm production, and decreased ability to exercise are common. Many of these symptoms occur when bacteria that normally inhabit the thick mucus <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and cause pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Nanotechnology has the {{potential}} to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.|$|E
25|$|In {{one of the}} few {{suspected}} acts of entomological bioterrorism an eco-terror {{group known}} as The Breeders claimed to have released Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) amidst an ongoing California infestation. Lockwood asserts that there is some evidence the group {{played a role in the}} event. The pest attacks a variety of crops and the state of California responded with a large-scale pesticide spraying program. At least one source asserted that there is no doubt that an outside hand played a role in the dense 1989 infestation. The group stated in a letter to then Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that their goals were twofold. They sought to cause the medfly infestation to <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> which, in turn, would render the ongoing Malathion spraying program financially infeasible.|$|E

50|$|During {{filming of}} the battle scene, which was shot in a meadow in the {{backyard}} of Kaufman's mother's house, a smoke bomb ignited a large patch <b>of</b> grass and <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> almost destroying the neighbors' house before the fire department arrived just in time. Mrs. Kaufman was not pleased.|$|R
500|$|Elle is {{introduced}} in the episode [...] "Fight or Flight" [...] {{as an agent of}} the Company, an organization whose primary purpose is to identify, monitor and study those individuals with special abilities. The daughter of Company head Bob Bishop, she possesses the power to generate and manipulate electricity. Elle is portrayed as mentally unstable, which is attributed to extensive [...] "testing" [...] condoned by her father to research her abilities when she was young. During the third season, Elle's powers <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> but with Sylar's help she regains control of them and begins a relationship with him. After finding out that Elle played a role in his transformation into a [...] "monster", Sylar killed her and stole her abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Alexandra, {{the exiled}} Dowager Governess of South Wood, {{is the main}} {{antagonist}} of Wildwood. She is charming and beautiful, and vastly more sophisticated and civilized than her anarchic coyote soldiers she only recently domesticated. In spite of her ruthlessness and murderous intentions, she is a somewhat tragic figure as a grieving mother whose madness is somewhat explained {{by the loss of}} her child. Ellis said, of the illustration of Alexandra holding a knife over Mac, [...] "as a mom of a little kid, just drawing that made my blood run cold." [...] The action of Wildwood is driven by her plot to take revenge on everyone and everything in The Wood, in which she intends to use Prue's brother Mac as a blood sacrifice in a spell to control The Wood's Ivy, which will then <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and consume every living thing in The Wood. The invasive threat of the magical ivy apocalypse that Alexandra plotted in the book is similar to the threat of an [...] "ivy desert" [...] monoculture from invasive English ivy (Hedera helix) in the real Forest Park.|$|E

50|$|Tumorigenesis in mammary glands can {{be induced}} biochemically by {{abnormal}} expression level of circulating hormones or local ECM components, {{or from a}} mechanical change in the tension of mammary stroma. Under {{either of the two}} circumstances, mammary epithelial cells would <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and eventually result in cancer. Almost all instances of breast cancer originate in the lobules or ducts of the mammary glands.|$|E

50|$|Sustenance farmers first clear small {{patches of}} forest. They remove trees with {{traditional}} {{tools such as}} axes or machetes {{during the dry season}} and burn the resulting brush. Farmers take care to protect trees bearing edible fruit, such as mangoes, plums, and pears, though fires sometimes <b>grow</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and prevent this. Farmers then plant seeds after the first rains: spices and vegetables closer to the house, plantains and tubers in larger plots farther into the bush. Villagers traditionally group their farms together as protection against animals and harvest their crops {{at the beginning of the}} dry season.|$|E
50|$|Between 17 and 18 July 1973, Maulan Shams-ud-din's Zhob {{residence}} was {{cordoned off}} by a heavy contingent of Frontier Corps, who arrested him.
