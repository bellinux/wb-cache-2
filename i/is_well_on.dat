Newsday critic Glenn Gamboa was more critical, writing that [...] "Pop concerts require strong personalities and, at 21, Ciara hasn't quite perfected hers yet".

Brian Sharp of Amiga Action gave this [...] "well-made and cleverly constructed package" [...] the Amiga Action Accolade award, calling it [...] "flawless" [...] and [...] "easily the best adventure game on the Amiga to date."

2500|$|Timed with Pocahontas' 400th birthday, Pocahontas had {{a limited}} release in North America on June 16, 1995, playing in only six {{selected}} theaters. The film grossed nearly $2.7 {{million during the}} weekend of June 16–18, standing at the eighth place in the box office ranking. The wide release followed on June 24, 1995, in 2,596 screens. Studio estimates initially ranked Pocahontas earning $30.5 million ranking first beating out the previous box office champion Batman Forever. The figure was later revised to $28.8 million with Pocahontas falling second behind Batman Forever. However, the final estimates placed Pocahontas narrowly ranking first grossing $29.5 million in its first weekend with Batman Forever falling into second place taking $29.2 million. By January 1996, the film grossed $141.5 million in the United States, being the fourth-highest-grossing film in North America behind Apollo 13, Toy Story, and Batman Forever respectively. Foreign wise, the film was expected to gross $225 million outside the United States, though foreign box office grosses eventually amounted to $204,500,000. Cumulatively, Pocahontas grossed $346,079,773 worldwide.
