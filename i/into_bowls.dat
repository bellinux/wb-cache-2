60|$|When the viands were removed, slaves brought round, as {{they had}} done before the meal began, basins of water and soft cotton towels; and each of those present washed his hands and face. Then a {{surprise}} even greater than those which had preceded it awaited Roger. Two attendants brought round waiters, upon {{one of which was}} placed a pile of a substance which looked to Roger {{as if it were the}} leaves of some vegetable, broken into small pieces, and also a gold box containing a brown dust. On the other tray were placed a variety of instruments, of whose use Roger was ignorant. They were small tubes, inserted <b>into</b> <b>bowls</b> of gold or silver; and in addition to these were some things that looked like yellowish-brown sticks, of two or three inches in length, with tubes into which they fitted.|$|E
60|$|Nor {{was this}} all. Heaton, under the {{influence}} of his habits, had studied the natures of the different trees he had met with on the other islands. The cocoa-nut, in particular, abounded in both groups, and finding it was a tree that much affected low land and salt water, he had taken care to set out various samples of his roots and fruits, on certain detached islets near this channel, where the soil and situation induced him to believe they would flourish. Sea sand he was of opinion was the most favourable for the growth of this tree, and he had chosen the sites of his plantations with a view to those advantages. On the Peak cocoa-nuts were to be found, but they were neither very fine, nor in very large quantities. So long as Mark had that island to himself, the present, supply-would more than equal the demand, but with the increase of the colony a greater number of the trees would become very desirable. Five or six years would be needed to produce the fruit-bearing tree, and the governor was pleased to find that the growth of one of those years had been already secured, in the case of those he had himself planted, in and on the crater, near three years had contributed to their growth, and neither the Guano nor Loam Island having been forgotten, many of them were now thirty feet high. As he approached the crater, on that occasion, he looked at those promising fruits of his early and provident care for the future with great satisfaction, for seldom was the labour of man better rewarded. Mark well knew the value of this tree, which was of use in a variety of ways, in addition to the delicious and healthful fruit it bears; delicious and healthful when eaten shortly after it is separated from the tree. The wood of the kernel could be polished, and converted <b>into</b> <b>bowls,</b> that were ornamental as well as useful. The husks made a capital cordage, and a very respectable sail-cloth, being a good substitute for hemp, though hemp, itself, was a plant that might be grown on the prairies to an almost illimitable extent. The leaves were excellent for thatching, as well as for making brooms, mats, hammocks, baskets and a variety of such articles, while the trunks could be converted into canoes, gutters, and timber generally. There was also one other expensive use of this tree, which the governor had learned from Heaton. While Bridget was still confined to the ship, after the birth of her daughter. Mark had brought her a dish of greens, which she pronounced the most delicious of any thing in its way she had ever tasted. It was composed of the young and delicate leaves of the new growth, or of the summit of the cocoa-nut tree, somewhat resembling the artichoke in their formation, though still more exquisite in taste. But the tree from which this treat was obtained died,--a penalty that must ever be paid to partake of that dish. As soon as Bridget learned this, she forbade the cutting of any more for her use, at least. All the boats got into port in good season, and the Reef once more became a scene of life and activity. The schooner was soon completed, and it only remained to put her into the water. This work was already commenced by Bigelow, and the governor directed everybody to lend a hand in effecting so desirable an object. Bigelow had all his materials ready, and so perseveringly did our colonists work, that the schooner was all ready to be put into the water on the evening of the second day. The launch was deferred only to have the benefit of daylight. That afternoon Mark, accompanied by his wife, had gone in the Bridget, his favourite boat, to look for the signal tree. He went some distance into the strait, ere he was near enough to get a sight of it even with the glass; when he did procure a view, there it was precisely as he had last seen it. Putting the helm of the boat up, the instant he was assured of his fact, the governor wore short round, making the best, of {{his way back to the}} crater, again. The distances, it will be remembered, were considerable, and it required time to make the passage. The sun was setting as Mark was running along the channel to the Reef, the young man pointing out to his charming wife the growth of the trees, the tints of the evening sky, the drove of hogs, the extent of his new meadows, and such other objects as would be likely to interest both, in the midst of such a scene. The boat rounded a point where a portion of the hogs had been sleeping, and as it came sweeping up, the animals rose in a body, snuffed the air, and began scampering off in the way conformable to their habits, Mark laughing and pointing with his fingers to draw Bridget's attention to their antics.|$|E

Milo is popular in Hawaii for woodworking (commonly turned <b>into</b> <b>bowls)</b> because of the range of colours expressed (tan, through yellow, to red). Traditionally it was planted in sacred groves and used for religious sculpture throughout eastern Polynesia. In Tahiti, Milo wood is used in the making of the to'ere (slotted wooden drum), used in traditional Tahitian tribal drumming. Makoi was used for the rongorongo tablets of Easter Island. Since the advent of aluminium-hulled boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson Island to harvest miro wood. Usually they venture to Henderson only once per year, but may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios, from which they derive much of their income. [...] The flower of the Portia tree played a part in Sri Lanka's independence struggle, when it was sold on Remembrance Day by the Suriya-Mal Movement instead of the poppy to aid indigenous ex-servicemen.|$|E
50|$|Blown glass {{has been}} an {{important}} industry in the state since the early 20th century, especially in Tonalá and Tlaquepaque. Initially, it was developed to make bottles for the tequila industry. Since then, it has developed into the making of various utilitarian and decorative objects, using a variety of techniques. Traditional colors for glass pieces include cobalt blue, amethyst and green. Blown glass remains true to traditional forms as well as division of labor, with workshops having apprentices and workers under a master craftsman. However more modern setups have come into play since the mid 20th century, when Jose Camarasa began to manufacture glass prisms for light fixtures and lamps in Tlaquepaque. He also makes ornamental and utilitarian pieces of lead crystal, with the red pieces particularly prized. Metals include iron, gold, tin, copper, and silver to make fine and everyday objects. Tin is worked from sheets to make decorative objects such as mirror frames and Christmas decorations. Wrought iron is principally worked in Guadalajara, and in Sayuda where they make knives, blades and machetes and is home to the Knife Museum. Silver is worked into jewelry (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, etc.) in Guadalajara, which is one of Mexico’s main centers for this work. Pewter is worked <b>into</b> <b>bowls,</b> plates, frames and more.|$|E
50|$|The past {{treatment}} finishes {{with one}} other guest quitting. Val decides {{to turn the}} heat up in their pods, {{and give them a}} T-shirt frozen into a cylinder shape. The first person to unfreeze the T-shirt and put it on would get two slices of pizza, the second would get one piece, and third place would get a piece of crust. For the test, the guests had to dunk their heads <b>into</b> <b>bowls</b> of colored pudding in a colored sequence they had to memorize. The sequence would keep getting longer up until thirty colors. If all the guests messed up any of the sequence, then the entire test would start over with a different sequence until someone correctly got all the way to thirty. The winner of the test did not win exemption from the treatment, but a penalty to give someone in the treatment as well as a penalty pass which allows a one-time skip of a penalty round. For the treatment, the guests had to balance a ball on a beam that they had to support on their neck and shoulders. They had to cross their pods in octagons on the floor, or on a balance beam. There were also chains hanging from the ceiling as obstacles. The guests had to race to hit the green button, and the last person to hit it, eventually both the last two, had to do a penalty round. The penalty round consisted of putting the beam on their shoulders, and squatting against the wall for a certain time, increasing with each penalty. Eventually, the rounds were only squats and nothing else. The time of their squats was a buildup of the time from their last penalty. The episode ends before anyone quit.|$|E
