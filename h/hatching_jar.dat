500|$|A spermiating male {{indicates}} successful {{production of}} mature spermatozoa {{which results in}} the release of large volumes of milt {{over the course of}} three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with the syringe to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs are adhesive and demersal, therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow-through <b>hatching</b> <b>jar,</b> the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping. [...] Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout {{his tenure}} at the Fish Commission, McDonald invented and {{designed}} a number of innovative fish hatching apparatuses and appliances. McDonald's most prominent apparatus was a fish ladder that enabled salmon and other migrating fish species to ascend the rapids of watercourses, thus increasing {{the extent of their}} spawning grounds. In 1871, McDonald devised [...] "automatic hatching jars" [...] which revolutionized the field of fish farming and were widely utilized by the United States Fish Commission, several state commissions, and commissions in Europe and Japan. The <b>hatching</b> <b>jar</b> apparatus enabled the [...] "vast extension" [...] of the propagation of shad accomplished in the 1880s and 1890s and rendered the work of the Fish Commission practicable commercially. In 1880, he designed a cod box that produced the tidal motion necessary for the hatching of floating eggs. McDonald further perfected his design of the cod box in 1888. In the winter of 1883, McDonald developed a tidal apparatus for the hatching of floating halibut eggs and those of other marine species. The vast production and distribution of fish eggs by the Fish Commission was possible through the utilization of this tidal apparatus. Through the usage of this apparatus, the process of hatching eggs was made cheaper and increased the fish farming output capacity of the commission.|$|E

A simoultanous hatching {{to a final}} hatching of 99 %, and positive buoyant larvae in the dark <b>hatching</b> <b>jars</b> were experienced. In the illuminated group the hatching was postponed, hatching curve progressed: more slowly to a final hatching of 72 and 80 % in two experiments.

40|$|The {{causes of}} {{mortality}} of fry of cultivable fishes in a fish seed farm were investigated. The mortality {{was due to}} fungal infection and the pathogen was Saprolegnia sp. The sources of infection were unhygienic breeding hapas, spawnery hapas in the cemented ponds, <b>hatching</b> <b>jars</b> and excess feeding. Application of one kg slaked lime followed by 75 g of CuSo sub(4) (l- 0. 5 p. p. m.) and 150 g of KMno sub(4) (2 - 1 p. p. m.) per each nursery (158 m³ water) controlled the pathogen...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} view of a fish hatchery, California, ca. 1910. Vats (or tanks?), some covered, are lined up in rows across the room. The vat in the foreground has some type of filtering device attached to it. Lined along the walls are pipes where more filter devices (or water pumping devices?) can be seen pouring water into the vats. Dozens of glass containers, filled with fish specimens, sit on a table {{near the center of}} the room. Other hatchery devices are seen scattered throughout the room. Nets hang from the roof. In the center of the room hangs a sign that reads: "California Northwestern fish hatchery, [ [...] . ]y Co. "; "The hatchery still houses the initial stages of the process, where fertilized eggs are placed in plastic hatching trays and incubated with a continuous flow of fresh water to provide adequate oxygen. In the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, tall glass <b>hatching</b> <b>jars</b> were used for this process. Today, hatched fish are kept in rearing troughs. When the fish reach 3 to 4 inches they are transferred to one of the ponds. In the spring fish are distributed to the State's waterways. When this was done by train and wagon, fish were transported in "fish cans" with perforated inserts for ice that provided oxygen to the fish as it melted. Today, they are distributed by trucks in large installed tanks. " [...] unknown author...|$|R

The duration {{of this study was}} 3 months (01 / 04 / 10 to 30 / 06 / 10). Reliance Aqua Farm is occupied 20 acre area of which 1. 5 acre is hatchery complex and 18. 5 acre pond area. They use 40 <b>hatching</b> <b>jar,</b> 120 hatching tray, 12 cistern and 300 hapa in the hatchery complex for seed production. The size of the breeding hapa is 50 ft× 25 ft× 3 ft and each hapa contain 50 male and 150 female at 1 : 3 (male:female) ratio. A single female can produce 1000 - 1500 eggs/cycle. They use hormone in feed for sex reversal (production of all male tilapia) from the first feeding stage. 17 α –methyl testosterone hormone used at 60 mg/kg feed which is dissolved with 95 % ethanol solution. 150 mg ethanol is used for per kg feed preparation. Mechanical method is used for hormone mixing in this farm, and then the feed are dried under room temperature. Commercial mega feed is used. After sex-reversal, fingerlings are generally nursed to an advanced size before they are stocked into grow-out facilities. This procedure increases survival in the grow-out stage and utilizes growing space more efficiently. Sex-reversed fingerlings are stocked at approximately 20 - 25 fish/m 2 in small ponds and cultured for 45 - 50 days to an average size of 15 - 20 g. Then Marketing is done at three size grades (small/. 60 TK, medium/. 80 TK, large/ 1 TK) ...|$|E
50|$|Mesoleptus hibernica is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} wasp that was discovered by Dr. Chris Williams, in County Mayo, when {{he was waiting for}} marsh flies to <b>hatch</b> in jam <b>jars</b> on his desk. Instead of flies, two wasp species emerged. Scientists from Italy, Finland and the United Kingdom identified the species. Mesoleptus hibernica females lay their eggs in fly larvae and when the eggs hatch, the wasps eat the larvae. It was the first parasitic wasp species that was discovered in Ireland that was new to science. It was named after the ancient Latin name of the country, Hibernia.|$|R
