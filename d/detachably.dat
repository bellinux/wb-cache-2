40|$|Summary: A {{new device}} for the {{endovascular}} treatment of aneurysms is described. It {{consists of a}} guidewire-directed porous liner or bag, <b>detachably</b> mounted on a microcath-eter and designed to be inserted into an aneurysm and {{to be filled with}} detachable coils or other embolic agents. Sev-eral prototypes have been made. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments have demonstrated its behavior in rel-atively wide-necked aneurysms. Since the introduction of controlled detachment coils, such as the Guglielmi detachable coil (GDC, Target Therapeutics, Fremont, CA) (1, 2), increas-ing numbers of patients with ruptured and unrup-tured intracranial aneurysms are being treated (3 â€“ 5). Initial results have been so encouraging that a prospective multicenter trial randomizing patients with surgically accessible aneurysms is now under way (the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial). There are, however, recognized complica-tions in the use of detachable coils, including thromboembolism, inadvertent occlusion of the an-eurysm-bearing artery, and early and delayed rup-ture of coil-treated aneurysms (5, 6). Some of these problems are due to the tendency of coils to pro-lapse out of wide-necked aneurysms and the ab-sence of evidence, in humans, of endothelialization across the necks of coil-treated aneurysms (7). Ab-sence of endothelialization has also been reported in a coil-treated rabbit aneurysm model (8). Indeed, in this model, large open spaces without signs of thrombosis were found between the loops of the coil baskets in several aneurysms regardless of the observation period. In aneurysm models in pigs (7), dogs (9), and primates (10), however, endothe-lialization across the necks of coil-treated aneu-rysms has been observed. In order to address these shortcomings, one of us (MAJ) conceived the ide...|$|E
