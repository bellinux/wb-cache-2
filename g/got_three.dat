25|$|Bringing {{sorely needed}} reinforcements, Türr was warmly welcomed in Baden, made {{immediately}} upon arrival a colonel in its revolutionary army, and <b>got</b> <b>three</b> battalions of German troops {{under his command}} {{in addition to the}} Hungarians who came with him. He did not hold this position long, however, as the Baden revolution soon succumbed to an overwhelming Prussian attack. Together with the overthrown Baden Government, he and his troops had to seek refuge in Switzerland. The victors, in control of occupied Baden, were summarily executing the officers of the revolutionary army who fell into their hands.|$|E

25|$|Durham Dynamos bowled first, {{and their}} seam bowlers Neil Killeen and Paul Collingwood <b>got</b> <b>three</b> wickets each against the Somerset Sabres at the Riverside Ground. Seven Somerset batsmen were caught, as Somerset lost their first nine wickets for 94, before Wesley Durston and Simon Francis added a 46-run last-wicket partnership.

Chasing 114 to win, Salman Butt and Shoaib Malik flayed the Australian opening bowlers, as Bracken ended with 4-0-26-0 and Mick Lewis with 3-1-19-0. They were both {{dismissed}} by White, who <b>got</b> <b>three</b> wickets, yet conceded 36 in 5.5 overs. Pakistan A reached their target in 19.5 overs, taking a convincing victory.|$|E

25|$|However, Scott Styris and Astle {{fought back}} well. Styris made 63, relying on nurdling the singles into the leg side, as he only hit ten runs in boundaries. However, {{he held the}} innings {{together}} twice. The first time was in his 62-run partnership with Astle. Then, when both Oram and McCullum deserted him within six overs and the scoreboard showed 149 for 7, he remained calm. His partnership with Vettori carried New Zealand past 200, Vettori joining Styris in nurdling the ball – his 47 runs included only 12 in boundaries. Andy Blignaut then <b>got</b> <b>three</b> wickets with five balls as New Zealand were bowled out for 238.|$|E

Northamptonshire {{declared}} eight overs into the last day, with the score 400 for 6 to unleash their spinners on Lancashire's batting line-up - and they did so very successfully. Brown got his second five-for of the match, ending with match figures of ten for 135, and Monty Panesar also <b>got</b> <b>three</b> wickets as Lancashire collapsed in a heap for 103 - with only Chilton passing 20, in a reversal of fortunes from the first innings.|$|E
