All six runs of the game were scored on the long ball, with David Ortiz going deep twice.|$|E

Ruddock dropped Morrison to his <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, but Morrison recovered {{to force a}} standing count in round two and compete on even terms for five rounds. In the sixth round, Ruddock hurt Morrison with a quick combination, but just as it seemed Morrison was in trouble, he countered with a tremendous hook that put Ruddock on the canvas. Ruddock regained his feet, but Morrison drove him to the ropes and showered him with an extended flurry of blows. Just as the bell was about to sound, the referee stepped in and declared Morrison the winner by TKO.|$|E

500|$|However, {{dolphins}} {{in these}} areas can also coexist with humans. For example, {{in the town of}} Laguna in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans. [...] These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them. [...] The fishermen typically stand up to their <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shallow waters or sit in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen. [...] One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here, and {{a detailed description of the}} signal's characteristics is available here). [...] In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins. [...] The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847. Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania, Africa.|$|E

Gene Guillot of The Times-Picayune also reviewed the event; describing it as [...] "spectacular" [...] and that it [...] "delivered three memorable moments, one for each X". Regarding the setup, Guillot wrote that [...] "the set was magnificent, the pyro and lighting impeccable and the pageantry unparalleled". Guillot described the first moment which started the show as [...] "classic" [...] when [...] "the three biggest stars {{in the history of the}} business were in the same ring"; Hulk Hogan [...] "the biggest name", Stone Cold Steve Austin [...] "the biggest star" [...] and the Rock, [...] "the most successful". Next, Guillot wrote that [...] "the second indelible moment nearly stopped the show", describing the end of the Undertaker's Streak as [...] "the biggest surprise ending in WrestleMania history—and maybe even wrestling history". Finally, the third moment which closed the show was [...] "Bryan holding and hoisting in unison the two championships that represent the WWE World Heavyweight Championship while on his <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring", which Guillot predicted [...] "will go down among the greatest moments in WrestleMania history".|$|E

2500|$|Seuss {{reportedly}} had {{misgivings about}} The Seven Lady Godivas before its publication; the {{drawing on the}} endpaper contains a small bucket of sap labeled [...] "Bennett Cerf," [...] the name of Seuss's publisher at Random House. Seuss, by calling Cerf a sap, was apparently implying that Cerf was being too nice in allowing the book to be published. The initial 1939 publishing had a print run of 10,000 copies, but only around 2,500 sold. (One authority states that only 50 were sold.) Seuss himself called it his [...] "greatest failure" [...] and [...] "a book that nobody bought". To another interviewer he said [...] "It was all full of naked women, and I can't draw convincing naked women. I put their <b>knees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong places." [...] It became {{one of only two}} Dr Seuss books, along with The Cat in the Hat Songbook, to be allowed to go out of print.
