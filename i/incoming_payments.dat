50|$|Payment {{recovery}} firms {{specialize in}} getting vendors to return money inadvertently paid to them. In corporate America, this frequently occurs when accounts payable staff accidentally pay a duplicate invoice. Another {{situation in which}} this might occur is when, for instance, a company places a deposit on a corporate cell phone account {{in order to prevent}} service interruption {{in the event of a}} late payment. If the company then switches cell phone providers, it may have difficulty collecting its deposit from the original provider. Accounts receivable staff who handle <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> seldom have authority to cut checks themselves, and in any case tend to place a lower priority on returning overpayments than in collecting back payments. Rather than spend time on hold working with vendors, many companies decide to turn the matter over to the experts.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} a new framework for Privacy-Preserving Investment systems in a distributed model. In this model, independent investors can transfer funds to independent projects, {{in the same}} way as it works on crowdfunding platforms. The framework protects the investors' single payments from being detected (by any other party), only the sums of each investor's payments are revealed. Likewise, the projects' single <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> are concealed and only the final sums of the <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> for every project are revealed. In this way, no other party than the investor (not even the system administration) can detect how much she paid to any single project. Though it is still possible to confidentially exchange any part of an investment between any pair of investors, such that market liquidity is unaffected by the system. On top, our framework allows a privacy-preserving return of a multiple of all the held investments (e. g. interest payments or dividends) to the indivdual investors while still revealing nothing else than the sum of all returns for every investor. We provide reasonable security guarantees for this framework that are based on common notions from the Secure Multi-Party Computation literature. As instantiation for this framework we present Investcoin. It is a proper combination of three cryptographic protocols, namely a Private Stream Aggregation scheme, a Commitment scheme and a Range test and it is usable in connection with any existing currency. The security of these protocols is based on the DDH assumption. By a composition theorem from the SMPC literature, the security of the resulting Investcoin protocol is also based on the DDH assumption. Furthermore, we provide a simple decentralised key generation protocol for Investcoin supporting dynamic join/leave and fault-tolarance of investors and moreover achieves some security guarantees against malicious investors...|$|E

Participants of payment systems need access to intraday liquidity to fulfill their payment obligations. They do that either using their own funds, which are costly, or recycling incoming payment.

40|$|When {{settling}} {{their own}} liabilities {{and those of}} their clients, settlement banks rely on <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> to fund {{a part of their}} outgoing payments. We investigate their behaviour in CHAPS, the United Kingdom’s large-value payment system. Our estimates suggest that in normal times, banks increase their payment outflows when their liquidity is above target and immediately following the receipt of payments. We use these estimates to determine the robustness of this payment system to two hypothetical behavioural changes. In the first, a single bank stops sending payments, perhaps because of an operational problem. In the second, it pays out exactly what it previously received, relying exclusively on the liquidity provided by other system members. Using the observed uncertainty around our estimated behavioural equations, we derive probabilistic statements about the time at which the bank’s counterparties would run out of liquidity if they followed their estimated normal-time behaviour.

40|$|Banks {{rely heavily}} on <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> from other banks to fund their own payments. The {{terrorist}} attacks of September 11, 2001, destroyed facilities in Lower Manhattan, leaving some banks unable to send payments through the Federal Reserve's Fedwire payments system. As a result, many banks received fewer payments than expected, causing unexpected shortfalls in banks' liquidity. These disruptions also made it harder for banks to redistribute balances across the banking system in a timely manner. In this article, the authors measure the payments responses of banks to the receipt of payments from other banks, both under normal circumstances and during the days following the attacks. Their analysis suggests that the significant injections of liquidity by the Federal Reserve, first through the discount window and later through open market operations, were important in allowing banks to reestablish their normal patterns of payments coordination.

This thesis reports the results of an experiment that tested the effect of so-called «nudging» on young adults’ decision-making process concerning bill payments. Based on theories of judgment and decision-making, text messages were sent out to 2500 randomized treatment and control subjects aged 18 - 30, pulled from One Call’s (Network Norway AS) customer base. <b>Incoming</b> <b>payments</b> were then recorded to determine whether the messages had influenced customers’ decision to pay their bill within due.

The aim of this study has been to test existing theories and models in this field of research in a new context, thereby contributing to further development and hopefully active use of nudging as a positive alternative to regulations. This could benefit each individual being nudged, and ultimately bring out positive larger scale societal changes.

For example, a company that pays its suppliers in 30 days but takes 60 days to collect its receivables has a working capital cycle of 30 days. This 30-day cycle usually needs to be funded through a bank operating line, and the interest on this financing is a carrying cost that reduces the company's profitability. Growing businesses require cash, {{and being able to}} free up cash by shortening the working capital cycle is the most inexpensive way to grow. Sophisticated buyers review closely a target's working capital cycle because it provides them with an idea of the management's effectiveness at managing their balance sheet and generating free cash flows.|$|R

40|$|Real-time gross {{settlement}} (RTGS) {{systems such as}} CHAPS Sterling require large amounts of liquidity to support payment activity. To meet their liquidity needs, RTGS participants borrow from the central bank or rely on <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> from other participants. Both options can prove costly [...] the latter in particular if participants delay outgoing payments until incoming ones arrive. This article presents an empirical analysis of the timing and funding of payments in CHAPS. The authors seek to identify the factors driving the intraday profile of payment activity {{and the extent to}} which incoming funds are used as a funding source, a process known as liquidity recycling. They show that the level of liquidity recycling in CHAPS is high and stable throughout the day, and attribute this result to several features of the system. First, the settlement of time-critical payments provides liquidity to the system early in the settlement day; this liquidity can be recycled for the funding of less urgent payments. Second, CHAPS throughput guidelines provide a centralised coordination mechanism, in effect limiting any tendency toward payment delay. Third, the relatively small direct membership of CHAPS facilitates coordination between members, for example, through the use of bilateral net sender limits. Coordination encourages banks to maintain a relatively constant flux of payments throughout the day. The authors also argue that the high level of recycling helps to reduce liquidity risk, and that the relatively smooth intraday distribution of payments serves to mitigate operational risk associated with highly concentrated payment activity. They note, however, that the benefits of liquidity recycling are not evenly distributed between members of CHAPS. Payment systems; Bank liquidity; Risk; Electronic funds transfers...|$|E
40|$|The current {{paper has}} the aim to provide {{guidelines}} for designing efficient product and price strategies, through proposed business cases {{which could be}} used especially for banking products addressed to SMEs. While identifying the optimal product and price strategy and designing the product catalogue structure, the marketing specialist should definitely consider existing portfolio behaviour and estimate the growing potential (if possible, overall portfolio, with focus on accurately defining the additional impact of the newly proposed product/ products). A business case contains estimations for results to be generated by products to be launched or optimized. This paper presents complex schemes for business case scenarios for migration of existing portfolio to the new products, but also considers new clients acquisition based on important features of the products. The pricing strategy is not a simple task to manage. Especially when speaking about transactional packages (for which the price is lower than separate services included), some segments or clusters may generate loss to the bank if they already used the services at a higher price than the one of the package. Therefore, the decision of setting up specific prices needs to be based on an accurate and complex analysis, as presented in current paper. The assumptions used in a business case need to be relevant for the entire process of designing and launching a product, therefore they can always be adjusted for better calculation of the impact. No matter if the assumptions and prices remain as in the initial proposal or not, the steps to be followed are the same. Segmentation also {{plays an important role in}} designing the product strategy, since the target for a product or product catalogue can be represented by a segment, a sub segment or a cluster of many segments. Not always the initial segmentation represents the clustering for the product strategy. Sometimes, behaviour of existing clients represents the starting point for clustering of a market target for products. In case of SMEs acquiring banking products, another relevant aspect to consider is the turnover through the bank, incoming and outgoing. It consists in the business routed to the bank as <b>incoming</b> <b>payments</b> and out the bank, through transactions made. The turnover is directly influenced by the value proposition of the new packages and may radically influence the final net impact of the business case, being a revenue generator, as you may see explained in the following pages...|$|E

In agriculture bankruptcy has become well-nigh universal. At {{the same time}} our debtors abroad, both public and private, are forced to default. The loss of the foreign markets, moreover, has destroyed the fundamental balance between agriculture and industry in our national economic life. There are, however, several correctives at work mending the fabric of foreign trade.

40|$|Intraday {{liquidity}} risk {{is a subject}} that applies to all banks, and arises whenever there is a timing mismatch between <b>incoming</b> and outgoing <b>payments</b> within a business day. In case such a mismatch occurs, the bank is exposed to the risk that it is unable to meet its payment obligations at the time expected. A liquidity buffer could help to mitigate this risk. This thesis presents a framework for intraday {{liquidity risk}} management within ABN AMRO Bank, while taking different priorities of transactions into account. We examine the use of extreme value theory (EVT) and propose two metrics to capture the risk: the univariate and multivariate risk metric. The univariate risk metric represents {{the size of the}} liquidity buffer for each priority group separately and provides granular view. Making use of a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm in combination with univariate EVT, we are able to estimate the size of the liquidity buffer for a specified time interval within a business day. We forecast the buffer size 30 days out-of-sample and test the violations against the conditional coverage (CC) hypothesis. Satisfactory results are obtained for the groups with high and moderate priority when the highest confidence levels are considered: α = 0. 1 and 0. 05. For the group with low priority, the risk metric performs well for the lowest confidence levels: α = 0. 025 and 0. 01. The multivariate risk metrics aggregates the size of the liquidity buffer, while taking the diversification of the priority groups into account. We define a failure set and investigate the use of multivariate EVT. Applied Mathematic...|$|R

Some mobile and desktop apps have tired to address individual issues of the restaurant dining process, but there is no single platform that attempts to fix the experience as a whole. We begin by outlining the idea behind OmniSplit, a small to medium business solution that seeks to address many of these issues simultaneously. OmniSplit combines online food payments, individual item ratings, and splitting the check all in one system. We implemented a web application for restaurant staff members and an iOS app for restaurant customers.

30|$|Longinidis and Georgiadis (2011) {{evaluate}} the financial {{performance of a}} company-wide multi-product, multi-period supply chain network with four echelons by maximizing the economic value added (EVA). With respect to a given dividend payout ratio during the time periods, they determine the associated design of the supply chain network including the numbers, locations and capacities of warehouses and distribution centers {{to be set up}} as well as transportation links to be established. The total invested capital is defined as the sum of shareholders’ equity as well as short- and long-term liabilities. To avoid misinterpretations with respect to risk consideration within the WACC rate that is commonly used for calculating EVA, Hahn and Kuhn (2012 a) assume an externally predefined hurdle rate to calculate the capital charge. Within their model, applicable to a make-to-stock supply chain in the consumer goods industry with single-stage production, they use an objective based on EVA, which allows for integrated performance and risk optimization. As a consequence, material flows and financial flows are optimized simultaneously within the time periods of the mid-term planning horizon. The cash position resulting from operations, open items management, financial management (short-term investments and short-term borrowing at fixed interest rates) and exogenous cash flows (including dividend payouts) is balanced within each period. With regard to long-term planning, Hahn and Kuhn (2012 b) refer to the market value added (MVA), which represents the multi-annual extension of the EVA concept, as it can be calculated as the sum of WACC-discounted EVA values up to the planning horizon. However, the aforementioned measures consider the profit that remains after accounting for the return expectations of the investors. Koberstein et al. (2013) propose an objective function of a weighted sum of the expected NPV of the profits and an additional conditional value at risk measure for their integrated strategic planning of global production networks. A company-specific interest rate (such as WACC) is used to compute the discounted cash flows. Their two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model, which takes uncertain exchange rates and product demands into account, includes strategic investment decisions as well as decisions on production and transportation quantities. The usage of financial instruments focuses on forward contacts and options. Sahling and Kayser (2016) use the combined maximization of the expected NPV and the conditional value of risk for strategic supply planning with vendor selection. The configuration of the three-layer supply network includes decisions on the selection of production facilities, the assignment of products to facilities, the selection of vendors for delivery of components and the assignment of retailers to production facilities. The considered cash flows include <b>incoming</b> and outgoing <b>payments,</b> e.g., for establishing, closing and running production facilities, installing tools at facilities, fulfilling demand at retailers, acquiring and transporting components as well as processing and transporting end products, which are discounted by a period-specific internal interest rate that is derived from WACC.|$|R
