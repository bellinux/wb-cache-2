40|$|Objective: Acute {{renal failure}} {{is common in}} septic patients. <b>Fenoldopam,</b> a dopamine- 1 {{receptor}} agonist, increases renal blood flow and may, therefore, {{reduce the risk of}} acute renal failure in such patients. Accordingly, we sought to determine the safety and efficacy of <b>fenoldopam</b> for the prevention of acute renal failure in septic patients. Design: Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Three multidisciplinary intensive care units at a university hospital. Patients: Three hundred septic patients with baseline serum creatinine concentrations 150 mol/L, during study drug infusion. Measurements and main results: The incidence of acute renal failure was significantly lower in the <b>fenoldopam</b> group compared with the control group (29 vs. 51 patients; p. 006). The odds ratio of developing acute renal failure for patients treated with <b>fenoldopam</b> was estimated to be 0. 47 (p. 005). The difference in the incidence of severe acute renal failure (creatinine > 300 mol/L), however, failed to achieve statistical significance (10 vs. 21; p. 056). The length of intensive care unit stay in surviving patients was significantly lower in the <b>fenoldopam</b> group compared with the control group (10. 64 9. 3 vs. 13. 4 14. 0; p <. 001).

Furthermore, the authors tested the hypothesis that the addition of <b>fenoldopam</b> (0. 1 microg x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)) to a combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine (5 microg x kg(- 1) x min(- 1)) may improve gastric mucosal perfusion in septic shock.

Similar pressor responses induced by the selective alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine were also reduced by <b>fenoldopam</b> (to 38. 4 +/- 6. 4 %), but responses to locally administered angiotensin II were not modified. Pretreatment with SCH 23390 (50 micrograms kg- 1) antagonized the effect of <b>fenoldopam</b> on baseline perfusion pressure, but had no influence on the effect of <b>fenoldopam</b> on responses to electrical stimulation or to noradrenaline. Pretreatment with the selective alpha 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (100 micrograms kg- 1) had no effect on the reduction in baseline perfusion pressure induced by <b>fenoldopam</b> nor on its inhibitory effect on the response to noradrenaline, but it antagonized the stimulatory effect of <b>fenoldopam</b> on the response to electrical stimulation.

To determine if catecholamines differentially regulate {{the expression of}} PLC isoforms, we infused <b>fenoldopam,</b> a D 1 agonist, or pramipexole, a D 1 /D 2 agonist, intravenously or infused <b>fenoldopam</b> or NE into the renal artery of anesthetized rats. After 3 - 4 h of infusion, when the expected natriuresis (<b>fenoldopam</b> or pramipexole) or antinatriuresis (NE) occurred, the kidneys were removed for analysis of PLC isoform protein expression activity. Western blot analysis revealed that in renal cortical membranes, <b>fenoldopam</b> and pramipexole increased expression of PLC beta 1 and decreased expression of PLC gamma 1; PLC delta was unchanged. In the cytosol, pramipexole and <b>fenoldopam</b> increased expression of both PLC beta 1 and PLC gamma 1. No effects were noted in the medulla. A preferential D 1 antagonist, SKF 83742, which by itself had no effect, blocked the effects of pramipexole, thus confirming {{the involvement of the}} D 1 receptor. In contrast, NE also increased PLC beta 1 but did not affect PLC gamma 1 protein expression in membranes. The changes in PLC isoform expression were accompanied by similar changes in PLC isoform activity. These studies demonstrate for the first time differential regulation of PLC isoforms by catecholamines...|$|E
40|$|IN THE PRESENT STUDY THE HAEMODYNAMIC AND PHARMACODYNAMIC EFFECTS, AS WELL AS THE PHARMACOKYNETICS OF <b>FENOLDOPAM,</b> A SELECTIVE AGONIST OF THE POSTSYNAPTIC DOPAMINERGIC RECEPTORS WERE STUDIED, IN PATIENTS WITH LIVER CIRRHOSIS. A PILOT STUDY OF INTRAVENOUSLY ADMINISTERED <b>FENOLDOPAM</b> WAS INITIALLY CARRIED OUT IN 5 PATIENTS, IN INCREASING DOSES OD 0, 05 TO 1, 6 ΜG /KG/MIN. ON THE BASIS OF THE RESULTS, THE DOSE TO BE USED IN THE HAEMODYNAMIC STUDY (0, 05, 0, 5, 1 AND 1, 6 ΜG/KG. MIN) WAS DEFINED, EACH INFUSION LASTING FOR 30 MINUTES. IN THIS STUDY THE HAEMODYNAMIC EFFECT OF FENOLDPAM WAS ASSESSED, ON THE SYSTEMATIC ANDSPLANCHIC HAEMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS, IN 12 PATIENTS WITH CIRRHOSIS AND PORTALHYPERTENTION (IN 6 WITH COMPENSATED AND 6 WITH DECOMPENSATED LIVER DISEASE). FINALLY, A PHARMACOKINETIC ASSEAAMENT OF <b>FENOLDOPAM</b> WAS CARRIED OUT, IN ANOTHER 12 PATIENTS WITH COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS. IN THESE PATIENTS <b>FENOLDOPAM</b> WAS GIVEN EITHER PER OS (50 MG) OR INTERAVENOUSLY (0, 5 ΜG/KG/MIN FOR 2 HOURS) IN A RADOM ORDER IN TWO DIFFERENT DAYS AT LEAST ONE WEEK APART. INTRAVENOUS <b>FENOLDOPAM</b> ADMINISTRATION RESULTED IN DOSE DEPENDENT REDUCTION IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND REDUCTION OF THE SYSTEMIC VASCULAR RESISTANCE WITH CONCOMITANT INCREASE IN CARDIAC OUTPUT. THE PORTIAL PRESSURE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DUETO INCREASE IN PORTIAL BLOD FLOW, AS A RESULT OF SPLANCHNIC ATRERIAL VASODILATION.

40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{dopamine}} D 1 -receptor agonist <b>fenoldopam</b> were {{compared with those of}} the D 2 -receptor agonist R(−) -propylnorapomorphine and vehicle on mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP, the driving force of venous return), arterial resistance (Ra), venous resistance (Rv), heart rate (HR) and cardiac output (CO) in groups of thiobutabarbitone-anaesthetized rats pre-treated with i. v. injection of mecamylamine (3. 7 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1) and continuously infused with noradrenaline (6. 8 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1). The vehicle did not alter any haemodynamic variables. All doses of <b>fenoldopam</b> (0. 5, 2 and 16 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1) reduced MAP, Ra and Rv, and increased CO. At the highest dose, <b>fenoldopam</b> also increased HR and reduced MCFP. All doses of R(−) -propylnorapomorphine (0. 5, 2 and 16 [*]μg[*]kg− 1 [*]min− 1) increased MAP but did not significantly alter CO, Rv and MCFP. Both Ra and HR were increased by the highest dose of R(−) -propylnorapomorphine. Our results indicate that <b>fenoldopam</b> reduces MAP and MCFP, and markedly increases CO through reductions of arterial and venous resistances. The effects of <b>fenoldopam</b> in dilating arterial resistance and capacitance vessels were similar. In contrast, R(−) -propylnorapomorphine elevates MAP through an increase in arterial resistance but has minimal effects on CO, MCFP and venous resistance. Both drugs have a small direct, positive chronotropic action at the highest dose...|$|E

Abstract OBJECTIVE: Acute renal failure {{is common in}} septic patients. <b>Fenoldopam,</b> a dopamine- 1 receptor agonist, increases renal blood flow and may, therefore, {{reduce the risk of}} acute renal failure in such patients. Accordingly, we sought to determine the safety and efficacy of <b>fenoldopam</b> for the prevention of acute renal failure in septic patients. DESIGN: Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Three multidisciplinary intensive care units at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Three hundred septic patients with baseline serum creatinine concentrations 150 micromol/L, during study drug infusion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The incidence of acute renal failure was significantly lower in the <b>fenoldopam</b> group compared with the control group (29 vs. 51 patients; p =. 006). The odds ratio of developing acute renal failure for patients treated with <b>fenoldopam</b> was estimated to be 0. 47 (p =. 005). The difference in the incidence of severe acute renal failure (creatinine > 300 mumol/L), however, failed to achieve statistical significance (10 vs. 21; p =. 056). The length of intensive care unit stay in surviving patients was significantly lower in the <b>fenoldopam</b> group compared with the control group (10. 64 +/- 9. 3 vs. 13. 4 +/- 14. 0; p <. 001). There were no complications of <b>fenoldopam</b> infusion. A direct effect of treatment on the probability of death, beyond its effect on acute renal failure, was not significant (odds ratio = 0. 68, p =. 1). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with placebo, low-dose <b>fenoldopam</b> resulted in a smaller increase in serum creatinine in septic patients. The clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. A large multiple-center trial is now needed to confirm these findings. Comment in Crit Care Med. 2005 Nov; 33 (11) : 2681 - 3...|$|E
