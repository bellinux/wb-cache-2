40|$|Abstract: Effects of {{pressure}} of toluene, reaction temperature {{and nature of}} catalysts on coking over catalysts in toluene disproportionation are studied by using the method of thermogravimetry. Experiment results show that during the toluene disproportionation, the coking amount over catalysts increases with partial pressure of toluene and reaction temperature and the initial <b>coking</b> <b>temperature</b> decreases with partial pressure of toluene. Coking results mainly from the relatively stronger acid sites {{on the surface of}} the catalyst. Both HZSM- 5 and HM catalysts have efficiency for toluene disproportionation, but HZM- 5 catalyst has higher catalytic activity and stability...|$|R

The main objective of this work is to determine the admissible stress for the coke oven heating walls in order to prevent cracks formation. Thus a numerical tool of the coke oven battery based on the Finite Element Method was developed. It is a two-step model using homogenization and submodelling techniques in order to decrease the computational cost. Coke oven masonries are large structures composed of thousands of bricks and mortar joints. In the model, bricks and mortar are replaced by a Homogeneous Equivalent Material (HEM) whose behaviour depends on the joints state. The HEM properties are determined thanks to brick-mortar interface behaviour, experimentally characterised at high temperature. In order to control joint opening, a criterion changing the HEM is used. The use of the HEM gives the global stresses instead of local stresses, that's why, a submodelling step has been developed to obtain local stresses used in the criterion and thus to have accurate information about joint opening...|$|R

Second, sample 2 and 3 showed a major weight loss peak at 284 and 293  °C, respectively, corresponding to the volatilization of small molecular compounds and the decomposition or dehydration condensation of oxygen-containing groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, this is distinctly different from the weight loss behavior of raw coal sample, it indicates that by treatment with oxidative HNO 3, a large number of active oxygen-containing functional groups appeared in the coal structure. Noted that within this range sample 3 has lower temperatures for water loss peak and decomposition peak of oxygen-containing groups than that of sample 2, demonstrating that the content of oxygen-containing groups in sample 3 is higher than that in sample 2, because the existent of oxygen-containing groups can not only facilitate the decomposition and dehydration condensation of coal but also induce the pyrolysis of organic matter and decrease the pyrolysis temperature (Fletcher et al. 2007; Ruiz et al. 2006). Moreover, the oxygen-containing groups in sample 2 and 3 were basically removed by the first pyrolysis, resulting in higher dehydrogenation condensation <b>coking</b> <b>temperature</b> than that of raw coal sample during the second pyrolysis; therefore, both sample 2 and 3 exhibited weight loss peaks between 500 and 600  °C. In addition, the weight loss ratio of sample 2 within the 0 – 1000  °C temperature range is higher than that of sample 3, which is mainly caused by initial loss of water.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Hypersonic vehicles operate at high flight Mach numbers exposing the airframe and engine structures to high heat loads which are quite severe in the combustor part of the high-speed air breathing engine. In order to withstand high heat loads experienced in the combustor region of the engine during hypersonic flight, actively cooled panels are employed. Herein, a fuel before being injected into the combustor serves as a coolant and is made to flow through the combustor heat exchanger panels such that the material and coolant temperatures are maintained below their critical limits. A few of the candidate materials considered for the active panels of the engine are Nb alloy Cb 752, Ni alloy Inconel X- 750, and CSiC. To enhance the heat withstanding capacity of these materials, low thermal conductivity thermal barrier coatings (TBC) are employed. Currently Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) material and ceramic materials are being used as popular TBC materials because of their very low thermal conductivity and high phase stability. In this analytical study, thermal properties of air-plasma-sprayed zirconia based lanthanum zirconate (La 2 Zr 2 O 7) – LZ- coatings were employed in the investigations. Lanthanum-cerium oxide (La 2 Ce 2 O 7) –LC- is considered as a new candidate material for TBCs because of its low thermal conductivity and high phase stability. With the use of La 2 Ce 2 O 7 and La 2 Zr 2 O 7 as TBC materials, {{the difference in the}} weight of the active panel material and the heat gained by the fuel are nearly identical as compared to active panel material coated with YSZ TBC. Results showed that the effect of TBC thickness on the weight of the optimised actively cooled panel is negligible, because of very small TBC layer thickness ranging from 0. 5 to 3. 0 mm and nearly identical thermal properties of the TBC’s. Results showed that Inconel X- 750 is capable of sustaining high heat transfer coefficients with fuel/coolant heat gain well below fuel <b>coking</b> <b>temperature</b> with moderate weight to area ratio. dc 201...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityBiomass {{is one of}} the {{important}} renewable energy sources which are used to produce carbon-based liquid fuels through biochemical and thermochemical methods. The bio–oil from the biomass pyrolysis is an intermediate and requires upgrading. Catalyst coking is the most difficult challenge during the upgrading process, and results in low hydrocarbon yield and short catalyst life time. Compared with other methods for reducing catalyst coking such as high temperature baking and co-feeding hydrogen, a new route by liquid–liquid extraction to separate chemical compounds in mixture has been established in this study. First of all, the liquid-liquid extraction process using chloroform solvent on raw pyrolysis oil successfully separated chemical compounds by their properties and polarities with high extracting yield and admirable effect on chemical distribution. The acid, aldehyde and unpyrolyzed sugar can be completely removed from the bio–oil mixture. Secondly, an esterification process over the acid-rich water phase of pyrolysis oil achieved acid conversion over 89 % of by completely randomized design with temperature and catalyst loading factors. The esterification process followed the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism and reaction constants were calculated to build a practical esterification model for acid compounds. Additionally, dimethyl acetal was also produced by acetalization on the water phase via acetalization. Products determined by HPLC and GC−MS represented similar Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism kinetics to esterification, while moisture and acid content in the feedstock are the main inhibitors for the process. Finally, raw bio–oil and liquid–liquid extracted bio–oil on ZSM– 5 catalytic cracking was compared to illustrate our new pathway to solve catalyst <b>coking.</b> <b>Temperature</b> played an important role on increasing gaseous product and hydrocarbon yield as shown by GC−MS and Micro−GC analysis. Less catalyst coke and longer catalyst lives were achieved on liquid–liquid extracted bio–oil than raw bio–oil, indicating significant positive results on reducing catalyst coking. Besides, the new method developed in our study had several advantages over the traditional methods to solve catalyst coking. Neither alumina loss happened, nor high cost hydrogen was required, and other types of bio–oil also can be applied in this system.

Both materials possess cubic, B-site cation-disordered Pm- 3 m structure in air up to high temperatures. SrFe 0. 5 Mn 0. 25 Mo 0. 25 O 3 -δ was found to transform to a B-site cation-ordered structure after reduction in dry 5 vol % H 2 /Ar at 1100 ◦C, while no structural changes were observed for SrFe 0. 75 Mo 0. 25 O 3 -δ. Weight change upon annealing up to 850 ◦C in air and in dry 5 vol % H 2 /Ar indicated an increase in oxygen deficiency on the order of δ = 0. 2. Seebeck coefficient and conductivity depen-dence on the oxygen partial pressure pO 2 showed that both oxides exhibit p-type conductivity in air and n-type conductivity under reducing conditions. Carbon deposition was found to depend on temperature, gas composition (CO or CH 4), and presence of Ce 0. 8 Gd 0. 2 O 1. 9 electrolyte in the composite-type electrode. Stable fuel cell performance, without carbon deposition, was obtained for SrFe 0. 75 Mo 0. 25 O 3 -δ-based SOFC in 10 vol % of CO in CO 2.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} decomposition of tar compounds {{is an important}} issue in the cleaning and upgrading of gasification product gases. This work focuses on toluene pyrolysis in a quartz tube reactor with a fixed bed of activated carbon. A toluene to benzene and coke conversion mechanism is also proposed. Liquid decomposition products were analysed with GC-FID. The ash content in the spent carbon was measured, allowing for the determination of coke deposit growth on the carbon surface. Pyrolysis runs were performed at temperatures ranging from 650 to 800 °C and with varying toluene feeding times. It was determined that toluene conversion is maintained above 90 % for the first 20 min of pyrolysis at 800 °C. At this initial time, pronounced coking on the carbon surface was observed. Subsequently, toluene conversion decreased, coke deposition was hindered and benzene, a decomposition side product, yield was greatly enhanced. At lower <b>temperatures</b> <b>coking</b> is inhibited and toluene conversions were relatively low. For short, 10 min feeding times and at low temperatures, the benzene share of overall converted toluene is significant.

This information has been used to unambiguously identify coal-derived PAHs in contaminated land sites. Aromatic hydrocarbons in a number of samples analysed from a former foundry site at Mansfield displayed variable compositions with those containing predominately alkylated benzenes and naphthalenes having carbon stable isotopic ratios in the range of − 28 to − 30 ‰, typical of transport fuels. The aliphatic hydrocarbon distributions confirmed the petroleum origin and indicated that the oil had also been biodegraded. Less negative (enriched in 13 C, − 25 to − 26 ‰) isotopic profiles were obtained for the fractions rich in 3 – 6 ring parent PAHs, indicating a significant input from coal utilisation. Separating the aromatic by ring size enabled the coal-derived 3 – 6 ring PAHs to be identified in samples where petroleum-derived alkylated benzenes and naphthalenes dominated. A similar situation to this with only a small input from coal-derived PAHs was found for a soil heavily contaminated with diesel fuel from the Motherwell area. Carbon stable isotopic data taken in conjunction with PAH distributions indicate that the coal tar contaminating an area of Glasgow Green, which was believed to be dumped during the Second World War and was unearthed recently, probably originated from a high <b>temperature</b> <b>coking</b> plant as opposed to a gas works, as indicated by the isotopic signatures of the distributions of PAHs...|$|R
