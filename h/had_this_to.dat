25|$|Nothing about a {{personal}} connection between Gertrude Lawrence and Daphne du Maurier was published during Lawrence's lifetime. Two years after Lawrence's death, her widower Richard Aldrich <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> {{say in a}} best-selling biography of his late wife, Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.:All her ingenuous traits, which could be annoying as well as endearing, would be swept away by her courage, her clear perception of truth, and the divine compassion which could flood her heart and lift her to the heights of nobility.|$|E
25|$|In 1732 Lord Cobham's nephew Gilbert West wrote {{a lengthy}} poem, The Gardens of the Right Honourable Richard Viscount Cobham, that is {{actually}} {{a guide to the}} gardens in verse form. Charles Bridgeman commissioned 15 engravings of the gardens from Jacques Rigaud which were published in 1739. In 1744 Benton Seeley published A Description of the Gardens of Lord Cobham at Stow Buckinghamshire. In 1748 William Gilpin produced the Views of the Temples and other Ornamental Buildings in the Gardens at Stow followed in 1749 by A Dialogue upon the Gardens at Stow. Unlicensed copies of all three books were published in 1750 by George Bickham as The Beauties of Stow. To cater to the large number of French visitors, a French guidebook, Les Charmes de Stow, was published in 1748. In the 1750s Jean-Jacques Rousseau had visited the gardens and his writings about the gardens helped spread their fame and influence throughout Europe. He <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> say 'Stowe is composed of very beautiful and very picturesque spots chosen to represent different kinds of scenery, all of which seem natural except when considered as a whole, as in the Chinese gardens of which I was telling you. The master and creator of this superb domain has also erected ruins, temples and ancient buildings, like the scenes, exhibit a magnificence which is more than human'. Georges-Louis Le Rouge published in 1777 Détails de nouveaux jardins à la mode that included engravings of buildings at Stowe as well as at other famous gardens in Britain. In Germany Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld published Theorie der Gartenkunst in 5 volumes in Leipzig 1779–1785, that included Stowe. The last edition of the Seeley guide was published in 1827. In 1805-9 John Claude Nattes painted 105 wash drawings of both the house and gardens.|$|E

500|$|Despite the mainly {{positive}} reviews, {{the novel}} has received some negative criticism.

At the time girls just didn't join the WAVES or go into the military. But my Dad, he said, you'll be OK".|$|E

500|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight. Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster <b>had</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> say: [...] "Since seeing is only partly a matter of the image on the retina and the sensation it produces, but is in still larger part a matter of the cerebral processes of synthesis, in which memories play a principal role, it follows that by repetition, by practice, by exercises, one builds up a substratum of memories useful for the interpretation of sensations and facilitates the syntheses which are the major part of seeing." [...] Lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting the role of the brain in the process of seeing, [...] "leaving to irregular, half-trained workers the cultivation of that field".|$|E

500|$|The Natives next {{defeated}} both Northamptonshire and Kent, before defeats by Moseley and Burton-on-Trent. Both defeats were unexpected, {{and in the}} Moseley match, injuries {{played a}} part– the tourists played most of the match at least two men down, as replacements were then not allowed.

Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public, and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park, Uckfield. The Middlesex side contained a number of international players, including Arthur Gould. Middlesex won easily, with the Natives play characterised by poor tackling.
