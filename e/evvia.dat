50|$|Synthetic {{transfer}} zones {{must have}} major normal faults dipping {{in the same}} direction. This includes relay ramps. Relay ramps have been studied within the East African rift system (Lake Malawi) and the Gulf of Suez rift system. Transfer zone drainage basins consist of any sediments that will eventually travel through the transfer zone and in the half graben. The Gulf of <b>Evvia</b> is an example where a relay ramp {{plays a major role}} in drainage. Footwall drainage is limited in the Gulf of <b>Evvia</b> while transfer zone drainage is more pronounced. Since size of the drainage basin is one of the major controls on sediment flux, both interbasin and intrabasin synthetic relay ramp type transfer zones must have a major influence on sedimentation into the overall system. While intrabasin transfer zones are smaller they still act as a conduit for sedimentation.|$|E
50|$|Intrabasin {{transfer}} {{zones are}} within {{the constraints of the}} interbasin transfer zones and are normally an order of magnitude smaller. Intrabasin transfer zones could be relay ramps within en echelon normal faults, or minor fault jogs. The southern margin of the Gulf of <b>Evvia</b> near Atalanti shows the magnitude of difference between interbasin transfer zones with accommodating distances up to 10 km as well as intrabasin transfer zones that accommodate approximately 1 km or less.|$|E

50|$|What the Greek people hated {{about the}} Battalions, {{even more than}} their collaborationist nature, was the total lack of control over their members. For example after a battle in the hamlet of Attali in <b>Evvia</b> the collaborationists pillaged the houses of the village, taking away 1,000 oka of oil, five sewing machines, 200 ok of cheese and 30 {{complete}} trousseaus. 60 mules were needed to carry away the loot. By {{the end of the}} occupation their name was synonymous with arbitrary violence and frightful cruelty.|$|E
50|$|Jean Alberti was {{introduced}} to food preparation by his restaurant-owning family and his early culinary interest developed into a career as an international chef. The French native {{is a graduate of}} Ecole de Hotelier de Murbach in Alsace, France, and in 1976 was named the top apprentice chef in France. After working as a chef de partie in several exclusive restaurants in his native country, Alberti moved to the west coast of the United States and was named executive chef of The Tower Restaurant in Los Angeles. He subsequently became executive chef in then-new Jumby Bay Resort in Antigua, before successfully opening two Mediterranean restaurants in San Francisco, <b>Evvia</b> Estiatorio in 1996 and Kokkari Estiatorio in 1998. In 2002, Alberti was a chef for the James Beard Foundation Awards gala. Alberti opened the Shikumen Bistro, a high-end French brasserie, in Shanghai, China, in 2005. His interest in quality and variety of teas began during his California days when he discovered artisan teas.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{variations}} of the arrival times and polarities with backazimuth and distance of teleseismic P-to-S converted waves at interfaces bounding the slab crust under the upper plate mantle are used to constrain the depth, dip angle and azimuth of the slab of the Hellenic subduction zone. A grid search is designed to estimate the model parameters. Dip values of 16 - 18 °, with an azimuth of 20 ° to 40 °, are thus derived at 3 sites aligned over 50 km along the eastern coast of Peloponnesus. They {{are consistent with the}} variation from 54 to 61 km of the slab top depths constrained below each receiver. North of the Gulfs of Corinth and <b>Evvia,</b> a similar depth for the top of the slab is found at a distance from the subduction at least 100 km larger. This suggests flatter subduction of a different slab segment. Such a variation in slab attitude at depth across the region from south of the eastern Gulf of Corinth to north of <b>Evvia</b> is a candidate for the control of the recent or active localized crustal thinning of the upper plate we documented in earlier work, and of the surface deformation...|$|E

The new taxon {{belongs to the}} Duvalius “isotopic” trechine lineage, but is markedly characterized by the peculiar combination of several morphological features in the general shape, chaetotaxy of head, serrate lateral margins of elytra, and features of male genitalia (both in median lobe of aedeagus and endophallus).

40|$|International audienceOur {{aim is to}} {{understand}} better the rifting process by imaging the Moho depth variation beneath Corinth and <b>Evvia.</b> We present here {{the results of a}} gravity inversion analysis in the region of the Corinth and <b>Evvia</b> rift system, and compare them to those obtained independently from teleseismic tomography and receiver function analyses. The results of these different studies appear to be consistent and show (1) a 10 km crustal thickening {{in the western part of}} the area beneath the Hellenides mountains, (2) NW–SE-trending periodic crustal thinning, and (3) a maximum crustal thinning north of the Gulf of Corinth. This 4 km thinning is unlikely to be the result of the rifting alone, which seems to have been reactivated since only 1 Ma. We propose here a geodynamical scenario in two major steps to explain the evolution of Corinth area. Aegean Miocene extension involving boudinage resulted in periodic crustal thinning, consistent with observations. These lithospheric instabilities could have favoured rupture initiation in particular areas, especially near the city of Corinth. Then, the reactivation of the Corinth Rift extension, 1 Myr ago, led to westward rift propagation. The offset observed between the maximum crustal thinning and the Gulf of Corinth could be accommodated by a low-angle normal fault at about 10 – 15 km depth. The Corinth Rift is thus asymmetrical and was initiated in places of crustal weakness due to Miocene lithospheric instabilities...|$|E
40|$|Ardennite is a mixed-anion {{silicate}} with ideal {{chemical formula}} (Mn,Ca,Mg) 4 [Al,Fe 3 +) 5 Mg](AsO 4) (SiO 4) 2 (Si 3 O 10) (OH) 6). From the structural point of view, {{it may be}} regarded {{as a member of a}} polytypic family formed by two different kinds of regularly alternating layers. Such a prototypic family is conveniently described in terms of the OD-theory. The results of a combined chemical and HRTEM study are presented for ardennite sampled at two different localities - Western Alps, France and <b>Evvia</b> island, Greece. A plausible structural model for the most common complex polytype of ardennite is suggested with a doubled c period. Contrarily, ardennite from the Western Alps presents neither significant deviations from ideal stoichiometry nor evidence for polytypic behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Two species, D. octhoniai from <b>Evvia</b> and D. saraolacosi from Skyros island (Greece) are morphologically described. These {{two species}} were {{collected}} {{for the first}} time at the end of the ‘ 70 s but they were recorded only as nomina nuda without any formal taxonomic description. D. octhoniai is very similar to the other Evvian species D. makrikapa and to D. vandeli and D. petrochilosi from Viotia and Attiki respectively, differing from them only by a few morphological characters. On the other hand D. saraolacos i is very different from all the other species of Central Greece and West Aegean showing some affinity only with the Attiki species D. insignis and with the South Evvian species D. cassagnaui. Relationships among the species inhabiting caves of this area of Greece are discussed in relation to the complex geological history of the West Aegean area and the adjacent mainland...|$|E
40|$|Palaeomagnetic {{studies in}} Greece have {{concentrated}} upon Neogene sequences, with Mesozoic rocks of mainland Greece receiving little attention. The Neogene data base is now sufficiently extensive, however, to allow meaningful interpretation of older units. This paper presents new palaeomagnetic data from Mesozoic and Tertiary sequences of eastern central Greece, which document a pre-Neogene phase cf rotational deformation. Mesozoic carbonates have been sampled within the classic Pelagonian Zone in the Argolis Peninsula, Beotia and <b>Evvia.</b> Pelagonian sequences record the development, drowning and subsequent re-establishment of a carbonate platform separating two strands of the Neotethys Ocean (the Pindos and Vardar basins). Most platformal facies are tdo weakly magnetized for palaeomagnetic analysis. However, pelagic horizons consisting of pink condensed limestones have been deposited periodically {{in response to}} platform subsidence. These Middle-Late Triassic, Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous sequences yield high-quality palaeomagnetic data, which reveal a consistent clockwise rotation of about 94 ". The constancy of rotation angle deduce...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Aegean sea is a back arc basin {{in which}} the {{continental}} lithosphere has been stretched through the tertiary leaving several diachronous belts of Metamorphic Core Complexes (MCCs). The Aegean MCCs present two classes of shapes. Some are elongated {{in the direction of}} the lineation (A-type e. g. Naxos, Paros [...] ) while the others are elongated in a direction normal to the lineation (B-type e. g. Tinos, <b>Evvia</b> [...] .). While it is well established from 1 and 2 D modeling that MCC's forms when the lower crust is weak, the reason for the diversity of shape remains an open question. The A-type domes are not only elongated in shape; their P-T-t paths indicate a clear phase of warming during the exhumation and they also present migmatites (which are not observed in the other islands). Several hypothesis may be drawn. The elongated domes could result from 1) the competition of boudinage versus normal constriction folding, 2) lateral variation of the thickness or the temperature of the crust resulting in local buoyant instability (R-T instability) or 3) lateral gradient of deformation. This contribution presents the preliminary results obtained with thermo-mechanical models in which we test the influence of a local plutonic intrusions, along strike variation of extensional rate, and lateral boundary condition (normal shortening or extension) on the shape of the domes. As this problem is inherently three dimensional, the models were computed on our computer cluster using Gale/Underworld an ALE method with visco-plastic temperature dependent rheologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Gulf of Aden and the Anatolian Fault systems are modelled using the principles of elastic fracture mechanics usually applied to smaller scale cracks or faults. The lithosphere is treated as a plate, and simple boundary conditions are applied that correspond to the known plate boundary geometry and slip vectors. The models provide a simple explanation for many observed geological features. For the Gulf of Aden the model predicts why the ridge propagated {{from east to west}} from the Owen Fracture Zone towards the Afar and the overall form of its path. The smaller en echelon offsets can be explained by upward propagation from the initially created mantle dyke while the larger ones may be attributed to the propagating rupture interacting with pre-existing structures. For Anatolia the modelling suggests that the East Anatolian Fault was created before the North Anatolian Fault could form. Once both faults were formed however, activity could switch between them. The time scales over which this should take place are not known, but evidence for switching {{can be found in the}} historical seismicity. For Aden and Anatolia pre-existing structures or inhomogeneous stress fields left from earlier orogenic events have modified the processes of propagation and without an understanding of the existence of such features the propagation processes cannot be fully understood. Furthermore a propagating fault can extend into an active region where it would not have initiated. The North Anatolian Fault encountered slow but active extension when it entered the Aegean about 5 Ma and the stress field associated with the extending fault has progressively modified Aegean extension. In the central Aegean activity has been reduced while to the north-west on features such as the Gulfs of <b>Evvia</b> and Corinth activity has been increased. The field observation that major structures propagate and the success of simple elastic mod- els suggest that the continental crust behaves in an elastic-brittle or elastic-plastic fashion even though laboratory tests may be interpreted to suggest viscous behaviour. There are major prob- lems in scaling from the behaviour of small homogeneous samples to the large heterogeneous mantle and large-scale observations should be treated more seriously than extrapolations of the behaviour of laboratory experiments over many orders of magnitude in space and time. The retention of long-term elasticity and localised failure suggests a similar gross rheology for the oceanic and continental lithospheres. Even though it is incorrect to attribute differences in behaviour to the former being rigid (i. e. elastic) and the latter viscous, oceanic and continental lithosphere behave in different ways. Unlike oceanic crust, continental crust is buoyant and cannot be simply created or destroyed. The process of thickening or thinning works against gravity preventing large displacements on extensional or contractional features in the upper mantle. The equivalents of ridge or subduction systems are suppressed before they can accom- modate large displacements and activity must shift elsewhere. On the other hand, strike-slip boundaries and extrusion processes are favoured. Peer reviewe...|$|E
