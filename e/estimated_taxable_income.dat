40|$|In this dissertation, I {{include three}} essays {{regarding}} earnings forecasts, the DuPont analysis and tax expense, all using mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption in Canada as a setting. In the first essay entitled “DuPont Analysis, Earnings Persistence and Return on Equity: Evidence from Mandatory IFRS Adoption in Canada”, I propose four new models to forecast one-year-ahead {{return on equity}} and change in return on equity based on prior research in the DuPont analysis and earnings persistence. I also examine whether the persistence of return on equity has improved since Canadian companies adopted IFRS in 2011. In the second essay entitled “Information Content of Tax Expense and the Effect of IFRS Adoption on Tax Expense”, I examine the information content of tax expense about future profitability {{and the effect of}} IFRS adoption on tax expense. Prior studies (Lev and Nissim, 2004; Hanlon, 2005; Schmidt, 2006; Ayers et al., 2009) use <b>estimated</b> <b>taxable</b> <b>income,</b> book-tax differences and effective tax rates to investigate the relation between income taxes and future earnings. However, those estimated proxies contain measurement errors and might distort the relationship among variables. Tax expense including current, deferred and other income taxes is directly derived from a Compustat account with no estimation error. The main analysis and robustness tests show that tax expense contains more incremental information content about future profitability beyond pre-tax book income than <b>estimated</b> <b>taxable</b> <b>income.</b> In the third essay entitled “Impact of IFRS Adoption, Value Relevance and Industry Effects: A Canadian Study”, I propose a new comparability index to examine the impact of IFRS adoption on the financial statements of firms from different industries.

40|$|Academic {{researchers}} and policy activists {{have used the}} difference between accounting income and <b>estimated</b> <b>taxable</b> <b>income,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} the book-tax difference (BTD) as a proxy of the unobservable level of corporate income tax planning. In drawing any policy implications from observed BTDs, an understanding of the sources of BTDs and their properties is important. In particular, identifying the degree of persistence or representativeness of an observed annual BTD is critical. To the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first to examine how BTDs and their components e. g. permanent differences, temporary differences and the effect of differences between UK and overseas statutory tax rate behave over time. The necessary data disclosed under IAS 12 Income Taxes (IASB, 2010) has only been systematically publicly disclosed in the UK since 2005. In summary, the results indicate that the degree of persistence is dependent {{on the nature of the}} BTD and that this variation in persistence itself varies by industry group. The most persistence component relates to differences between UK and overseas statutory tax rates with temporary differences being the least persistent, indicative of a non-earnings management motivation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{a large body}} of tax {{accounting}} literature on the association between book-tax conformity (BTC) /book-tax differences (BTD) and firms' opportunistic reporting behavior has emerged. Yet, existing empirical evidence on the questions whether increased book-tax conformity actually reduces Earnings Management (EM) and/or Tax Sheltering (TS) and whether book-tax differences are really indicative of such opportunistic reporting behavior is not yet clear. We therefore conduct a meta-analysis aimed at identifying the sources of heterogeneity in primary studies and at providing a consensus estimate with respect to the sign and the statistical significance level for the examined association. Our qualitative literature review reveals that major sources of heterogeneity in the study design include differences in the proxies for EM and TS and in the measures used to determine BTD and BTC. Our meta-regression results show that BTD are indeed indicative of opportunistic reporting behavior, and even more so of EM. These results are, however, weaker for studies that determine BTD only roughly as the difference between book and <b>estimated</b> <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> instead of using more specific BTD proxies. Moreover, examining actual BTD computed from tax returns instead of only approximating these from financial statements strongly increases the effects. Hence, efforts taken to accurately determine BTD seem to be worth wile {{when it comes to the}} explanatory power for opportunistic reporting. Furthermore, our results suggest a negative association between book-tax conformity and EM/TS, which we interpret as an indicator for higher conformity indeed being effective in reducing aggressive reporting...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{estimates of}} individuals' responses in hourly wages {{to changes in}} marginal tax rates. Estimates based on register panel data of Swedish households covering the period 1992 to 2007 produce significant but relatively small net-of-tax rate elasticities. The results vary with family type, with the largest elasticities obtained for single males and the smallest for married/cohabitant females. Despite these seemingly small elasticities, evaluation {{of the effects of}} a reduced state tax using a microsimulation model shows that the effort effect matters. The largest effect is due to changes in number of working hours yet including the effort effect results in an almost self-financed reform.

Estimates are systematically examined by applying a number of sensitivity tests. Estimates are produced after altering the: (1) time interval over which observational-level behavior is measured; (2) income restrictions on the sample; (3) choice of control variables; and (4) weighting scheme used in the regressions. In general, estimates are quite sensitive {{to a number of}} different factors. In contrast to some of the literature, estimates are larger when behavior is measured over 3 -year intervals as opposed to over 1 -year intervals, suggesting small transitory responses to tax changes but larger longer-term responses. When including the richest set of income controls, income-weighted short-term elasticity estimates (based on 1 -year differencing) range from 0 to 0. 19. Similarly estimated longer-term elasticities (where data are differenced over 3 -year intervals) are about 0. 32. When adding adjacent year tax rates to the model, short-term elasticity estimates range from 0. 30 to 0. 43 and longer-term estimates from 0. 97 to 1. 37. In most cases, estimates from an end-year approach (which includes only 2 years of data, one well before the tax change and one well after) are not statistically different from 0. However, even for the approaches that produce statistically significant results, estimates are sensitive to an array of factors and plausible sensitivity checks often result in estimates that differ greatly.

The size of the kink allows us to derive tighter bounds on the long-run elasticity than previous studies.

The purpose of the dissertation research was to identify the effects of inflation upon the taxation of income and capital within the nonfinancial corporate sector. A partial equilibrium approach was used to address two areas: (1) to identify the magnitude and variation of the effects of inflation upon the taxation of corporate income and capital, given the existing nominal income tax system, and (2) to identify the effects of using a price-level-adjusted <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> measure upon the aggregate magnitude and distribution of corporate income tax payments. The study used financial statement data from the annual industrial COMPUSTAT tapes. A subset of 864 nonfinancial corporations was selected for the study within 26 two-digit standard industry classifications. An algorithm was developed to perform the following: (1) to <b>estimate</b> <b>taxable</b> <b>income,</b> (2) to <b>estimate</b> price-level-adjusted pre-tax <b>income</b> and price-level-adjusted <b>taxable</b> <b>income,</b> and (3) to estimate the tax payments based upon historical cost <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> and price-level-adjusted <b>taxable</b> <b>income.</b> Real and nominal tax rates were computed for each firm and capital maintenance conditions were used to determine the incidence of capital erosion and the degree of capital maintenance within each industry group. The analysis was cross-sectional and encompassed the years 1976, 1977 and 1978. The results indicate that the real tax rate was significantly greater than the nominal tax rate for most firms and industries in the study. The exceptions to this general finding were explained by using a form of sensitivity analysis. The results also indicate that there was a substantial variation in the real tax rate among firms and industry groups. In addition, {{it was found that the}} use of a price-level-adjusted <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> measure would alter the magnitude and the distribution of tax payments within the corporate sector. It was concluded that the effects of inflation upon corporate income taxation have resulted in intersectoral and intrasectoral misallocations of capital. In particular, the most obvious economic effect of the increase in the real corporate tax rate is a reduction in the rate of corporate capital formation. Moreover, the substantial variation of the real tax rate implies a source of capital misallocation within the corporate sector. It was also concluded that the use of a price-level-adjusted <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> measure would result in some serious problems for income tax policy formulation. In particular, the policy change would result in a reduction in the tax revenue obtained from the corporate sector. In addition, the policy change would cause a shifting of tax payments among firms and industries...|$|R

40|$|Recently, a voluminous {{literature}} <b>estimating</b> the <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> elasticity {{has emerged}} as an important field in empirical public economics. However, {{to a large extent}} it is still unknown how the hourly wage rate, an important component of <b>taxable</b> <b>income,</b> reacts to changes in marginal tax rates. In this study we use a rich panel data set and a sequence of tax reforms that took place in Sweden during the 1980 ’s to estimate the elasticity of the hourly wage rate with respect to the net-of-tax rate. While carefully accounting for the endogeneity of marginal tax rates as well as other factors that determine wage rates we do find a statistically significant response both among married men and married women. The hourly wage rate elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate is estimated to 0. 14 - 0. 16 for males and 0. 41 - 0. 57 for females. In addition, we obtain uncompensated <b>taxable</b> labor <b>income</b> elasticities of around 0. 21 for men and 0. 96 - 1. 44 for women. In contrast to earlier studies, we also find significant income effects for males. Accordingly, for males the compensated <b>taxable</b> labor <b>income</b> elasticity is about 4 percentage points higher than the uncompensated one. ...|$|R

The paper finds that that Gruber and Saez’s approach yields an <b>estimated</b> elasticity of <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> (ETI) for the 1990 s that is about half the size of this paper’s corresponding estimate for the 1980 s.

40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of tax reform, it is {{necessary}} {{to take into account the}} way households adjust their <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> to tax rates. The key parameter is the elasticity of <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> to the marginal tax rate or its complementarity to one, a rate called "retention". This elasticity is estimated using individual data for the period 1997 - 2004. This period saw legislative changes to income tax (reduction of the ceiling of the family quotient and cuts in scale rates) which are "natural experiments" suitable for measuring the elasticity of <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> with respect to the marginal rate, drawing on the estimation strategy used by Gruber and Saez (2002). Across all <b>taxable</b> households, the <b>estimated</b> elasticity of <b>taxable</b> <b>income</b> to the marginal retention rate is very low, in the order of 0. 02. But there is a fairly strong heterogeneity of reactions, since it is 0. 31 for the 10 % of households with the highest <b>taxable</b> <b>income.</b> To illustrate, we examine the implications of such an elasticity in the context of a model to determine the maximum rate for the highest income, the Saez model (2001). This calculation is only indicative, however, because the Saez model is designed to assess the optimal rates on the assumption that income tax is the only redistributive instrument and the only source of revenue for public finances. It does not give clues as to the optimal rate to be applied in a tax system where income tax plays only a minor role...|$|R
