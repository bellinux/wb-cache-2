60|$|Early in the day, Mervyn {{returned}} with the superintendent of police. He was still too much excited to rest, and his heavy tread re-echoed from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>floor,</b> as he showed the superintendent round the house, calling his sister or the servants to corroborate his statements, or help out his account {{of what he had}} hardly seen or comprehended. Thus he came to Phoebe for her version of the affair in the gallery, of which he only knew his own share--the noise that had roused him, the sight of the burglar, the sudden darkness, the report of the pistol; and the witness of his danger--the bullet--was in the wall nearly where his head had been. When Phoebe had answered his questions, he gazed at her, and exclaimed--'Hallo! why, Phoebe, it seems that but for you, Parson Robert would be in possession here!' and burst into a strange nervous laugh, ending by coming to her and giving a hearty kiss to her forehead, ere hurrying away to report her evidence to the policeman.|$|E
60|$|The next day, {{about the}} hour appointed, {{the young man}} found {{his way to the}} square, which I will here call Golden Square, though that was not its name. What to expect, he knew not; for a man may live in dreams, and yet be {{unprepared}} for their realisation. It was already with a certain pang of surprise that he beheld the mansion, standing in the eye of day, a solid among solids. The key, upon trial, readily opened the front door; he entered that great house, a privileged burglar; and, escorted by the echoes of desertion, rapidly reviewed the empty chambers. Cats, servant, old lady, the very marks of habitation, like writing on a slate, had been in these few hours obliterated. He wandered from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>floor,</b> and found the house of great extent; the kitchen offices commodious and well appointed; the rooms many and large; and the drawing-room, in particular, an apartment of princely size and tasteful decoration. Although the day without was warm, genial, and sunny, with a ruffling wind from the quarter of Torquay, a chill, as it were, of suspended animation inhabited the house. Dust and shadows met the eye; and but for the ominous procession of the echoes, and the rumour of the wind among the garden trees, the ear of the young man was stretched in vain.|$|E
60|$|Though {{the word}} castle is of common use in Europe, {{as applied to}} ancient baronial edifices, the thing itself is very {{different}} in style, extent, and cost, in different countries. Security, united to dignity and the means of accommodating a train of followers suited to {{the means of the}} noble, being the common object, the position and defences of the place necessarily varied according to the general aspect of the region in which it stood. Thus ditches and other broad expanses of water were much depended on in all low countries, as in Flanders, Holland, parts of Germany, and much of France; while hills, spurs of mountains, and more especially the summits of conical rocks, were sought in Switzerland, Italy, and wherever else these natural means of protection could readily found. Other circumstances, such as climate wealth, the habits of a people, {{and the nature of the}} feudal rights, also served greatly to modify the appearance and extent of the building. The ancient hold in Switzerland was originally little more than a square solid tower, perched upon a rock, with turrets at its angles. Proof against fire from without, it had ladders to mount from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>floor</b> and often contained its beds in the deep recesses of the windows, or in alcoves wrought in the massive wall. As greater security or greater means enabled, offices and constructions of more importance arcse around its base, inclosing a court. These necessarily followed the formation of the rock, until, in time, the confused and inartificial piles, which are now seen mouldering on so many of the minor spurs of the Alps, were created.|$|E

60|$|This is the house, 22 Little Owlet Street, Marylebone, {{but which}} were his rooms {{it is less}} easy to determine, for he was a lodger who flitted placidly from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>floor</b> {{according}} to the state of his finances, carrying his apparel and other belongings in one great armful, and spilling by the way. On this particular evening he was on the second floor front, which had a fireplace in the corner, furniture all his landlady's and mostly horsehair, little to suggest his calling save a noble saucerful of ink, and nothing to draw attention from Pym, who lolled, gross and massive, on a sofa, one leg over the back of it, the other drooping, his arms extended, and his pipe, which he could find nowhere, thrust between the buttons of his waistcoat, an agreeable pipe-rack. He wore a yellow dressing-gown, or could scarcely be said to wear it, for such of it as was not round his neck he had converted into a cushion for his head, which is perhaps the part of him we should have turned to first It was a big round head, the plentiful gray hair in tangles, possibly because in Pym's last flitting the comb had dropped over the banisters; the features were ugly and beyond life-size, yet the forehead had altered little except in colour since the day when he was near being made a fellow of his college; there was sensitiveness left in the thick nose, humour in the eyes, though they so often watered; the face had gone to flabbiness at last, but not without some lines and dents, as if the head had resisted the body for a space before the whole man rolled contentedly downhill.|$|E
6000|$|After full many {{a mutual}} delay [...] My friend and I at last fixed {{on a day}} [...] For seeing Black Cross Farm, which he had long [...] Boasted the fittest theme for tale or song [...] In all that charming region round about: [...] Something that must not really be left out [...] Of the account {{of things to do}} for me. [...] It was a teasing bit of mystery, [...] He said, which he and his had tried in vain, [...] Ever since they had found it, to explain. [...] The right way was to happen, as they did, [...] Upon it in the hills where it was hid; [...] But chance could not be always trusted, quite, [...] You might not happen on it, though you might; [...] Encores were usually objected to [...] By chance. The next best thing that we could do [...] Was in his carryall, to start together, [...] And trust that somehow favoring wind and weather, [...] With the {{eccentric}} progress of his horse, [...] Would so far drift us from our settled course [...] That we at least could lose ourselves, if not [...] Find the mysterious object that we sought. [...] So one blithe morning of the ripe July [...] We fared, by easy stages, toward the sky [...] That rested one rim of its turquoise cup [...] Low on the distant sea, and, tilted up, [...] The other on the irregular hilltops. Sweet [...] The sun and wind that joined to cool and heat [...] The air to one delicious temperature; [...] And over the smooth-cropt mowing-pieces pure [...] The pine-breath, borrowing their spicy scent [...] In barter for the balsam that it lent! [...] And when my friend handed the reins to me, [...] And drew a fuming match along his knee, [...] And, lighting his cigar, began to talk, [...] I let the old horse lapse into a walk [...] From his perfunctory trot, content to listen, [...] Amid that leafy rustle and that glisten [...] Of field, and wood, and ocean, rapt afar, [...] From every trouble of our anxious star. [...] From time to time, between effect and cause [...] In this or that, making a questioning pause, [...] My friend peered round him while he feigned a gay [...] Hope that we might have taken the wrong way [...] At the last turn, and then let me push on, [...] Or the old horse rather, slanting hither and yon, [...] And never {{in the middle of the}} track, [...] Except when slanting off or slanting back. [...] He talked, I listened, while we wandered by [...] The scanty fields of wheat and oats and rye, [...] With patches of potatoes and of corn, [...] And now and then a garden spot forlorn, [...] Run wild where once a house had stood, or where [...] An empty house yet stood, and seemed to stare [...] Upon us blindly from the twisted glass [...] Of windows that once let no wayfarer pass [...] Unseen of children dancing at the pane, [...] And vanishing to reappear again, [...] Pulling their mother with them to the sight. [...] Still we kept on, with turnings left and right, [...] Past farmsteads grouped in cheerful neighborhoods, [...] Or solitary; then through shadowy woods [...] Of pine or birch, until the road, grass-grown, [...] Had given back to Nature all her own [...] Save a faint wheel-trace, that along the slope, [...] Rain-gullied, seemed to stop and doubt and grope, [...] And then quite ceased, as if 't had turned and fled [...] Out of the forest into which it led, [...] And left us at the gate whose every bar [...] Was nailed against us. But, [...] "Oh, here we are!" [...] My friend cried joyously. [...] "At last, at last!" [...] And making our horse superfluously fast, [...] He led the way onward by what had been [...] A lane, now hid by weeds and briers between [...] Meadows scarce worth the mowing, to a space [...] Shaped as by Nature for the dwelling-place [...] Of kindly human life: a small plateau [...] Open to the heaven that seemed bending low [...] In liking for it. There beneath a roof [...] Still against winter and summer weather-proof, [...] With walls and doors and windows perfect yet, [...] Between its garden and its graveyard set, [...] Stood the old homestead, out of which had perished [...] The home whose memory it dumbly cherished, [...] And which, when at our push the door swung wide, [...] We might have well imagined to have died [...] And had its funeral the day before: [...] So clean and cold it was from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>floor,</b> [...] So lifelike and so deathlike, with the thrill [...] Of hours when life and death encountered still [...] Passionate in it. They that lay below [...] The tangled grasses or the drifted snow, [...] Husband and wife, mother and little one, [...] From that sad house less utterly were gone [...] Than they that living had abandoned it. [...] In moonless nights their Absences might flit, [...] Homesick, from room to room, or dimly sit [...] Around its fireless hearths, or haunt the rose [...] And lily in the neglected garden close; [...] But they whose feet had borne them from the door [...] Would pass the footworn threshold nevermore. [...] We read the moss-grown names upon the tombs, [...] With lighter melancholy than the glooms [...] Of the dead house shadowed us with, and thence [...] Turning, my heart was pierced with more intense [...] Suggestion of a mystical dismay, [...] As in the brilliance of the summer day [...] We faced the vast gray barn. The house was old, [...] Though so well kept, as age by years is told [...] In our young land; but the barn, gray and vast, [...] Stood new and straight and strong--all battened fast [...] At every opening; and where once the mow [...] Had yawned wide-windowed, on the sheathing now [...] A Cross was nailed, the bigness of a man, [...] Aslant from left to right, athwart the span, [...] And painted black as paint could make it. Hushed, [...] I stood, while manifold conjecture rushed [...] To this point and to that point, and then burst [...] In the impotent questionings rejected first. [...] What did it mean? Ah, that no one could tell. [...] Who put it there? That was unknown as well. [...] Was there no legend? My friend knew of none. [...] No neighborhood story? He had sought for one [...] In vain. Did he imagine it accident, [...] With nothing really implied or meant [...] By the boards set in that way? It might be, [...] But I could answer that as well as he. [...] Then (desperately) what did he guess it was: [...] Something of purpose, or without a cause [...] Other than chance? He slowly shook his head, [...] And with his gaze fixed on the symbol said: [...] "We have quite ceased from guessing or surmising, [...] For all our several and joint devising [...] Has left us finally where I must leave you. [...] But now I think it is your part to do [...] Yourself some guessing. I hoped you might bring [...] A fresh mind to the riddle's unraveling. [...] Come!" ...|$|E
