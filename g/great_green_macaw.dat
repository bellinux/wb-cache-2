50|$|Before 1994 {{very few}} things were {{known about the}} natural history of the <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> and their {{abundance}} was in a sharp decline. In order to improve our knowledge on the ecology and natural history of this bird, a large radio telemetry was conducted by a team of researchers between 1994 and 2006. The main objectives of this study were to determine the home range of A. ambiguus, characterize the habitats that it frequents and learn more about its natural history in general (feeding habits, ecological associations, abundance, and reproduction and nesting habits). The results of this study were published in 2007. It was found that, in Costa Rica and adjacent Panama, the habitats where <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> occur were dominated by the wood almond (Dipteryx panamensis (or D. oleifera)), oilbean trees (Pentaclethra macroloba) and raffia palms (Raphia spp.). This is not surprising considering that <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> depend on D. panamensis for both feeding and nesting.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{establishment}} as a National Park {{an estimated}} 238 {{species of birds}} has been identified. Some species include the motmot, parrot, toucan, <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws.</b> Other than birds there is also wildlife present such as anteater, howler monkey, jaguars, and tapirs.|$|R
50|$|Another study {{published}} in 2007 revealed that the abundance of food within a habitat {{is not related to}} the abundance of macaw; however the researchers found that there was a link between the abundance of food and the amount of time <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> spend at one place.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1980s retired American expat couple Margot and Richard Frisius {{started a}} {{licensed}} zoological park" [...] (Friends of the Birds). Over {{the years they}} created what has become the biggest collection of <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> in captivity and, upon acquiring a breeding stock of sufficient genetic diversity, a successful scarlet macaw reintroduction program.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} length, this species {{is second only}} in size to the {{hyacinth}} macaw, {{the largest of the}} macaws. The red-and-green macaw attains a total body length of 90 to 95 cm in adults. Twelve adults were found to average 1214 g. A weight range of between 1050 and 1708 g has been reported. While its weight range is broadly {{similar to that of the}} hyacinth, the average weight of the red-and-green macaw is slightly surpassed by both the hyacinth and <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws,</b> and amongst all living parrots additionally by the kakapo.|$|R
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaw's</b> {{breeding}} season starts in December and ends in April, {{but the time}} and duration {{vary depending on the}} location. Before building a nest, a pair establishes a large territory that does not overlap with that of other couples, and then, they find a tree cavity in which they can build a nest. Dipteryx panamensis is the nesting substrate 90% of the time. The female lays 2-3 eggs and incubates them for about a month period. This species has high reproductive success (60% of young survive), which is not surprising given its relatively small clutch size.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> are {{the largest}} parrots in their natural range, the second {{heaviest}} macaw species (although are relatively shorter tailed than other large macaws such as the red-and-green macaw and are thus somewhat shorter), and the third heaviest parrot species in the world. This species averages 85 - 90 cm in length and 1.3 kg in weight. [...] They are mainly green and have a reddish forehead and pale blue lower back, rump and upper tail feathers. Tail is brownish red tipped with very pale blue. The bare facial skin is patterned with lines of small dark feathers, which are reddish in older and female parrots.|$|R
50|$|The largest macaws are the hyacinth, Buffon's (<b>great</b> <b>green)</b> and green-winged <b>macaws.</b> While still {{relatively}} large, macaws {{of the genera}} Cyanopsitta, Orthopsittaca and Primolius are significantly smaller than the members of Anodorhynchus and Ara.

50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaw</b> {{lives in}} {{tropical}} {{forests in the}} Atlantic wet lowlands of Central and South America from Honduras to Western Ecuador.

In Costa Rica, the range of the <b>great</b> <b>green</b> <b>macaw</b> is restricted to 1120 km2 of very wet forests along the border with Nicaragua where there are populations in the Bosawas and San Juan reserves, which represents only 10% of its historical range. Even though it is now rare near the rìo platano in Honduras, it still occurs there. In Panama, it can be observed on the Caribbean slope, near Cana and Alturas de Nique, and the adjacent Colombia.|$|E

40|$|Mammal survey: This study aims {{to monitor}} the long term changes that occur in mammal populations after the {{cessation}} of hunting activity. 2006 was the fourth consecutive year of data collection along line transects. Populations recorded this year were compared to levels in 2003. The spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth chamek) was the only species to have shown a statistically significant increase in population abundance. This species {{has been the most}} severely affected by hunting activities in adjacent river systems (the lower part of River Tambopata) where over hunting has caused the species to become locally extinct. For other hunted species, it may be that it is too soon in the study to see significant increases and that future studies will reveal a clearer trends. Recommendations for wildlife protection in the River Las Piedras are made. Macaw & parrot survey: Results are presented here on the impacts of boat traffic on red and <b>green</b> <b>macaws</b> at two study sites in south eastern Peru, for two time periods.

50|$|Macaws eat {{a variety}} of foods {{including}} seeds, nuts, fruits, palm fruits, leaves, flowers, and stems.
