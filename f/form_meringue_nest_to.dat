[...] Suspiro {{is a type}} of frosting made of egg whites and sugar which are mixed together to <b>form</b> a <b>meringue.</b> The most popular filling for Dominican cake is the baked-in pineapple filling, but other fillings include guava, tres leches, and dulce de leche.|$|R
5000|$|... ==Reproduction== The {{reproductive}} behavior of slave-making ants usually consists in synchronous emergence of sexuals {{followed by a}} nuptial flight and the invasion of a host nest, but also in some cases females display a mating call around the natal <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> attract males and immediately after mating search for a host <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> usurp.|$|R

50|$|There are two worker castes in M. bellicosus, {{the major}} worker and the minor worker. In both cases, the workers begin their lives by {{taking care of}} the queen, and later on leave the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> begin foraging. The point at which the worker leaves the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> begin {{gathering}} food differs slightly between the two castes. Major workers will leave at any point between 13 and 25 days after moulting, and the minor worker exits between 9 and 32 days.|$|R

25|$|Many {{species of}} bird conceal their <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> {{protect them from}} predators. Some species may choose nest sites that are {{inaccessible}} or build the <b>nest</b> so as <b>to</b> deter predators. Bird nests can also act as habitats for other inquiline species which may not affect the bird directly. Birds have also evolved <b>nest</b> sanitation measures <b>to</b> reduce the effects of parasites and pathogens on nestlings.|$|R

40|$|Squamate {{reptiles}} {{rely heavily}} on visual and chemical cues to detect their prey, so we expected yellow-spotted goannas (Varanus panoptes) which are predators of sea turtle nests on mainland beaches in northern Australia would use these cues to find sea turtle nests. Ghost crabs (Ocypode ceratophthalmus and Ocypode cordimanus) are also common on Australian sea turtle nesting beaches and frequently burrow into sea turtle nests. However, the potential for ghost crab burrowing activity at sea turtle <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> signal {{the location of a}} <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> goannas has not been investigated. Here, we used camera traps and presence of tracks at <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> record goanna activity around selected nests during the incubation period and 10 days after hatchling turtles emerged from their nests. We also recorded the number of ghost crab burrows around <b>nests</b> <b>to</b> evaluate ghost crab activity. Our results indicated that nest discovery by goannas was independent of nest age, but that the nest visitation rate of goannas and crabs increased significantly after a nest had been opened by a goanna or after hatchlings had emerged from the nest. There was no apparent connection between ghost crab burrows into a nest and the likelihood of that nest being predated by goannas...|$|R
50|$|For {{the larvae}} and the pupae in the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> {{properly}} develop {{there needs to}} be the proper temperature.

2500|$|Small {{bird species}} {{in more than}} 20 {{passerine}} families, and a few non-passerines—including most hummingbirds, kinglets and crests in the genus Regulus, some tyrant flycatchers and several New World warblers—use considerable amounts of spider silk {{in the construction of}} their nests. [...] The lightweight material is strong and extremely flexible, allowing the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> mold to the adult during incubation (reducing heat loss), then to stretch to accommodate the growing nestlings; as it is sticky, it also helps <b>to</b> bind the <b>nest</b> <b>to</b> the branch or leaf to which it is attached.|$|R
