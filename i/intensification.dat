5|$|The rapid <b>intensification</b> of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC {{indicated}} {{the possibility of}} such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. They noted the only inhibiting factor would be how quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just {{before the onset of}} rapid <b>intensification,</b> the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid <b>intensification</b> guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid <b>intensification</b> was already underway.|$|E
5|$|After {{attaining}} {{tropical storm}} status, significant <b>intensification</b> was limited {{due to a}} slight increase in wind shear as well as impeded outflow. The slowing of the strengthening trend was temporary, and by early on April 16 the organization had rapidly improved. As a result, the JMA upgraded Neoguri to a severe tropical storm. Warm water temperatures contributed to further <b>intensification,</b> and an eye formed {{in the center of the}} convection. At 1200UTC on April 16, the JMA classified Neoguri as a typhoon about 350km (220mi) east of Qui Nhon, Vietnam. An approaching mid-level trough turned the typhoon northwestward, which enhanced outflow and contributed to further <b>intensification.</b> Late on April 17, the JTWC assessed Neoguri as attaining peak winds of 175km/h (110mph), averaged over a duration of one minute, near the Paracel Islands. Early the next day, the JMA estimated Neoguri reached its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph), about 190km (120mi) east of Sanya on the southern tip of Hainan.|$|E
5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period of rapid <b>intensification,</b> despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive <b>intensification.</b> At {{the end of this}} phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E
40|$|Poleward {{boundary}} <b>intensifications</b> are nightside geomagnetic disturbances {{that have}} an auroral signature that moves equatorward from the poleward boundary of the auroral zone. They occur repetitively, so that many individual disturbances can occur during time intervals of ~ 1 hr, and {{they appear to be}} the most intense auroral disturbance at times other than the expansion phase of substorms. We have used data from three nightside conjunctions of the Geotail spacecraft in the magnetotail with the CANOPUS ground-based array in central Canada to investigate the relation between the poleward boundary <b>intensifications</b> and bursty plasma-sheet flows and to characterize the bursty flows associated with the disturbances. We have found a distinct difference in plasma she t dynamics between periods with, and periods without, poleward boundary <b>intensifications.</b> During periods with identifiable poleward boundary <b>intensifications,</b> the plasma sheet has considerable structure and bursty flow activity. Dur ng periods without such poleward boundary <b>intensifications,</b> the plasma sheet was found to be far more stable with fewer and weaker bursty flows. This is consistent with the <b>intensifications</b> being the result of the mapping to the ionosphere of the electric fields that give rise to bursty flows within th...|$|R

5|$|Hondo {{continued}} to quickly strengthen, becoming a tropical cyclone, {{the equivalent of}} a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, that same day. After maintaining its through the early hours of February6, a pinhole eye began to develop, signifying that Hondo was beginning to undergo rapid <b>intensification.</b> During this <b>intensification</b> phase, the storm became nearly stationary again due to a weakness in the ridge which was previously steering the cyclone towards the east. Later that day, Hondo was upgraded to an intense tropical cyclone with winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-minute winds). After becoming an intense tropical cyclone, wind shear began to increase, causing the eye to become slightly disorganized, temporarily slowed the <b>intensification.</b> Later in the day, the eye became better defined, allowing Hondo to intensify further. Operationally, Hondo was upgraded to a very intense tropical cyclone with winds of 220km/h (140mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 906hPa (mbar). However, after reanalysis, it was found that Hondo never intensified beyond intense tropical cyclone status and winds peaked at 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar).|$|E

The observations are used to investigate apsects of the relationship between magnetotail dynamics and the separate <b>intensifications</b> of a multiple onset substorm inferred from ground-based data. It is proposed that the signatures associated with individual substorm <b>intensifications</b> are localized in the dawn-to-dusk extent even at remote locations in the magnetotail, just as they are in the ionosphere, and that the tail disturbances associated with successive substorm <b>intensifications</b> step across the tail towards the dusk flank...|$|R

40|$|During a 9 -hour period {{following}} a storm-sudden commencement, six spacecraft near geosynchronous orbit, {{one over the}} pole, and three in the mgnetotail, monitored a complex sequence of magnetospheric variations. Magnetic field compressions associated with the sudden commencement were seen first by the near-earth spacecraft and subsequently by the three down-tail spacecraft with increasing time delays that {{were consistent with the}} tailward movement of an interplanetary-shock-associated pressure enhancement. Ground magnetograms and synchronous orbit data are used to identify 7 substorm <b>intensifications</b> during this geomagnetically active period. Six of these <b>intensifications</b> are clearly associated with tail lobe field decreases about 18 R sub E behind the earth. Four of these <b>intensifications</b> are followed by both Bz field increases in the tail lobes at about 18 and about 30 R sub E and by the subsequent observation of rapidly flowing plasma sheet plasma at ISEE 3 about 110 R sub E down the tail. During two substorms where DE 1 was optically observing the auroral oval, the area of the polar cap was observed to decrease as the tail lobe field decreased at 18 R sub E. All these observations are consistent with the substorm associated release of a plasmoid at a neutral line near 20 R sub E...|$|R
5|$|Between September26 and 27, {{the storm}} {{continued}} to slow while turning northwestward. Its wind field became asymmetric {{during the afternoon}} of September26, with hurricane-force winds present only in the eastern side.

5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of August1, a strong central dense overcast, an area of high, thick clouds, developed over the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout the next day, the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense overcast, leading to further strengthening. Operationally, Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August2; however, in post-storm analysis, the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid <b>intensification</b> took place. Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific, Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid <b>intensification</b> stage.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that intense and {{frequent}} auroral-zone disturbances, which are often attributed to substorms, occur during magnetic storms. We examine observations during the January 10, 1997 main phase and find that observed auroral-zone activity was dominated by a combination of global auroral and current enhancements, which are a direct response to solar wind dynamic pressure enhancements, and poleward boundary <b>intensifications,</b> which are localized in longitude and have an auroral signature that moves equatorward from the magnetic separatrix. Poleward and azimuthally expanding regions of auroral activity which accompany substorms are found to contribute significantly less to the observed activity.

40|$|Although the {{large-scale}} auroral oval {{has been well}} examined, what controls the occurrence of meso-scale enhanced auroras remains ambiguous. The answer is critical for forecasting ionospheric scintillation and remote-sensing magnetospheric disturbances. One important meso-scale auroral enhancement is poleward boundary <b>intensifications</b> (PBIs), which are <b>intensifications</b> along the poleward boundary of the nightside auroral oval and are produced by magnetic reconnection, a fundamental energy conversion process in the magnetosphere. This thesis is dedicated to understand when and where PBIs and the associated magnetotail reconnection occur, spontaneously or driven by external forcing, based on coordinated observations of all-sky imagers (ASIs) and radars. We found that the occurrence of PBIs is consistently accompanied with narrow and fast flows near the auroral poleward boundary in the polar cap. They occur simultaneously with or 1 – 2 [*]min before PBIs near the PBI longitude, and direct equatorward toward the auroral poleward boundary. They have a duration and width {{comparable to those of}} PBIs. Although the prior flow evolution could not be obtained based on the limited radar field-of-view, a polar cap ASI can substantially expand our observing area by enabling flow tracing using airglow patches and polar cap arcs. It shows that deep in the polar cap, localized fast flows typically propagate at ~ 600 m/s, persist tens of minutes to hours, and are of a few hundred km width. They appear as channels of flow enhancements that are elongated in the noon-midnight meridian, and significantly contribute to magnetic flux convection across the polar cap. The mosaic ASI images further show that as these fast flow propagate equatorward from the magnetic pole and impinge on the nightside auroral poleward boundary, they are followed by <b>intensifications</b> within the auroral oval that are spatially connected to them and occur within a few minutes and <~ 10 ? longitudes. Such <b>intensifications</b> are major disturbances that do not occur until the impingement of polar cap flows, suggesting the <b>intensifications</b> to be triggered by these flows. Our results suggest that locally enhanced nightside auroras, and the associated magnetic reconnection, can be preceded by, and developed around, localized flow enhancements arriving at the auroral poleward boundary from the polar cap. This preceding signature in the polar cap is essential to understand the development of magnetotail reconnection, and gives the potential of forecasting the specific time and location of disturbances in the magnetosphere and ionosphere. The existence and importance of such polar cap precursor were not recognized in the past {{due to the lack of}} coordinated radar and ASI observations, as well as broadly covered mosaic from an ASI array...|$|R

30|$|Taken together, {{the results}} of maps (i-vi) {{analysis}} show that the dynamics of high-latitude flow channels {{during one of the}} multiple auroral <b>intensifications</b> was similar to that observed during isolated substorms (Zou et al. 2009).
