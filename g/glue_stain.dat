Tannins are also used for heavy metal removal in surface water treatment. Tannins play very important role in dyeing with natural dyes by improving the affinity of fibres towards different dyes. By mixing with different natural dyes it gives different shades like yellow, brown, grey and black. Acacia catechu (Cutch), Terminalia chebula (Harda), Punica granatum (Pomegranate/Anar), Quercus infectoria (Gallnut), are plant sources for tannins [3, 41, 65, 68, 69].|$|R

40|$|Wood is {{the most}} ancient {{material}} used by mankind for furniture making. During the ages it was almost completely replaced by new materials like metal, plywood, chipboard, plastic, MDF and some others. But nowadays, as the world has become too filled with different chemicals and harmful substances, people have started to worry about ecological and human-friendly materials. Thus wood has received its "re-birth". The market share of solid wood glued board furniture is increasing every year. However if we {{take a close look}} at the Russian furniture market, we will notice that this process is extremely slow in our country because of local stereotypes regarding common furniture appearance which can be clearly seen through IKEA example. IKEA is one of the largest wood producers on the Russian furniture market. Four years ago IKEA opened its first store in Russia. Yet the sales share for solid wood furniture is still much lower than that in Europe. That is why there is a huge need for solid wood furniture products specifically adapted to the Russian market. The main goal of this thesis is to design a factory capable of producing a furniture set made of solid wood which could fit in the IKEA range in Russia. The choice of overall appearance and construction is based on the Russian market research. All technological and environmental requirements are based on internal IKEA specifications. The designed furniture production viability was checked from technological and economical points of view. The well-known “wooden glued board” production system was chosen because it gives an opportunity to increase the yield. The idea is that sawn goods are splitted into planed lamellas in 4 -side molder and glued together in pressing machine to get the glued board which can be processed further like a usual board material like chipboard or MDF. Then the CNC router center used to get the non-linear shape of the edges. For finishing the UV-curing line was chosen as the system which can give us the most cheap surface treatment layer. The exact equipment models were chosen according to the needed capacities on the each stage of production process. The whole line is able to produce 45000 pieces of universal furniture unit per year in case of three shifts which corresponds to ~ 2600 m 3 of highly treated furniture. The raw materials needs were calculated using original Russian method which allows taking into account the exact amounts of all wastes on each stage of technological process. The annual sawn goods need was estimated to ~ 6000 m 3. Also all additional need like <b>glue,</b> <b>stains,</b> sealer, lacquer and sanding paper were calculated in purpose to get the real direct production costs. The total factory layout including all additional areas was made based on Russian legislation and hygienic norms. It was needed to calculate annual electricity, water and heat assumption. The final stage of the thesis is the total economical calculation of all costs to carry out during the production of annual program. Taking into calculation all direct and indirect production costs the profitability became 36, 5 % which is really high figure for Russian market. The IRR of 11, 3 % and payback time of 4, 6 years is also suitable for Russia, so the project appears to be vital and profitable. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R

In the present study immunoprecipitation of the 50 -kDa polypeptide from bovine brain cytosol with a specific monoclonal antibody revealed coprecipitating components of 150, 135, 62, and 45 kDa, which were completely distinct from the polypeptides immunoprecipitated using an antibody to the well established 74 -kDa cytoplasmic dynein subunit. The 150 - and 135 -kDa polypeptides reacted with an antibody to p 150 Glued, the mammalian homologue of the Drosophila Glued gene. N-terminal microsequencing of tryptic peptides of the major 45 -kDa component of the complex revealed {{it to be the}} alpha-isoform of centractin, a novel form of actin.

Being deployed originally for biosynthesis or biodegradation, enzymes have also shown great potentials {{for development of}} functional materials. One particular challenge in deriving enzyme-based functional materials is the control of protein-material interactions for best compatibility, activity and stability. The main objectives {{of this study are}} to (1) investigate the incorporation of industrial enzymes into general purpose materials like hydrophobic coatings and hydrophilic thin films; (2) probe the fundamental mechanisms that control enzyme functionality and stability; and (3) explore novel applications in the realm of enzyme based functional materials, especially self-cleaning coatings. One major effort was dedicated to the development of enzyme-functionalized polyurethane coatings to afford a self-cleaning functionality with a reasonable lifetime. To act effectively against surface <b>gluing</b> organic <b>stains,</b> the applicability and suitability of hydrolytic enzymes like amylase, protease and lipase have been evaluated. Enzymes were incorporated into polymeric coatings in a manner to ensure high activity and stability. In the final cured coatings, a small portion of enzyme molecules is partially exposed to the outer surface, enabling the desired self-cleaning functionality; whereas the majority of the enzyme is entrapped in the interior, forming a reservoir for the gradual replenishment. This special way of enzyme immobilization enabled a high surface activity that is concomitantly accompanied by longevity as needed in practical applications. The enzyme was entrapped into coatings through direct dispersion of an aqueous enzyme solution into a hydrophobic prepolymer mixture. Enzyme loadings of up to 5 % wt (dry mass) have been tested. The polymer-enzyme mixture was applied as a coating solution and subsequently cured for 30 min at 83 oC, resulting in bioactive coatings with high surface enzyme activity (~ 2. 0 unit/cm 2 for á-amylase and ~ 0. 18 unit/cm 2 for protease). In the fully cured coatings the enzymes were entrapped uniformly in form of microspherical particles. Such coatings also demonstrated very good activities against real-life stains in absence of bulk water, including food stains, smashed insects and fingerprints. In comparison to enzyme-free coatings, the rate of stain removal of was accelerated by a factor up to five orders of magnitude. It was further demonstrated that self-cleaning coatings can be reused for more than 50 times. Practical applications of such bioactive coatings also require outstanding durability against weathering and other detrimental effects. Therefore, two predominant weathering factors, heat and water, which tend to inactivate enzymes easily were investigated. Coated enzymes revealed a good thermal stability against both factor and showed half lifetimes in the order of years. However, contacting the surface exposed enzyme with water resulted in a decay of the self-cleaning functionality as part of the enzyme was released from the surface. Strategies for improved enzyme retention were developed by alternating the enzyme distribution and improving crosslinking between enzyme and polymer. Several preparation parameters including pH of the enzyme solution, the post-addition of surfactant and NCO/OH ratio were found effective in manipulating the degree of enzyme-polymer crosslinking, enzyme activity, enzyme particle size and distribution. For instance, an improvement of enzyme retention by a factor of 85 % was achieved for á-amylase coating when the NCO/OH ratio was increased from 1. 2 to 2. 4. A parallel study was performed to explore the advantages and limitations of enzyme entrapment into hydrophilic films. A hydrophilic matrix allows monophasic enzyme entrapment as in contrast to the two-phase PU coating system. Hydrogels made of polyacrylamide are known for being fully compatible with enzymes. The polymeric network is swollen in the water and becomes a rigid glass upon drying. It was assumed that final dry glassy PAG matrix had been in geometrical congruence with the structure of enzyme molecules entrapped inside, providing effective spatial confinement for the enzyme molecules. PAG with enzyme loadings of up to 2 %, were prepared and examined in this study. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterization confirmed the dimensions of the pores of the annealed gels in the range tens of nanometers, comparable to the dimension of single protein molecules. PAG-enzyme composite showed tremendously improved enzyme stabilities, against thermal or solvent inactivation. The most dramatic stabilization was observed for PAG-glucose oxidase (GOx) composite. The half-life time for PAG-entrapped GOx at 75 oC in pure ethanol was about half year, more than 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of it native counterpart, a result not achieved by another types of enzyme stabilization measures. Marked stability was further observed on the PAG-entrapped á-chymotrypsin implying such a spatial confinement method could be general to all the proteins. In summary, this work proved the feasibility of the concept of enzyme-based self-cleaning coatings. It also reveals a generic approach for preparation of a wide array of biofunctional smart coatings. We further discovered that spatial confinement of enzymes into hydrophilic polymer matrix can substantially stabilize enzymes against thermal and chemical inactivation...|$|R
