25|$|Merezhkovsky's major {{literary}} debut {{came with}} the publication of Poems (1883–1888). It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with Protopop Avvacum, a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, {{the group}} {{sets out to}} {{retrieve}} the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley, which Everett earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of receiving pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it turns out it wasn't her ring, and she doesn't <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> where she put it.|$|E
25|$|As {{far back}} as the 1960s, the footballing rivalry between England and Germany has been {{considered}} mainly an English phenomenon; this has been observed by several commentators of both English and German origin. In June 2009, British comedian Stephen Fry stated on the BBC show QI that, unlike the English, German football fans do not care about their team's loss at the 1966 World Cup final and may not <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> that they had made it that far. Instead, German fans consider their rivalry with the Netherlands to be their traditional footballing rivalry and care more about the matches against them, such as the 1974 FIFA World Cup final.|$|E

500|$|Age of Empires allows {{players to}} choose to play either along specialized, story-backed {{conditions}} or as individual battles against the AI (and other players). Choosing to battle against the AI – rather than following the storyline – allows the AI to adapt to players' strategies and <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> which games it won and lost. The AI eventually overcomes players' strategies and easily destroys their villages after several games. For instance, in Age of Empires III, this {{is referred to as}} playing a [...] "Skirmish." [...] However Age of Empires III allows players to refine their strategies further against the AI by [...] "Building a Deck," [...] which allows players to replace [...] "Home City" [...] shipments with improved alternatives.|$|E

[...] To achieve this, Dickinson insists on gaining eye contact with audience members and urges them to join in with the phrase [...] "scream for me" [...] (followed by the concert's location).

500|$|Radiohead {{tried to}} work quickly and spontaneously, {{avoiding}} procrastination and over-analysis. Yorke was forced to write lyrics differently, as {{he did not have}} time to rewrite them in the studio; for some songs, he returned to the method of cutting up words and arranging them randomly he had employed for Kid A and Amnesiac. Greenwood said: [...] "We didn't really have time to be stressed about what we did.

In their attempt to create powerful soldiers, NESTS kidnapped K′ and injected him with DNA from the fighter Kyo Kusanagi, giving him his pyrokinetic skills. Unlike Kyo, K' is only able to create fire from his right hand, which he is sometimes unable to control. He wears a glove to protect his body from being burned accidentally. During the program, NESTS repressed K′s memories, and he was made {{to believe that he}} was Krizalid's clone. While in NESTS, K′ became enraged with how the organization played with human lives, and escaped to recover his memories. As he could not <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> his name, K' decided to destroy NESTS in order to stop their experiments.

It is a running gag throughout the series that Edmund's father cannot <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> his name. However, despite his mostly dismissive attitude toward his second son, the series' finale makes it clear that the King loves Edmund as much as Harry: on Edmund's deathbed, the King does his best to console him and has the entire court drink a toast in his honour. In the third episode, when Edmund becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury and helps his father to secure some land before the church, the King acknowledges Edmund as his son, embraces him and even mentions to the Queen that he has [...] "turned out well".|$|E

The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> the last time I saw something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E

[...] Jack Valenti, then {{president and chief executive of}} the Motion Picture Association of America, denounced Stone's film in a seven-page statement. He wrote, [...] "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, in which Adolf Hitler was depicted as a newborn God. Both JFK and Triumph of the Will are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax. Mr. Stone and Leni Riefenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction."

500|$|American Idiot is {{a concept}} album that {{describes}} {{the story of a}} central character named Jesus of Suburbia, an anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. It is written {{from the perspective of a}} lower-middle-class suburban American teen, raised on a diet of [...] "soda pop and Ritalin." [...] Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. The second character introduced in the story is St. Jimmy, a [...] "swaggering punk rock freedom fighter par excellence." [...] Whatsername, [...] "a 'Mother Revolution' figure," [...] is introduced as a nemesis of St. Jimmy in the song [...] "She's a Rebel". The album's story is largely indeterminate, as the group was unsure of where to lead the plot's third quarter. In this sense, Armstrong decided to leave the ending up to the listeners' imagination. The two secondary characters exemplify the record's main theme—"rage versus love"—in that while St. Jimmy is driven by [...] "rebellion and self-destruction," [...] Whatsername is focused on [...] "following your beliefs and ethics." [...] Jesus of Suburbia eventually decides to follow the latter, resulting in the figurative suicide of St. Jimmy, which is revealed to be a facet of his personality. In the album's final song, Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well, to the point in which he can't <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> her name.|$|E

In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not <b>even</b> <b>remember</b> his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E
