25|$|Focusing on {{providing}} {{a more realistic}} driving experience, the studio revamped its damage model, adding new elements, such as a wear and tear system, which means car parts lose performance through general use, and a suspension damage system. It also introduced a new team radio philosophy in which the player itself can request information on car damage, gaps, rival position and teammate position. The player can also ask its engineer to instruct their teammates to attack, defend or hold their position. By popular demand, Codemasters retained its unique Flashback feature from previous Grid installments with which the players can rewind their races a few seconds and resume it earlier, if needed. Cockpit view also made a return, after being absent, very much {{to the dismay of}} the core fanbase, in Grid 2. Aside from such elements, the developers generally decided to strip the game <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> away with everything that stood in the way of raw racing. These features included Grid 2’s narrator-driven career mode and superfluous menus. The latter received a more simplistic look.|$|E
25|$|The game uses a {{class-based}} character system, {{similar to}} the system found in Pandemic's previous game Star Wars: Battlefront. There are four playable classes. Warriors are a melee combat unit which focus on swordsmanship. Unlike the other classes, whose special attacks recharge over time, warriors can only gain energy by defeating enemies, which allows them to unleash more powerful attacks with a flaming sword, such as spinning to hit every adjacent enemy. They are the only class that can block or perform counterattacks with special moves. The warrior also has a throwing axe as a secondary, medium ranged weapon. Archers are better suited for long range combat and are equipped with a bow and arrow. Different types of arrows can be equipped: fire arrows, which can knock down enemies and deal explosive damage; poison arrows, which slow enemies <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> damage over time, {{and the ability to}} fire a volley of three normal arrows at multiple enemies at once. They also have a kick for use in close-quarters, which knocks back the enemy. They can also hit concealed Scouts with the multiple arrow skill. A headshot will allow the archer to kill most enemies in a single hit.|$|E

[...] He suggested that he should appear again, but that [...] "... should do it properly, and talk about the issues of the day", and added: [...] "That audience was taken from a city that is no longer British... That was not my country any more. Why not come <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it in Thurrock, do it in Stoke, do it in Burnley? Do it somewhere where there are still significant numbers of English and British people, and they haven't been ethnically cleansed from their own country." ...|$|E

500|$|On joining Walsall as a 19-year-old, Davis {{described}} himself as [...] "the type of player who likes to break things <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> what I call the 'nitty-gritty'. I like to get stuck in and work hard". He is primarily a defensive midfielder, reportedly priding himself on [...] "ball-winning ground-covering defensive midfield work"; his major contribution to his team comes from [...] "flying around midfield winning the ball and disrupting the opposition". Lee Clark suggested he looks best when using his power and strength and keeping {{his use of the}} ball simple. Dean Saunders mentioned his [...] "winning mentality"; according to the Birmingham Mail Brian Dick, [...] "when Blues are down no-one leads by example quite as much as Davis".|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} few months after its installation, the PDP-1 {{programming}} community at MIT focused on simpler programs to work out how to create software for the computer. The community had heard of the Spacewar concept, however, and understood that Russell would spearhead the development of it. [...] When members of the community began to feel the time was right to start work on the game, Russell, nicknamed [...] "Slug" [...] because of his tendency to procrastinate, began providing various excuses as to why he could not start programming the game. One of these was the lack of a trigonometric function routine needed to calculate the trajectories of the spacecraft. This prompted Alan Kotok of TMRC to call DEC, who informed him that they had such a routine already written. Kotok drove to DEC to pick up a tape containing the code, slammed it down in front of Russell, and asked what other excuses he had. Russell, later explaining that [...] "I looked around and I didn't find an excuse, so I had to settle <b>down</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> some figuring," [...] started writing the code in December 1961. The game was developed to meet three precepts Russell, Graetz, and Wiitanen had developed for creating a program that functioned equally well as an entertainment experience for the players and as a demonstration for spectators: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. It took Russell, with assistance from the other programmers—including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner (but not Wiitanen, who had been called up by the United States Army Reserve)—about 200 man-hours to write the first version of Spacewar, around six weeks to develop the basic game.|$|E

Readers are {{intended}} to recognize that although Satan and God's power could ultimately achieve similar things, it {{is the source of}} Satan's power that drives Jesus from sin.|$|E
2500|$|A {{severely}} burned body {{found inside}} Spengler's house {{is believed to}} be Spengler's 67-year-old sister Cheryl, with whom he was living. The shooting was suspected to have followed an argument between Spengler and Cheryl. A two-to-three-page typewritten letter written by Spengler was found at the scene. It reflected Spengler's intent to ambush first responders, but offered no motive for the shooting. In it, he wrote, [...] "I still have to get ready to see how much of the neighborhood I can burn <b>down,</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> what I like doing best, killing people." ...|$|E

Quentin Tarantino also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in [...] and [...] [...] "Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices," [...] said Bogdanovich.
