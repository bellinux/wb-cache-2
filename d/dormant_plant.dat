Plants exposed to short days for 28 d formed a terminal bud but were not dormant, whereas exposure to short days for 49 d induced bud dormancy. BSP accumulated in bark of plants exposed to both SD treatments. The level of BSP declined rapidly when nondormant plants were returned to long days. BSP levels did not decline in <b>dormant</b> <b>plants</b> that were exposed to long-day (LD) conditions.

HWT is a robust and reliable technique used to destroy life stages of pests (insects, nematodes) and to inactivate pathogens (phytoplasma, bacteria, fungi) in <b>dormant</b> <b>plant</b> propagation materials (grapevine and other crops).

40|$|Non-freezing low {{temperature}} (LT) {{is the main}} factor controlling cold acclimation and dormancy release of woody plants {{in the cold and}} temperate regions. Through evolution many tree species have developed different ecotypes, which are closely adapted to the local climatic conditions. In order to elucidate the physiological basis of climatic adaptation involved in LT sensing in the northern tree species, we investigated responses of the northern and southern ecotypes of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) to a range of decreasing temperatures. Development of freezing tolerance, determined by the electrolyte leakage, and bud dormancy release were monitored. A range of decreasing temperatures triggered cold acclimation and development of freezing tolerance in actively growing plants, and enhanced freezing tolerance and released bud dormancy in the <b>dormant</b> <b>plants</b> in both ecotypes tested. However, there were significant ecotypic differences in LT-induced cold acclimation and bud dormancy release. The northern ecotype was more responsive to a range of decreasing temperatures than the southern ecotype, resulting in more rapid cold acclimation and development of freezing tolerance in actively growing plants, and earlier enhancement of freezing tolerance and bud dormancy release in the <b>dormant</b> <b>plants.</b> Development of freezing tolerance and dormancy release induced by LT was accompanied by changes in ABA levels. Alterations in ABA levels paralleled with development of freezing tolerance and preceded bud dormancy release in both ecotypes tested, but these alterations in ABA levels were ecotype-dependent, the northern ecotype reacting more strongly to LT.

Encounter histories such as 0 VF 00 F 000 may then occur where the meaning of zeroes becomes ambiguous. A zero can either mean a dead or a <b>dormant</b> <b>plant.</b> Various ad hoc methods in wide use among plant ecologists have made strong assumptions about when a zero should be equated to a dormant individual. These methods have never been compared among each other. In our talk and in Kéry et al. (submitted), we show that these ad hoc estimators provide spurious estimates of survival and should not be used. In contrast, if detection probabilities for aboveground plants are known or can be estimated, capturerecapture(CR) models can be used to estimate probabilities of survival and state–transitions and the fraction of the population that is dormant. We have used this approach in two studies of terrestrial orchids, Cleistes bifaria (Kéry et al., submitted) and Cypripedium reginae (Kéry & Gregg, submitted) in West Virginia, U. S. A. For Cleistes, our data comprised one population with a total of 620 marked ramets over 10 years, and for Cypripedium, two populations with 98 and 258 marked ramets over 11 years. We chose the ramet (= single stem or shoot) as the demographic unit of our study since there was no way distinguishing among genets (genet = genetical individual, i. e., the "individual" that animal ecologists are mostly concerned with). This will introduce some non–independence into the data, which can nevertheless be dealt with easily by correcting variances for overdispersion. Using ramets instead of genets has the further advantage that individuals can be assigned to a state such as flowering or vegetative in an unambiguous manner. This is not possible when genets are the demographic units. In all three populations, auxiliary data was available to show that detection probability of aboveground plants was > 0. 995. We fitted multistate models in program MARK by specifying three states (D, V, F), even though the dormant state D does not occur in the encounter histories. Detection probability is fixed at 1 for the vegetative (V) and the flowering state (F) and at zero for the dormant state (D). Rates of survival and of state transitions as well as slopes of covariate relationships can be estimated and LRT or the AIC machinery be used to select among models. To estimate the fraction of the population in the unobservable dormant state, the encounter histories are collapsed to 0 (plant not observed aboveground) and 1 (plant observed aboveground). The Cormack–Jolly–Seber model without constraints on detection probability is used to estimate detection probability, the complement of which is the estimated fraction of the population in the dormant state. Parameter identifiability is an important issue in multi state models. We used the Catchpole–Morgan–Freeman approach to determine which parameters are estimable in principle in our multi state models. Most of 15 tested models were indeed estimable with the notable exception of the most general model, which has fully interactive state- and time-dependent survival and state transition rates. This model would become identifiable if at least some plants would be excavated in years when they do not show up aboveground. Our analyses for three analyzed populations of Cleistes and Cypripedium yielded annual ramet survival rates ranging from 0. 86 – 0. 96. Estimates of the average fraction dormant ranged from 0. 02 – 0. 30, but with up to half a population in the dormant state in some years. Ultrastructural modeling enables interesting hypotheses to be tested about the relationships of demographic rates with climatic covariates for instance. Such covariate modeling makes the CR approach particularly interesting for evolutionary–ecological questions about, e. g., the adaptive significance of the dormant state. Previous and foreseeable future applications of CR in plant ecology Since the paper by Alexander et al. (1997), it has become increasingly clear that CR models may be useful for demographic analysis of plant populations. In the future, we are likely to see increasing use of these methods that were originally developed for animal populations. Here is a summary about all previous applications that I have come across. I am grateful if readers point out to me any titles that I may have missed. If a reliable way to mark seeds can be devised, CR might indeed provide the analysis tool for tackling one of the ultimate frontiers in plant population ecology: the dynamics of the seed bank. Indeed, the first ever application of CR to plants that I have come across (Naylor, 1972) used a fluorescent dye to mark seeds and a Lincoln–Peterson–type estimator to estimate the seed bank size in an agricultural weed. The application of CR to plants with dormancy has been treated by hefferson et al. (2001, 2003), Kéry et al. (submitted) and Kéry & Gregg (submitted). Population size, and survival rates of plants whose aboveground states are easily overlooked have been estimated for an elusive prairie plant (Alexander et al., 1997; Slade et al., 2003) and for a tropical savannah tree (Lahoreau et al., 2003). For plot–based plant demographic studies, we have shown previously that (not surprisingly) different life–states may have different detection probabilities, and that this may seriously bias inference from population modelling (Kéry & Gregg, 2003). It is somewhat astonishing that there still appear to be no applications of CR to the analysis of plant populations and communities. For instance, species richness, patch occupancy, population extinction rates, and species turnover in communities are all still based on adding up the raw data, even though the animal literature has plenty of papers showing more adequate ways of estimating these quantities (e. g., Boulinier et al., 1998; Nichols et al., 1998). I have submitted a note (Kéry, submitted) describing the use of the Cormack–Jolly–Seber model to estimate extinction probabilities for plant populations in a manner exactly analogous to patch occupancy models (MacKenzie et al., 2002, 2003). It is perhaps in plant community ecology where we will see most future applications of CR...|$|E

The effect of HWT on the performance of <b>dormant</b> <b>plants</b> in a four-growing seasons study was investigated. Methods and Results: The effect of HWT at 53 °C for 30 min on shoot mass, yield parameters and composition of must in <b>dormant</b> grafted <b>plants</b> (Tempranillo cultivar grafted onto 110 Richter rootstock) was evaluated. Eight bundles of 20 grafted plants were assigned to HWT, and eight additional bundles of 20 untreated grafted plants were prepared as a control (non-HWT). <b>Dormant</b> grafted <b>plants</b> were immediately planted in two field sites in April 2007. Shoot fresh mass was evaluated during winter in four consecutive growing seasons. Yield parameters and must composition were evaluated in the third and fourth growing seasons. In general, there was no significant difference in shoot mass at pruning, yield parameters and must components between treatments, with the exception of the must total soluble solids and volumetric mass in the fourth growing season. Conclusions: The findings obtained in this study indicate that HWT at 53 °C for 30 min did not affect plant viability, yield parameters and the main components of must composition, and could be successfully used commercially. Significance of the Study: This study represents the first approach to investigate the long-term effect of HWT on plant development, yield and composition of must under field conditions.

Eight bundles of ten cuttings were treated for each factor combination, and eight additional bundles of ten untreated cuttings were prepared as controls (no HWT). <b>Dormant</b> grafted <b>plants</b> were immediately planted in two field sites in March 2010. The number of plants that emerged from dormancy was counted in July 2010. In January 2011, shoot length and fresh weight were evaluated. Although significant, the percentages of plants emerging from dormancy among treatments were relatively small. A significant reduction was observed in shoot length and weight for all treatments compared with the control, particularly in all variables for non-hydrated hot-water-treated cuttings kept in cold storage for 4 weeks immediately after HWT.

The particular areas of interest were the growth and development of the vegetative tillers and the reproductive culm. The main study was carried out at the Scotts Bluff Experimental Range in 1967. An individual blue grama plant is defined and illustrated. The growth and development of various morphological structures are discussed and presented in pictures. The total height of the plant was recorded over a collection period of twenty weeks. These data are presented graphically and with pictures. The critical temperatures for germination of caryopses, growth of established plants, and renewal of growth of winter <b>dormant</b> <b>plants</b> were established. A stoloniferous blue grama plant is described and illustrated. Advisor: Donald F. Burzlaf...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria-free {{cultures}} of Spirodela oligorrhiza {{continue to increase}} in frond number for 2 to 3 days after transfer to darkness. There is then no further increase in frond number for 3 to 4 weeks, although DNA, RNA and protein synthesis continue at decreased rates and starch accumulates in the plants. We refer to such `non-growing' plants in darkness as dormant. Adding kinetin to dormant Spirodela initiated increased DNA, RNA and protein synthesis within 1 h, although new fronds were not detected until 24 h after the addition of kinetin. The frond number then continued to increase. Starch accumulated in <b>dormant</b> <b>plants.</b> Accumulation of starch {{appeared to be a}} consequence of inhibition of growth rather than the converse. No evidence was obtained for a block in [14 C]glucose metabolism that might explain the lack of growth in darkness in the absence of kinetin. In darkness, more ribosomes were membrane-bound in dormant Spirodela than in Spirodela growing with kinetin. Similarities between the response of Spirodela to darkness, stringent control in bacteria and pleiotypic controls in animal cells are discussed. It is suggested that all three processes are ultimately controlled by specific protein kinases that are individually sensitive to different effectors...|$|R
40|$|This study quantifies {{the effect}} of {{dehydration}} during storage of bare root grape vines delivered from the nursery and planted in winter. In that period, plants {{are at risk of}} dehydration, but it has not been well studied [...] One-year-old dormant bench grafts of Vitis vinifera cv. 'Redglobe' on Freedom or Harmony rootstocks were exposed to a range of dehydration treatments to observe survival and growth of the vines after planting. Field-finished plants were harvested from nursery soil, and the roots of 25 plants were exposed to air for 0, 4, 8, 22, 32, 70, 96, 128, 192 or 262 h to simulate variable environmental conditions that plants suffer before planting. For each rootstock-time combination, the hydration status was determined gravimetrically on 5 plants and the remaining 20 were individually planted in containers for weekly evaluation of bud break and growth. Plant organs exhibited different dehydration kinetics. Roots and trunk (two-year-old wood) were the most appropriate organs to determine plant hydration status and later planting success, whereas one-year-old wood was highly variable. Hydration status of root and trunk during dormancy were significantly related to growth potential. <b>Dormant</b> <b>plants</b> grafted on Harmony tolerated dehydration better than plants grafted on Freedom.

40|$|Temperature plays a {{significant}} role in the annual cycling between growth and dormancy of the herbaceous perennial chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat.). After exposure to high summer temperatures, cool temperature triggers dormancy. The cessation of flowering and rosette formation by the cessation of elongation are characteristic of <b>dormant</b> <b>plants,</b> and can be stimulated by exogenous ethylene. Thus, the ethylene response pathway may be involved in temperature-induced dormancy of chrysanthemum. Transgenic chrysanthemums expressing a mutated ethylene receptor gene were used to assess this involvement. The transgenic lines showed reduced ethylene sensitivity: ethylene causes leaf yellowing in wild-type chrysanthemums, but leaves remained green in the transgenic lines. Extension growth and flowering of wild-type and transgenic lines varied between temperatures: at 20 °C, the transgenic lines showed the same stem elongation and flowering as the wild type; at cooler temperatures, the wild type formed rosettes with an inability to flower and entered dormancy, but some transgenic lines continued to elongate and flower. This supports the involvement of the ethylene response pathway in the temperature-induced dormancy of chrysanthemum. At the highest dosage of ethephon, an ethylene-releasing agent, wild-type plants formed rosettes with an inability to flower and became dormant, but one transgenic line did not. This confirms that dormancy is induced via the ethylene response pathway...|$|R

40|$|Seed {{dimorphism}} for dispersal characteristics {{is widespread}} and essentially found in annual plant species. Each individual of such species {{is able to}} produce two types of seeds : some adapted for dispersal and others with no obvious dispersal properties. The morphological position of these dimorphic seeds is usually constant within the plant architecture. Using a few samples, it is shown that seed dimorphism for dispersal {{is often associated with}} physiological dimorphism with regard to dormancy and growth characteristics : dispersed seeds have no dormancy while non dispersed seeds may be <b>dormant.</b> <b>Plants</b> grown from dispersed seeds are more vigourous and produce more seeds than plants grown from non dispersed seeds, when environmental conditions are favorable. On the other hand, plants grown from non dispersed seeds are stress-tolerant : they can produce some seeds in extreme conditions while the others cannot. The proportion of dispersed seeds produced by a plant is variable, depending on the species, the population, and the individual. For some species, it is the product of both environmental conditions and genetic background. Moreover, for self-compatible species, seed dimorphism may be associated with different selfing rates : the non dispersed seeds being more likely to be inbred. The evolutionary significance of dimorphism for dispersal, and its possible association with other aspects of dimorphism, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|To {{test for}} {{different}} stem reorientation strategies in leaning seedlings of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.), we inclined <b>dormant</b> <b>plants</b> at 0 °, 45 ° and 90 ° for 35 days in optimal growth conditions. Stem {{angle to the}} vertical was measured at regular intervals. After 22 and 35 days, bending tests were carried out to determine stem elasticity and stiffness. The quantity of compression wood (CW) formed was also measured. Results showed that after 24 h, the apices of leaning maritime pine stems had completely reoriented to the vertical, whereas no such primary tropic response was observed in loblolly pine. After 22 days, the significantly stiffer loblolly pines had begun straightening up from the stem base, but not maritime pine. After 35 days, the overall secondary reorientation process was more efficient in loblolly pine, with significantly more CW produced. In both species, CW had formed immediately on tilting stems, i. e. no early wood cells had formed. As maritime pine originates from a dry to semi-arid region, having less CW will mean that water uptake will be greater for the same xylem area compared to loblolly pine which possesses more CW. In establishing maritime pine seedlings, rapid apical orientation with regard to light and gravity will compensate for a slower straightening up mechanism in the more lignified parts of the stem. Therefore, juvenile needle exposure to patches of light will be maximised at all times. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
