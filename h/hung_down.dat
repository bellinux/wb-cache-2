25|$|There is {{a decided}} {{difference}} between {{the form of the}} modern pallium and that used in early Christian times, as portrayed in the Ravenna mosaics. The pallium of the sixth century was a long, moderately wide, white band of wool, ornamented at its extremity with a black or red cross, and finished off with tassels; it was draped around the neck, shoulders, and breast in such a manner that it formed a V in front, and the ends <b>hung</b> <b>down</b> from the left shoulder, one in front and one behind.|$|E

500|$|Contextually, the {{painting}} forms {{part of the}} Northern Renaissance, a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Renaissance induced {{a new kind of}} social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of {{the painting}}'s commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: [...] "During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which <b>hung</b> <b>down</b> from the tablet above them." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine was {{formally}} stripped of her title as queen and Anne was consequently crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey with a banquet afterwards. She {{was the last}} queen consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband. Unlike any other queen consort, Anne was crowned with St Edward's Crown, which had previously been used to crown only a monarch. Historian Alice Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne's pregnancy was visible by then and she was carrying the heir who was presumed to be male. On the previous day, Anne had taken part in an elaborate procession {{through the streets of}} London seated in a litter of [...] "white cloth of gold" [...] that rested on two palfreys clothed to the ground in white damask, while the barons of the Cinque Ports held a canopy of cloth of gold over her head. In accordance with tradition she wore white, and on her head a gold coronet beneath which her long dark hair <b>hung</b> <b>down</b> freely. The public's response to her appearance was lukewarm.|$|E

500|$|Roebling's {{bridge was}} {{supported}} by two limestone towers {{on each side of}} the gorge. [...] These Egyptian-style towers stood [...] tall on the American shore and [...] tall on the Canadian shore. [...] With their foundations [...] in the earth, the limestone structures could support up to 12millionpounds (5.4millionkg). [...] Four [...] thick main cables held up the bridge; two cables ran through iron saddles at the top of each tower. Each cable comprised 3,059 wires that were spun with Roebling's patented technique used in his Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct. [...] The ends of each cable were secured to [...] cast-iron plates sunk [...] deep in the bedrock. [...] Support lines <b>hung</b> <b>down</b> from iron clamps that encircled the main cables, and held up the decks. [...] Deep trussesnever before seen on a large suspension bridgelined the sides of the bridge, [...] and joined the two decks so that the structure looked like a cage.

500|$|The {{hurricane}} was {{the worst}} to strike Puerto Vallarta in 20years. 5,000 people were evacuated due to the hurricane with an addition 500 people on vacation becoming stranded inside their hotels. At least 600 evacuees sought refuge in a customs house, with an additional 1000 more evacuating to an airport terminal. More evacuees sought shelter in schools and the city hall. Four major rivers, including the Cuale River, which flows into the city, overflowed their banks, inundating the city along with several neighboring communities. Some areas of downtown Puerto Vallarta were submerged in depths of up to [...] due to the flooding. Telephone lines in the city were suspended and highways were rendered impassable by the floods. One person died during a house collapse {{in the city and}} two others drowned. Another source reported five deaths from house collapses, although the post-season report regards only three deaths in association with Lily in Mexico. The hurricane also passed over the nearby town of Barra de Navidad, where the residents took refuge inside the church of San Antonio. A local legend states that during the hurricane, the arms of Jesus Christ on the church's crucifix broke and <b>hung</b> <b>down.</b> The moment the arms broke, the hurricane's effects in the town stopped. The figure has since been known as the Christ of the Cyclone.|$|E

2500|$|Another early {{design was}} the [...] "Safety Hood and Smoke Protector" [...] invented by Garrett Morgan in 1912, and {{patented}} in 1914. [...] It {{was a simple}} device consisting of a cotton hood with two hoses which <b>hung</b> <b>down</b> to the floor, allowing the wearer to breathe the safer air found there. In addition, moist sponges were inserted {{at the end of}} the hoses in order to better filter the air. This was later modified to include its own air supply, leading to World War I era gas masks.|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, 1864, at the Battle of Dallas, {{there was}} at the center of Dawes's {{regiment}} a road leading to Lost Mountain which was left open. It was the evident to Dawes that the Confederates were going to force their way through this road and capture the Union supply trains. Dawes ascertained the Union line could break at this point, so he rushed to the road just as the Confederate advance was within about 50 feet of the Union line which began to waver. During the melee of battle Dawes was struck by a Mini√© ball on the left side of his lower jaw. It tore off his lower lip and chin so that it <b>hung</b> <b>down,</b> removing almost all his lower teeth and cut his tongue. As he was carried off Dawes managed to scribe in the dust on the carriage floor, [...] "Good for a 60 day furlough?" [...] Dawes subsequently was honorably discharged on October 31, 1864. After months of suffering from this wound, Dawes had his jaw reconstructed by Dr. George Blackman, and finally was restored to health. Despite the serious wound to his jaw, Dawes later went on to become a gifted public speaker.|$|E
