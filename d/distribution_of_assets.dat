40|$|Abstract. The {{widely used}} {{mean-variance}} criteria is actually not the optimal solution for asset allocation as the joint <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> re-turns are distributed in asymmetric ways {{rather than in}} the assumed normal distribution. It is a computationally challenging task to model the asymmetries and skewness <b>of</b> joint <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> returns in high dimensional space due to their own complicated structural complexities. This paper proposes to use a new form of canonical vine to produce the complex joint <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns. Then, we use the utility function of Constant Relative Risk Aversion to determine the optimal allocation <b>of</b> the <b>assets.</b> The importance <b>of</b> using the asymmetries infor-mation is assessed by comparing the performance of a portfolio based on the mean-variance criteria and that of a portfolio based on the new canonical vine. The results show that the investors using the forecasts of these asymmetries can make better portfolio decisions than those who ignore the asymmetries information...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a company}} nears insolvency, UK law {{provides}} four main procedures {{by which the}} company could potentially be rescued or wound down and its assets distributed. First, a company voluntary arrangement, allows the directors of a company {{to reach an agreement}} with creditors to potentially accept less repayment in the hope of avoiding a more costly administration or liquidation procedure and less in returns overall. However, only for small private companies is a statutory moratorium on debt collection by secured creditors available. Second, and since the Enterprise Act 2002 the preferred insolvency procedure, a company which is insolvent can go under administration. Here a qualified insolvency practitioner will replace the board of directors and is charged with a public duty of rescuing the company in the interests of all creditors, rescuing the business through a sale, getting a better result for creditors than immediate liquidation, or if nothing can be done effecting an orderly winding up and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets.</b> Third, administrative receivership is a procedure available for a fixed list of eight kinds of operation (such as public-private partnerships, utility projects and protected railway companies) where the insolvency practitioner is appointed by the holder of a floating charge that covers a company's whole assets. This stems from common law receivership where the insolvency practitioner's primary duty was owed to the creditor that appointed him. After the Insolvency Act 1986 it was increasingly viewed to be unacceptable that one creditor could manage a company when the interests of her creditor might conflict with those holding unsecured or other debts. Fourth, when none of these procedures is used, the business is wound up and a company's assets are to be broken up and sold off, a liquidator is appointed. All procedures must be overseen by a qualified insolvency practitioner. While liquidation remains the most frequent end for an insolvent company, UK law since the Cork Report has aimed to cultivate a [...] "rescue culture" [...] to save companies that could be viable.|$|E
2500|$|While UK {{insolvency}} law fixes a priority regime, and within each class of creditor <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> is proportional or pari passu, creditors can [...] "jump up" [...] the priority ladder through contracts. A contract for a security interest, which is traditionally conceptualised as creating a proprietary right that is enforceable against third parties, will generally allow the secured creditor to take assets away, free from competing claims of other creditors {{if the company}} cannot service its debts. This is the first and foremost function of a security interest: to elevate the creditor's place in the insolvency queue. A second function of security is to allow the creditor to trace the value in an asset through different people, should the property be wrongfully disposed of. Third, security assists independent, out-of-court enforcement for debt repayment (subject to the statutory moratorium on insolvency), and so provides a lever against which the secured lender can push for control's over the company's management. However, given the adverse distributional impact between creditors, the economic effect of secured lending is a negative externality against non-adjusting creditors. With an ostensibly private contract between a secured lender and a company, assets that {{would be available to}} other creditors are diminished without their consent and without them being privy to the bargain. Nevertheless, security interests are commonly argued to facilitate the raising of capital and hence economic development, which is argued to indirectly benefits all creditors. UK law has, so far, struck a compromise approach of enforcing all [...] "fixed" [...] or [...] "specific" [...] security interests, but only partially enforcing floating charges that cover a range of assets that a company trades with. The holders of a floating charge take subject to preferential creditors and a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for up to a maximum of £600,000 reserved for paying unsecured creditors. The law requires that details of most kinds of security interests are filed on the register of charges kept by Companies House. However this does not include transactions with the same effect of elevating creditors in the priority queue, such as a retention of title clause or a Quistclose trust.|$|E

40|$|We analyze two robust {{portfolio}} selection models, where a mean-variance investor considers possible {{deviations from}} a reference <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> returns, adopting a maxmin criterion.

In the second model, introducing an alternative measure <b>of</b> distance between <b>distributions,</b> we show that observational equivalence ceases to hold and the proportions between risky assets are altered.
