5|$|By now aged nearly 56, Kruger {{resolved}} that {{he could}} no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his <b>facial</b> <b>hair,</b> leaving the chinstrap beard he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called Kruger House, would be completed in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Levesque {{is a fan}} of {{the band}} Motörhead (which has {{performed}} three different entrance themes for Triple H over his career), and was good friends with lead singer Lemmy. To pay homage to both Lemmy and the band, Levesque wore Lemmy-inspired <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> during a large portion of his career. After Lemmy died on December 28, 2015, Levesque attended his funeral on January 9, 2016, where he spoke about the gift of sound that Lemmy and Motörhead have given to him and the friendship they had over the years.|$|E
5|$|Michelangelo painted {{onto the}} damp plaster using a wash {{technique}} to apply broad areas of colour, {{then as the}} surface became drier, he revisited these areas with a more linear approach, adding shade and detail {{with a variety of}} brushes. For some textured surfaces, such as <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> and woodgrain, he used a broad brush with bristles as sparse as a comb. He employed all the finest workshop methods and best innovations, combining them with a diversity of brushwork and breadth of skill far exceeding that of the meticulous Ghirlandaio.|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} {{that there is}} no valid basis on which to sustain the monotypic genus Bathycranium Strobl and concluded that Bathycranium should be recognised as a junior synonym of Syntormon Loew (new status). The species Syntormon bicolorellus Zetterstedt (new combination) falls into a natural grouping of Syntormon species with downcurved <b>facial</b> <b>hairs</b> in females. This species and S. luteicornis Parent are redescribed. Distinctions between Syntormonand Parasyntormon are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Different tamarin species vary {{considerably}} in appearance, ranging from nearly all black through mixtures of black, brown and white. Mustache-like <b>facial</b> <b>hairs</b> are typical for many species. Their body size ranges from 13 to 30 cm (plus a 25 to 44 cm tail) and they weigh from 220 to 900 g. Tamarins differ from marmosets primarily in having lower canine teeth that are clearly {{longer than the}} incisors. In captivity, tamarins can live for up to 18 years.|$|R
50|$|Since the mid-twentieth century, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) has {{encouraged}} {{men to be}} clean-shaven, particularly those that serve in ecclesiastical leadership positions. The church's encouragement of men's shaving has no theological basis, but stems from the general waning of <b>facial</b> <b>hair's</b> popularity in Western society {{during the twentieth century}} and its association with the hippie and drug culture aspects of the counterculture of the 1960s, and has not been a permanent rule.|$|R
5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their <b>facial</b> <b>hair.</b> Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose Everett Burnside (May 23, 1824– September 13, 1881) was an American soldier, {{railroad}} executive, inventor, industrialist, and politician from Rhode Island, {{serving as}} governor and a United States Senator. As a Union Army {{general in the}} American Civil War, he conducted successful campaigns in North Carolina and East Tennessee, as well as countering the raids of Confederate General John Hunt Morgan, but suffered disastrous defeats at the Battle of Fredericksburg and Battle of the Crater. His distinctive style of <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> became known as sideburns, derived from his last name. He {{was also the first}} president of the National Rifle Association.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexual}} {{behavior may}} be present in every culture, although {{the concept of a}} lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not. Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women's roles in each society, and each culture's definition of sex. Women in the Middle East have been historically segregated from men. In the 7th and 8th centuries, some extraordinary women dressed in male attire when gender roles were less strict, but the sexual roles that accompanied European women were not associated with Islamic women. The Caliphal court in Baghdad featured women who dressed as men, including false <b>facial</b> <b>hair,</b> but they competed with other women for the attentions of men.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and <b>facial</b> <b>hair,</b> and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E
25|$|<b>Facial</b> <b>hair</b> {{in males}} {{normally}} {{appears in a}} specific order during puberty: The first <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> to appear tends to grow {{at the corners of}} the upper lip, typically between 14 and 17 years of age. It then spreads to form a moustache over the entire upper lip. This is followed by the appearance of hair on {{the upper part of the}} cheeks, and the area under the lower lip. The hair eventually spreads to the sides and lower border of the chin, and the rest of the lower face to form a full beard. As with most human biological processes, this specific order may vary among some individuals. <b>Facial</b> <b>hair</b> is often present in late adolescence, around ages 17 and 18, but may not appear until significantly later. Some men do not develop full <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> for 10 years after puberty. <b>Facial</b> <b>hair</b> continues to get coarser, darker and thicker for another 2–4 years after puberty.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens affect {{existing}} <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> only slightly; {{patients may}} see slower growth and some reduction in density and coverage. Those {{who are less}} than a decade past puberty and/or whose race generally lacks a significant amount of <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> may have better results. Patients taking antiandrogens tend to have better results with electrolysis and laser hair removal than those who are not. In patients in their teens or early twenties, antiandrogens prevent new <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> from developing if testosterone levels are within the normal female range.|$|E

40|$|An {{essential}} {{issue in}} perception {{is how the}} location of an object is estimated from tactile signals {{in the context of}} self-generated changes in sensor configuration. Here, we review the pathways and dynamics of neuronal signals that encode touch in the rodent vibrissa sensorimotor system. Rodents rhythmically scan an array of long, <b>facial</b> <b>hairs</b> across a region of interest. Behavioral evidence shows that these animals maintain knowledge of the azimuthal position of their vibrissae. Electrophysiological measurements have identified a reafferent signal of the azimuth that is coded in normalized coordinates, broadcast throughout primary sensory cortex and provides strong modulation of signals of vibrissa contact. Efferent signals in motor cortex report the range of the scan. Collectively, these signals allow the rodent to form a percept of object location...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. People use orientation of their faces to convey rich, inter-personal information. For example, a person will direct his face to indicate who the intended target of the conversation is. Similarly in a conversation, face orientation is a non-verbal cue to listener when to switch role and start speaking, and a nod indicates that a person has understands, or agrees with, what is being said. Further more, face pose estimation {{plays an important role}} in human-computer interaction, virtual reality applications, human behaviour analysis, pose-independent face recognition, driver s vigilance assessment, gaze estimation, etc. Robust face recognition has been a focus of research in computer vision community for more than two decades. Although substantial research has been done and numerous methods have been proposed for face recognition, there remain challenges in this field. One of these is face recognition under varying poses and that is why face pose estimation is still an important research area. In computer vision, face pose estimation is the process of inferring the face orientation from digital imagery. It requires a serious of image processing steps to transform a pixel-based representation of a human face into a high-level concept of direction. An ideal face pose estimator should be invariant to a variety of image-changing factors such as camera distortion, lighting condition, skin colour, projective geometry, <b>facial</b> <b>hairs,</b> <b>facial</b> expressions, presence of accessories like glasses and hats, etc. Face pose estimation has been a focus of research for about two decades and numerous research contributions have been presented in this field. Face pose estimation techniques in literature have still some shortcomings and limitations in terms of accuracy, applicability to monocular images, being autonomous, identity and lighting variations, image resolution variations, range of face motion, computational expense, presence of <b>facial</b> <b>hairs,</b> presence of accessories like glasses and hats, etc. These shortcomings of existing face pose estimation techniques motivated the research work presented in this thesis. The main focus of this research is to design and develop novel face pose estimation algorithms that improve automatic face pose estimation in terms of processing time, computational expense, and invariance to different conditions...|$|R
25|$|Maintaining <b>facial</b> <b>hair</b> is more {{prevalent}} among African-American men {{than in other}} male populations in the U.S. In fact, the soul patch is so named because African-American men, particularly jazz musicians, popularized the style.
