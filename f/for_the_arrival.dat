5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of secession, Stone found himself in Washington writing his report on Sonora. After a dinner with his former commander Winfield Scott, Stone was requested to be Inspector General of the District of Columbia Militia at the rank of colonel as of January 1, 1861, and was thus reputed {{to be the first}} volunteer officer mustered into the Union Army before the Civil War. In this role, he secured the capital <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of President-elect Abraham Lincoln, and was personally responsible for security at the new president's inaugural.|$|E
5|$|D'Avalos, having waited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> a {{large body}} of landsknechts {{dispatched}} by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, set off from Asti towards Carignano. His total force included 12,500–18,000 infantry, of which perhaps 4,000 were arquebusiers or musketeers; he was only able to gather about 800–1,000 cavalry, of which less than 200 were gendarmes. D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry and the large number of arquebusiers in its ranks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the colonial}} period, in the 19th century, Kanaks were {{recruited}} or enslaved, to perform unfree labour {{in places such}} as Australia, California, Canada, Chile and Fiji (with the inter-Asian slave trade to India, Japan, South Africa, and what is now Malaysia). During the 3,000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands, they were unprepared <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of European viruses and bacteria. The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations, ranches and public works.|$|E

5|$|Festivities {{formally}} {{begin in}} the early evening with the raising of the ball at around 6:00p.m. ET. Party favors are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors. The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on New Year's Eve television specials which are broadcast from Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and rooms on the ground floor.|$|E

The Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities across Guerrero; by 21:00UTC (4p.m.CDT) on September28, a tropical storm watch was in effect for west of Lázaro Cárdenas to Punta San Telmo, a tropical storm warning for Acapulco to east of Tecpán de Galeana, and a hurricane warning for Tecpán de Galeana to Lázaro Cárdenas.

The 2000–01 edition also {{introduced a new}} primetime hour at 10:00p.m. ET/PT, which featured additional segments and music performances to lead into the main program. Clark felt positive about the program's expansion into primetime – believing that viewers, {{no matter where they}} were, wanted {{to know what was going}} on in Times Square on New Year's Eve. Clark was joined by Fox & Friends anchor Steve Doocy, and Michelle Madison as reporters in Times Square. Comedian Wayne Brady hosted concert segments in Hollywood, which included performances by Lonestar, Boyz II Men, 98 Degrees, Baha Men, and Third Eye Blind among others.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} topics of debate after 's rampage became the way police dealt with him, {{especially}} whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize the perpetrator, and whether the decision to wait <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>arrival</b> of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became more vocal after a cook, who managed to escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes {{leading up to the}} point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter.|$|E

Based on this, the result of spin measurement along any arbitrary direction for such an ensemble is predicted. Comment: 9 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
