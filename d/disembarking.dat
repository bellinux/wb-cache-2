5|$|<b>Disembarking</b> at Marseilles, the 12th Battalion was {{initially}} posted to the Fleurbaix sector of France.

5|$|Due to {{an unfortunate}} {{accident}} during the Spring of April 6, 2009, Makoto Yuki (Akira Ishida) {{arrives in the}} city late at night on a delayed train. Upon <b>disembarking</b> at midnight, a strange phenomenon grips the city—shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become encased in coffins. Unperturbed, Makoto casually {{makes his way to}} the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy (Akira Ishida) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow dormmates, Yukari Takeba (Megumi Toyoguchi) and Mitsuru Kirijo (Rie Tanaka), albeit the pair weary of his arrival at midnight.|$|E
5|$|In late May, Derrick {{discovered}} a German {{posing as a}} British tank officer and reported him to company headquarters; the man was immediately arrested as a spy.

5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 {{was thrown into}} a {{different}} light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a somewhat eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by <b>disembarking</b> at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|On 29 July 1915, Baker {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War.

5|$|Psionic combat {{from the}} {{original}} 1994 game is retained, but some gameplay features of the original have been removed or adapted. The time units system, the always-visible grid map and the inventory system of the original have been removed. The initial mission phase of <b>disembarking</b> from the transport has also been removed – missions now begin with troops deployed outside the craft. Unlike in the 1994 game, only one XCOM base exists, the location of which is chosen {{at the beginning of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently visiting Boston, and Rockland, Maine, Yancey {{participated in}} amphibious boat {{exercises}} at Provincetown, Massachusetts, {{before she got}} underway on 24 July for Davisville, Rhode Island. There, she loaded a Seabee unit and their equipment and headed eastward, bound for Rota, Spain. Offloading one Seabee unit and onloading another, Yancey then paused briefly at Gibraltar before touching at Lisbon on the return leg of her voyage to the United States. <b>Disembarking</b> the seabees and unloading their equipment at Davisville, Yancey headed back to Norfolk, reaching her homeport on 18 August 1962.|$|E

5|$|The Pilgrim {{settlers}} {{realized that}} they did not have a patent to settle in the region, so they signed the Mayflower Compact prior to <b>disembarking.</b> The Pilgrims explored various parts of Cape Cod, and eventually sought a suitable location for a permanent settlement to the westward in Cape Cod Bay. The Pilgrims eventually came across the sheltered waters of Plymouth Harbor on December 17. The appealing protected bay led to a site in the present-day Harbor District being chosen for the new settlement after three days of surveying.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Great War, Playford {{returned}} to South Australia with his battalion, <b>disembarking</b> at Outer Harbor, Adelaide on 2 July 1919. He had received no decorations, but had been commissioned from the ranks as an officer and was honourably discharged in October with the rank of lieutenant. Despite Playford's intellectual capability, he shunned the Government's offer of free university education for soldiers and {{returned to}} his orchard. He continued growing cherries on the property, and engaged in his hobby of horticulture. His involvement in various organisations and clubs was renewed.|$|E
5|$|Aestheticism was {{sufficiently}} in vogue to be caricatured by Gilbert and Sullivan in Patience (1881). Richard D'Oyly Carte, an English impresario, invited Wilde {{to make a}} lecture tour of North America, simultaneously priming the pump for the US tour of Patience and selling this most charming aesthete to the American public. Wilde journeyed on the SS Arizona, arriving 2 January 1882, and <b>disembarking</b> the following day. Originally planned to last four months, it continued {{for almost a year}} due to the commercial success. Wilde sought to transpose the beauty he saw in art into daily life. This was a practical as well as philosophical project: in Oxford he had surrounded himself with blue china and lilies, and now one of his lectures was on interior design.|$|E
