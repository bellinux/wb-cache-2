40|$|Brian Nault, Jan Nyrop, Alan TaylorInsect pest {{activity}} is often concentrated {{in certain areas}} within crops. Past {{research has suggested that}} onion maggot, Delia antiqua (Meigen) (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), adult activity and oviposition may be concentrated along onion field edges and may be affected by the surrounding landscape. To examine this further yellow sticky cards were placed at varying distances along transects extending from edges of commercial onion fields that either bordered or did not border woods. Sticky cards were collected and replaced weekly throughout the 2002 and 2003 growing season. To determine if oviposition by first-generation onion maggot is concentrated along wooded field edges, potted onion plants were placed along edges and in centers of onion fields that either bordered or did not border woods. Results indicate that adult activity of both sexes is concentrated along edges of onion fields during the first- and second-generations of onion maggot, especially next to woods in the first generation. These ?edge effects? lessened as the season progressed and were not present during the third-generation. Oviposition was uniform with respect to distance from the edge and type of bordering habitat. It may be possible to limit application of insecticides targeting adult onion maggot to wooded field edges during the first-generation or to deploy cultural controls here. A delay in planting the onion crop has been recommended, but never evaluated, as a method of reducing onion maggot damage. A delay in planting will also result in plants being younger at the time onion maggot becomes damaging, and plants may be more susceptible to onion maggot when they are young. In contrast, planting early might result in onions being older and inherently more tolerant of onion maggot damage. To determine how planting date affects levels of onion maggot damage, damage was evaluated in three sequentially-planted onion plots in a commercial onion field in 2003. Earliest plantings coincided with the earliest commercial sowing date and delayed plantings were made three and six weeks later. To determine how plant age affects resistance to onion maggot, damage to onions of different ages was evaluated in the laboratory after they were infested with varying densities of onion maggot eggs. Ovipositional preference by onion maggot for differently aged onions was also investigated in the lab to determine if a preference for early plantings could result in egg densities being greater on these plants in the <b>field.</b> <b>Onion</b> maggot damage was high in earliest plantings (37 %), lower but economically unacceptable in intermediate plantings (21 %), and lowest in late plantings (2 %). While the latest planting provided acceptable control, planting this late is not currently feasible for New York growers because they prefer to plant as early as possible to maximize size of onion bulbs at harvest. Onion maggot laid more eggs on older than younger plants in choice tests; therefore more eggs may be laid on early vs. delayed plantings in the field. Older plants were more resistant to maggot attack than younger plants at low egg densities, but not at high ones. This may explain why early plantings are more heavily damaged than delayed ones in the field; greater numbers of eggs may be laid on early plantings if they are preferred for oviposition, resulting in damage being higher in early than delayed plantings.

40|$|Two fungi {{that cause}} disease on onion in the Mid Murray region of South Australia were {{investigate}}d. These were Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, {{the cause of}} damping off of seedlings, wilting in the field, and basal rot in storage, and Phoma terrestris, which causes pink root. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate resistant or tolerant cultivars and crop rotations as possible management strategies for these diseases. Several Fusarium spp. were isolated from onion roots and bulbs in the <b>field,</b> <b>onion</b> bulbs in storage, soil, and onion seed. All isolates were tested for pathogenicity by various means, however, none caused disease and therefore could not be identified conclusively as F. oxysporum f. sp. cepae. As a result research on Fusarium was discontinued. Pink discolouration was detected on onion roots in commercial crops at Bowhill, South Australia, and isolation of P. terrestris from roots was attempted. Several published and novel methods were employed with variable success. Only one of the published methods yielded P. terrestris, but results were inconsistent. Two methods developed in this study permitted isolation of P. terrestris. In both cases, infested plant material was incubated on wheat straw agar (WSA), which turns pink in the presence of P. terrestris. One method involved soaking surface sterilised pink-pigmented wheat straw in solution, at approximately 24 ºC for 2 days, and then spreading 1 ml of the resulting suspension on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA) and incubating for a further 7 to 10 days. The second method involved dispensing warm sterile water into a plate of pink-pigmented WSA, agitating the plate, and spreading 1 ml aliquots onto APDA, and incubating for 7 to 10 days. One isolate of P. terrestris, shown to be pathogenic to onion was used in subsequent experiments. Several brown onion cultivars commonly grown in the Mid Murray region of South Australia, or marketed as tolerant to pink root, were examined for susceptibility to infection by P. terrestris. Seven cultivars were tested in vitro, and seedlings of eight cultivars were grown in a greenhouse for 4 months in soil naturally infested with P. terrestris. Selected cultivars were also evaluated in the field. Of the cultivars tested, none was significantly less susceptible to infection by P. terrestris than any other as indicated by pink pigment on WSA. Cereals such as wheat, oat and barley, as well as lucerne and canola, are grown in rotation with onion to provide ground cover, to minimise soil erosion and reduce inoculum of pathogens between onion crops. As the susceptibility of these rotation crops to P. terrestris was not known, several were tested in the field and in the greenhouse for their ability to act as hosts for P. terrestris. Likewise, the potential of weeds commonly found in onion fields to act as hosts of P. terrestris was investigated. Less P. terrestris was detected in the roots of plants of oat cultivars Marloo and Swan, as well as barley cultivars Galleon and Schooner than of most other crops tested and, thus, these cvs were considered less likely to act as hosts of P. terrestris. Weeds such as Brassica tournefortii, Portulaca oleracea and Oxalis pes-caprae collected from the field were infected by P. terrestris, whereas P. terrestris was not detected in the roots of Chenopodium album. In summary, new methods for isolation of P. terrestris were identified and may, with further development, aid in research on pink root. The onion cultivars tested in this study did not differ in susceptibility to pink root, but more cultivars should be tested. P. terrestris infected a range of other crops and weeds, and it is recommended that further work is conducted in this area to facilitate cultural management of onion crops to minimise build up of inoculum in the soil.

40|$|Diversity and {{colonization}} {{levels of}} naturally occurring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in onion roots were studied to compare organic and conventional farming {{systems in the}} Netherlands. In 2004, 20 <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> were sampled in a balanced survey between farming systems and between two regions, namely, Zeeland and Flevoland. In 2005, nine conventional and ten organic fields were additionally surveyed in Flevoland. AMF phylotypes were identified by rDNA sequencing. All plants were colonized, with 60 % for arbuscular colonization and 84 % for hyphal colonization as grand means. In Zeeland, onion roots from organic fields had higher fractional colonization levels than those from conventional <b>fields.</b> <b>Onion</b> yields in conventional farming were positively correlated with colonization level. Overall, 14 AMF phylotypes were identified. The number of phylotypes per field ranged from one to six. Two phylotypes associated with the Glomus mosseae-coronatum and the G. caledonium-geosporum species complexes were the most abundant, whereas other phylotypes were infrequently found. Organic and conventional farming systems had similar number of phylotypes per field and Shannon diversity indices. A few organic and conventional fields had larger number of phylotypes, including phylotypes associated with the genera Glomus-B, Archaeospora, and Paraglomus. This suggests that farming systems as such did not influence AMF diversity, but rather specific environmental conditions or agricultural practice...|$|R

40|$|Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman, is an {{important}} agricultural pest worldwide. T. tabaci damages crops by feeding on leaves and by transmitting plant pathogens, including Iris yellow spot virus (Bunyaviridae: Tospovirus) (IYSV). T. tabaci and IYSV are perennial problems for New York's onion industry, and {{research is needed to}} improve our understanding about T. tabaci biology, ecology and IYSV epidemiology for developing better management programs. This dissertation examines the patterns of T. tabaci dispersal and colonization of onion crops. Clear sticky card traps and trap-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to monitor the seasonal dispersal patterns of T. tabaci and IYSV. Most T. tabaci were captured below 2 m, while an average of 4 % were captured above 2 m. Viruliferous T. tabaci were captured with both card traps and UAVs, and proportions increased through the growing season each year. T. tabaci dispersal activity below 6 m was observed to effectively cease at nightfall, while highest densities were observed during the evening crepuscular period. T. tabaci dispersal activity and temperature tended to be positively correlated, while negative correlations were observed with wind speed. Commercial <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> were sampled in three onion growing regions to identify the effect of adjacent habitat on patterns of T. tabaci colonization of <b>onion</b> <b>fields.</b> Early-season densities of adult T. tabaci were not affected by adjacent habitat in 7 of 9 cases, while edge effects were observed in 4 of 9 cases. Late-season densities were greater in <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> adjacent to senescing <b>onion</b> <b>fields,</b> and densities in these fields were observed to decrease with increasing distance into the <b>onion</b> <b>fields.</b> These results strongly suggest that T. tabaci engage in both short- and longrange dispersal during the onion growing season, and that late-season dispersal likely contributes to the spread of IYSV. Abiotic factors such as daylight, diel cycle, temperature, wind speed and atmospheric pressure determine when T. tabaci flight is likely to occur. Early-season colonization of <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> occurs relatively uniformly in onion crops, while senescing crops are likely the source of adult T. tabaci colonizing adjacent, non-senescing fields late in the season, prior to harvest. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|R

40|$|Onion is {{the third}} most grown {{vegetable}} crop in São Paulo state, Brazil. Organic onion farming {{is expected to increase}} in the state due to the increasing demand. Pest management in organic onion farming is based on plant extracts with insecticide effects. However, the efficacy of such plant extracts has not been proved yet, and it was observed that they do negatively affect natural enemies. Plants surrounding <b>onion</b> <b>fields,</b> and that are attractive to natural enemies, may be a good option to farmers, since they may lead to increased diversity of arthropod species and, consequently, the natural control of pest populations. This study deals with the effect of marigold plants as a resource plant to natural enemies in <b>onion</b> <b>fields.</b> The experiment was set in a certified organic farm using marigold rows at a center of an <b>onion</b> <b>field.</b> Samples were taken from marigold and the onion plants 5 m (near) and 30 m (far) from the flowering strips. Higher numbers of arthropod pests were observed in onion plants 30 m from the marigold strip, while higher numbers of predators and parasitoids were found at 5 m distance. Species richness and Shannon's diversity index were higher at 5 m from marigold. Therefore, marigold rows next to <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> resulted in higher number of entomophagous species, potentially enhancing the natural control of onion pests. In the study field, marigold strips may be an alternative to crop sprays for organic control of onion pests...|$|R

40|$|Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), is a pest of onion {{crops and}} other Allium spp. {{worldwide}} {{and is the}} only known vector of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) (Bunyaviridae: Tospovirus), a yieldreducing pathogen infecting onion. IYSV was first detected in New York <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> in 2006 and has since been found throughout all of the major onion producing regions in the state. Recent studies in New York have shown that IYSV can reduce bulb size, suggesting that this disease may cause serious economic losses for the onion industry. Sources of IYSV in New York <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> have only recently become better understood. IYSV may be annually introduced via transplanted onions imported from AZ, where the virus is established. IYSV also may be established in New York and bridge seasons through volunteer onion p lants and winter-annual, biennial and perennial weeds near <b>onion</b> <b>fields.</b> However, weed species that may be important in the epidemiology of IYSV in <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> are not known. T. tabaci can only acquire IYSV as first instars. Therefore, a weed can only be a source for IYSV if it is also a host for immature T. tabaci. Because weed hosts that would support larval populations of T. tabaci were not known for the Great Lakes region of North America including New York, the main purpose of this research was to identify weed species that supported populations of T. tabaci larvae. In 2008 and 2009, common weed species and T. tabaci larvae were sampled from spring through early fall in the Elba Muck onion-growing region in western New York, the second largest onion growing region in the state. Ninety-eight weed species were sampled and 30 had at least one T. tabaci larva. A total of 2, 121 T. tabaci larvae were found on weeds sampled in 2008 and 2009; 17 % of the weed species were members of Asteraceae and 20 % were in the Brassicaceae. Most of the larvae (90 %) were found on species of these two families. Because IYSV is thought to be non-transmissible by seed, winterannual, biennial and perennial weed species have the ability to act as overwintering reservoirs for IYSV in onion cropping systems. Thus, these types of weed species may likely be the most important sources for this virus. Of the 30 weed species hosting T. tabaci larvae, 25 were winter-annual, biennial and perennial weeds. Of these, only four are confirmed hosts of IYSV: common burdock, Arctium minus, chicory, Cichorium intybus, curly dock, Rumex crispus, and dandelion, Taraxacum officinale. Among these four species, plant densities and populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on common burdock and dandelion, suggesting that these weed species may have the greatest potential to impact the epidemiology of IYSV in New York <b>onion</b> <b>fields.</b> Densities of T. tabaci larvae were estimated to be 3, 536 and 3, 851 larvae per hectare on common burdock in 2008 and 2009, respectively, whereas densities were estimated to be 4, 720 and 24, 964 larvae per hectare on dandelion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Larvae were only observed on curly dock in 2008 (3 larvae per hectare) and on chicory in 2009 (143 larvae per hectare). In a separate field survey in the fall of 2009, populations of T. tabaci larvae were highest on common burdock and dandelion plants adjacent to <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> (0 - 50 m), whereas no larvae were observed on these weed species farther than 5 km from <b>onion</b> <b>fields.</b> Samples of common burdock and dandelion did not test positive for IYSV; however, the relative localization of T. tabaci populations suggests that management of these weed species near <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> in an effort {{to reduce the number of}} viruliferous T. tabaci that may colonize <b>onion</b> <b>fields</b> warrants further investigation. In addition to IYSV, there are other important viruses of vegetable crops grown in muck soils. Survey results covering the presence of these weed species in the Elba Muck are presented and discussed...|$|R
