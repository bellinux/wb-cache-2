Kenneth cannot bring himself to ask Jennifer out, so Tracy (Tracy Morgan) decides to help him.

Jennifer {{believes}} Kenneth is black, but Kenneth reveals he is white and expresses his feeling for her, and admits to her that Tracy was <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> talking. Jennifer tells him she does not mind of what has happened. However, after feeling Kenneth's face and comparing it to her own, she leaves, horrified at his appearance.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E

25|$|In {{the seventh}} reading, Moses {{instructed}} {{that when the}} Israelites approached to attack a town, they were to offer it terms of peace, and if the town surrendered, then {{all the people of}} the town were to serve the Israelites as slaves. But if the town did not surrender, then the Israelites were to lay siege to the town, and when God granted victory, kill all its men and take as booty the women, children, livestock, and everything else in the town. Those were the rules for towns that lay very far from Israel, but for the towns of the nations in the land — the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites — the Israelites were to kill everyone, lest they lead the Israelites into <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> abhorrent things that those nations had done for their gods.

25|$|The game's {{environment}} {{takes up}} 60–65% of the CPU bandwidth, {{primarily because of}} the moving camera, but also because eight different characters can appear on screen at any one time – a large number for the technology of the time. Because of this, a powerful CPU was required to run the game, since the engine relied on the processor <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> work in creating the 3D models. However, despite this limitation, the game runs at a minimum of 15 FPS, even on slow systems. The downside to this was that, since processor power at that time was limited, the in-game 3D models tended to look very pixelated, especially up-close and when motionless, due to the low amount of voxels used to display them. However, had the number of voxels been raised to increase the detail on the characters, the game would have become too slow to play, even on advanced CPUs.|$|E

Julie Andrews recalled that the [...] "Burlington Bertie From Bow" [...] number in Star! was physically demanding, and she balked when Kidd asked her for a retake, saying she had a bad back.

Online magazine FilmSlash criticized The New York Times statement about U2 3D being the first IMAX art film, stating {{that some of the}} first IMAX titles were [...] "experimental works of art". Music critic Joel Selvin wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that seeing U2 on the big screen was [...] "more distracting than illuminating", and Time Out London criticized Bono's political statements, stating he [...] "should refrain from ramming his preachy political meanderings down our throats and let the music do the talking". The Daily Telegraph favored Rattle and Hum over U2 3D and called U2's performance [...] "unexciting", criticizing how [...] "the cameras, not the band, are <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> work". The Guardian, which gave a rating of one out of five stars, claimed that U2 appeared to be [...] "four conceited billionaires who are further up themselves than ever".|$|E

Sarah recruits Joel (Sam Jaeger), a licensed contractor, to help Zeek, but tells him he must let Zeek believe he is <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> work.

500|$|A {{number of}} reviews praised Elite Forces {{gameplay}} and level design. The battles were described by GameSpot as [...] "particularly intense", enhanced by friendly non-player characters being [...] "surprisingly responsive" [...] in combat, giving the player {{the sense that}} they are [...] "not <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fighting by [...] ". While GameSpy voiced the view that Elite Force does not deviate radically from other games in the genre, it stated that [...] "what it does do, it does extremely well". Admiring the game's pacing, GameSpy noted that the use of periods with character interaction rather than combat helped prevent the game becoming a [...] "continuous onslaught" [...] and allowed the story to flow smoothly, a point echoed by GameSpot. However, both GameSpot and GameSpy were critical of the game's artificial intelligence in some circumstances, leading friendly characters {{to get in the way}} of the player during firefights. IGN was impressed with the variety of gameplay, from finding solutions to problems in coordination with other characters, engaging in stealth missions and pursuing a wide selection of objectives within the individual missions. Several reviewers were complimentary towards the design of the weapons in the game, commenting that they were powerful and fun to use as well as fitting for the Star Trek theme.|$|E
