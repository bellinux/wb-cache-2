40|$|Abstract — Recent {{measurements}} {{show that}} BGP peering links can fail {{as frequently as}} intradomain links and usually for short periods of time. We propose a new fast-reroute technique where routers are prepared to react quickly to <b>interdomain</b> <b>link</b> failures. For each of its interdomain links, a router precomputes a protection tunnel, i. e. an IP tunnel to an alternate nexthop which can reach the same destinations as via the protected link. We propose a BGP-based auto-discovery technique that allows each router to learn the candidate protection tunnels for its links. Each router selects the best protection tunnels for its links and when it detects an <b>interdomain</b> <b>link</b> failure, it immediately encapsulates the packets to send them through the protection tunnel. Our solution is applicable for the links between large transit ISPs and also for the links between multi-homed stub networks and their providers. Furthermore, we show that transient forwarding loops (and thus the corresponding packet losses) can be avoided during the routing convergence that follows the deactivation of a protection tunnel in BGP/MPLS VPNs and in IP networks using encapsulation.

40|$|Internet is {{composed}} of numbers of independent autonomous systems. BGP is used to disseminate reachability information and establishing path between autonomous systems. Each autonomous system is allowed to select a single route to a destination and then export the selected route to its neighbors. The selection of single best route imposes restrictions {{on the use of}} alternative paths during <b>interdomain</b> <b>link</b> failure and thus, incurred packet loss. Packet loss still occurs even when multiple paths exist between source and destination but these paths have not been utilized. To minimize the packet loss, when multiple paths exist, multipath routing techniques are introduced. Multipath routing techniques ensure the use of alternative paths on link failure. It computes set of paths which can be used when primary path is not available and it also provides a way to transit domains to have control over the traffic flow. This can be achieved by little modification to current BGP. This paper highlights different multipath routing techniques and also discusses the overhead incurred by each of them...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The traffic {{exchanged}} {{between two}} overlay nodes in different autonomous systems (AS) is always {{subjected to a}} series of inter-domain policies. However, overlay routing often manages to get around these policy restrictions by relaying traffic through multiple legitimate segments, in order to achieve its selfish goals (e. g., better latency paths between endsystems). We focus on the violation of a generalized exit policy, which specifies the exact next hop AS and the egress <b>interdomain</b> <b>link</b> for a destination address prefix. We characterize the different types of these exit policy violations and investigate their extent in a Planetlab testbed. It is conceivable that the native ASes will eventually realize the negative impact of the exit violations and adopt stringent strategies to enforce the exit policies, thereby causing deterioration in overlay performance. In this context, based on our findings from a previous study[1], we develop a pricing-based strategy that an overlay service provider can use to obtain permits from a near-optimal set of native ASes, in an effort to regain its routing advantage within a fixed budget. Further, we illustrate the use of this approach on our case study overlay network. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Discrete-event {{simulation}} of computer networks has significant scalability issues, which makes simulating large-scale networks problematic. We propose a high-level abstraction modeling network domains, <b>interdomain</b> <b>links</b> and traffic with highly scalable analytical models, {{which is much}} more efficient but slightly less accurate than node-by-node models. Thus, simulation scenarios containing several ISP networks become feasible. We also propose a way to combine this modeling approach with traditional packet-based simulators and present some preliminary evaluation results of the concept...|$|R

Our analysis considers {{the relationships between the}} interdomain traffic and the interdomain topology. We first discuss the day-to-day stability of the interdomain traffic matrix to evaluate the feasibility of interdomain traffic engineering. Then, we study the variability of the interdomain flows for several aggregation levels (prefix, AS and sink tree) and with respect to the interdomain topology seen by BGP. We show that despite the important variability of interdomain flows, it would be useful for a non-transit ISP to traffic engineer its access traffic by relying on a sink tree aggregation level...|$|R

We first discuss the problem of establishing explicitly routed interdomain LSPs and show that the current subobjects found in RSVP-TE are not sufficient to establish interdomain LSPs {{because they do not}} take into account the policy constraints of the interdomain environment. We then show how to extend the fast-reroute and detour objects to protect <b>interdomain</b> <b>links</b> and ASBRs on interdomain LSPs. We also discuss the establishment of disjoint interdomain LSPs for restoration and load balancing purposes in the appendix.

40|$|While astonishingly successful, Internet {{is still}} less {{reliable}} than the phone system and supports very limited user choice and control. As many researchers observed, multipath routing is a promising paradigm {{to address these}} issues. In this thesis, we argue that multipath routing can indeed {{go a long way}} towards these goals as well as lead to a more scalable, extensible, and evolvable Internet. We begin by describing Yet Another Multipath Routing (YAMR) protocol that provably constructs a set of paths resilient to any one <b>interdomain</b> <b>link</b> failure. YAMR uses an efficient scheme to construct the paths and a novel failure hiding technique to further reduce the control plane overhead. Next, we describe Pathlet Routing, a protocol that departs from the path-vector paradigm. Pathlet routing allows ASes to advertise policy-compliant path segments called pathlets, and allows users to stitch them together, thus forming a complete path suitable for the user's particular needs. Pathlet routing greatly reduces the forwarding table size, can efficiently express a wide class of routing policies, and provide an exponential number of paths to the users. Finally, we investigate how pathlet routing can be a basis for an evolvable Internet architecture...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Interdomain multipath routing protocol. Multipath routing {{has been shown}} to be a promising technique to increase reliability of Internet routing and provide greater flexibility for users to choose paths that best suit their needs. In recent years, many schemes have been proposed to support mul-tipath interdomain routing. These existing works demonstrated the feasibility of providing alternative paths in a scalable and policy-compliant manner. In this work, authors propose “Yet Another Multipath Routing Protocol ” (YAMR). The contributions of this paper are two-fold. The paper first presents a path calculation mechanism called YPC. YPC constructs a set of policy-complaint interdomain routing paths which tolerant any single <b>interdomain</b> <b>link</b> failure. However, the increase in path resiliency comes at a price: a considerable increase in the control message overhead imposed by alternative path advertisement. The paper then presents a mechanism which reduce control message overhead by localizing routing updates. The idea is that a router does not notify its neighbors failure event if it still has an available path to reach the same destination. This method can effectively reduce the control message overhead. To avoid forwarding loops and disconnectivi-ty due to information hiding, a token is used as a signal to determine if information hiding is needed or not. All reviewers found that this failure hiding mechanism is quite interesting. The paper uses simulations to evaluate the benefit of YAMR and compares it with BGP. The results sho...|$|E

Her height SD score increased from - 6. 3 to - 4. 7 without acceleration of bone age. Isolated breast development progressed despite pubertal suppression with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue, which was stopped after 3 yr because of growth deceleration. Facial coarsening was documented with serial photographs. Sequencing and in vitro analysis identified a homozygous base pair substitution in exon 6 of the proband 2 ̆ 7 s GH receptor (GHR), which changed amino acid 131 from proline to glutamine (P 131 Q) and disrupted GH binding. Both the P 131 Q-mutated human GHR and wild-type (wt) hGHR were transiently expressed in COS- 1 cells, as demonstrated by Western blotting, but the P 131 Q- transfected cells did not bind I-hGH. Similarly, FDC-P 1 cells transfected with wthGHR bound I-hGH with high affinity and proliferated in response to GH, whereas the P 131 Q hGHR cells did neither. In CHO-K 1 cells cotransfected with wthGHR and the Egr- 1 promotor linked to a luciferase reporter gene, GH evoked a 2. 14 ± 0. 21 -fold increase in luciferase activity, {{but there was no}} response in the cells carrying the P 131 Q hGHR mutation.

40|$|Abstract. In today's BGP routing architecture, traffic {{delivery}} is in general based on single path selection paradigms. The lack of path diversity hinders {{the support for}} resilience, traffic engineering and QoS provisioning across the Internet. Some recently proposed multi-plane extensions to BGP offer a promising mechanism to enable diverse inter-domain routes towards destination prefixes. Based on these enhanced BGP protocols, we propose in this paper a novel technique to enable controlled fast egress router switching for handling network failures. In order to minimize the disruptions to real-time services caused by the failures, backup egress routers can be immediately activated through locally remarking affected traffic towards alternative routing planes without waiting for IGP routing re-convergence. According to our evaluation results, the proposed multi-plane based egress router selection algorithm is able to provide both high path diversity and balanced load distribution across <b>interdomain</b> <b>links</b> with {{a small number of}} planes. ...|$|R
40|$|The Tap protein mediates the {{sequence}} nonspecific nuclear export of cellular mRNAs {{as well as}} {{the sequence}}-specific export of retroviral mRNAs bearing the constitutive transport element (CTE). Previously, the structures of individual Tap subdomains, including ribonucleoprotein and leucine-rich repeat domains, have been described. Here, we report the crystal structure of a functional CTE RNA-binding domain of human Tap, including the N-terminal arm of the ribonucleoprotein domain and <b>interdomain</b> <b>linking</b> polypeptide. To identify residues that interact with the CTE, we have introduced 38 alanine substitutions for surface residues in the Tap CTE-binding domain and tested these mutants for their ability to support CTE-dependent nuclear RNA export and CTE binding. Four residues that cluster on a concave surface in the leucine-rich repeat domain were found to be critical for CTE binding and define a CTE-interacting surface on this domain. The second critical CTE-interacting surface on Tap is defined by three previously identified residues {{on the surface of the}} ribonucleoprotein domain.

40|$|Nonstructural protein 3 of {{the severe}} acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) coronavirus includes a "SARS-unique domain" (SUD) consisting of three globular domains separated by short linker peptide segments. This work reports NMR structure determinations of the C-terminal domain (SUD-C) and a two-domain construct (SUD-MC) containing the middle domain (SUD-M) and the C-terminal domain, and NMR {{data on the}} conformational states of the N-terminal domain (SUD-N) and the SUD-NM two-domain construct. Both SUD-N and SUD-NM are monomeric and globular in solution; in SUD-NM, there is high mobility in the two-residue <b>interdomain</b> <b>linking</b> sequence, with no preferred relative orientation of the two domains. SUD-C adopts a frataxin like fold and has structural similarity to DNA-binding domains of DNA-modifying enzymes. The structures of both SUD-M (previously determined) and SUD-C (from the present study) are maintained in SUD-MC, where the two domains are flexibly linked. Gel-shift experiments showed that both SUD-C and SUD-MC bind to single-stranded RNA and recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases, whereby SUD-MC binds to a more restricted set of purine-containing RNA sequences than SUD-M. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments with observations of (15) N-labeled proteins further resulted in delineation of RNA binding sites (i. e., in SUD-M, a positively charged surface area with a pronounced cavity, and in SUD-C, several residues of an anti-parallel beta-sheet). Overall, the present data provide evidence for molecular mechanisms involving the concerted actions of SUD-M and SUD-C, which result in specific RNA binding that might be unique to the SUD and, thus, to the SARS coronavirus...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) is {{a member}} of the nepovirus genus of {{icosahedral}} RNA plant viruses that cause disease in fruit crops. Nepoviruses, comoviruses and picornaviruses are classified in the picornavirus superfamily. Crystal structures of comoviruses and picornaviruses and the molecular mass of the TRSV subunit (sufficient to accommodate three β-barrel domains) suggested that nepoviruses may represent a link in the evolution of the picornavirus capsids from a T= 3 icosahedral virus. This evolutionary process is thought to involve triplication of the capsid protein gene, to encode a three-domain polyprotein, followed by development of cleavage sites in the <b>interdomain</b> <b>linking</b> regions. Structural studies on TRSV were initiated to determine if the TRSV subunit corresponds to the proposed uncleaved three domain polyprotein. Results: The 3. 5 å resolution structure of TRSV shows that the capsid protein consists of three β-barrel domains covalently linked by extended polypeptides. The order of connectivity of the domains in TRSV confirms the proposed connectivity for the precleaved comovirus and picornavirus capsid polyprotein. Structural differences between equivalent domains in TRSV and comoviruses are confined to the external surface loops, interdomain connecting polypeptides and N termini. The three different domains within TRSV and comoviruses are more closely related at the structural level than the three individual domains within picornaviruses. Conclusions: The structural results confirm the notion of divergent evolution of the capsid polyproteins of nepoviruses, comoviruses and picornaviruses from a common ancestor. A number of residues were found to be conserved among various nepoviruses, some of which stabilize the quaternary structure of the three domains in the TRSV capsid protein subunit. Two conserved regions were identified on the external surface of TRSV, however, mutational studies will be needed to understand their functional significance.

40|$|Tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV) is {{a member}} of the nepovirus genus of {{icosahedral}} RNA plant viruses. Nepoviruses and comoviruses are classified in the picornavirus superfamily based on similarity to picornaviruses. The Picorna-like virus capsids are composed of sixty copies of three subunits (with a similar β-barrel fold) which occupy positions on the surface lattice comparable to the 180 copies of a single subunit in a T= 3 virus capsid. The three different subunits are synthesized as a polyprotein, which is subsequently cleaved by a viral proteinase. ^ Structures of comoviruses and picornaviruses suggested that picorna-like viruses have evolved from a T= 3 virus by triplication of the gene encoding a β-barrel domain and the development of cleavage sites in the <b>interdomain</b> <b>linking</b> regions. The picornavirus capsid polyprotein is cleaved at two sites, while the comoviruses possess one cleavage site. Nepovirus capsids, composed of a single capsid protein species, may represent an early stage in the evolution of picornavirus capsids. Structural studies on TRSV were initiated to investigate the proposed evolutionary relationship. ^ The 3. 5 A resolution structure of TRSV has revealed that the capsid protein is folded into three β-barrel domains that are covalently linked by extended polypeptides. The quaternary structure of the three domains in the capsid protein is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interactions. The order of connectivity of the domains in TRSV confirms the proposed connectivity in the precleaved como- and picornavirus capsid polyproteins. ^ The structural differences between equivalent domains in TRSV and comoviruses are confined to the external surface loops, interdomain connecting polypeptides and N-termini. The three different domains within TRSV and comoviruses are structurally closer than the three domains within picornaviruses. The results of structural comparisons support the proposed divergent evolution of the capsid polyproteins of nepo-, como- and picornaviruses. ...|$|R
40|$|The large subunit (R 1) of {{herpes simplex}} virus (HSV) {{ribonucleotide}} r ductase is a bifunctional protein con-sisting of a unique N-terminal protein kinase domain and a ribonucleotide reductase domain. Previous tudies showed that the two functional domains are linked by a protease sensitive site. Here we provide vidence for two subdomains, of 30 K and 53 K, within the reductase domain. The two fragments, which were produced by limited proteolysis and were resistant to further degra-dation, remained tightly associated in a complex con-taining two molecules of each. They were capable of binding the R 2 subunit of HSV ribonucleotide reductase with approximately the same affinity as the intact protein but the complex did not complement the small subunit (R 2) to give an active enzyme. At low concentrations (0. 4 lag/ml) of trypsin or V 8 protease, cleavage between the subdomains was prevented {{by the presence of}} the N-terminal protein kinase domain. At higher protease concentrations (1 ~tg/ml) the N-terminal domain is extensively proteolysed and the 30 K and 53 K domains were generated. Identical results were obtained using purified R 1 isolated from infected cell extracts or following expression i Escherichia coli. The origin of the two domains was investigated by N-terminal sequencing of the 53 K fragment and by examining their reactivity with a panel of Rl-specific monoclonal ntibodies which we isolated and epitope mapped for that purpose. The trypsin cleavage site was found to lie between arginine 575 and asparagine 576, and proteolysis in this region was not prevented by the presence of R 2 or the nonapep-tide YAGAVVNDL.

40|$|ABSTRACT Protein {{function}} {{is governed by}} the underlying conformational dynamics of the molecule. The experimental and theoretical work leading to contemporary understanding of enzyme dynamics was mostly restricted to the large-scale movements of single-domain proteins. Collective movements resulting from a regulatory interplay between protein domains is often crucial for enzymatic activity. It is not clear, however, how our knowledge could be extended to describe collective near-equilibrium motions of multidomain enzymes. We examined the effect of domain interactions on the low temperature near equilibrium dynamics of the native state, using phosphoglycerate kinase as model protein. We measured thermal activation of tryptophan phosphorescence quenching to explore millisecond-range protein motions. The two protein domains of phosphoglycerate kinase correspond to two dynamic units, but <b>interdomain</b> interactions <b>link</b> {{the motion of the}} two domains. The effect of the interdomain interactions on the activation of motions in the individual domains is asymmetric. As the temperature of the frozen protein is increased from the cryogenic, motions of the N domain are activated first.
