50|$|The radios {{contained}} 100 transistors and 8 {{vacuum tubes}} and were modular in design, allowing most servicing {{to be done}} with only a screw driver. Later upgrades replaced the vacuum tubes with transistors. A variety of accessories were available, including antennas, control heads, encryptors, head sets, shock mounts, speakers and <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|E

The flaps are hydraulically operated. <b>Interconnecting</b> <b>cables</b> synchronize the flaps throughout their range of travel and a limit switch located on the left flap sector prevents over-travel.

These sets had around 300 vacuum tubes each, and 10 to 20 adjustment knobs each, and many <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables.</b> Nearly every day a vacuum tube would fail, and they would have to trace and troubleshoot.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{computers}} in the 1940s and 1950s were one-of-a-kind engineering efforts that could take weeks to program and program loading {{was one of many}} problems that had to be solved. An early computer, ENIAC, had no [...] "program" [...] stored in memory, but was set up for each problem by a configuration of <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables.</b> Bootstrapping did not apply to ENIAC, whose hardware configuration was ready for solving problems as soon as power was applied.|$|E

The CLELCo and three companies in south and east London - the County of London Electric Supply Company Limited; the South London Electric Supply Corporation Limited; and the South Metropolitan Electric Light and Power Company Limited - promoted the London Electricity (No.1) Act 1925.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} 1875, Edison and {{his assistants}} were experimenting with the Acoustic Telegraph when they noticed that a rapidly {{vibrating}} spark gap produced a spark in an adjacent relay. Subsequent investigation showed that the phenomenon {{could be made to}} occur at a distance of several feet without <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables.</b> Edison, with this small amount of evidence, announced that it was [...] "a true unknown force" [...] since he believed that the spark transmitted electricity without carrying any charge. Edison concluded that this discovery had the potential to cheapen telegraphic communication and to allow transatlantic cables to be laid without insulation. He was also interested in finding new forces as a means for providing scientific explanations for spiritualist, occult and other allegedly supernatural phenomena following his disenchantment with Helena Blavatsky's Theosophy.|$|E
5000|$|The water leak {{detection}} industry {{is small and}} specialized {{with only a few}} manufacturers operating worldwide. The original application was in the void created by [...] "computer room" [...] floors in the days of large main-frame computer systems. These use a modular, raised floor based around a structural [...] "floor tile" [...] usually 600 mm square and supported at the corners by pedestals. The void created gave easy access and routing for the mass of power, networking and other <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables</b> associated with larger computer systems - processors, drives, routers etc. mainframe computers also generated large amounts of heat so a void under the floor could also used as a plenum to distribute and diffuse chilled air around the computer room. The void therefore was likely to have chilled water pipes running through it along with the drains for condensates associated with refrigeration plant. In addition, designers found the floor void a very convenient place to route other wet services feeding bathrooms, radiators and other facilities.|$|E
5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the Lincoln LS {{shared a}} platform and equipment with the Jaguar S-Type. The DEW98 platform {{on which the}} cars were based was a rigid chassis that featured independent double wishbone (short-long arm; SLA) front and rear suspensions for excellent handling and ride quality. Enhancing ride quality further, as well as increasing interior space, was the LS' large 114.5 in wheelbase. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes were standard while Ford's AdvanceTrac traction control system was available as an option for improved driving control. A number of suspension components, {{as well as the}} hood, decklid, and front fenders, used aluminum to save weight. The LS came with standard 16-inch alloy wheels while 17-inch wheels were available through an optional sport package. The sport package for only an extra $1000.00, gave a stiffer suspension, 17-inch rims and a [...] "slap shift" [...] selecter. The battery of the LS was positioned in the spare tire well inside the car's trunk because too little room for it was left in the engine bay. However, moving the heavy battery and its <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables</b> {{to the rear of the}} vehicle contributed to its near-50/50 weight distribution.|$|E

30|$|The {{existing}} optimization methods or formulations in {{the literature}} {{do not seem to}} be completely satisfactory. This is because, finding the optimal electrical interconnection layout without cable sizing leads to over-dimensioning of the <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cable</b> system. Moreover, decreasing the problem size by any clustering method without considering integration of all WTs or utilizing an insufficient optimization algorithm for such a complex problem may result in a local optimal solution.|$|R

30|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{attenuation}} constant were performed for different types of superconducting coaxial cables down to 4 K by impedance matched measurements [24 – 31]. In those works, the attenuation constant is typically evaluated from measurements of the transmission spectrum of the waveguide, which is subsequently corrected for the attenuation in the <b>interconnecting</b> <b>cables</b> from room temperature to the cold stage in a reference measurement.
