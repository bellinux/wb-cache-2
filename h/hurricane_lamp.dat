25|$|In the US, {{national}} conventions are officially {{called to}} order by an opening ceremony {{in which the}} Eternal Flame of Service is brought forth {{by members of the}} Delta Omega chapter at the University of Houston. This tradition was started after the twenty-first national convention in Dallas, Texas. In the early hours of December 30, 1970, the delegates of the Delta Omega chapter met in a ceremony in the suite of H. Roe Bartle, with the newly elected members of the National Board of Directors and National President Aubrey B. Hamilton. Bartle lit a small blue candle that he in turn used to light a <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp,</b> which was then passed from the blue candle to each of the board members' candles. He then joined the board members to light two four foot candles. The flame was then taken to Houston and allowed to burn while awaiting the completion of the Eternal Flame site.|$|E
60|$|He lighted the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp,</b> {{took off}} his coat, turned up the bicycle, and set speedily to work. Miriam came with the bowl of water and stood close to him, watching. She loved to see his hands doing things. He was slim and vigorous, {{with a kind of}} {{easiness}} even in his most hasty movements. And busy at his work he seemed to forget her. She loved him absorbedly. She wanted to run her hands down his sides. She always wanted to embrace him, so long as he did not want her.|$|E
60|$|She leaned {{forwards}} and upwards {{to pierce}} the darkness; he, also straining to look, felt her breath on his cheek, and turning, saw the pallor {{of her face}} close to his, and felt the dark glow of her eyes. He caught her in his arms, and held her mouth in a kiss. Then, when he released her, he turned away, saying something incoherent about going to fetch the lantern to look. She remained with her back towards me, and pretended to be feeling among the mistletoe for the berries. Soon I saw the swing of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> below.|$|E
50|$|The Jet Age {{formed in}} 2005 after singer/guitarist Eric Tischler's {{previous}} indie rock band, The <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Lamps</b> (1995-2004; 5 LPs and a Bus Stop Label 7", multiple national tours) folded when drummer Jason Merriman decided to attend {{graduate school and}} bassist Greg Bennett planned to move overseas. Dave Meyer, a <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Lamps</b> fan, agreed to play bass and introduced Tischler to Pete Nuwayser. Shortly before beginning to record the band's first album, Breathless, Meyer moved to Colorado (his then fiancée, and now spouse, accepted a teaching position with a university there). Bennett's relocation plan had changed by that time, so Tischler quickly asked him to resume playing bass.|$|R
50|$|The School’s {{air raid}} shelters were {{built on the}} grounds of nearby Warwick Castle which could be {{accessed}} through a door in the school wall. There were two; one for infants (5-7) and juniors (8-11) and another for seniors (11-14). Both were equipped with two chemical toilets and three <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The first {{concert of}} Sydney Musica Viva was {{presented}} at Verbrugghen Hall, Sydney Conservatorium of Music on 8 December 1945. Let down by Sydney's unreliable post-war power supply, the concert took place in darkness save the headlights of several cars parked {{in the doorway of}} the auditorium and some <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> in the foyers.|$|R
5000|$|Cassie tells Georgina that Roy {{raped her}} but Georgina {{does not believe}} her. Still in her {{delusion}} that Cassie is her sister Marlena, she mentions that Marlena {{was going to call}} the police to report that Roy had killed Arthur. Georgina states that Marlena was always a [...] "witch" [...] and [...] "witches must be burned," [...] sitting in Roy's fathers chair. David shuts off the power to the house from outside, and Georgina gets a <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> to light the room where she is sitting with Cassie. David arrives with a hacksaw and begins to work on the chains tying Cassie to the bed. Georgina accepts that he is Marlena's new husband {{and that it would be}} best for them to leave. Roy arrives and tells Georgina that Marlena and Donna are dead and that they died when Georgina gave them lethal overdoses of sleeping tablets in milk to prevent them going to the police.Roy gets into a fight with Cassie and David and throws the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> at the wall starting a fire.|$|E
50|$|A Hurricane {{glass is}} a form of {{drinking}} glass which typically will contain 20 fluid ounces (600 ml). It is used to serve mixed drinks, particularly the Hurricane from which it is named originating at Pat O'Brien's Bar in New Orleans. Other drinks served in this glass include the Singapore Sling, June bug, Piña colada and Blue Hawaii. It is shaped similarly to a vase or a <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> and is typically taller and wider than a highball glass.|$|E
50|$|O'Brien is {{reported}} to have invented the hurricane cocktail in the 1940s. The story of the drink's origin holds that, due to difficulties importing scotch during World War II, liquor salesmen forced bar owners to buy up to 50 cases of their much-more-plentiful rum in order to secure a single case of good whiskey or scotch. The barmen at Pat O'Brien's came up with an appealing recipe to reduce their bulging surplus of rum. When they decided to serve it in a hurricane glass, shaped like a <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp,</b> the hurricane was born.|$|E
60|$|I nodded, and {{he handed}} to me a felt-covered flask of the non-conducting kind, filled with boiling water, a tin of {{preserved}} milk, {{and a little}} bottle of meat extract of a most concentrated sort. Then, having lit two of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> and seen that they were full of oil, we started back up the cave.|$|R
60|$|The {{second day}} drew to its close. Our simple {{preparations}} were complete. They consisted mainly in making ready our <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> and packing {{up a little}} food, enough to keep us {{for three or four}} days if necessary, together with some matches and a good supply of oil, since, as Bastin put it, he was determined not to be caught like the foolish virgins in the parable.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experience}} of 1 UDR {{was the same}} as that of all battalions of the regiment in the early days. Because of equipment shortages patrols had to be carried out in private cars or in vehicles borrowed from other army units. [...] Instead of torches, patrols carried <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Lamps</b> which had to be lit by hand. These were eventually replaced by the Bardic torches carried by the regular army.|$|R
50|$|In 1978 Kat's mother {{bought a}} summer home from her uncle in the Adirondacks {{to be near}} her {{grandfather}} as his health failed. The family moved back to New York and lived year around in a rustic, uninsulated frame home, without electricity. They cooked on a wood burning cast iron range and washed in rainwater collected in a cistern. Kat did her homework by candle light or <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> and graduated from Ausable Valley Central School at age 16. That summer her grandfather died and she left her mother {{to move in with}} her father and step-mother in Rochester, New York.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1990s, {{after the}} nor'easters of December 1992 and March 1993 heavily damaged {{the coast of}} Rockaway, the Army Corps of Engineers began {{rebuilding}} Rockaway Peninsula beaches. They used sands dredged close to shore. Professor Nicholas Coch of Queens College, along with local undergraduate students, was observing the work and its results, replenishing of the beaches along Rockaway when they noticed peculiar items along the coast. The group uncovered hundreds of different artifacts including whiskey bottles, beer mugs, and even a <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp.</b> The majority of the items were dated around the late 19th century. Coch believes they came from Hog Island, but admits {{they could have been}} the result of the 1893 storm's devastation in other nearby resort areas.|$|E
50|$|When Ben and Oscar {{return to}} the guest house the next day, Ben is alarmed to {{discover}} that, although the Tourists have left the house, their luggage is still there. He and Oscar track them to an abandoned factory outside the town, where Ben realises that they are awaiting a second disaster which is about to strike the school. The tourists try to detain him, but he evades them and races to the scene, hoping to save Hilary. Meanwhile, maintenance workers accidentally damage a gas pipeline in the boiler room of the school, and just as Ben arrives, a <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> in the gymnasium ignites the leaking gas, destroying the school in a massive blast and killing {{most of the people}} inside, including Hilary and Quish, who has followed Ben to the building.|$|E
25|$|Boarman {{built his}} first home out of lumber and lived rough with his only luxuries being a coal stove and <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> he ordered though the local general store. As a young doctor {{traveling}} the countryside he faced many obstacles including severe weather {{conditions such as}} floods and thunderstorms, and especially the harsh winters of the Upper Midwest, as well as poor roads and no telegraph system. Harris made countless house calls and delivered over 3,000 babies in his near 60-year career.|$|R
60|$|He {{was sitting}} with {{his back against the}} coffin of the Glittering Lady, whom {{therefore}} he had not seen. Now he began to turn round, and being too weak to do so, motioned me to help him. I obeyed, while Bickley, guessing his purpose, held up one of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> that he might see better. With a kind of fierce eagerness he surveyed her who lay within the coffin, and after he had done so, uttered a sigh as of intense relief.|$|R
50|$|A local {{pavilion}} was dismantled {{and rebuilt}} on the Earlmead site in 1938. Having {{been presented to}} the Club by a local land owner Mr G Champniss, later club president, it was to call the Champniss Stand. This stand had room for 250 seated and a further 100 standing. During the Second World War the Pavilion was successfully blacked out and the club could continue playing. <b>Hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> under biscuit tins with words such as 'way in' and 'turn left' punched out provided signage.|$|R

5000|$|During the renovations in 2004 several {{significant}} discoveries were made: [...] "Seven century-old, {{white marble}} clapboards embossed with carvings of the Egyptian Sphinx were recently {{found in a}} hotel storage room that has been sealed for decades. The storage room at the Shanghai Astor House Hotel also contained several other century-old utensils, including an American <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp,</b> an English ammeter, four blades of an American electric fan, and 37 white marble candle holders". According to Li Hao, a manager at the Hotel, [...] "The antiques will first be appraised, then be repaired, and finally be put in their former places or exhibited to the public. ... We'll relocate them to where they were, providing {{them a chance to}} function again as before." [...] Jasper Becker reported later in 2004, soon after the most recent renovation: [...] "The oak-panelled walls and Ionic marble columns of the Astor Hotel's reception hall lend it a grandeur that war and revolution have not altered since Bertrand Russell and Bernard Shaw succumbed to Shanghai's splendid decadence." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thus Dunlop grew up {{surrounded}} by the seminal figures of the Irish Literary Renaissance, in an atmosphere smacking of mysticism and Spiritualism. The Dunlop family moved to New York in 1899, then London three years later. From here, they made the annual pilgrimage back to Dublin during Horse Show week, with Dunlops father returning to London clutching {{two or three more}} Æ canvasses each time. Dunlop trained in art in London, associating with a group of young artists who exhibited at the <b>Hurricane</b> <b>Lamp</b> Gallery in Chelsea. In 1928 the group published a journal called Emotionism: Dunlop supplied a rather vague manifesto ("Art is the expression of the essence of life"), a poem, and an illustration of one of his paintings, [...] "The Fish Market". Dunlop soon expanded his exhibiting circle, showing with the New English Art Club and later with the Royal Academy and the Royal Society of British Artists. He maintained his Irish connections, returning periodically to paint in Dublin and submitting a number of works to the RHA in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
6000|$|... [As HARRY {{goes out}} {{a crowd of}} people surge through the great [...] open doorway of the courtyard. They are monks of the temple, [...] {{attracted}} to the street by the quick rumour of accident, coolies, [...] and the night watchman with his rattle. Some of them bear Chinese [...] lanterns, some <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps.</b> The crowd separates out as they [...] approach the room and then it is seen that three men are bearing [...] {{what seems to be the}} body of a man.|$|R
50|$|The bridge (no. 6m 74c), {{which had}} 19 in wrought iron girders, spanned 20 ft and was {{supported}} by brick and flint abutments; it had a minimum headroom of 15 ft. A single platform was provided on which stood a wooden passenger waiting shelter and the running in board. The halt was unstaffed and in winter two <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> lit the platform at night, both being lit and extinguished by the late-turn guard. Access to the station was via a kissing gate and a flight of steps from the roadside {{on the south side}} of the bridge.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the gold}} began to {{decrease}} in the early 1900s, and by World War I, the town was in serious decline. The federal electorate was abolished in 1913 due to the diminished population, as many of its residents left for other towns where the gold was still plentiful, and it soon {{ceased to be a}} municipality. The situation remained unchanged throughout the century, as its population slipped to around 200 and it became a virtual ghost town. An example of this decline is that, in March 1896, Coolgardie's main street was lit by an electric light, but by April 1924, the same street was lit by four <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the modern}} {{principles}} of combat health support were displayed in the critical 1942 Kokoda campaign of the 2 / 4 th Field Ambulance. The photographic collection and war diary {{of a member of}} this Field Ambulance, Captain Alan Watson, Dental Officer, AAMC, provides a unique illustrated view of the essential and difficult work of the 2 / 4 th Field Ambulance. The 2 / 4 th Field Ambulance functioned in a similar fashion to a current day ADF role two (enhanced) deployable hospital, providing initial wound surgery close to the battlefield whilst being mobile and capable of redeploying quickly to minimise evacuation times over the mountainous jungle terrain as the campaign progressed. In his Kokoda campaign, Captain Alan Watson demonstrated the vital importance of deploying a dentist to provide rapid and local care for soldiers' dental pain, dental disease, and mouth and jaw battlefield wounds. Dental pain, disease and injury not only reduce soldier performance and oral function, they lower morale. The versatility of deployed dental officers was illustrated when Captain Watson was multitasked into two additional essential roles while still performing his dental duties. In the absence of an anaesthetist for the general surgeon, Captain Watson was trained in the field to administer general anaesthesia for battle casualties, and performed 173 general anaesthetics for wounded soldiers, often under <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamp</b> and ankle deep in mud. Captain Watson also served as an aerial evacuation officer, and in one day alone arranged the aerial evacuation of approximately 400 casualties. Events of the campaign of the 2 / 4 th Field Ambulance are described in relation to current day principles of combat health support. The valuable and timeless lesson from the Kokoda campaign of Captain Alan Watson is that immediate high quality oral care by ADF dental teams who are capable of providing battlefield wound care has always been essential for our deployed Australian soldiers...|$|E
50|$|Just {{before sunset}} on Christmas Eve 1921, all adult and junior {{members from the}} centres of Marsa, Blata l-Bajda and Hamrun began to {{assemble}} at 6, Fra Diegu Street, Hamrun, where 14 years earlier Dun Gorg has started his Society of Christian Doctrine. Some came along with lanterns like those used by altar boys accompanying the Viaticum, other brought their father's bicycle headlamp lit by acetylene gas, others carried paraffin <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> and even candle-lit lanterns used by farmers on their carts; younger children brought coloured paper lamps and Venetian lights. Some even carried palm fronds and olive branches while others improvised lanterns made of hewn small pumpkins lit by candle.|$|R
5000|$|Ned Kelly opened 30 December 1977 at the Festival Theatre, Adelaide Festival Centre. It was {{produced}} by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, Eric Dare, the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust and SAS Channel 10. The musical was capitalised at $250,000 with weekly running costs of $40,000 to $50,000. The production was visually striking, with design features including a full drop curtain containing over 600 <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> and Kelly's iconic armour represented by a costume of shiny black plastic with geometric bullet holes. Critical reception was negative. The major Adelaide newspaper, the Adelaide Advertiser, in its review referred to the show as [...] "an artistic disaster - a hideous monument to bad taste and theatrical excess".|$|R
60|$|What {{else could}} it be? There was the brown and ancient cone of the extinct volcano. There were the tall palms {{of the main}} island and the lake {{glittering}} in the sunlight between. There was Bastin conducting a kind of Sunday school of Orofenans upon {{the point of the}} Rock of Offerings, as now he had obtained the leave of Oro to do. There was the mouth of the cave, and issuing from it Bickley, who by help of one of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> had been making an examination of the buried remains of what he supposed to be flying machines. Without doubt it was nightmare, and I would say nothing to them about it for fear of mockery.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, an Emergency Operation Centre {{was established in}} St. John's by the Antigua & Barbuda Red Cross Society in St. John's. In the first week after the storm, 35 Red Cross volunteers distributed 1,500 tarpaulins, 210 blankets, 300 food parcels, and 30 <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> to residents in the effected communities of York's, Villa, Greens Bay, Perry Bay, Piggotts, Bendals Bolans, Crab's Hill, Urlings, St. John's, and Jennings. a Red Cross office in St. Vincent de Paul also distributed rice and beans to 2,000 people, while the National office of Disaster Services provided plastic sheeting and water bottles. The Government of Antigua and Barbuda dispatched teams to re-open roads, clean up debris, and restore utilities. However, after Hurricane Lenny struck the Lesser Antilles about a month later, relief efforts slowed, as many more people were significantly affected, causing recovery to be costlier.|$|R
50|$|The settlers' first {{homes were}} built from split timber with shingle roofs. As {{there was no}} running water, {{one of the main}} daily tasks was the {{carrying}} of water from nearby creeks, a responsibility often given to the youngest members of the family. As most homes had no bathroom, bathing was done by hip bather, the water heated in tins on open fires or wood stoves. <b>Hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> and candles provided the only source of light. Of course the settlers of necessity had to be nearly self-sufficient in such a remote settlement. Straight-grained trees that split easily were used to provide palings and posts for buildings and fences; vegetable gardens were established, and each household produced its own milk, butter and eggs. Meat came from the farm's own livestock, and if that source of supply fell short then there was always the ever-present wallaby or rabbit to tide the family over.|$|R
5000|$|Opened in 1925, the halt - {{the last}} station to {{open on the}} line - sought to {{encourage}} passenger traffic {{in the face of}} increased competition from buses. It was situated to the south of a level crossing over an unclassified road leading to Lower Wainhill and Hempton Wainhill. The lane saw very occasional traffic as it was unsuitable for motor vehicles and only served nine or ten houses on {{the eastern side of the}} Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway. A modest crossing keeper's cottage had been provided by the railway company which comprised two ground floor rooms and one bedroom on the first floor; there was no mains water, gas or electricity. The crossing keeper was responsible for keeping the lamps alight on the gates and, once the station had opened, trimming and lighting the two oil <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> hung on posts to illuminate the single platform.|$|R
60|$|For quite a {{long while}} he gazed at us gravely, talking us in and {{everything}} connected with us. For instance, Bickley's medicine-case which lay open showing the little vulcanite tubes, a few instruments and other outfit, engaged his particular attention, and I saw at once that he understood what it was. Thus his arm still smarted where the needle had been driven in and on the blanket lay the syringe. He looked at his arm, then looked at the syringe, and nodded. The paraffin <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> also seemed to interest and win his approval. We two men, as I thought, attracted him least of all; he just summed us up and our garments, more especially the garments, with a few shrewd glances, and then seemed to turn his thoughts to Tommy, who had seated himself quite contentedly at his side, evidently accepting him as a new addition to our party.|$|R
40|$|It is {{a matter}} of shame for all of us that even after 55 years of {{independence}} there are 63 % of total rural households in India which use only kerosene for lighting. Majority of the kerosene <b>lamps</b> are <b>hurricane</b> type <b>lamps,</b> which produce very poor light of about 60 - 70 lumens. Similarly, rural areas in India use about 180 million tons of biomass fuel for cooking through very inefficient and smoky cookstoves. Cooking and lighting energy constitute 75 % of total energy used in rural areas. Yet the quality of end product (heat and light) leaves much to be desired and the rural poor are still living in stone ages. A country, which has made great strides in developing world class rocket technology and software, can certainly create technologies {{to improve the quality of}} life for rural poor. This paper therefore presents some possible research and development strategies in lighting and cooking energy based upon the emerging technologies like nano and biotechnology. Various economic and policy issues are discussed which might make it possible to improve the lives of rural poor.

5000|$|In 1945 {{he founded}} [...] "Richard Goldner's Sydney Musica Viva", whose first concert {{was held at}} the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music in Sydney on 8 December 1945, to an {{audience}} of over 1,000 people. The first item they played was Beethoven's Große Fuge, Op. 133, in honour of his teacher Simon Pullman. (Pullman's makeshift chamber ensemble had been playing the Große Fuge in the Warsaw Ghetto in August 1942 when they were rounded up and sent to Treblinka, only one of them surviving.) During Goldner's concert there was a power blackout, and car headlights, an Army generator and <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> were used for illumination. The success of the concert inspired Goldner to form an organisation for the promotion of chamber music in all its forms. In this he was supported by Hephzibah Menuhin (then married to an Australian and living in Victoria) and assisted by a fellow refugee named Walter Dullo, a German lawyer-turned-chocolate maker and musicologist. Together, Goldner and Dullo found 17 musicians (mostly also southern or central European refugees, and mostly Jewish) and formed them into four separate chamber groups under the name Musica Viva (later becoming Musica Viva Australia). The initial funding for the organisation came from Goldner himself, from the proceeds of the manufacture of his zipper. They developed a punishing playing schedule throughout Australia and New Zealand, giving 170 concerts and travelling 50,000 miles a year. Although they were always financially successful, this schedule became exhausting. This, plus the fact that Goldner had injured the first finger of his left hand while making another invention, led to Goldner retiring from playing in 1952, and the group was disbanded, but it reformed in 1954.|$|R
60|$|With {{a sudden}} thrill of horror Mackintosh asked himself {{whether he was}} already dead. The first thing at all events was {{to get him out}} of the cart, and that, owing to Walker's corpulence, was a {{difficult}} job. It took four strong men to lift him. They jolted him and he uttered a dull groan. He was still alive. At last they carried him into the house, up the stairs, and placed him on his bed. Then Mackintosh was able to see him, for in the yard, lit only by half a dozen <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps,</b> everything had been obscured. Walker's white ducks were stained with blood, and the men who had carried him wiped their hands, red and sticky, on their lava-lavas. Mackintosh held up the lamp. He had not expected the old man to be so pale. His eyes were closed. He was breathing still, his pulse could be just felt, but it was obvious that he was dying. Mackintosh had not bargained for the shock of horror that convulsed him. He saw that the native clerk was there, and in a voice hoarse with fear told him to go into the dispensary and get what was necessary for a hypodermic injection. One of the policemen had brought up the whisky, and Mackintosh forced a little into the old man's mouth. The room was crowded with natives. They sat about the floor, speechless now and terrified, and every now and then one wailed aloud. It was very hot, but Mackintosh felt cold, his hands and his feet were like ice, and he had to make a violent effort not to tremble in all his limbs. He did not know what to do. He did not know if Walker was bleeding still, and if he was, how he could stop the bleeding.|$|R
6000|$|Within {{the latter}} lived the Europeans, {{visible in the}} daytime to the few Malays on board as if through a white haze. In the evening the {{lighting}} of the <b>hurricane</b> <b>lamps</b> inside turned them into dark phantoms surrounded by a shining mist, against which the insect world rushing in its millions {{out of the forest}} on the bank was baffled mysteriously in its assault. Rigidly enclosed by transparent walls, like captives of an enchanted cobweb, they moved about, sat, gesticulated, conversed publicly during the day; and at night when all the lanterns but one were extinguished, their slumbering shapes covered all over by white cotton sheets on the camp bedsteads, which were brought in every evening, conveyed the gruesome suggestion of dead bodies reposing on stretchers. The food, such as it was, was served within that glorified mosquito net which everybody called the [...] "Cage" [...] without any humorous intention. At meal times the party from the yacht had the company of Lingard who attached to this ordeal a sense of duty performed at the altar of civility and conciliation. He could have no conception how much his presence added to the exasperation of Mr. Travers because Mr. Travers' manner was too intensely consistent to present any shades. It was determined by an ineradicable conviction that he was a victim held to ransom on some incomprehensible terms by an extraordinary and outrageous bandit. This conviction, strung to the highest pitch, never left him for a moment, being the object of indignant meditation to his mind, and even clinging, as it were, to his very body. It lurked in his eyes, in his gestures, in his ungracious mutters, and in his sinister silences. The shock to his moral being had ended by affecting Mr. Travers' physical machine. He was aware of hepatic pains, suffered from accesses of somnolence and suppressed gusts of fury which frightened him secretly. His complexion had acquired a yellow tinge, while his heavy eyes had become bloodshot because of the smoke of the open wood fires during his three days' detention inside Belarab's stockade. His eyes had been always very sensitive to outward conditions. D'Alcacer's fine black eyes were more enduring and his appearance did not differ very much from his ordinary appearance on board the yacht. He had accepted with smiling thanks the offer of a thin blue flannel tunic from Jorgenson. Those two men were much of the same build, though of course d'Alcacer, quietly alive and spiritually watchful, did not resemble Jorgenson, who, without being exactly macabre, behaved more like an indifferent but restless corpse. Those two could not be said to have ever conversed together. Conversation with Jorgenson was an impossible thing. Even Lingard never attempted the feat. He propounded questions to Jorgenson much as a magician would interrogate an evoked shade, or gave him curt directions as one would make use of some marvellous automaton. And that was apparently the way in which Jorgenson preferred to be treated. Lingard's real company on board the Emma was d'Alcacer. D'Alcacer had met Lingard on the easy terms of a man accustomed all his life to good society in which the very affectations must be carried on without effort. Whether affectation, or nature, or inspired discretion, d'Alcacer never let the slightest curiosity pierce the smoothness of his level, grave courtesy lightened frequently by slight smiles which often had not much connection with the words he uttered, except that somehow they made them sound kindly and as it were tactful. In their character, however, those words were strictly neutral.|$|R
