5|$|The first clear {{reference}} {{to the use of}} the Highland bagpipes is from a French history, which mentions their use at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. George Buchanan claimed that they had replaced the trumpet on the battlefield. This period saw the creation of the ceòl mór (the <b>great</b> <b>music)</b> of the bagpipe, which reflected its martial origins, with battle-tunes, marches, gatherings, salutes and laments. The Highlands in the early seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairloch. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen players in Lewis alone.|$|E

25|$|In 1861, Edmond and {{his brother}} Alphonse were {{founding}} members of the Cercle de l'Union Artistique, formed to promote performances of <b>great</b> <b>music</b> in venues other than theatres.

25|$|In {{the words}} of soprano Montserrat Caballé:She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was {{sleeping}} not only <b>great</b> <b>music</b> but great idea of interpretation.

25|$|Paz' husband Prince Ludwig Ferdinand was a <b>great</b> <b>music</b> lover. He {{played the}} violin with the Munich royal orchestra. Besides {{following}} a military career, reaching the highest ranks, he practiced medicine {{which he had}} studied at the University of Munich. He avoided palace intrigues, for {{he did not like}} court life; the couple preferred to live quietly with their three children in Schloss Nymphenburg. They surrounded themselves with Spanish artists visiting Bavaria: the composer Tomás Bretón, the violist Sarasate and the painters Rosales and Moreno Carbonero.|$|E

25|$|He {{considered}} it {{the task of}} the artist to create beauty. How the artist did this did not really matter. But originality was no virtue; personality was. <b>Great</b> <b>music,</b> like Beethoven’s, is admired because the composer’s personality shines through; Beethoven’s daring originality is now only of historical interest. However, Ryelandt was highly critical of atonality, claiming that the modernists’ “empty game of sound combinations brings us no interior enrichment at all,” and that the value of works like Honegger’s “unforgettable” Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher lay chiefly in their tonal passages.|$|E
25|$|The Tang dynasty was {{the golden}} age of Chinese music and dance. Institutions were set up to oversee the {{training}} and performances of music and dances in the imperial court, such as the <b>Great</b> <b>Music</b> Bureau (太樂署) responsible for yayue and yanyue, and the Drums and Pipes Bureau (鼓吹署) responsible for ceremonial music. Emperor Gaozu set up the Royal Academy, while Emperor Xuanzong established the Pear Garden Academy for the training of musicians, dancers and actors. There were around 30,000 musicians and dancers at the imperial court during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, with most specialising in yanyue. All were under the administration of the Drums and Pipes Bureau and an umbrella organization called the Taichang Temple (太常寺).|$|E
25|$|During the <b>Great</b> <b>Music</b> of the Ainur, Melkor {{attempted}} {{to alter the}} Music and introduced what he believed to be elements purely of his own design. As part of these efforts, he drew many weaker-willed Ainur to him, creating a counter to Eru’s main theme. Ironically, these attempts did not truly subvert the Music, but only elaborated Eru's original intentions: the Music of Eru took on depth and beauty {{precisely because of the}} strife and sadness Melkor's disharmonies (and measures to rectify them) introduced. Unlike his fellow Ainu Aulë, Melkor was too proud to admit that his creations were simply discoveries made possible entirely by Eru. Instead, Melkor aspired to the level of Eru, the true creator of all possibilities.|$|E

25|$|During Wetz's lifetime, {{his works}} {{remained}} little known outside {{the circle of}} his devotees and music-lovers in his home region, {{to the point that}} he became nearly unknown after his death. Since that time, his compositions have continued to draw few fans despite the eagerness of his enthusiasts and his reputation as a <b>great</b> <b>music</b> pedagogue. Politically, Wetz made decisions towards {{the end of his life}} that may have had an effect on his standing after his death: after the end of the First World War, he became a confessed nationalist who saw the position of his vanquished Germany as a humiliation and longed for resurgence of national greatness, which seemed possible to him in 1933 with the seizure of power by the National Socialists (the Nazis). In May of that same year he enrolled into the Nazi Party and took over the leadership of the music department of the Erfurt branch of the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur, where he hoped he could thereby gain the goodwill and the support of the Nazi rulers. This, however, had little influence on his ability to spread his work, leaving him the role of composing primarily propaganda pieces.|$|E

The film received its première at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival on 16 May and has been reviewed as [...] "a tragic masterpiece", [...] "brilliant", [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and [...] "unmissable".

500|$|Handel's {{decision}} {{to give a}} season of concerts in Dublin {{in the winter of}} 1741–42 arose from an invitation from the Duke of Devonshire, then serving as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. A violinist friend of Handel's, Matthew Dubourg, was in Dublin as the Lord Lieutenant's bandmaster; he would look after the tour's orchestral requirements. [...] Whether Handel originally intended to perform Messiah in Dublin is uncertain; he did not inform Jennens of any such plan, for the latter wrote to Holdsworth on 2 December 1741: [...] "...it was some mortification to me to hear that instead of performing Messiah here he has gone into Ireland with it." [...] After arriving in Dublin on 18 November 1741, Handel arranged [...] a subscription series of six concerts, to be held between December 1741 and [...] February 1742 at the <b>Great</b> <b>Music</b> Hall, Fishamble Street. These concerts were so popular that a second series was quickly arranged; Messiah figured in neither [...] series.|$|E
500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher {{realized}} that she had to make a choice about the direction of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's <b>great</b> <b>music</b> to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E
