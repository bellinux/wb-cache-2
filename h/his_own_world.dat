5|$|Chambers {{was cleared}} {{to compete on}} 10 June 2006, {{although}} his return was dependent on an agreement to repay prize money he won while using banned substances. He returned to competition on 11 June 2006 at the British Grand Prix and took third in 10.07s, behind Asafa Powell who equalled <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>world</b> record. Chambers stated that his training regime with Bolt had helped him make a strong opening performance despite a long absence from competition. The result placed Chambers {{at the top of}} the British rankings and was the second fastest time by a European sprinter in 2006.|$|E
5|$|After A You {{spends time}} in this world, Grandpa Beard decides that his {{problems}} are solved and returns to take {{him away from the}} imaginary world. A You protests, not wanting to return to the cold reality, but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it. Returned to <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>world,</b> A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house, where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him. A You's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder, and he eventually gets married to his co-worker and friend Su Fei. The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard's Fun House, a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard, where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness.|$|E
5|$|In the Olympic 100 m final, Bolt broke new ground, {{winning in}} 9.69 s (unofficially 9.683 s) with a {{reaction}} time of 0.165 s. This was an improvement upon <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>world</b> record, {{and he was}} well ahead of second-place finisher Richard Thompson, who finished in 9.89 s. Not only was the record set without a favourable wind (+0.0m/s), but he also visibly slowed down to celebrate before he finished and his shoelace was untied. Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished {{with a time of}} 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time. Considering factors such as Bolt's position, acceleration and velocity in comparison with second-place-finisher Thompson, the team estimated that Bolt could have finished in 9.55±0.04 s had he not slowed to celebrate before the finishing line.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 {{athletics}} season saw Gay {{rise to the}} top of {{the rankings}} for the first time and become a genuine contender in the 100m. He became the 2006 US Outdoor Champion in unfortunate circumstances: Gay originally finished second in 10.07s with a strong headwind, but Justin Gatlin's first-place finish was later rescinded for use of a banned substance. Gay significantly improved upon his previous 200m personal best by over two-tenths of a second at the IAAF Grand Prix in Lausanne. However, his time of 19.70s was not enough to beat newcomer Xavier Carter who ran the second fastest time ever with 19.63s. Improvements in the 100m followed, as he won the Rethymno track meet and set another personal best with 9.88s. Gay scored another sub-10 second 100m at the Stockholm Grand Prix, finishing second to Asafa Powell with a 9.97s, and beating Michael Johnson's British all-comers 200m record with a 19.84s win in London. Gay continued to improve at the 100m, revising his personal best to 9.84s at the Zürich Golden League meet, but it was not enough to beat Powell, who equaled <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>world</b> record of 9.77s.|$|E
5|$|The {{pressure}} in the lead-up was further compounded by the media attention surrounding Phelps, who had decided that the 200m freestyle {{would be one of}} the events in his quest for eight gold medals. This prompted many media outlets to label the race between Thorpe, van den Hoogenband, Phelps and Hackett as The Race of the Century. With the press spotlight growing, Thorpe tried to avoid media attention, resulting in a few terse media events. Thorpe's increasing focus on the 100m event, coupled with the media pressure, resulted in speculation that he was vulnerable to Hackett in the 400m event. Thorpe made a slow start in the final, reaching the 100m mark one second outside world record pace. In a topsy-turvy performance at irregular pace, there were multiple changes of lead before Thorpe established a body-length lead by 350m. He was closed down by Hackett, holding on by only 0.26s in a time three seconds outside <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>world</b> record. Thorpe appeared to shed tears in an uncharacteristic sign of emotion, admitting that the controversy surrounding the event had taken a toll on him, but denying that any liquid had left his eyes.|$|E

5000|$|Moore's seventh solo effort, In <b>His</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Worlds,</b> was {{released}} on Frogville Records on June 27, 2008.

[...] In a 2007 feature article with JamBase, Moore explained how his religion influenced the making of the album: [...] There's hypocrisy with the religious community waging these wars and damaging the environment that made me want to pull the Jesus I knew up. The Jesus I know is completely against these wars and the use of fossil fuels. The Jesus I know would never be in favor of these things. On In <b>His</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Worlds</b> I wanted him to be there in the room, to invite Jesus into the conversation, hopefully as tactfully as possible.|$|R
