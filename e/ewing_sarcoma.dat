40|$|The {{introduction}} of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic {{drugs in the}} 1970 ’s improved the survival rate of patients with bone sarcomas and allowed limb salvage surgeries. However, {{since the turn of}} the century, survival data has plateaued for a subset of metastatic, nonresponding osteo, and/or <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> In addition, most high-grade chondrosarcoma does not respond to current chemotherapy. With an increased understanding of molecular pathways governing oncogenesis, modern targeted therapy regimens may enhance the efficacy of current therapeutic modalities. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) /Extracellular-Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERK) are key regulators of oncogenic phenotypes such as proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and inflammatory responses; which are the hallmarks of cancer. Consequently, MAPK/ERK inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic targets for certain types of cancers, but there have been sparse reports in bone sarcomas. Scattered papers suggest that MAPK targeting inhibits proliferation, local invasiveness, metastasis, and drug resistance in bone sarcomas. A recent clinical trial showed some clinical benefits in patients with unresectable or metastatic osteosarcomas following MAPK/ERK targeting therapy. Despite in vitro proof of therapeutic concept, there are no sufficient in vivo or clinical data available for <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas</b> or chondrosarcomas.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Biología Molecular. Fecha de lectura: 28 - 07 - 2015 DNA replication stress (RS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common and dangerous forms of genotoxic stress, which occurs when the progression of replication forks is halted by endogenous or exogenous lesions. This frequently leads to the accumulation of highly unstable single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). If persistent, RS leads to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and genomic rearrangements that are cell-toxic. The ATR kinase {{is one of the}} key players in the response to RS, and triggers the activation of the G 2 /M checkpoint while it promotes the stability of stalled replication forks. ATR inhibiton leads to an accumulation of RS and impairs checkpoint activation, thereby causing cells to collapse due to mitotic catastrophe. Investigating the basic mechanisms of RS-driven toxicity and exploring tumors that are especially sensitive to ATR inhibitors constituted the core of the present work. On the first part we have studied the role of FBH 1, a DNA helicase thought to mediate the accumulation of ssDNA during RS and to regulate the response to RS-derived breakage. Our study leads to conclude that in mice, the contribution of FBH 1 in such processes has a minor impact either in physiological conditions or in a context of defective DNA damage repair. This might be due to compensatory mechanisms or redundant factors that evolved in mammals. On the second part we explored the role of RS in <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> These neoplasias bear a translocation between EWSR 1 and a transcription factor, most frequently FLI 1. Evidence exists that the resulting fusion proteins (most commonly EWS/FLI 1) act as oncogenic transcription factors and cause tumorigenesis. Less attention has been put on the actual role of EWS, the product of EWSR 1, and how a loss of function of EWS can impact on tumorigenesis. Our work firstly demonstrates that <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas</b> suffer a high degree of RS and therefore are suitable candidates for treatment with ATR inhibitors. Next we demonstrate that R-loops are responsible for RS in <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> and that R-loop accumulation is caused by the absence of EWS activity. This might be due to a dominant-negative effect of EWS/FLI 1 over EWS. Furthermore, we propose a model for EWS R-loop-suppressor function, by which self-aggregation around R-loops promotes R-loop removal. Finally we describe a phenotype of neurodegeneration in adult EWS-depleted mice, which reveals a role for EWS in preventing ALS-linked neurodegeneration...|$|R

40|$|Oncogenic {{activation}} of the ETS Related Gene (ERG) in humans was originally identified in subsets of <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> myeloid leukemias and, recently, {{in the majority of}} prostate cancers. Expression of human ERG protein and consequently its functions in normal and disease states needs to be better understood in light of its suggested role in cell differentiation and proliferation. Here, we analyzed temporal and spatial expression of the Erg (mouse protein) by immunohistochemical analysis during mouse embryonic and adult organogenesis using a highly specific ERG monoclonal antibody (ERG MAb). This study establishes widespread immunolocalization of Erg protein in endothelial cells and restricted expression in precartilage and hematopoietic tissues. Intriguingly, Erg is not expressed in any epithelial tissue including prostate epithelium, or in infiltrating lymphocytes that are occasionally seen in the prostate environment, a common site of tumors with ERG rearrangements and unscheduled ERG expression.

40|$|EWS-FLI 1, a multi-functional fusion oncogene, is {{exclusively}} {{detected in}} <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas.</b> However, previous studies reported that rare varieties of osteosarcomas also harbor EWS-ETS family fusion. Here, using the doxycycline-inducible EWS-FLI 1 system, we established an EWS-FLI 1 -dependent osteosarcoma model from murine bone marrow stromal cells. We {{revealed that the}} withdrawal of EWS-FLI 1 expression enhances the osteogenic differentiation of sarcoma cells, leading to mature bone formation. Taking advantage of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, we also show that sarcoma-derived iPSCs with cancer-related genetic abnormalities exhibited an impaired differentiation program of osteogenic lineage irrespective of the EWS-FLI 1 expression. Finally, we demonstrate that EWS-FLI 1 contributed to secondary sarcoma development from the sarcoma iPSCs after osteogenic differentiation. These findings demonstrate that modulating cellular differentiation is a fundamental principle of EWS-FLI 1 -induced osteosarcoma development. This in vitro cancer model using sarcoma iPSCs should provide a unique platform for dissecting relationships between the cancer genome and cellular differentiation...|$|R

40|$|Members of the ETS {{transcription}} factor family have {{been implicated in}} several cancers, where they are often dysregulated by genomic derangement. ETS variant 1 (ETV 1) is an ETS factor gene that undergoes chromosomal translocation in prostate cancers and <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> amplification in melanomas, and lineage dysregulation in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Pharmacologic perturbation of ETV 1 would be appealing in these cancers; however, oncogenic {{transcription factor}}s are often deemed “undruggable” by conventional methods. Here, we used small-molecule microarray screens to identify and characterize drug-like compounds that modulate the biologic function of ETV 1. We identified the 1, 3, 5 -triazine small molecule BRD 32048 as a top candidate ETV 1 perturbagen. BRD 32048 binds ETV 1 directly, modulating both ETV 1 -mediated transcriptional activity and invasion of ETV 1 -driven cancer cells. Moreover, BRD 32048 inhibits p 300 -dependent acetylation of ETV 1, thereby promoting its degradation. These results point to {{a new avenue for}} pharmacologic ETV 1 inhibition and may inform a general means to discover small molecule perturbagens of transcription factor oncoproteins.

The authors objective was to evaluate clinical features and treatment results observed {{in a series of}} Italian patients over a 24 -year period. METHODS: Fifty-two patients age 8 - 18 years (median 8 years) were observed (1979 - 2002). Primary sites were on the lower limbs in 41 and on the upper limbs in 11 cases. Clinical TNM and surgical Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Staging systems were adopted. Therapeutic guidelines recommended an initial biopsy plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Aggressive delayed surgery of residual disease, including compartmental resections, was recommended. Radiotherapy was suggested only for patients age > 3 years when surgery was incomplete or not feasible. RESULTS: The evaluation was performed dividing the patients into two categories according to their chemosensitivity.

40|$|<b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas</b> (ES) {{are highly}} {{malignant}} bone or soft tissue tumors. Genetically, ES {{are defined by}} balanced chromosomal EWS/ETS translocations, which give rise to chimeric proteins (EWS-ETS) that generate an oncogenic transcriptional program associated with altered epigenetic marks throughout the genome. By use of an inhibitor (JQ 1) blocking BET bromodomain binding proteins (BRDs) we strikingly observed a strong down-regulation of the predominant EWS-ETS protein EWS-FLI 1 in a dose dependent manner. This was further enhanced by co-treatment with an inhibitor of the PI 3 K pathway. Microarray analysis further revealed JQ 1 treatment to block a typical ES associated expression program. The effect on this expression program was mimicked by RNA interference with BRD 3 or BRD 4 expression, indicating that the EWS-FLI 1 mediated expression profile is {{at least in part}} mediated via such epigenetic readers. Consequently, contact dependent and independent proliferation of different ES lines was strongly inhibited. Mechanistically, treatment of ES resulted in a partial arrest of the cell cycle as well as induction of apoptosis. Tumor development was suppressed dose dependently in a xeno-transplant model in immune deficient mice, overall indicating that ES may be susceptible to treatment with epigenetic inhibitors blocking BET bromodomain activity and the associated pathognomonic EWS-ETS transcriptional program...|$|R

The natural ligands {{for these}} receptors are the {{peptides}} of the NPY family, including the neurotransmitter NPY {{and the two}} gut hormones peptide YY (PYY) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP). Via binding to the NPY receptors, these peptides regulate {{a wide variety of}} physiologic functions such as digestion, vasoconstriction, and reproduction. They also {{play a key role in}} eating behavior [10]. On this basis, Y 2 and Y 4 receptor agonists and Y 1 and Y 5 receptor antagonists have become potential drugs against overweight that are currently evaluated for this application [11]. On the other hand, since Y 1 and Y 2 receptors are highly over-expressed in breast cancer, <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas,</b> neuroblastomas, and high-grade gliomas [7, 12 – 14], the use of radiolabeled Y 1 and Y 2 receptor ligands for an NPY receptor-targeted imaging and radiotherapy of these tumors, was suggested [1, 15]. It is worth mentioning that in those tumors, the presence of a significant amount of Y 4 or Y 5 receptors was not observed [8]. A daunorubicin-coupled cytotoxic NPY analog [16], a Y 2 -selective, 99 mTc-labeled radioactive NPY analog [17], and more recently, a 99 mTc-labeled Y 1 agonist were developed [18]. Preliminary clinical data on Y 1 -targeted tumor imaging with the latter compound in breast cancer patients are encouraging [18].|$|R
40|$|Usage {{of cancer}} cell lines has {{repeatedly}} generated conflicting results provoked by differences among subclones or contamination with mycoplasm or other immortal mammalian cells. To overcome these limitations, we decided within the EuroBoNeT consortium to characterize {{a common set}} of cell lines including osteosarcomas (OS), <b>Ewing</b> <b>sarcomas</b> (ES), and chondrosarcomas (CS). DNA fingerprinting was used to guarantee the identity of all of the cell lines and to distinguish subclones of osteosarcoma cell line HOS. Screening for homozygous loss of 38 tumor suppressor genes by MLPA revealed deletion of CDKN 2 A as the most common event (15 / 36), strictly associated with absence of the CDKN 2 A (p 16) protein. Ten cell lines showed missense mutations of the TP 53 gene while another set of nine cell lines showed mutations resulting in truncation of the TP 53 protein. Cells harboring missense mutations expressed high levels of nuclear TP 53, while cell lines with nonsense mutations showed weak/absent staining for TP 53. TP 53 wt cell lines usually expressed the protein in 2 - 10 % of the cells. However, seven TP 53 wt osteosarcomas were negative for both mRNA and protein expression. Our analyses shed light on the correlation between immunohistochemical and genetic data for CDKN 2 A and TP 53, and confirm the importance of these signaling pathways. The characterization of a substantial number of cell lines represents an important step to supply research groups with proven models for further advanced studies on tumor biology and may help to make results from different laboratories more comparable.
