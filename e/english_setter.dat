5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, near the mouth of the Somme. This caused the infusion of <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{competition}} at Westminster {{was restricted to}} champions only. A dog can only become a champion by gaining championship points at other conformation shows. Prior to 1992, admission to dogs was open, and in 1938 an <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> named Daro of Maridor was the Best in Show title at Westminster in his very first outing at a dog show {{at the age of}} 11 months.

Those known to sometimes occur in <b>English</b> <b>Setters</b> can include congenital deafness, which was reported as affecting 12.4 percent of the 701 <b>English</b> <b>Setters</b> tested by the Louisiana State University in 2010. As at 2013, {{there has not been}} any detailed research on this condition undertaken in the UK; autoimmune thyroiditis, which was shown to affect 26.2 percent of 747 <b>English</b> <b>Setters</b> examined between January 1974 until December 2012 in an Orthopedic Foundation for Animals listing; canine hypothyroidism; elbow dysplasia; and allergies, which can include some sensitivity to certain food ingredients and also skin conditions, are known to occur.|$|R

5|$|The breed {{has many}} {{similarities}} with the Picardy Spaniel {{due to the}} two breeds' recent history. The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, {{as well as the}} obvious difference in coat color. The Picardy has a brown coat whereas the Blue Picardy has a black and grey coat, which was brought into the breed by the introduction of <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> blood. Similar in the modern era due to the close similarities of the two different breed standards. In addition, the Blue Picardy is a little faster, and has a slightly finer nose.|$|E
5|$|The Picardy Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in France {{for use as}} a gundog. It is related to the Blue Picardy Spaniel, and still has many similarities, but the Picardy Spaniel is the older of the two breeds. It is thought {{to be one of the}} two oldest continental spaniel breeds and was favoured by the French nobility, remaining popular for hunting after the French Revolution due to its weather resistant coat that enabled it to hunt in a variety of conditions and terrain. However its popularity waned following the influx of English hunting breeds in the early 20th century. Slightly smaller than an <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> but larger than most of its spaniel cousins, it has no major health issues although as with many breeds with pendulous ears, it can be prone to ear infections.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{became more}} popular still {{following}} the French Revolution and the aftermath in which hunting {{was no longer}} restricted to the nobility. Although spread throughout France, a large concentration was located in the north west where the weather resistant coat of the breed made it ideal for the wooded and swampy conditions. During the early 19th century, British hunters crossed the channel to hunt in the grounds of north west France. The British brought their own hunting dogs, and {{this resulted in a}} change of preference as French hunters switched to English breeds and caused a major blow to the existence of the Picardy Spaniel. In addition the infusion of blood from the <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> into the local spaniel population created the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E

50|$|They rank 37th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, {{being of}} above average working/obedience intelligence. <b>English</b> <b>Setters</b> are very {{intelligent}} {{and can be}} trained to perform about any task another breed can do, {{with the exception of}} herding. However, they are not always easy to train, as their natural bird instinct tends to distract them in outdoor environments. Their temperament is considered to be gentle and as <b>English</b> <b>Setters</b> can be very sensitive to criticism, positive reinforcement training methods using treats and praise work best when undertaking basic training.|$|R

25|$|In 1874, the American Field put {{together}} the Field Dog Stud Book and registry of dogs in the United States was born. The FDSB is the oldest pure-bred registry in the United States. At that time, dogs could be registered even when bred from sires and dams of different breeds. At about this time, the Llewellin Setter was bred using blood lines from the Lavarack breeding of <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> and, among other breeds, bloodlines from native Irish Setters. Around the same time, the red Irish Setter became a favourite in the dog show ring.|$|E

It was also compared to the <b>English</b> <b>Setter</b> in its build, shape, and proportions, although it was a much smaller size. While other field spaniels of this era displayed colours other than liver and white or liver and black, the Norfolk did not. The breed-specific qualities varied greatly as in some places the breeding lines were not kept particularly pure, those lines having had stock from Sussex and Clumber Spaniels bred into them.|$|E

GB decides to name the pup Weed, after the English word for wild plant, because he is [...] "small but powerful". Upon {{arriving}} at Ōu, the pair learn that a monstrous creature is wreaking havoc and Ōu has fallen into turmoil. Gin is away, on a desperate search for his mate. Weed, GB, and other Ōu soldiers meet a team of dogs led by the German shepherd Jerome. Jerome explains that the monster is a mutated dog that escaped from a laboratory after killing several scientists. Weed's group joins them and they succeed in killing the monster, though lose several soldiers in the process, among them Gin's old ally, Smith.|$|E

6000|$|Youatt infers, from a {{comparison}} of an old picture of King Charles's spaniels with the living dog, that [...] "the breed of the present day is materially altered for the worse:" [...] the muzzle has become shorter, the forehead more prominent, and the eyes larger; the changes in this case have probably been due to simple selection. The setter, as this author remarks in another place, [...] "is evidently the large spaniel improved to his present peculiar size and beauty, and taught another way of marking his game. If {{the form of the}} dog were not sufficiently satisfactory on this point, we might have recourse to history:" [...] he then refers to a document dated 1685 bearing on this subject, and adds that the pure Irish setter shows no signs of a cross with the pointer, which some authors suspect has been the case with the <b>English</b> <b>setter.</b> The bulldog is an English breed, and as I hear from Mr. G.R. Jesse (1/85. Author of 'Researches into the History of the British Dog.), seems to have originated from the mastiff since the time of Shakspeare; but certainly existed in 1631, as shown by Prestwick Eaton's letters. There {{can be no doubt that}} the fancy bulldogs of the present day, now that they are not used for bull-baiting, have become greatly reduced in size, without any express intention on the part of the breeder. Our pointers are certainly descended from a Spanish breed, as even their present names, Don, Ponto, Carlos, etc., show; it is said that they were not known in England before the Revolution in 1688 (1/86. See Col. Hamilton Smith on the antiquity of the Pointer, in 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 196.); but the breed since its introduction has been much modified, for Mr. Borrow, who is a sportsman and knows Spain intimately well, informs me that he has not seen in that country any breed [...] "corresponding in figure with the English pointer; but there are genuine pointers near Xeres which have been imported by English gentlemen." [...] A nearly parallel case is offered by the Newfoundland dog, which was certainly brought into England from that country, but which has since been so much modified that, as several writers have observed, it does not now closely resemble any existing native dog in Newfoundland. (1/87. The Newfoundland dog is believed to have originated from a cross between the Esquimaux dog and a large French hound. See Dr. Hodgkin 'British Assoc.' 1844; Bechstein 'Naturgesch. Deutschland' b. 1 s. 574; 'Nat. Lib.' volume 10 page 132; also Mr. Jukes 'Excursion in and about Newfoundland.') ...|$|E
