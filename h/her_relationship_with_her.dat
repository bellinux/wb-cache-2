500|$|The {{theme of}} family and family {{relationships}} (which scholar Mary Jane Lupton called [...] "kinship concerns"), from the character-defining experience of Angelou's parents' abandonment to <b>her</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> son, husbands, friends, and lovers are important in all of her books.

Motherhood was a theme that connected all of Angelou's autobiographies, specifically her experiences as a single mother, a daughter, and a granddaughter.
