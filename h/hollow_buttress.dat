5000|$|In October 1943 the {{construction}} of a permanent concrete weir at this location began. This was completed and began use in January 1944 and became known as Aplin's Weir. The weir consisted of a <b>hollow</b> <b>buttress</b> weir with sloped walls {{on both sides of the}} weir and concrete abutments. repairs occurred several times during the 1950s after flood damage. The downstream slope of Aplin's Weir has in recent years deteriorated and much of the concrete slope has collapsed exposing the buttresses. The weir received a significant upgrade in 2011(??).|$|E
5000|$|The current project {{contains}} a main earth-fill dam with an inclined clay core and other random fills, two saddle dams (earth-fill dams) {{at the left}} bank and a 240 m concrete dam (<b>hollow</b> <b>buttress</b> type) at the right bank. The concrete dam includes eight bottom outlets, a spillway and four power intakes and conduits, a stilling basin, headrace and tailrace channels. There is a power house, close to the concrete dam. The Badush Dam's spillway will have a maximum output of each hydro-power unit will have a capacity of [...] {{for a total of}} [...] The bottom outlets, power station and spillway combined afford a discharge capacity of ...|$|E
50|$|In Thailand, {{this species}} {{is known to}} form small colonies inhabiting caves and is {{considered}} a rare species (Lekagul & McNeely, 1977). In Peninsular Malaysia, the species has been recorded roosting in a cave and in the <b>hollow</b> <b>buttress</b> of a tree and shares its roosting site with Hipposideros ridleyi (Kingston et al. 2006; Francis, 2008). In Philippines, this species was previously known as C. hirsutus and recorded only from Mindoro Island (Nowak, 1994; Wilson & Reeder, 2005). However, Hill (1972) suggested that C. hirsutus was a conspecific species of C. robinsoni. Until now, the ecology and habitat preference is still poorly known, due mainly to the species being difficult to catch. Throughout its distribution {{it is not known}} whether the small number of specimens is due to low population numbers or it has a high level of trap and net avoidance due to a combination of flight pattern and sensitive echolocation.|$|E
5000|$|The first waters {{reached into}} the city gates in 1620, to a provisionary {{fountain}} at the Church of Madalena. On 23 June 1622, the aqueduct and Fonte da Misericórdia was inaugurated, but, owing to structural problems with the [...] "completed" [...] project, interventions were needed. In 1625, {{it was decided to}} construct <b>hollowed</b> <b>buttresses,</b> filled in with dirt and loose stone. Ancillary projects began to develop following the completion of the main project, including diversion of water down the Rua de São Lourenço, a lengthy project owing to the rock substrata. These projects resulted in the extension of the taxes on 1 August 1627, for another two years, that included the construction of city's fountains. By 1628, the aqueduct was successfully fed the Fonte da Misericórdia, Chafariz da Madalena, Chafariz de São Lourenço, Chafariz de São Domingos, Chafariz de São Vicente and the Chafariz da Alameda, and construction of fountains of Biquinha, Cavaleiros and São José were underway.|$|R
50|$|The Uganda ironwood or Muhimbi (Cynometra alexandri) is {{a species}} of legume that occurs in {{tropical}} lowland forests of central and east Africa. They grow gregariously in drier forest types and as a constituent of swamp forests. They reach some 120 ft to 150 ft in height, and larger trees often develop <b>hollow</b> boles and <b>buttress</b> roots.|$|R
50|$|Black Weir, {{formerly}} Black School Weir, is {{the most}} upstream weir of those on Ross River. Built in the early 1930s, Black Weir is a <b>hollow</b> <b>buttress</b> weir with an ogee shaped face on the downstream side, a sloped face on the upstream face and stone pitched abutments. The weir's name {{is derived from the}} name of Black School which abutted Ross River near the location of weir when it was constructed. Following damage to the weir due to flooding, the weir underwent major renovations in 1934. These renovations included the addition of a second pump well, the addition of further buttresses and the underpinning of the original structure. It took until 1936 to fill the reservoir behind the weir, but only provided a few years water supply. During World War II the large influxes of population as a result of Townsville's heavy military presence necessitated the provision of more water. In 1940 a galvanized iron wall was erected atop Black Weir to provide additional storage capacity to supplement the town's water supply. This continued for many years in order to provide additional water which could be pumped from the weir.|$|E
50|$|Originally, Haweswater was {{a natural}} lake about four {{kilometres}} long, nearly divided by a tongue of land at Measand; the two reaches of the lake were known as High Water and Low Water. The building of the dam raised the water level by 29 metres (95 feet) and created a reservoir six kilometres (four miles) long and around 600 metres (almost half a mile) wide. The dam wall measures 470 metres long and 27.5 metres high; {{at the time of}} construction it was considered to be cutting-edge technology as it was the world's first <b>hollow</b> <b>buttress</b> dam, using 44 separate buttressed units joined by flexible joints. A parapet, 1.4 metres (56 inches) wide, runs the length of the dam and from this, tunnelled supplies can be seen entering the reservoir from the adjoining valleys of Heltondale and Swindale. When the reservoir is full, it holds 84 billion litres (18.6 billion gallons) of water. The reservoir is now owned by United Utilities PLC. It supplies about 25% of the North West's water supply.Before the valley was flooded in 1935, all the farms and dwellings of the villages of Mardale Green and Measand were demolished, as well as the centuries-old Dun Bull Inn at Mardale Green. The village church was dismantled and the stone used in constructing the dam; all the bodies in the churchyard were exhumed and re-buried at Shap. Today, when the water in the reservoir is low, the remains of the submerged village of Mardale Green can still be seen, including stone walls and the village bridge.|$|E
