5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

25|$|Some insects {{present in}} the grapes at harvest inevitably {{end up in the}} press {{and for the most part}} are inoffensive. Others, notably types of ladybirds, or the multicoloured Asian lady beetle, release {{unpleasant}} volatile compounds as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's bouquet and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compounds are methoxypyrazines, or pyrazines, that are perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter herb, <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper,</b> or cat urine. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so ladybird taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

500|$|There are {{a couple}} of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavors that are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The most widely {{recognized}} is the herbaceous or <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> flavor caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in underripened grapes. Pyrazine compounds are [...] present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as [...] 2 nanograms (ng) per liter. At the time of veraison, when the grapes first start to fully ripen, there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30ng/l. In cooler climates, it is difficult to get Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected. The <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> flavor is not considered a wine fault {{but it may not be}} desirable to all consumers' tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavor, earning the nickname of [...] "Monterey veggies". In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can have the effect of shutting down the grape vines and further inhibiting ripeness.|$|E
500|$|The classic {{profile of}} Cabernet Sauvignon {{tends to be}} {{full-bodied}} wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity {{that contributes to the}} wine's aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon tends to produce wines with blackcurrant notes that can be accompanied by <b>green</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> notes, mint and cedar which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates the blackcurrant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes while in very hot climates the currant flavors can veer towards the over-ripe and [...] "jammy" [...] side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have a characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes.|$|E
