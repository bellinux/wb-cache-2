5000|$|The {{effects of}} the {{imagined}} contact hypothesis extend beyond increasing explicit and implicit attitudes to impact behavioral intentions such as engaging with outgroup members. Researchers showed that having non-Muslim British undergraduate students imagine contact with an outgroup Muslim lead to greater intentions (measured via a Likert scale survey) to engage with Muslims in the future, compared to a control condition. [...] This work has been replicated {{using a variety of}} outgroup targets such as ethnic minorities in Cyprus, gay men and asylum seekers. [...] In the cases described, behavioral intention to engage was measured via survey items such as <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to [...] "avoid" [...] or [...] "talk to" [...] an outgroup member. This work has also been replicated in school-aged children. [...] Beyond simply intentions to engage, the imagined contact paradigm also influences social distancing. For example, one study showed that undergraduate participants who first imagined a positive interaction with an obese individual subsequently positioned chairs closer together when they thought they would be interacting and discussing society's perception of obesity with an obese individual.|$|E
5000|$|A very {{ordinary}} man named Howard Mitla, {{who has a}} strange aptitude for Jeopardy!, is confronted by the bizarre sight of a human finger poking {{its way out of}} the drain in his apartment's bathroom sink. He tries to deny the reality of what is happening, but the solitary digit eventually proves to be infinitely long and multijointed, and capable of attacking him. Mitla burns it with a bottle of heavy-duty drain cleaner, then chops it off with a pair of electric hedge trimmers. Howard, after cutting up the finger, starts thinking about the creature to which it was attached. He realizes it really had multiple digits and that there were several openings in an average bathroom, and an ominous sound is heard from the toilet. Investigating reports of noise coming from Howard's apartment, the police arrive to find him lying in a daze next to the toilet. He tells them, [...] "If {{you have to go to}} the bathroom, I definitely suggest you hold it." [...] The toilet lid pops up. The story ends with the officer lifting the lid after Howard asks, [...] "Final Jeopardy. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to wager?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} of the practice-oriented research strategy is to develop knowledge about the improvement of practices. Practice oriented research is research in which the research goal {{is coming from the}} professional practice and in which the knowledge created in the research contributes directly to this professional practice. The problem does not originate in theory, and the knowledge created in the research is not valued because it contributes to theory. It is not knowledge-for-its-own-sake, but the knowledge is valued because it contributes to the improvement of the practice which is considered (by ministers and lay people) to be a problem. Practice-orientated research is especially relevant to congregational studies because the congregational ministry is conducted within a specific context that is challenging it to be relevant. The major steps or questions in developing a research design of practice oriented research is: what is the problem you are going to study? Why is it interesting to get this new knowledge and for whom is it interesting? How are you going to reach your research objective? <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to know? And what are the conceptual instruments which you are going to use in your research? In following these steps the specific research orientation of practice oriented research is introduced...|$|E
