40|$|Experimental {{studies suggest}} that {{thromboxane}} A 2 could {{play a role in}} the pulmonary hypertension of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We therefore investigated the hemodynamic and gasometric effects of <b>dazoxiben,</b> a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, in seven patients who had developed ARDS. The patients were studied for 120 minutes after a single intravenous bolus of 1. 5 mg of <b>dazoxiben</b> per kilogram of body weight. During this period, there was no change in pulmonary hemodynamics, a moderate increase in arterial oxygen pressure, and a slight decrease in venous admixture. Therefore, administration of <b>dazoxiben</b> in patients with ARDS does not decrease pulmonary hypertension.

40|$|Thromboxane synthase {{inhibition}} {{can lead}} to two opposing effects: accumulation of proaggregatory cyclic endoperoxides and increased formation of antiaggregatory PGI 2 and PGD 2.

In a first study, in 10 healthy male volunteers, the combined administration of the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13. 177 and the thromboxane synthase inhibitor <b>dazoxiben</b> gave stronger inhibition of platelet aggregation and prolonged the bleeding time more than either drug alone.

40|$|SUMMARY. We {{examined}} {{the role of}} thromboxane in mediating the alterations in pulmonary hemodynamics and in lung fluid and protein exchange after thrombin. Studies were made in control sheep and in sheep pretreated with the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, <b>Dazoxiben</b> (injection of 10 mg/kg followed by infusion of 4 mg/kg per hr). Thrombin infusion caused an increase in mixed venous and aortic concentrations of thromboxane B 2, a stable degradation product of thromboxane A 2, whereas the concentrations of 6 -keto-PGFia, a degradation product of prostacyclin, did not change significantly. In sheep pretreated with <b>Dazoxiben,</b> thromboxane B 2 concentrations did not increase, indicating effectiveness of the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor. The blood concentrations of 6 -keto-PGFia after thrombin increased in the thromboxane synthetase-inhibited group, indicating shunting towards prostacyclin synthesis. Thrombin in untreated sheep increased pulmonary lymph flow (Qiym) and the lymph protein clearance (Qiym * lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio).

Indomethacin and EPO 45 (a thromboxane receptor antagonist) partially inhibited platelet aggregation in rats. It was concluded that only one third of the aggregatory response to collagen was mediated by the products of cyclo-oxygenase conversion of arachidonic acid. In rats, <b>dazoxiben</b> was inactive although the conversion of the prostaglandin endoperoxides to thromboxane A 2 was inhibited (measured as thromboxane B 2). 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha was detected in plasma after collagen was injected into dazoxiben-treated rats. In this species therefore, the endoperoxides have significant aggregatory activity whilst the apparent increase in the level of prostacyclin was not sufficient to have any anti-aggregatory effect. All three drugs were active in the guinea-pig. About 60 % of the aggregatory response to collagen was due to the products of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, the main mediator being thromboxane A 2. In guinea-pigs, <b>dazoxiben</b> also elevated 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha in the plasma after an injection of collagen.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{thromboxane}} synthetase inhibitors (<b>dazoxiben</b> and UK 38485) were investigated on the cardiovascular and metabolic effects of Escherichia coli endotoxin infusion in the conscious, unrestrained rat. Infusion of E. coli endotoxin (41. 7 ng kg- 1 min- 1) for 4 h produced a fall in mean arterial pressure, {{an increase in}} heart rate, a transient hyperglycaemia (at 1 h) followed by hypoglycaemia (evident at 6 h), an elevation in plasma lactate and a profound thrombocytopenia. The above changes were accompanied by a marked elevation in plasma thromboxane B 2 concentrations (e. g. endotoxin-treated 935 +/- 150 pg ml- 1 at 1 h compared with pre-endotoxin values of 125 +/- 30 pg ml- 1). The administration of either <b>dazoxiben</b> (30 mg kg- 1 i. v., given 30 min before starting the endotoxin infusion) or UK 38485 (15 mg kg- 1 given 30 min before, and again 4 h after, starting the endotoxin infusion) prevented the rise in plasma thromboxane B 2 concentrations. Neither <b>dazoxiben</b> nor UK 38485 prevented the metabolic, cardiovascular or thrombocytopenic effects of endotoxin and did not modify mortality.

40|$|The {{immersion}} of a limb in {{a mixture}} of water and ice induces in normal humans an initial vasoconstriction mediated mainly by catecholamine release. In some studies the cold pressor test was associated with an increase in vasoconstrictor thromboxane A 2 and in vasodilating prostacyclin. <b>Dazoxiben</b> hydrochloride, a thromboxane synthase inhibitor, has been reported to suppress cold-induced vasoconstriction. We compared in a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study the effects of indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor), <b>dazoxiben</b> hydrochloride, and BM 13. 177 (a novel thromboxane receptor antagonist) on the changes in cutaneous vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure induced by cold in 12 healthy volunteers. Cold challenge produced an increase in blood pressure and an initial decrease in finger blood flow, reflecting an increase in cutaneous vascular resistance. Neither effective suppression of thromboxane A 2 generation or of the effects of thromboxane A 2 on platelets by the three active treatments nor increase in prostacyclin generation after ingestion of <b>dazoxiben</b> hydrochloride modified the hemodynamic response to cold.

Prostaglandin E 2 has been shown previously to inhibit mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. U 46619, a stable thromboxane A 2 analog, slightly enhanced lymphocyte responses to mitogens in the presence of <b>dazoxiben</b> and in the presence of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin). This occurred at concentrations of U 46619 which are probably supraphysiological in view of the short half-life of natural thromboxane A 2. Finally, the thromboxane A 2 receptor blocker BM 13. 177 did not have any effect on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation. It is concluded that thromboxane A 2 has no or minimal modulatory effects on lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens and that the effect of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition is rather due to reorientation of cyclic endoperoxide metabolism, resulting in increased prostaglandin E 2 production. status: publishe...|$|E

The techniques used in this in vitro study were platelet aggregometry in whole blood, and measurement of platelet thromboxane B 2 and prostaglandin E 2 production and leucocyte production of 6 -keto-PGF 1 α. The platelet-subendothelium interaction was evaluated in rabbit aorta subendothelium preparations exposed to flowing blood at a shear stress of 800 s− 1. Morphometric methods were used to calculate the percentage of subendothelium occupied by platelets. The 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of DT-TX 30 in whole blood was in the range of 10 − 7 μM (induced with collagen or arachidonic acid) to 10 − 5 μM (induced with thrombin) or 10 − 4 (induced with ADP). IC 50 values under all experimental conditions were lower with DT–TX 30 than with ASA. For thromboxane B 2 the IC 50 were: ASA 0. 84 ± 0. 05 μM, <b>dazoxiben</b> 765 ± 54 μM, DT–TX 30 8. 54 ± 0. 60 μM. Prostaglandin E 2 was inhibited only by ASA (IC 50 1. 21 ± 0. 08 μM). Leucocyte 6 -keto-PGF 1 α was inhibited by ASA (IC 50 6. 58 ± 0. 76 μM) and increased by <b>dazoxiben</b> and DT–TX 30. The greatest reduction in percentage subendothelial surface occupied by platelets after blood perfusion was seen after treatment with DT–TX 30 in the range of concentrations that inhibited collagen-induced platelet aggregation (control group: 31. 20 ± 3. 8 %, DT-TX 30 at 0. 1 μM: 10. 71 ± 0. 55 %, at 1. 0 μM: 6. 53 ± 0. 44 %, at 5. 0 μM; 1. 48 ± 0. 07 %). All three drugs reduced thrombus formation, although ASA (unlike <b>dazoxiben</b> or DT–TX 30) increased the percentage surface occupied by adhesions.

In 136 studies the agents were given twice daily by oral administration both singly and in combination. The antithrombotic efficacy {{of a given}} therapy was determined by its capacity to interrupt steady-state platelet utilization induced by thrombogenic arteriovenous cannulae. When given alone, dipyridamole and sulfinpyrazone reduced {{the rate at which}} platelets were utilized by thrombus formation in a dose-dependent manner with essentially complete interruption by dipyridamole at 10 mg/kg per d. In contrast, neither aspirin (2 - 100 mg/kg per d) nor <b>dazoxiben</b> (20 - 100 mg/kg per d) decreased cannula platelet consumption detectably despite the striking reduction in the capacity of platelets to produce thromboxane B 2. However, aspirin, but not <b>dazoxiben,</b> potentiated the antithrombotic effects of dipyridamole and sulfinpyrazone in a dose-dependent fashion without changing the pharmacokinetics for any of the agents. Complete potentiation required aspirin at 20 mg/kg per d to be given with each dose of dipyridamole. Because dazoxiben's blockade of platelet thromboxane A 2 production was not associated with antithrombotic potentiation, and because complete potentiation by aspirin required a dose that fully inhibited vascular production of prostaglandin I 2 (PGI 2), we conclude that aspirin's potentiating effect on dipyridamole is independent of PGI 2 production or inhibition of thromboxane A 2 formation.

The presented study does not give one single clue as to the origin (platelet, vessel wall or other) of the prostanoid, but very likely originates from platelets because a very low dose of acetylsalicylic acid (250 to 500 mg every other day), which irreversibly inhibits platelet cyclooxygenase, is highly effective in the prevention of erythromelalgia in thrombocythaemia...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{prostaglandin}} endoperoxides, which continue to be formed in the setting of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition, might influence the fate of ischemic myocardium in a model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion. BACKGROUND: It was recently demonstrated that thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitors reduce ischemic myocardial injury through a redirection of prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxides toward the synthesis of "cardioprotective" prostaglandins, such as PGI 2, PGE 2 and PGD 2. However, part of these prostaglandin endoperoxides may also stimulate a receptor, shared with thromboxane A 2, mediating platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion, followed by 5. 5 h of reperfusion. Fifteen minutes before reperfusion, the animals were randomized to receive 1) saline solution (control animals, n = 8); 2) SQ 29548, a potent and selective thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); 3) <b>dazoxiben,</b> a selective thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitor (n = 8); 4) R 68070 (Ridogrel), a drug with dual thromboxane A 2 synthase-inhibiting and thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptor-blocking properties (n = 8); or 5) aspirin + R 68070 (n = 8). RESULTS: <b>Dazoxiben</b> and R 68070, but not SQ 29548, significantly reduced thromboxane B 2 formation and increased plasma levels of 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha, PGE 2 and PGF 2 alpha. Ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by U 46619 (a thromboxane A 2 mimetic) was inhibited by SQ 29548 and R 68070 but not by <b>dazoxiben.</b> In control animals, infarct size determined at the end of the experiment by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining averaged 57. 7 +/- 3. 2 % of the area at risk of infarction. The administration of SQ 29548 did not significantly reduce infarct size compared with that in control animals, whereas <b>dazoxiben</b> and R 68070 significantly reduced infarct size to 36. 7 +/- 2. 8 % and 16. 6 +/- 3. 6 % of area at risk of infarction, respectively (p < 0. 001 vs. control values). In rabbits treated with R 68070, infarct size was also significantly smaller than that of dazoxiben-treated rabbits (p < 0. 01). This protective effect of R 68070 was completely abolished when the drug was administered with aspirin, infarct size in this group averaging 59. 7 +/- 1. 6 % (p = NS vs. control values). No differences in regional myocardial blood flow, systemic blood pressure, heart rate or extent of area at risk were observed among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, prostaglandin endoperoxides play an important role in modulating the cardioprotective effects of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitors. The simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane A 2 synthase and blockade of thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptors by R 68070 identify a pharmacologic interaction of potential therapeutic importance...|$|E

However, with <b>dazoxiben</b> treatment both TPR and CVP decreased. The H 2 -receptor antagonist cimetidine reduced C 5 a-induced hypotension and diminished prostanoid release. Both the hypotensive response and elevated prostanoid release were observed after C 5 a challenge in animals rendered neutropenic prior to challenge. It is concluded that C 5 a-induced arterial hypotension in the rabbit is a PMN-independent reaction, mediated through cyclooxygenase products and, to some degree, by histamine. The mechanism producing systemic arterial hypotension does not seem to involve peripheral vasodilation but appears to be a secondary effect of pulmonary vasoconstriction, possibly mediated by TxA 2...|$|E

Coronary thrombosis was induced in 35 dogs by placing a copper coil into the left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary flow was measured with a Doppler flow probe. 30 min after thrombus formation, the animals received saline (controls, n = 10); SQ 29548 (0. 4 mg/kg bolus + 0. 4 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA 2 /PGH 2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); <b>dazoxiben</b> (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a TxA 2 synthase inhibitor (n = 9); or R 68070 (5 mg/kg bolus + 5 mg/kg per h infusion), a drug that blocks TxA 2 /PGH 2 receptors and inhibits TxA 2 synthase (n = 8). Then, all dogs received heparin (200 U/kg) and a bolus of t-PA (80 micrograms/kg) followed by a continuous infusion (8 micrograms/kg per min) for up to 90 min or until reperfusion was achieved. The time to thrombolysis did not change significantly in SQ 29548 -treated dogs as compared with controls (42 +/- 5 vs. 56 +/- 7 min, respectively, P = NS), but it was significantly shortened by R 68070 and <b>dazoxiben</b> (11 +/- 2 and 25 +/- 6 min, respectively, P less than 0. 001 vs. controls and SQ 29548 -treated dogs). R 68070 administration resulted in a lysis time significantly shorter than that observed in the dazoxiben-treated group (P less than 0. 01). Reocclusion was observed in eight of eight control dogs, five of seven SQ 29548 -treated dogs, seven of nine dazoxiben-treated dogs, and zero of eight R 68070 -treated animals (P less than 0. 001). TxB 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha, measured in blood samples obtained from the coronary artery distal to the thrombus, were significantly increased at reperfusion and at reocclusion in control animals and in dogs receiving SQ 29548. R 68070 and <b>dazoxiben</b> prevented the increase in plasma TxB 2 levels, whereas 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha levels were significantly increased with respect to control and SQ 29548 -treated dogs.

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF) in the response to endothelin- 1 in arteries with regenerated endothelium. METHODS: Rings of porcine coronary arteries, with and without endothelium of previously deendothelialized left anterior descending coronary arteries and native left circumflex coronary arteries, were suspended in conventional organ chambers for the measurement of isometric force. RESULTS: In quiescent rings of the previously deendothelialized left anterior descending coronary artery treated with the NO-synthase inhibitor nitro-L- arginine, endothelin- 1 caused contractions which were larger in rings with than that in those without endothelium. Under the same experimental conditions, in the left circumflex coronary artery, the contractions to endothelin- 1 were augmented markedly by {{the removal of the}} endothelium. In rings with endothelium of the previously deendothelialized left anterior descending coronary artery, indometacin (inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) and ridogrel (thromboxane A 2 receptor antagonist and inhibitor of thromboxane synthase) inhibited contractions to endothelin- 1. <b>Dazoxiben</b> (inhibitor of thromboxane synthase) inhibited, to the same extent as indometacin and ridogel, the response to higher concentrations of endothelin- 1.

Maximum reduction in cardiac output (Qt) also occurred at the same time. Lung lymph flow (QL) increased during this period and remained elevated for at least 6 h after endotoxin. T X B 2 levels had returned from a peak of 13. 1 to 0. 7 ng/ml by 2 h. In dazoxiben-treated animals, plasma concentrations of T X B 2 were never significantly elevated. Increases in Ppa and Pw were markedly reduced and decreased Qt was transient. QL in treated animals began to increase by 30 min after endotoxin and reached a peak by 2 h. Increased QL in treated animals was not as great as in the untreated animals. Moreover, lymph-plasma protein ratios increased significantly in treated animals. Plasma prostaglandin (PG) F 2 alpha and 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha concentrations were elevated in both groups after endotoxin with values significantly greater in treated animals.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether prostaglandia endoperoxides, which {{continue}} to be formed in the setting of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibition, might influence the fate of ischemic myocardium in a model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Background. It was recently demonstrated that thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitors reduce ischemic myocardial injury through a redirection of prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxides toward the synthesis of “cardioprotective” prostaglandins, such as PGI 2, PGE 2 and PGD 2. However, part of these prostaglandin endoperoxides may also stimulate a receptor, shared with thromboxane A 2, mediating piutelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. Methods. New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to 30 min of coronary occlusion, followed by 5. 5 h of reperfusion. Fifteen minutes before reperfusion, the animals were randomized to receive 1) saline solution (control animals, n = 8); 2) SQ 29548, a potent and selective thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptor antagonist (n = 8); 3) <b>dazoxiben,</b> a selective thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitor (n = 8); 4) R 68070 (Ridogrel), a drug with dual thromboxane A 2 synthase-inhibiting and thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptor-blocking properties (n = 8); or 5) aspirin + R 68070 (n = 8). Results. <b>Dazoxiben</b> and R 68070, but not SQ 29548, significantly reduced thromboxane B 2 formation and increased plasma levels of 6 -keto-PGF 10, PGE 2 and PGF 2 a. Ex vivo platelet aggregation induced by U 46619 (a thromboxane A 2 mimetic) was inhibited by SQ 29548 and R 68070 but not by <b>dazoxiben.</b> In control animals, infarct size determined at the end of the experiment by triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining averaged 57. 7 ± 3. 2 % of the area at risk of infarction. The administration of SQ 29548 did not significantly reduce infract size compared with that in control animals, whereas dazosxiben and R 68070 significantly reduced infarct size to 36. 7 ± 2. 8 % and 16. 6 ± 3. 6 % of area at risk of infarction, respectively (p < 0. 001 vs. control values). In rabbits treated with R 68070, infract size was also significantly smaller than that of dazoxiben-treated rabbits (p < 0. 01). This protective effect of R 68070 was completely abolished when the drug was administered with aspirin, infarct size in this group averaging 59. 7 ± 1. 6 % (p = NS vs. control values). No differences in regional myocardial blood flow, systemic blood pressure, heart rate or extent of area at risk were observed among groups. Conclusions. Thus, prostaglandin endoperoxides play an important role in modulating the cardioprotective effects of thromboxane A 2 synthase inhibitors. The simultaneous inhibition of thromboxane A 2 synthase and blockade of thromboxane A 2 /PGH 2 receptors by R 68070 identify a pharmacologic interaction of potential therapeutic importance...|$|E
40|$|Human {{platelets}} pre-exposed to {{arachidonic acid}} (AA) (0. 1 - 1 mM) {{or to the}} endoperoxide analogue U 46619 (1 - 3 microM) and then washed and resuspended, failed to respond with aggregation or secretion to a second challenge by either agonist. The response to thrombin at low (0. 04 - 0. 1 u ml- 1) but not at high (2. 5 u ml- 1) concentrations was also inhibited by pre-exposure to AA and U 46619. The ability of platelets to synthesize thromboxane (Tx) B 2 from AA or upon challenge with thrombin persisted despite platelet desensitization. In {{the presence of the}} reversible cyclo-oxygenase (CO) inhibitors methyl salicylate (MS) or L 8027, pre-exposure to AA had no effect on subsequent challenge by the same agonist or by U 46619, whereas platelet desensitization by pre-exposure to U 46619 persisted. However, platelet activation by, and desensitization to AA and U 46619, was prevented by trimetoquinol and compound L 636499, two thromboxane/endoperoxide receptor antagonists. In contrast to the CO inhibitors, the thromboxane synthetase inhibitor <b>dazoxiben,</b> which in 3 'responders' out of 5 subjects suppressed aggregation, secretion, and Tx formation induced by AA, failed to prevent AA-induced desensitization. Compared to quiescent cells the distances between platelets desensitized after re-exposure to AA were reduced in electron microscopy, but the tight connections associated with aggregated cells were not observed. Degranulation was also not observed and cell morphology resembled that of normal quiescent platelets. In conclusion, (a) AA and U 46619 desensitize human platelets at a similar site sensitive to prostaglandin/thromboxane receptor antagonists, and show cross-desensitization; (b) desensitization by AA appears to be mediated by a CO-dependent metabolite, as CO inhibitors prevent desensitization by AA but not to U 46619; (c) the failure of <b>dazoxiben</b> to prevent desensitization by AA suggests that a metabolite other than TxA 2, possibly the endoperoxides, mediates the phenomenon; (d) desensitization does not involve inactivation of CO or thromboxane synthetase enzymes...|$|E

The contractions of rings caused by uridine 5 '-triphosphate were not affected by removal of the endothelium. An inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, indomethacin (10 - 5 M), prevented excitatory responses to A 23187, arachidonic acid, and acetylcholine but did not alter contractions caused by KCl.

40|$|Objective: The aim was {{to study}} the effects of endothelin- 1 on human placental veins and the role of {{cyclooxygenase}} products as mediators of these effects. Study design: Rings of placental veins with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers filled with physiologic salt solution. After a period of stabilization at optimal basal tension, isometric tensions in the control group were recorded at increasing concentrations of endothelin- 1 (10 - 10 to 10 - 7 mol/L). Rings in the experimental groups were treated with either indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 10 - 5 mol/L), <b>dazoxiben</b> (thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, 10 - 4 mol/L), or SQ 29548 (thromboxane receptor antagonist 10 - 6 mol/L) before addition of endothelin- 1. To demonstrate the presence of functional thromboxane receptors in the rings, contractile responses to U- 46619 (10 - 9 to 10 - 6 mol/L), a thromboxane A 2 analog were measured. The effectiveness of SQ 29548 blockade was tested in rings treated with SQ 29548 (10 - 6 mol/L) before addition of U- 46619. The concentration-response curves of the treated and control groups were compared with the Student paired t test. Results: Endothelin- 1 in doses of 10 - 10 to 10 - 7 mol/L caused concentration-dependent contraction of placental veins. Indomethacin significantly reduced the response of veins with endothelium to low endothelin- 1 concentrations (10 - 9. 5 to 10 - 9 mol/L), (p < 0. 05). However, it had no effect at higher endothelin- 1 concentrations or in vessels without endothelium. The presence of functional thromboxane A 2 receptors was confirmed by the vasoconstrictor effect of U- 46619 and its blockade by treatment with SQ 29548. Neither SQ 29548 nor the thromboxane A 2 synthesis inhibitor <b>dazoxiben</b> significantly influenced the response to endothelin- 1. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that endothelin- 1 is a potent vasoconstrictor in the human placental vein. Although functional thromboxane A 2 receptors exist in this vessel, endothelin- 1 is action is independent of thromboxane A 2. Prostaglandins may mediate part of the endothelin- 1 -induced placental vasoconstriction. However, endothelin- 1 acts primarily by a direct effect on vascular smooth muscle cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Convulxin was purified ftom C. d. cascavella e C. d terrificus venom by chromatography on Sephadex G- 75 in 0. 005 M ammonium formate, ph 3. 5. Male Swiss mice were injected i. v. with varying doses of convulxin and then euthanized 30 minoLater after wich the lungs were rapidly removed, fixed and processed for histological analysis to determine the ftequency of pulmonary thrombosis. Human platelet-rich plasma was prepared by standart differential centrifugation. Convulxin from C. d cascavella e C. d terrificus venoms aggregated hurnan platelet at concentrations 8 ng/ml and cause pulmonary thrombosis at doses 20 ~g/kg. The latter was dose-dependent at doses up to 400 ~g/kg, but decreased at higher dose (up to 1000 ~g/kg) which produced the convulsions characteristic of. this toxin. In no caso did the frequency of thrombi (expressed {{as the percentage of}} vessels occuded with thrombi) exceed 70 %. Histological examination by light microscopy showed that there was no thrombus formation in other organs such as heart, kidney and tiver. Heparin and dermatan (anionic molecules) were partially effective at preventing the thrmbotic action of convulxin, particularlyat low doses ofthe latter, perhaps through a direct electrostatic interaction with convulxin.

40|$|The {{covalent}} {{modification of}} proteins by metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) {{was investigated in}} human platelets. Following incubation of washed human platelets with radiolabeled AA, ethanol precipitation of the proteins, and lipid extraction by organic solvents, {{a small fraction of}} the radioactivity added (0. 3 %) was tightly bound to the protein pellet. A dozen labeled protein bands were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Exhaustive hydrolysis of platelet proteins by proteases released an amphipathic radiolabeled material which had a chromatographic behavior similar to that of a known peptidolipid, leukotriene C 4. These findings suggest a covalent nature for the observed binding. This binding was specific for AA since palmitate, myristate, or linoleate did not bind to a significant extent. It involved products of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways: it was indeed inhibited to a greater extent by eicosatetraynoic acid than by indomethacin. The protein-associated radioactivity was increased by the thromboxane synthase inhibitor <b>dazoxiben.</b> Indomethacin completely abolished this increase in binding, which could not be reproduced by exogenous prostaglandin (PG) E 2, F 2 alpha, or D 2, and might thus involve PGG 2 and/or PGH 2. Diamide, an agent known to inhibit the reduction of 12 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in platelets, produced an increase of the covalent binding, which was abolished by eicosatetraynoic acid but not by indomethacin: this suggests that the lipoxygenase product bound was 12 -hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid or a by-product. <b>Dazoxiben</b> and diamide produced distinct patterns of protein labeling after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One labeled band had a Mr of 70, 000 as the PGH synthase monomer. Addition of AA at 17 microM enhanced the labeling of this band, while 100 microM was inhibitory. Labeling of this band was also induced by thrombin in prelabeled platelets. Two monoclonal antibodies against PGH synthase caused immune precipitation of a 70 -kDa labeled protein in homogenates of [3 H]AA-labeled platelets. PGH synthase, purified from ram seminal vesicles, was covalently modified after incubation with [3 H]AA: this labeling was almost completely abolished by indomethacin. As much as 40 % of platelet PGH synthase was covalently modified after incubation with 17 microM AA. It can be concluded that in intact platelets PGH synthase is covalently modified by an eicosanoid following incubation with exogenous AA or after AA mobilization from phospholipids by thrombin.
