25|$|The thogotovirus {{glycoprotein}} is not {{similar to}} the influenza virus glycoproteins (<b>haemagglutinin</b> and neuraminidase), and instead shows some similarities with the gp64 glycoprotein of baculoviruses, which infect insects. It also has some similarity with the <b>haemagglutinin</b> of Quaranfil virus, the type species of a new genus of tick-transmitted orthomyxoviruses. The mechanism by which thogotoviruses gained a baculovirus-like glycoprotein is unknown. Pat Nuttall and colleagues have speculated that the acquisition enabled these viruses to infect ticks. This apparent receptor specificity for arthropod cells does not prevent most thogotoviruses from infecting vertebrates.

25|$|Humoral {{responses}} after {{a single}} DNA injection {{can be much}} longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein (HBsAg) have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza <b>haemagglutinin</b> was demonstrated in mice after gene gun delivery. Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the bone marrow and spleen for long-term antibody production, and generally localise there after one year.|$|E
25|$|The viruses bind to a cell through {{interactions}} between its hemagglutinin glycoprotein and sialic acid sugars on {{the surfaces of}} epithelial cells in the lung and throat (Stage 1 in infection figure). The cell imports the virus by endocytosis. In the acidic endosome, part of the <b>haemagglutinin</b> protein fuses the viral envelope with the vacuole's membrane, releasing the viral RNA (vRNA) molecules, accessory proteins and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into the cytoplasm (Stage 2). These proteins and vRNA form a complex that is transported into the cell nucleus, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase begins transcribing complementary positive-sense cRNA (Steps 3a and b). The cRNA is either exported into the cytoplasm and translated (step 4), or remains in the nucleus. Newly synthesised viral proteins are either secreted through the Golgi apparatus onto the cell surface (in the case of neuraminidase and hemagglutinin, step 5b) or transported back into the nucleus to bind vRNA and form new viral genome particles (step 5a). Other viral proteins have multiple actions in the host cell, including degrading cellular mRNA and using the released nucleotides for vRNA synthesis and also inhibiting translation of host-cell mRNAs.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Twenty-three {{strains of}} Escherichia coli with mannose-resistant and eluting (MRE) <b>haemagglutinins</b> with eight {{different}} patterns of substrate speci-ficity were examined {{by a variety}} of electronmicroscope methods. In 12 strains, the presence of MRE <b>haemagglutinins</b> with broad-spectrum patterns 1, 3 and 4 was correlated with that of fimbriae. In 11 strains with MRE <b>haemagglutinins</b> with the less common patterns 6, 7 var., 8, 9 and 10, fimbriae were not found on bacteria in MRE+ cultures, indicating that the latter <b>haemagglutinins</b> are non-fimbrial...|$|R
40|$|Mice given single {{injections}} of a polyvalent pseudomonas vaccine produced anti-pseudomonas <b>haemagglutinins</b> against the 16 component immunogens of the multivalent vaccine. Mice passively immunized with sera from vaccinated mice were protected against lethal challenge by 8 / 10 strains of Ps. aeruginosa of homologous serotype. Protection by the serum was {{inversely proportional to}} the virulence of the challenge strains. Anti-pseudomonas <b>haemagglutinins</b> were always present in sera which passively protected mice against pseudomonas infection. Low levels of anti-pseudomonas <b>haemagglutinins</b> were present in some sera which failed to passively immunize mice against pseudomonas infection. Anti-pseudomonas <b>haemagglutinins</b> and antibodies involved in passive protection were mainly in the IgM fractions of mouse serum. Control human sera contained anti-pseudomonas <b>haemagglutinins</b> against most serotypes of Ps. aeruginosa. Sera from patients with burns contained high levels of anti-pseudomonas <b>haemagglutinins</b> against some but not all serotypes of Ps. aeruginosa.

40|$|The {{architecture}} and chemical {{composition of the}} influenza virus particle is described with particular reference to the protein constituents and their genetic control. The dominant role in infection of the surface proteins - <b>haemagglutinins</b> and neuraminidases - acting as antigens and undergoing variation in time known as antigenic drift and shift is explained. The immuno-diffusion technique has illuminated the interrelationships of the <b>haemagglutinins</b> of influenza A viruses recovered {{over long periods of}} time. The H 0 and H 1 <b>haemagglutinins</b> are now regarded as a single sub-type with H 2 and H 3 representing the <b>haemagglutinins</b> of the 1957 and 1968 sub-types. Animal influenza viruses of pigs, horses and birds are described.

40|$|Since the {{reintroduction}} {{of influenza}} viruses of the H 1 N 1 subtype {{into the human}} population in 1977, antigenically distinguishable viruses have been isolated each year from outbreaks of respiratory disease in young people. In this paper the antigenic properties of viruses representative of isolates made in 1982, 1983, and 1984 are compared, and the amino acid sequences of their <b>haemagglutinins</b> are presented. The results provide a complete description of the 1982 and 1983 H 1 N 1 influenza virus <b>haemagglutinins</b> and allow correlation of specific amino acid sequence differences with antigenic differences...|$|R
50|$|The {{filamentous}} <b>hæmagglutinin</b> adhesin (FHA) is a large, filamentous {{protein that}} serves as a dominant attachment factor for adherence to host ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, called respiratory epithelium. It is associated with biofilm formation and possesses at least four binding domains which can bind to different cell receptors on the epithelial cell surface. One notable bacterium that produces filamentous <b>hæmagglutinin</b> adhesin is Bordetella pertussis, which uses this protein as a virulence factor.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{naturally}} occurring <b>haemagglutinins</b> on the in vitro phagocytosis of sheep erythrocytes by the blood cells (haemocytes) of Clitumnus extradentatus and Periplaneta americana was studied. The {{results showed that}} the <b>haemagglutinins</b> in both species failed to act as opsonins. Indeed, in some instances, incubation of erythrocytes in haemolymph resulted in less avid ingestion as compared with the saline-incubated controls. This reduced phagocytosis was probably caused by the clumping of erythrocytes on the haemocyte monolayers, leaving fewer single red cells available for uptake. The possible roles of these erythrocyte agglutinins in the host defence systems of insects are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Lethally irradiated, {{bone marrow}} protected, normal and thymectomized adult mice were given 140 – 250 × 106 syngeneic spleen and lymph node cells from normal or {{sensitized}} donors.

5000|$|There [...] "is {{evidence}} {{of at least}} three independent virulence factors connected with three different genes. It is highly unlikely that all of the high-virulence alleles will simultaneously mutate and disappear if and when the <b>haemagglutinin</b> gene changes so as to make the <b>haemagglutinin</b> molecule better adapted for the human-type (alpha-2,6-linked) receptor (which is a necessary prerequisite in order that a pandemic with H5N1 virus may start). It is more probable that evolutionary adaptation of the <b>haemagglutinin</b> of H5N1 viruses to the human-type receptor will happen without any simultaneous change in those other genetic properties that now are important for explaining the exceptionally high virulence of certain strains of avian-adapted H5N1 influenza virus. The change of the <b>haemagglutinin</b> molecule from avian adaptation to human adaptation must be expected to act as an additional virulence factor because it will enhance the total number of cells that can be infected (per host organism), increase the total rate of virus replication and potentiate the effects of the other virulence factors already present." [...] The H5N1 genes work together in ways we don't yet understand. Influenza research is continuing. The genetic factors that make H5N1 so deadly are only partly understood. Known factors involve the surface antigen encoding gene segments H (hemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase) genes (causing it to be H5N1 for example), as well as the matrix M2 gene, and the polymerase genes.|$|E

No such spontaneous reconstitution was observed in F 1 -hybrids of highly inbred CBA and CBA-T 6 T 6 mice.

50|$|There are {{two major}} {{proteins}} {{on the surface of}} influenza virus particles. One is the lectin <b>haemagglutinin</b> protein with three relatively shallow sialic acid-binding sites and the other is enzyme sialidase with the active site in a pocket. Because of the relative deep active site in which low-molecular-weight inhibitors can make multiple favorable interactions and approachable methods of designing transition-state analogues in the hydrolysis of sialosides, the sialidase becomes more attractive anti-influenza drug target than the <b>haemagglutinin.</b> After the X-ray crystal structures of several influenza virus sialidases were available, the structure-based inhibitor design was applied to discover potent inhibitors of this enzyme.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, haemagglutinin-esterase fusion glycoprotein (HEF) is a multi-functional protein {{embedded in}} the viral envelope of several viruses, including influenza C virus, coronaviruses and toroviruses. HEF is required for infectivity, and functions to recognise the host cell surface receptor, to fuse the viral and host cell membranes, and to destroy the receptor upon host cell infection. The <b>haemagglutinin</b> region of HEF is responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion, and bears a strong resemblance to the sialic acid-binding <b>haemagglutinin</b> found in influenza A and B viruses, except that it binds 9-O-acetylsialic acid. The esterase region of HEF {{is responsible for the}} destruction of the receptor, an action that is carried out by neuraminidase in influenza A and B viruses. The esterase domain is similar in structure to Streptomyces scabies esterase, and to acetylhydrolase, thioesterase I and rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase.|$|E
40|$|The immune {{response}} of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) to four purified protein antigens was evaluated by radioimmunoelectrophoresis. Specific antibody production was consistently detected and antigen binding {{was related to}} four immunoglobulin (Ig) precipitin lines (called Ig 1, 2, 3, 4) in turtle serum. Antibody activity was detected first in the Ig 1 or Ig 2 and then later {{in the course of}} immunization in Ig 3 and Ig 4. Ig 1 was about 19 S in size, was not detectable after reduction and alkylation, and was the only Ig absent from turtle lymph. Ig 3 and Ig 4 were about 7 S in size and Ig 2 appeared slightly heavier by sucrose density gradient and Sephadex G- 200 analysis. <b>Haemagglutinins</b> produced after primary inoculation were routinely sensitive to mild reduction and alkylation although antigen-binding capacity was still detectable. However, mercaptoethanol-resistant <b>haemagglutinins</b> were found in sera from turtles after booster injections of antigen.

50|$|In July 1997 {{he offered}} Taubenberger {{to return to}} what is now Brevig, Alaska. Again he {{received}} permission to dig for victims of the 1918 Spanish flu, and this time he unearthed the remains of an obese woman, maybe thirty years old, whom he christened “Lucy”. The fat had protected her lungs from decay, and he took both of them. It turned out that in Lucy's case the fragments were even smaller - around 100 base pairs as compared to 150 in the case of Vaughn and Downs - but now there was enough material to sequence the complete 1918 virus many times over. Taubenberger and Reid managed to generate a complete <b>haemagglutinin</b> sequence to confirm the one they had got from Vaughn. In all three cases - Vaughn, Downs, and Lucy - the 1,800 base pairs differed only in a few places.
