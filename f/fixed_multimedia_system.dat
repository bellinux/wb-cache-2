40|$|With the {{advancement}} in network bandwidth and computing power, <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> {{have become a}} popular means for information delivery. However, general principles of system testing cannot be directly applied to testing of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> on account of their stringent temporal and synchronization requirements. In particular, {{few studies have been}} made on the stress testing of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> with respect to their temporal requirements under resource saturation. Stress testing is important because erroneous behavior is most likely to occur under resource saturation. This paper presents an automatable method of test case generation for the stress testing of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> It adapts constraint solving techniques to generate test cases that lead to potential resource saturation in a <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> Coverage of the test cases is defined upon the reachability graph of a <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed stress testing technique is supported by tools and has been successfully applied to a real-life commercial <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> Although our technique focuses on the stress testing of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems,</b> the underlying issues and concepts are applicable to other types of real-time systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{real-time}} community {{tends to}} contend that <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> are indeed real-time <b>systems,</b> while the <b>multimedia</b> community points to {{problems such as}} video databases on disks and dynamic environments as issues unique to <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, historically, real-time and <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> have had different roots, and therefore embody different schools of thought. In this paper, we consider {{the similarities and differences}} between hard real-time <b>systems</b> and <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> We argue that <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> do exhibit new requirements but that many of the insights and techniques developed for real-time systems can be fruitfully applied to the design and implementation of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> We then propose augmenting the hard real-time system framework with mechanisms to support the dynamic nature of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> As a matter of fact, {{one of the goals of}} the Real-Time Mach operating system being developed at Carnegie Mellon University is to be able to support both hard re [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> {{comprises}} of audio+video+data. The data {{characteristics of}} this system are {{quite different from the}} traditional data, which is well understood. But here the data is spatio-temporal in nature and hence involves issues like real time scheduling and synchronization. Obviously <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> needs additional support from the operating system. In this context, this paper discusses “Operating System Concerns for Multimedia”. The paper will address the problems related to the operating <b>systems</b> issues in <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> and will discuss various existing and proposed techniques researchers have developed to solve the problem.

40|$|Although {{still in}} its infancy, <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> {{production}} is a growing and rapidly evolving industry. The nature of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems,</b> incorporating text, graphics, animation, sound and video, means {{that the process of}} eliciting, specifying and validating requirements for such systems differs in many ways from the process of requirements capture in other software development. The literature on requirements engineering contains {{little in the way of}} either theoretical guidance or empirical case studies relating to the specification of requirements for interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> Where advice does exist for <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems,</b> it is geared mainly to their design and production, rather than to the engineering of their requirements. No one has yet come forward with techniques or tools specifically designed to model requirements for multimedia systems; nor has any systematic evaluation of currently available approaches been carried out in this context. In this paper we identify some of the distinctive features of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> that have a material effect on the requirements process. We then develop a list of criteria for assessing the suitability of notations for effective modelling of requirements for a <b>multimedia</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due {{to recent}} {{advances}} {{in the areas of}} <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> and groupware, flexible working is emerging as a new way of working, where workers carry out tasks using computers no matter where, when and how they work. This paper discusses modeling and prototyping of a distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> which is used to provide a flexible working environment. First, we propose a model to specify distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> (especially, user interfaces) for flexible working. The model is based on finite state machines and information exchanged between them. The specifications in our model are executable so that the specifications {{can be used as a}} prototype of the distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> Second, a prototyping tool is introduced which is an interpreter of executable specifications in the model. The tool is currently operational on the Mac family such as Mac II, Power Macintosh and PowerBook.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} the novel concept of {{probabilistic}} design for <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> and a methodology to quickly explore such design space {{at an early}} design stage. The probabilistic design is motivated by the challenge of how to design, but not over-design, <b>multimedia</b> embedded <b>systems</b> while systematically incorporating such application 's performance requirements, uncertainties in execution time, and tolerance for reasonable execution failures. Our goal is {{to bridge the gap}} between real-time analysis and embedded software implementation for rapid and economic (<b>multimedia)</b> <b>system</b> prototyping. Our method takes advantage of <b>multimedia</b> <b>system's</b> unique features mentioned above to relax the rigid hardware requirements for software implementation and eventually avoid over-designing the system...|$|R

Abstractly, {{the task}} of a distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> is to process multimedia traffic data. Hence, the quality of service of distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> is related to a fundamental issue how to accurately represent the multimedia traffic data to be processed.

40|$|Availability of precise, yet usable {{modeling}} languages {{is essential}} to the construction of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> based on software engineering principles and methods. Although several languages have been proposed for the specification of isolated <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> aspects, there not yet exists an integrated modeling language that adequately supports multimedia software development in practice. We propose an extension of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) for the integrated specification of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> based on an object-oriented development method. Since integration of co-existing timed procedural and interactive behavior {{is at the heart of}} <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems,</b> we focus on UML-based specification of behavior in this paper. In addition, we outline how these behavioral aspects are to be integrated with media, presentation, and software architecture modeling to achieve a coherent and consistent model.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the design and {{creation}} of interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> is a difficult and challenging task. Most interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> differ from conventional computer systems by being functionally more complex and by addressing a wider and broader range of inexperienced or novice users. The increased complexity in functionality is often a result of integration, time variation, and navigation. Furthermore, years of research within software engineering shows that improvements in software design processes require systematic work practices that involve well-founded methods. This paper reports from an empirical study of a conventional software analysis and design for the design of an interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> The primary purpose of the study is to investigate software engineering concepts for the design of interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems.</b> The actual activities and concepts of the method are empirically evaluated against a typical desktop-based interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> and weakness and strength of the analysis and design are discovered. It is concluded that more software engineering concepts are not well suited for interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> design. The main reason is that more of the concepts are intended for the analysis and design of work processes in a given, specific work environment. However, the rigid focus on work processes and tasks is useless since the complexity of the future system is not hidden in work tasks. The challenge of designing a coherent and affective interactive <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> lacks conceptual support and foundation. It is indicated that future analysis and design methods need to address other aspects of systems design than previous methods. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>multimedia</b> information <b>systems</b> must be managed and controlled {{just as it}} is for other generic system types. This paper proposes an approach for assessing <b>multimedia</b> component and <b>system</b> characteristics with a view to ultimately using these features to estimate the associated development effort. Given the different nature of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems,</b> existing metrics {{do not appear to be}} entirely useful in this domain; however, some general principles can still be applied in analysis. Some basic assertions concerning the influential characteristics of <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> are made and a small preliminary set of data is evaluated.

40|$|The {{environment}} of distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> is not static. The specification {{of quality of}} service (QoS) {{plays an important role}} to describe the dynamic characteristics and is used for distributed <b>multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> to adapt to environment changes. We argue that the QoS requirements should be able to be specified from the user's and application's perspectives. Thus, we formally define the concept of QoS-massages that provides a specification interface between applications and the communication network. A framework based on a transformation approach is proposed to transform user/application's QoS requirement specification to QoS-messages that direct the transmission of multimedia information.

40|$|The {{usefulness}} of a multimedia presentation {{depends on the}} accuracy of its output values and the timing of those outputs. A Quality of Service (QOS) specification is a vehicle for requesting accuracy guarantees from a <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> This paper gives a formal model for presentation-level QOS specification that constrains presentation outputs only. Such a QOS specification leaves a <b>multimedia</b> <b>system</b> free to optimize resource management while providing end-to-end guarantees for multimedia services. An error model is proposed with {{a complete set of}} QOS parameters for specifying presentation quality. We show how this error model extends the opportunities for optimizing resources within a <b>multimedia</b> <b>system.</b> Keywords: Quality of Service, Multimedia, Synchronization, Resource Reservations. 1 Introduction <b>Multimedia</b> <b>systems</b> today support presentations with continuous media [1, 18], such as video and audio, as well as synthetic compositions such as slide shows and computer-generat [...] ...|$|R
