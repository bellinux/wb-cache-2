Protected objects are a monitor-like construct, but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions. The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables {{are not required}} for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and {{it also has a}} <b>declaration</b> <b>part</b> and a body.|$|R

40|$|The Z {{notation}} is {{a formal}} specification language used for describing and mod-elling computing systems. Z notation was proposed by Abrial et al in 1974. Tools {{are available for}} simulation and validation of the model specified in Z. The Z no-tation is based upon set theory and mathematical logic. The mathematical logic is a first-order predicate calculus. Mathematical objects and their properties can be collected together in schemas- patterns of declarations and constraints [2]. The schema language {{can be used to}} describe the state of a system, {{and the ways in which}} a state may change. The state of the system can be modelled in Z on a component basis in a bottom up fashion. A schema specification modelling a component of the system state includes two parts- <b>declaration</b> <b>part</b> which specifies the fields or variables of the compo-nent (for example the <b>declaration</b> <b>part</b> of the schema Bag in Figure 1 (a) specifies elements as a set of natural numbers) and a constraint part which specifies the invariants on the component (for example the constraint part of the schema Bag in Figure 1 specifies that each member in the set elements is either 1 or 2). A state change in the system is modelled with a schema called operation schema. An operation schema specifies the state change w. r. t. the schema mod-elling the system state. The state change is specified as a relation between the pre-state and post-state of the schema modelling the system state. We call th...|$|R

40|$|Name {{obfuscation}} is {{a software}} protection technique, which renames identifiers {{in a given}} program, to protect the program from illegal cracking. The conventional meth-ods replace names appearing in the <b>declaration</b> <b>part</b> with the meaningless ones. Therefore, the methods cannot be used to obfuscate names declared in system libraries, since changing such system-defined names significantly dete-riorates the program portability. This paper presents a new name obfuscation method, which can hide appear-ance of the system-defined names. In the proposed method, the system-defined names are statically encrypted, and the original names are resolved during run time using the re-flection. An experimental evaluation on the Java platform showed that the run-time overhead for the obfuscated pro-gram was 1. 74 {{times larger than the}} one for the original.

On 21 February 2008 Republika Srpska adopted resolution through which it denounced {{and refused to}} recognise {{the declaration of independence}} of Kosovo from Serbia. In addition, the parliament adopted resolution stating that in the event that majority of EU and UN states recognise Kosovo's independence, Republika Srpska would cite the Kosovo secession as a precedent and move to hold a referendum on its own constitutional status within Bosnia and Herzegovina. Finally, the resolution called upon all Republika Srpska officials to do everything in order to prevent Bosnia and Herzegovina from recognising Kosovo's declared independence. Regardless of <b>Declaration</b> <b>part</b> that calls for referendum in Republika Srpska, Serbia's official position remained unchanged and continued to support the sovereignty and integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|R
