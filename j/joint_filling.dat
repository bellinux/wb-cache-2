40|$|In this master thesis it {{is focused}} on {{permeable}} pavement and with an extra focus on permeable interlocking concrete unit blocks as the type of pavement. This is because the test facility in Sandnes is built {{with this type of}} pavement, and all the data collected and used in the master thesis is from this test facility. The measurements started in May 2015 and parameters like air temperature, ground temperature, precipitation intensity, air pressure, wind speed, wind direction, water level in the infiltration basins and excess flow from the permeable areas are continuously registered in the system. The different parts of the test facility from construction of the permeable pavement to the instrumentations used for collecting data are described in detail. Test area 1 and 2 is the access road and are only infiltrating water from the area they cover, which is 2 x 120 m 2. Test area 3 is 104 m 2 and infiltrates water from an impermeable part of the parking area of 1250 m 2. The test facility have been doing constant registrations of data since the time of construction, but they were not controlled to see if the quality were good and if they were useful and could give some indications of the behavior of the permeable pavement. The potential evaporation from the permeable pavement is calculated and events with inflow to the infiltration basins in connection to the permeable test areas are analyzed. The saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured for one of the test areas after almost a year without any maintenance since the construction. When the openings in the <b>joint</b> <b>filling</b> material remained untouched the infiltration rate was measured to be 78. 9 cm/h and 107. 2 cm/h. The upper 5 cm of the <b>joint</b> <b>filling</b> material were removed and the infiltration was measured to be 554. 6 670. 9 cm/h.

The analytical solutions for wave propagation across a single joint are derived in this paper by accounting for the incident angle, the non-dimensional joint stiffness, the non-dimensional joint viscosity and the acoustic impedance ratio of the <b>filled</b> <b>joint.</b> It is shown that the viscoelastic behaviour results in dissipation of wave energy and frequency dependence of the reflection and transmission coefficients.

40|$|<b>Filled</b> <b>joints</b> in rock mass pose {{a number}} of {{constructional}} problems. When <b>filled</b> <b>joints</b> are reckoned to be critical to an engineering structure, their behaviours are often studied using expensive in-situ testing and complex full-scale physical modelling. This is because sampling of an undisturbed <b>filled</b> <b>joint</b> {{is almost impossible to}} undertake. As such, a means of anticipating the behaviour and characteristics of this critical geological discontinuity is important. One method to predict the behaviour of <b>filled</b> <b>joint</b> is through systematic classification based on its essential components, particularly those features that control the behaviour of the joint under shear and compressive load. Exposed <b>filled</b> <b>joints</b> in granite rock in Lahat, Perak, have been selected for the field study. The field assessments indicate there are several components of <b>filled</b> <b>joint</b> that exhibit certain geological and mechanical characteristics which can be identified and assessed in the field and laboratory. For the infilling material, the essential features include thickness, weathering grade and texture. For the host joint blocks, the features include texture and roughness of the joint surface and weathering degree of the blocks. The weathering grade of the infill and joint blocks are geological characteristics that can be graded according to the standard classification system. The samples of infilling were further evaluated in the laboratory using index and characterisation tests like sieving, compression and shear tests.

In the same (average) way, the continuity conditions of displacements and tractions at the interfaces between subcells and between neighboring representative elements are imposed, resulting in a homogenization procedure that eliminates the discrete nature of the composite model.

Howev-er, the study of long-wavelength propagation in a jointed rock mass is challenging in the laboratory, and limited data are available under controlled test conditions. Long-wavelength P-wave and S-wave propagation normal to joints, using an axially loaded jointed column device, reproduces a range of joint conditions. The effects of the normal stress, loading his-tory, joint spacing, matched surface topography i. e., joint roughness, joint cementation e. g., after grouting, joint opening, and plasticity of the <b>joint</b> <b>filling</b> on the P-wave and S-wave velocities and onS-wave attenuation are notable. The ratio VP /VS in jointed rock masses differs from that found in homogeneous continua. The concept of Poisson’s ratio as a function ofVP /VS is unwarranted, andVP /VS can be interpret-ed in terms of jointed characteristics. Analytic models that consider stress-dependent stiffness and frictional loss in joints as well as stress-independent properties of intact rocks can model experimental observations properly and extract joint properties from rock-mass test data. Thus, joint proper-ties and normal stress have a prevalent role in propagation ve-locity and attenuation in jointed rockmasses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a space-time hole filling {{approach}} {{is presented to}} deal with a disocclusion when a view is synthesized for the 3 D video. The problem becomes even more complicated when the view is extrapolated from a single view, since the hole is large and has no stereo depth cues. Although many techniques have been developed to address this problem, most of them focus only on view interpolation. We propose a space-time <b>joint</b> <b>filling</b> method for color and depth videos in view extrapolation. For proper texture and depth to be sampled in the following hole filling process, the background of a scene is automatically segmented by the random walker segmentation in conjunction with the hole formation process. Then, the patch candidate selection process is formulated as a labeling problem, which can be solved with random walks. The patch candidates that best describe the hole region are dynamically selected in the space-time domain, and the hole is filled with the optimal patch for ensuring both spatial and temporal coherence. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to state-of-the-art methods and provides both spatially and temporally consistent results with significantly reduced flicker artifacts.

The infiltration curves are shown as regression curves of the averaged infiltration values. These tests can be continuously repeated to observe the long-term performance. These tests show especially a significant relation between infiltration and age.

Meanwhile, distinct stop-pass behavior exhibits with the change of joint thickness or wave frequency for a single elastic joint. While for the wave transmission across a single viscoelastic joint, the transmission coefficient generally decreases with increasing joint thickness or wave frequency, except when the two parameters match with the pass bands of the corresponding elastic joint. When parallel joints exist, multiple wave reflections among joints influence wave transmission.

30|$|In {{adaptive}} control welding, i.e., a {{closed loop system}} using feedback-sensing devices and {{adaptive control}}, there is a process control system that detects changes in welding conditions automatically {{with the aid of}} sensors and directs the equipment to take appropriate action. Sensors are needed in adaptive control welding to find the joint, assess root penetration, conduct bead placement and seam tracking, and ensure proper joint fill (Cary and Helzer 2005). Use of sensors allows adaptive control for real-time control and adjustment of process parameters such as welding current and voltage. For example, the capabilities of sensors in seam finding, identification of joint penetration and <b>joint</b> <b>filling,</b> and ensuring root penetration and acceptable weld bead shape mean that corrective modification of relevant welding parameters is done such that constant weld quality is maintained (Cary and Helzer 2005; Drews and Starke 1986). An adaptive welding robot should have the capabilities to address two main aspects. The first aspect is the control of the end effector’s path and orientation so that the robot is able to track the joint to be welded with high precision. The second one is the control of welding process variables in real time, for example, the control of the amount of metal deposition into the joint as per the dimensions of the gap separating the parts to be welded.|$|E

The stability of these structures are greatly influenced by the engineering behaviour of the rock mass. For intact rock, its low deformability behaviour indicates {{that it is a}} stronger material. However, the condition changes with the presences of joint as discontinuity features in the rocks. The presence of this joint influence the strength and deformability of rock to a great extend. The situations become worst when intensive weathering of jointed rock mass under tropical climate leads the formation of the filled joint. Being the weakest component of a filled <b>joint,</b> <b>filling</b> materials contributes significantly to joint deformability and thus reducing joint strength and stiffness. In construction work that involving excavation in rock masses, filled joint poses a number of design and constructional problem that may influence the stability and factor of safety to the structure.

Comparing the stress-strain curves and Young's Modulus value has done analyses ofthe experimental result. The result suggested that the filled joint exhibits high deformation behaviour due to a lowest value of Young's Modulus.

The implementation of robotic technology into welding processes is made difficult by the inherent process variables of part location, fit up, orientation and repeatability. Considering these aspects, to ensure weld reproducibility consistency and quality, advanced adaptive control techniques are essential. These involve not only the development of adequate sensors for seam tracking and joint recognition but also developments of overall machines {{with a level of}} artificial intelligence sufficient for automated welding. The development of such a prototype system which utilizes a manipulator arm, ultrasonic sensors and a transistorised welding power source is outlined. This system incorporates three essential aspects. It locates and tracks the welding seam ensuring correct positioning of the welding head relatively to the joint preparation. Additionally, it monitors the joint profile of the molten weld pool and modifies the relevant heat input parameters ensuring consistent penetration, <b>joint</b> <b>filling</b> and acceptable weld bead shape. Finally, it makes use of both the above information to reconstruct three-dimensional images of the weld pool silhouettes providing in-process inspection capabilities of the welded joints.
