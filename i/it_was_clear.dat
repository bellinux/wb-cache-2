5|$|By 1924, {{there was}} {{distinct}} pressure on {{space in the}} halls of residence, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that more rooms were needed. The existing halls were full and so South Stoneham and South Hill were extended by covering their outbuildings.|$|E

5|$|After {{a heated}} week of pre-fight confrontations, fans were expecting {{something}} special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah. And the fighters delivered, though in an unanticipated fashion.

5|$|After <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Austria-Hungary {{had lost}} World War I, the Austrian {{government}} {{decided to give}} Viribus Unitis, along {{with much of the}} Austro-Hungarian fleet, to Yugoslavia, the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer, she was renamed Yugoslavia.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E

5|$|By 1939, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> {{that war}} was looming, {{and the team}} began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was barely adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range {{proved to be a}} far greater problem.|$|E
5|$|By February 1326, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E
5|$|By July 1918, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, which had forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, {{resulting in a}} return to trench warfare on the Western Front.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that France {{was unable}} to match British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required.

5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|In the 1824 presidential election, Sharp alienated {{some of his}} {{constituency}} {{by supporting}} his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Edward now {{regarded}} the struggle {{not as a}} war between two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> that Harrison {{would not}} be re-nominated unanimously.

At the convention in Minneapolis, Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition.|$|E
5|$|Problems arose {{quickly for}} the new Princeps.

Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus Julius Caesar, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line.|$|E
