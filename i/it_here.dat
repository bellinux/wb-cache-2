5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7.

As CR-506 runs concurrently with <b>it</b> <b>here,</b> and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E

In a study by the University of Cagliari, Italy, VAD rats had more trouble learning a Radial arm maze than rats who had normal levels of the vitamin. The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15-day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve <b>it.</b> <b>Here</b> {{it was found that the}} retinoid receptors which help transport vitamin A were of normal function.|$|E
25|$|At {{the west}} end of the 3rd floor is El hombre controlador del universo (Man, {{controller}} of the universe- known as Man at the Crossroads), originally commissioned for New York's Rockefeller Center in 1933. The mural depicts a variety of technological and societal themes (such as the discoveries made possible by microscopes and telescopes) and was controversial for its inclusion of Lenin and a Soviet May Day parade. The Rockefellers were not happy with the painting and the incomplete work was eventually destroyed and painted over. Rivera recreated <b>it</b> <b>here</b> in 1934. On {{the north side of the}} third floor are David Alfaro Siqueiros' three-part La Nueva Democracía (New Democracy) and Rivera's four-part Carnaval de la Vida Mexicana (Carnival of Mexican Life); to the east is José Clemente Orozco's La Katharsis (Catharsis), depicting the conflict between humankind's 'social' and 'natural' aspects.|$|E

Frida {{was the daughter of}} Wilhelm (Guillermo) Kahlo, who immigrated from Europe to Mexico and native Mexican Matilde Calderón y González. Frida spent her childhood in this house. She stated that during the Mexican Revolution, her mother would open the windows of this house in order to donate supplies to the Zapata army when it was in the area in 1913. She also spent large amount of time in the house convalescing, first in 1918 when she was struck with polio which would leave one leg shorter than the other. When she was 18, a trolley accident left her badly mangled. She spent about two years confined to her bed in casts and orthopedic devices. It was then she began to paint as a way to pass the time. One of the works from this time has Frida on {{what appears to be a}} stretcher, her body bandaged and located to the side of this house.|$|E

500|$|... "This Is It" [...] is a pop ballad with {{a simple}} mid-tempo {{keyboard}} that lasts three minutes and thirty-six seconds. The song begins with Jackson singing, “This is <b>it,</b> <b>here</b> I stand / I’m {{the light of the}} world, I feel grand / Got this love I can feel / And I know yes for sure it is real” and then he tenderly hits his signature high notes about a new lover he feels he’s known [...] "since 1,000 years." [...] Jackson's brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon (credited as The Jacksons) are featured as background vocals throughout the song. Background music includes fingersnaps, a [...] "soaring chorus," [...] big-build strings and [...] "bubbly guitars." [...] The song is played in the key of Bb major. Throughout the song, Jackson's vocal range spans from F4 to C6. The song's tempo is moderate, and its metronome speed is 96 beats per minute. According to the music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing and the Winnipeg Sun, the song is written in common time. The lyrics [...] "toggle between grandiosity" [...] ("This is <b>it,</b> <b>here</b> I stand / I'm the light of the world, I feel grand") and [...] "shy, romantic yearning" [...] ("I never heard a single word about you / Falling in love wasn't my plan"). Darrly Sterdan of the Winnipeg Sun felt that Jackson's voice and the background music sounded [...] "like a demo that's been fleshed out with overdubs and doowoppy backup vocals from his brothers." [...] Anthony McCartney, of the Associated Press felt that the finger-snap percussion [...] "echoes" [...] that present in Jackson's 1982 song [...] "The Girl Is Mine" [...] with Paul McCartney.|$|E
