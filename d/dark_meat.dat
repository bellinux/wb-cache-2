5|$|Guinea pig meat is high {{in protein}} and low in fat and cholesterol, and is {{described}} as being similar to rabbit and the <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> of chicken. The animal may be served fried (chactado or frito), broiled (asado), or roasted (al horno), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy, a soup dish. Pachamanca or huatia, a process similar to barbecueing, is also popular, and is usually served with corn beer (chicha) in traditional settings.|$|E

To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants on its grilled chicken sandwiches that have different ingredients from the standard sandwich recipe. Being one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is sometimes the center of product advertising for the company. Additionally, as a major product in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E
50|$|A meat slurry, reconstituted meat, or {{emulsified}} meat is a liquefied {{meat product}} that contains fewer fats, pigments and less myoglobin than unprocessed <b>dark</b> <b>meats.</b> Meat slurry is more malleable than <b>dark</b> <b>meats</b> and eases {{the process of}} meat distribution as pipelines may be used.|$|R
5000|$|Lexington style uses a {{vinegar and}} ketchup type sauce, and uses only the pork shoulder, which is <b>darker</b> <b>meat,</b> thus more moist. It is also served with red slaw, {{a type of}} coleslaw that uses this {{barbecue}} sauce (locally called [...] "dip") instead of mayonnaise.|$|R
50|$|Mukuzani has a {{deep red}} color with a soft smoky scent of oak and berry. The taste begins dry but the oak and fruit flavors quickly come through. As {{a result of its}} longer aging, Mukuzani has more {{complexity}} than the other wines made from saperavi grapes. It goes particularly well with steaks and <b>dark</b> <b>meats.</b>|$|R
25|$|Cattle, sheep, {{pigs and}} poultry are all commercially farmed; Manx lamb from the hill farms is a popular dish. The Loaghtan, the {{indigenous}} breed of Manx sheep, has a rich, <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> that has found favour with chefs, featuring in dishes on the BBC's MasterChef series.|$|E
25|$|White {{turkey meat}} is often {{considered}} healthier than <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> {{because of its}} lower fat content, but the nutritional differences are small. Although turkey is reputed to cause sleepiness, holiday dinners are commonly large meals served with carbohydrates, fats, and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere, {{all of which are}} bigger contributors to post-meal sleepiness than the tryptophan in turkey.|$|E
25|$|The {{meat for}} turkey bacon {{comes from the}} whole turkey and can be cured or uncured, smoked, chopped, and {{reformed}} into strips that resemble bacon. Turkey bacon is cooked by pan-frying. Cured turkey bacon made from <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> can be 90% fat free. The low fat content of turkey bacon means it does not shrink while being cooked and {{has a tendency to}} stick to the pan.|$|E
50|$|Aquaculture of the Nile tilapia {{dates back}} to Ancient Egypt. In modern aquaculture, {{wild-type}} Nile tilapia are not farmed very often because of the dark color of their flesh, that is undesirable for many customers, {{and because of the}} reputation the fish has as being a trash fish. However, they are fast-growing and produce good fillets; leucistic ("red") breeds which have lighter meat have been developed to counter the consumer distaste for <b>darker</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The meat {{produced}} by these cross-breeds {{is different from}} the [...] "authentic" [...] Kobe beef, though this is [...] "often by design", due to the perception that American palates do not actually want the richness of Japanese beef and would prefer a more familiar flavor profile. Some US meat producers claim any differences between their less expensive [...] "Kobe-style" [...] beef and true Kobe beef are largely cosmetic.

25|$|Chicken McNuggets – {{introduced}} in 1983 {{as a replacement}} for the McChicken, these are small chicken chunks served with dipping sauces of barbecue, sweet n' sour, honey, and hot mustard. Available in 4, 6, 10 (originally 9), or 20 pieces. Up until 2003, they were a combination of white and <b>dark</b> <b>meat,</b> now they are made with only white meat. In 2011, five new dipping sauces were introduced and added to the line-up: sweet chilli, honey mustard, spicy buffalo, and creamy ranch. With the addition of these new dipping sauces, McDonald's began phasing out the Hot Mustard sauce, and by February 2014, it had been discontinued in most U.S. markets.|$|E
500|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>meat,</b> which avian myologists {{refer to}} as [...] "red muscle", is used for {{sustained}} activity—chiefly walking, {{in the case of}} a chicken. The dark colour comes from the protein myoglobin, which plays a key role in oxygen uptake and storage within cells. White muscle, in contrast, is suitable only for short bursts of activity such as, for chickens, flying. Thus, the chicken's leg and thigh meat are dark, while its breast meat (which makes up the primary flight muscles) is white. Other birds with breast muscle more suitable for sustained flight, such as ducks and geese, have red muscle (and therefore <b>dark</b> <b>meat)</b> throughout. [...] Some cuts of meat including poultry expose the microscopic regular structure of intracellular muscle fibrils which can diffract light and produce iridescent colours, an optical phenomenon sometimes called structural colouration.|$|E
500|$|Generally, {{chickens}} are not fried whole; instead, {{the chicken}} is divided into its constituent pieces. The two white meat sections are the breast and the wing {{from the front of}} the chicken, while the <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> sections are the thigh and leg or [...] "drumstick", are from the rear of the chicken. These pieces are usually subdivided into the wings, the breasts (the wishbone is often cut out first in home cooking), the legs, and the thighs. The ribs are sometimes left on the breast, but commercially they and the back are usually discarded.|$|E
40|$|Thirty-four capretto {{carcasses}} slaughtered {{from nine}} genotypes {{were used in}} the present study to evaluate their meat quality. The nine genotypes were Feral X Feral (BF) as a control, Boer X Saanen (BS), Boer X Feral (BF), Saanen X Angora (SA), Saanen X Feral (SF), and Boer sired second crosses BBBA, BBBS, BBSF and BBSA. In general, BBSF tend to have higher ultimate pH, <b>darker</b> <b>meat</b> color, lower shear force resistance, and greater tenderness than other genotypes. In contrast, BBBS are likely to have lower ultimate pH, paler meat colour, higher cooking loss, higher shear force resistance, and lower subjective tenderness scores than other genotypes...|$|R
50|$|Claw <b>meat</b> is the <b>dark</b> pink <b>meat</b> {{that comes}} from the {{swimming}} fins and claws of the crab. It has a stronger taste, and is less expensive than the white color meat grades. It is often used in soups, where the strong taste comes through.|$|R
40|$|P>The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of markers developed in eight genes, located in a previously detected meat quality QTL region on SSC 17, on growth, fat and meat quality traits collected in commercial pig populations of different genetic backgrounds. The genes had been previously mapped to SSC 17 as part of a fine-mapping effort. Association analyses were conducted between each marker and the available phenotypic traits. Results showed that three genes (CTSZ, CSTF 1 and C 20 orf 43) were significantly associated with the growth traits. In addition, CTSZ also impacted on meat colour, with the less favourable genotype for growth being associated with <b>darker</b> <b>meat.</b> The differences observed between genotypes were substantial and may be of economic importance to pig producers. These markers may be useful for selecting for faster growth or improved meat quality...|$|R
2500|$|A culinary {{staple of}} North Carolina is pork barbecue. There are strong {{regional}} differences and rivalries over the sauces and methods used {{in making the}} barbecue. The common trend across Western North Carolina {{is the use of}} premium grade Boston butt. Western North Carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato-based sauce, and only the pork shoulder (<b>dark</b> <b>meat)</b> is used. Western North Carolina barbecue is commonly referred to as Lexington barbecue after the Piedmont Triad town of Lexington, home of the Lexington Barbecue Festival, which attracts over 100,000 visitors each October. [...] Eastern North Carolina pork barbecue uses a vinegar-and-red-pepper-based sauce and the [...] "whole hog" [...] is cooked, thus integrating both white and <b>dark</b> <b>meat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Squab is <b>dark</b> <b>meat,</b> and {{the skin}} is fatty, like that of duck. The meat is very lean, easily digestible, and [...] "rich in proteins, minerals, and vitamins". It has been {{described}} as having a [...] "silky" [...] texture, as it is very tender and fine-grained. It has a milder taste than other game, and {{has been described as}} having a mild berry flavor. Squab's flavor lends itself to complex red or white wines.

2500|$|They circulated, for instance, the reprint of {{an article}} quoted by the Aryan in its issue of March–April 1912 : [...] "The smoke-coloured Hindu, exotic, unmixable, picturesque, a languid worker and a refuge for fleas, we will always have with us, but we don’t want any more of him. We don’t want any Hindu women. We don’t want any Hindu children. It’s {{nonsense}} to talk about Hindu assimilation. The Sikh may be of Aryan stock; I always thought he was of Jewish extraction. He may be near-white though he does not look it. But we know him, and don’t want any more of him. British Columbia cannot allow any more of the <b>dark</b> <b>meat</b> {{of the world to}} come to this province. To deport these British subjects from India would be the wisest thing.

[...] Both Das and Kumar with the help of Surendramohan Bose and Hussain Rahim [...] had set to bring together the various Indian communities in terms of a united action, until it reached the climax in the Gadhar organisation. Bose had been sent to Japan by the Scientific and Industrial Association of Kolkata in 1906. On reaching Canada at the end of 1907, Bose had informed Sri Aurobindo on 26 December, that Bengalis were wrong in hoping for Japanese help in their nationalist movement, although they had some sympathisers. Specialised in chemistry, he also toured as a lecturer on Indian subjects. In 1913 he became the general secretary of the Hindustan Association of the USA. Shortly before leaving America, in 1913, [...] from Chicago, he sent to Harnam [...] notes and formulae of his own for making bombs. [...] In January 1914, Bose wrote again from Paris along with [...] "a valuable copy of the process used by the Russian Revolutionists..." [...] Having visited revolutionaries in Paris and Geneva, Bose reached India in February 1914. [...] Harnam Singh (of Sahri) was the other important revolutionary who shared with them this patriotic task : a former trooper of the 4th Cavalry in India, he had gone to China in 1904 and, three years later, reached Canada with Kumar. In 1908-1909 he attended school at Seattle, and went to Vancouver as Kumar’s guest. In a letter to Das, in July 1913, Kumar described Harnam {{as the leader of the}} revolutionary movement in Vancouver. Owing to his friendship with Harnam, Baba Gurdit Singh of the Komagata Maru affair knew well this zealous group and, prior to his expedition, had received from Das names and addresses of the leading Jugantar figures like Atulkrishna Ghose and Satish Chakravarti who worked under Jatindranath Mukherjee.

An experiment involving 60 male chickens {{reared in}} an organic production system {{was carried out}} in order to investigate carcass characteristics and qualitative meat traits of three slow-growing Italian local breeds of chicken (Ermellinata, Padovana, and Pépoi). 2. Chicks were randomly selected at hatch, raised together under the same conditions, slaughtered at 190 days of age, dissected for carcass traits, and meat (breast and thigh) was stored for subsequent analysis of quality parameters. 3. Ermellinata chickens were significantly different from Padovana and Pépoi chickens for live, carcass and thigh weights. Breeds were also different for breast muscle protein content (Ermellinata > Pépoi and Padovana, p Padovana and Ermellinata, p< 0. 05) values. 4. The CIE system values of lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) evidenced a distinctive <b>darker</b> <b>meat</b> and lighter skin colour of Padovana breast meat. 5.
