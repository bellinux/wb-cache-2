5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography <b>I</b> <b>Stole</b> Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E

500|$|The episode, which explores John Doggett's backstory as a New York City police officer, was {{described}} as containing similar themes as those [...] "explored on the Millennium series." [...] The episode guest-starred Arthur Nascarella, who {{was a friend of}} series co-star Robert Patrick. Patrick was essential in getting Nascarella cast on the show; he later joked [...] "I stole [...] New York accent in Copland [...] and <b>I</b> <b>stole</b> it to do The X-Files, but I got him cast in The X-Files show." ...|$|E

500|$|West Coast artist The Game also {{recounts the}} impact of Illmatic for fans like himself outside of New York.

500|$|Though an {{accomplished}} comic, Hardee was arguably more highly {{regarded as a}} [...] "character", a compère and talent-spotting booker at his own clubs, particularly The Tunnel Club in Greenwich, South East London, which gave vital and early exposure to up-and-coming comedians {{during the early years}} of British alternative comedy. In its obituary, The Times opined that [...] "throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences" [...] and one journalist claimed: [...] "To say that he has no shame is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has". In a publicity quote printed in Hardee's autobiography <b>I</b> <b>Stole</b> Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake, Arthur Smith wrote that Hardee had [...] "led his life as though for the perfect autobiography and now he has paid himself the compliment of writing it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{writing the}} script, O'Bannon drew {{inspiration}} from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He later stated that [...] "I didn't steal Alien from anybody. <b>I</b> <b>stole</b> it from everybody!" [...] The Thing from Another World (1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment. Forbidden Planet (1956) gave O'Bannon {{the idea of a}} ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning. Planet of the Vampires (1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien skeleton; this influenced the Nostromo crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. O'Bannon has also noted the influence of [...] "Junkyard" [...] (1953), a short story by Clifford D. Simak in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs. He has also cited as influences Strange Relations by Philip José Farmer (1960), which covers alien reproduction, and various EC Comics horror titles carrying stories in which monsters eat their way out of people.|$|E

500|$|In the 1950s, Kubrick and Harris {{developed}} a sitcom starring Ernie Kovacs and a film adaption {{of the book}} <b>I</b> <b>Stole</b> $16,000,000, but nothing came of them. Tony Frewin, an assistant who worked with the director {{for a long period}} of time, revealed in a March 2013 Atlantic article: [...] "He [...] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject." [...] Kubrick had intended making a film about the life story of Dietrich Schulz-Koehn, a Nazi officer who used the pen name [...] "Dr. Jazz" [...] to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book Swing Under the Nazis after he had finished production on Full Metal Jacket, the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Koehn. A screenplay was never completed and Kubrick's film adaptation plan was never initiated. The unfinished Aryan Papers, [...] based on Louis Begley's debut novel Wartimes Lies, was a factor in the abandonment of the project. Work on Aryan Papers depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) covered much of the same material.|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why don't I just admit it? <b>I</b> <b>stole</b> money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Laughlin {{appeared}} in the film Gidget as [...] "Lover Boy".

2500|$|Sacchetti's version differs: [...] "When I {{proposed}} to Lucio my original treatment for Per Sempre, which {{was nothing more}} than a sequel to The Postman Always Rings Twice in which a dead man returns to life, he became really enthusiastic and had my story read by a producer friend of his who then commissioned me to write a finished script. At that time, Fulci assumed that he would direct it. Later, for various reasons, problems arose and the film was never made. Four years later, (Lamberto) Bava used my script to make Per Sempre and Fulci, who was not working much at the time, got angry with me and started hurling these accusations. It's one thing for him to say that we were originally supposed to make the film together, but to claim that he originated the story and that <b>I</b> <b>stole</b> it from him is pure science fiction".|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Walter Phillips, who {{was present}} at two of the {{meetings}} in Jinzhou, wrote: [...] "It was at Chinchow that I first {{came into contact with}} the Revival. Meetings had been going on there for a week, hence, I was ushered into the heart of things unprepared, and in candour, I must add, with a strong temperamental prejudice against 'revival hysterics' in every form, so that mine is at least an unbiased witness. At once, on entering the church, one was conscious of something unusual. The place was crowded to the door, and tense, reverent attention sat on every face. The very singing was vibrant with new joy and vigour [...] [...] [...] The people knelt for prayer, silent at first, but soon one here and another there began to pray aloud. The voices grew and gathered volume and blended into a great wave of united supplication that swelled till it was almost a roar, and died down again into an undertone of weeping. Now I understood why the floor was so wet - [...] it was wet with pools of tears! The very air seemed electric -- I speak in all seriousness [...] - and strange thrills coursed up and down one's body. Then above the sobbing, in strained, choking tones, a man began to make public confession. Words of mine will fail to describe the awe and terror and pity of these confessions. It was not so much the enormity of the sins disclosed, or the depths of iniquity sounded, that shocked one[...] [...] [...] It was the agony of the penitent, his groans and cries, and voice shaken with sobs; it was the sight of men forced to their feet, and, in spite of their struggles, impelled, as it seemed, to lay bare their hearts that moved one and brought the smarting tears to one's own eyes. Never have I experienced anything more heart breaking, more nerve racking than the spectacle of those souls stripped naked before their fellows. So for hour after hour it went on, till the strain was almost more than the onlooker could bear. Now it was a big, strong farmer groveling on the floor, smiting his head on the bare boards as he wailed unceasingly, 'Lord! Lord!' Now a shrinking woman in a voice scarce above a whisper, now a wee laddie from the school, with the tears streaking his piteous grimy little face, as he sobbed out: 'I cannot love my enemies. Last week <b>I</b> <b>stole</b> a farthing from my teacher. I am always fighting and cursing. I beseech the pastor, elders and deacons to pray for me.' And then again would swell that wonderful deep organ tone of united prayer. And ever as the prayer sank again the ear caught a dull undertone of quiet sobbing, of desperate entreaty from men and women, who, lost to their surroundings, were wrestling for peace." ...|$|E

60|$|But I pleaded that <b>I</b> had <b>stole</b> nothing, {{they had}} lost nothing, that the door was open, and I went in, seeing the goods lie there, and with design to buy.
