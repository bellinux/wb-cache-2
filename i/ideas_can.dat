5|$|Until {{his final}} years, Wagner's life was characterised by {{political}} exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment, notably, {{since the late}} 20th century, where they express antisemitic sentiments. The effect of his <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be traced {{in many of the}} arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.|$|E

5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that existence is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|The first Penrose tiling (tiling P1 below) is an {{aperiodic}} set of six prototiles, {{introduced by}} Roger Penrose in a 1974 paper, {{but it is}} based on pentagons rather than squares. Any attempt to tile the plane with regular pentagons necessarily leaves gaps, but Johannes Kepler showed, in his 1619 work Harmonices Mundi, that these gaps can be filled using pentagrams (star polygons), decagons and related shapes. Traces of these <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> also be found in the work of Albrecht Dürer. Acknowledging inspiration from Kepler, Penrose found matching rules (which can be imposed by decorations of the edges) for these shapes, obtaining an aperiodic set. His tiling {{can be viewed as a}} completion of Kepler's finite Aa pattern.|$|E
5|$|The most {{complete}} coverage of Engelbart's bootstrapping <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> {{be found in}} Boosting Our Collective IQ, by Douglas C. Engelbart, 1995. This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by Yuri Rubinsky and Christina Engelbart to commemorate {{the presentation of the}} 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee. Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart Institute.|$|E

5|$|These <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be {{illustrated}} by drawing objects in pairs. It {{is difficult to}} depict zero groups of two, or to emphasize the nonexistence of a leftover object, so it helps to draw other groupings and to compare them with zero. For example, {{in the group of}} five objects, there are two pairs. More importantly, there is a leftover object, so 5 is odd. In the group of four objects, there is no leftover object, so 4 is even. In the group of just one object, there are no pairs, and there is a leftover object, so 1 is odd. In the group of zero objects, there is no leftover object, so 0 is even.|$|E

25|$|Later Greek historians {{consider}} Democritus to {{have established}} aesthetics {{as a subject}} of investigation and study, as he wrote theoretically on poetry and fine art long before authors such as Aristotle. Specifically, Thrasyllus identified six works in the philosopher's oeuvre which had belonged to aesthetics as a discipline, but only fragments of the relevant works are extant; hence of all Democritus's writings on these matters, {{only a small percentage}} of his thoughts and <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be known.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} Christianity, {{as well as}} the {{historical}} Jesus and the , are a matter of longstanding debates in theological and historical research. Within a few years after the death of Jesus in c. 33 CE, already before Paul started preaching, a number of proto-Christian communities seem to have been in existence. A central question is how these communities developed and what their original convictions were, as a wide range of beliefs and <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be found in early Christianity, including adoptionism, docetism and gnosticism, which were deemed heretical by proto-orthodox Christianity.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} that George Eliot depicts in Scenes of Clerical Life {{religion}} in England was undergoing significant changes. While Dissenting (Nonconformist) Churches had been established {{as early as the}} Church of England itself, the emergence of Methodism in 1739 presented particular challenges to the Established Church. Evangelicalism, at first confined to the Dissenting Churches, soon found adherents within the Church of England itself. Meanwhile, {{at the other end of}} the religious spectrum, the Oxford Movement was seeking to emphasise the Church of England's identity as a catholic and apostolic Church, reassessing its relationship to Roman Catholicism. Thus in the early 19th century Midlands that George Eliot would later depict various religious <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be identified: the tension between the Established and the Dissenting Churches, and the differing strands within Anglicanism itself, between the Low church, the High church and the Broad church.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to its Pittsburgh campus, Carnegie Mellon has a branch campus in the Middle East, Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, which offers a full undergraduate curriculum with degree programs in computer science, business administration, biology, computational biology, and information systems. The campus is located in Doha’s Education City which is home to multiple other U.S. universities {{all of which are}} funded by the Qatar Foundation. The Qatari campus in particular {{has been the subject of}} criticism due to Qatar’s adherence to Sharia Law and lack of freedom of speech and intellectual freedoms. Questions have been raised about whether an American institution that values these <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> provide an equal experience in a community that limits them. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon and other U.S. Universities in Education City have been criticized for being essentially complicit in Qatar's funding of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, and Hamas and their questionable human rights record by continuing to operate there despite these issues.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, writing {{shifted from}} the Puritanism of Winthrop and Bradford to Enlightenment ideas of reason. The belief that human and natural occurrences were {{messages}} from God no longer fit with the new human-centered world. Many intellectuals believed that the human mind could comprehend the universe through {{the laws of physics}} as described by Isaac Newton. One of these was Cotton Mather. The first book published in North America that promoted Newton and natural theology was Mather's The Christian Philosopher (1721). The enormous scientific, economic, social, and philosophical, changes of the 18th century, called the Enlightenment, impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture, making way for democratic principles. The increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time. In 1670, the population of the colonies numbered approximately 111,000. Thirty years later it was more than 250,000. By 1760, it reached 1,600,000. The growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies. These new <b>ideas</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the popularity of Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography.|$|E
