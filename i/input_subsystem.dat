Many companies will try to be flexible enough in facing the changes around their environment, especially which deal with the industry they choose. To be able to follow the development worldwide, some companies develop useful information system in order to help them in understanding their strengths and weaknesses, and also to view the competitors. The system is not only applied to Manufacturing Companies, but also to Service Company. PT "X" is a Shipping Company that chooses to run an Operational Information System as a tool to integrate the divisions and also the branches in the company. This System makes it possible for the management to know the company improvement and to find the idle capacity in the company. If those problems are handled, there would be improvement in internal results of the company including efficiency, effectiveness, quality of service and also efficiency of costs. The problem is "How could the application of the Operational Information System create efficiency in the operational activities of "X" Shipping company ?"

One of the marketing strategies currently conducted by the company is employing salesmen to help distribute its products, supported by promotion for customers and distributors. The company is compelled to compete with competitors from other companies in Tuban {{as well as other}} big companies A good marketing information system well supports marketing efforts of companies that undertake it, as the information produced can assist them in selecting the appropriate marketing strategy. The problem is "To what extent is the role played by the marketing information system of the Laron soya company in relation to its decision to determine a marketing strategy?" The theories utilized by this study are concerned with marketing information strategies and marketing strategies. The matrix analysis of Marketing Mix, SWOT, Grand Strategy and evaluation in the form of strategy selection are employed to support the analysis. This research is descriptive in nature and employs qualitative data. The object of the research is the management of "Laron" soya company, its distributors and consumers. The instruments for data collection are documentation, interviews and questionnaires on the company management. The result of measurement and matrix analysis of Marketing Mix indicates that the position of "Laron" soya company is in the quadrant I, meaning that the company is still strong and potential. The matrix analysis using Grand Strategy places the company in quadrant II where there are seven alternative strategies. The result of an analysis on the seven alternative strategies indicates that currently there are only three strategies that can be implemented supported by marketing information strategy.
