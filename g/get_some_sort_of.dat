Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to honouring journalists, Lindsey Hilsum, the Channel 4 News International Editor {{who was the}} host of the 2014 awards, emphasises that the Amnesty Awards play a very important role in encouraging editors to allow journalists to cover more obscure stories that are far away and expensive. She said that when: “you point out that you won an Amnesty Award for a similar story a couple of years ago. It makes editors think that they will <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> kudos from this, and that it matters within the industry. So I think it’s tremendously important and I think Amnesty is doing a tremendous job by giving us these awards so that we can use them to say: ‘Yes, we’ve got to carry on reporting human rights, it really matters’." ...|$|E

Do you think your mother would mind if I took him up to have a wash? He's had a longish walk. And might he have some breakfast? He must be hungry." ...|$|R
5000|$|Addiction to the {{chemicals}} {{released in the}} brain during starving and physical activity: [...] people affected with anorexia often report <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> high from not eating. The effect of food restriction and intense activity causes symptoms similar to anorexia in female rats, {{though it is not}} explained why this addiction affects only females.|$|R

5000|$|... 3D reconstructions of ARMAN {{cells in}} the {{environment}} has revealed that {{a small number of}} them attach to other Archaea of the order Thermoplasmatales (Baker et al. 2010 [...] ). The Thermoplasmatales cells appear to penetrate the cell wall to the cytoplasm of the ARMAN cells. The nature of this interaction hasn't been determined. It could be <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> parasitic or symbiotic interaction. It is possible that ARMAN is <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> metabolite that it is not able to produce on its own.|$|R

6000|$|... "Certainly, Fred. I am {{not afraid}} of that crowd, and the more they talk the better I'll like it, for then I can <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> line on what they are aiming at." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{believe it}} will, my boy. I had {{intended}} to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> covering for my dear Ailie put up in the stern-sheets; but I {{did not think of}} absolutely making a box for her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon. Your brother evidently has {{something}} on his mind apart from business.

6000|$|... "Nothing at all," [...] Laverick answered, with an inward {{sense of}} thankfulness. [...] "To {{tell you the}} truth, though, I am afraid you are right {{and that he did}} <b>get</b> into <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> trouble last night.

6000|$|Toward {{daylight}} of {{the same}} morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy sleep and opened his eyes in the dark.

6000|$|My {{brother who}} was still one of Herne's company of players in Shore Acres, had no home to break up, but he said, [...] "I'm going to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{headquarters}} in New York.

5000|$|Lurie then {{wrote and}} {{directed}} Nothing But the Truth, {{which is based on}} the stories of Valerie Plame and Judith Miller, which stars Kate Beckinsale, Matt Dillon, Angela Bassett, Alan Alda and David Schwimmer. Lurie insisted his film is not intended to be an accurate depiction of the Plame Affair, but merely a vehicle to explore a similar situation, which he then takes several steps further. [...] "You look at the story that happened in reality, and Judy Miller <b>gets</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> permission to speak and then speaks. So what? Nothing really big came of the whole thing," [...] explained Lurie in an interview published prior to the film's release. [...] "I tried to make a movie that's a commercial thriller as well as being something that's topical." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{time had}} been when he would have {{attempted}} comfort; when he would have tried mocking; but that time was long past; he could only pray inwardly for <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> diversion, but {{what it was to}} be in their barren circumstance he was obliged to leave altogether to Providence. He ventured, pending an answer to his prayers upon the question, [...] "Don't you think I'd better see the doctor, and <b>get</b> you <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> tonic?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then she can't get any education. Old Gould is a {{sensible}} man, who says any school {{he could afford}} would only turn her out a sham, and he means, when Mary and Kate are a little older, to <b>get</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> governess for the three. But, mother, couldn't you just let him bring her in on market days and teach her a little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{admitted}} that {{such was the}} case, and added after a pause that I wished {{he had been able}} to follow my example. [...] "You think I don't?"

60|$|It {{was only}} the English kingdom that had really rebelled against, and put to death King Charles's father. There had {{been a great deal}} of {{difficulty}} in Scotland, it is true, and the republican spirit had spread quite extensively in that country. Still, affairs had not proceeded to such extremities there. The Scotch had, in some degree, joined with the English in resisting Charles the First, but it was not their wish to throw off the royal authority altogether. They abhorred episcopacy in the Church, but were well enough contented with monarchy in the state. Accordingly, soon after the death of the father, they had opened negotiations with the son, and had manifested their willingness to acknowledge him as their king, on certain conditions which they undertook to prescribe to him. It is very hard for a king to hold his scepter on conditions prescribed by his people. Charles tried every possible means to avoid submitting to this necessity. He found, however, that the only possible avenue of access to England was by first <b>getting</b> <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> possession of Scotland; and so, signifying his willingness to comply with the Scotch demands, he set sail from Holland with his court, moved north ward with his little squadron over the waters of the German Ocean, and at length made port In the Frith of Cromarty, in the north of Scotland.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} {{students}} {{on a field trip}} to Lapland uncovers an ancient shield. One of the students <b>gets</b> possessed by <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> spirit essence and when a supposed rescue team arrives an epic battle over an entity trapped in the shield begins.|$|R

Now," [...] he continued, with a hope <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> into <b>some</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> human {{relations}} with his guest {{which he had}} not felt before, [...] "why shouldn't a young man on a farm take up some scientific study, like geology, for instance, which makes every inch of earth vocal, every rock historic, and the waste places social?" [...] Barker looked so blankly at him that he asked again, [...] "You understand?" ...|$|R
