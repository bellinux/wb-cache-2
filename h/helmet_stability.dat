40|$|One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} of a protective bicycle helmet is to provide and maintain adequate coverage to the head. A poorly fitting or fastened helmet may be displaced during normal use or even ejected during a crash. The aims {{of the current study}} were to identify factors that influence the size of helmet worn, identify factors that influence helmet position and adjustment, and examine the effects of helmet size worn and adjustment on <b>helmet</b> <b>stability.</b> Methods: Recreational and commuter cyclists in Sydney were surveyed to determine how helmet size and/or adjustment affected <b>helmet</b> <b>stability</b> in the real world. Anthropometric characteristics of the head were measured and, to assess <b>helmet</b> <b>stability,</b> a test analogous to the requirements of the Australian bicycle helmet standard was undertaken. Results: Two hundred sixty-seven cyclists were recruited across all age groups and 91 % wore an AS/NZS 2063 -compliant helmet. The main ethnic group was Europeans (71 %) followed by Asians (18 %). The circumferences of the cyclists&# 039; heads matched well the circumference of the relevant ISO headform for the chosen helmet size, but the head shapes differed with respect to ISO headforms. Age and gender were associated with wearing an incorrectly sized helmet and helmet adjustment. Older males (> 55 years) were most likely to wear an incorrectly sized helmet. Adult males in the 35 - 54 year age group were most likely to wear a correctly adjusted helmet. Using quasistatic <b>helmet</b> <b>stability</b> tests, {{it was found that the}} correctness of adjustment, rather than size, head dimensions, or shape, significantly affected <b>helmet</b> <b>stability</b> in all test directions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: One {{solution}} to prevent flight-related neck pain in military helicopter pilots is to initiate ergonomic {{improvements in the}} equipment used by the pilots and loadmasters. The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify factors that may be important for optimizing helmet use and adjustments with respect to neck load among the helicopter crew of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. A second aim was to identify the factors contributing to an ideal flight helmet. Methods: We interviewed 12 pilots and 11 loadmasters using semi-structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and qualitative analyses were performed. Various factors as well as their interrelations and relation to experienced neck load emerged as the analysis progresses and were discussed by the research team. Results: Factors that were directly related to the experienced neck load were type of flight operations and tasks as well as the weight and the weight distribution of the flight helmet. Factors that indirectly contributed to the experienced neck load were the stability of the helmet, the helmet fit and comfort. Factors that contributed to an ideal flight helmet were categorized into task- and user-related factors. The latter category included factors to increase comfort and usability as well as a considerable number of the above-mentioned factors to optimize helmet use and adjustments with respect to neck load. Conclusion: Several factors related to helmet use and adjustments were found to contribute to the experienced neck load and were either directly or indirectly related. The next step should be to improve the helmet fit and the <b>helmet</b> <b>stability</b> taking the comfort issues into account, and to evaluate the effect of optimizing these factors on the experienced neck load. Relevance to industry: Neck pain in military helicopter aircrew is of growing concern to various militaries, especially because flight missions occur more frequently in the dark and the aircrew use night vision goggles. The results of this study provide useful information to the flight helmet industry because the neck load and factors such as weight, weight distribution, <b>helmet</b> <b>stability,</b> helmet fit and comfort issues are important considerations for helmet designs and requirements.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to improve the helmet fit of {{military}} helicopter aircrew members and evaluate its effect on the experienced <b>helmet</b> <b>stability</b> (helmet gliding), neck load, neck pain, hot spots (pressure points), irritation/distraction, and overall helmet comfort during night flights. A within-subject design was used over a three-month period that consisted of two consecutive interventions of optimising the fit of the aircrew's helmets: 1) a new helmet fit using a renewed protocol and 2) replacement of a thermoplastic inner liner with a viscoelastic foam inner liner. A total of 18 pilots and loadmasters rated the outcome measures using the Visual Analogue Scales immediately after their night flights, for three night flights in total per measurement period. The optimised helmet fit resulted in a significant decrease in the experienced helmet gliding, neck load and pressure points, a decrease trend in the experienced neck pain and irritation/distraction, and a significant increase in the experienced overall helmet comfort during flight. These results demonstrate the importance of achieving an optimised helmet fit for military helicopter aircrew and that an optimised helmet fit might have implications for both health and safety concerns.

40|$|Among warm giant stars, rapid {{mass loss}} sets in along a well defined {{velocity}} dividing line (VDL). Hot corona also disappear {{close to the}} VDL and thermal pressure cannot drive the observed rapid mass loss in these stars. The VDL {{may be associated with}} magnetic fields changing from closed to open. Such a change is consistent with the lack of X-rays from late-type giants. A magnetic transition locus based on Pneuman's work on <b>helmet</b> streamer <b>stability</b> agrees well with the empirical VDL. The change from closed to open fields not only makes rapid mass loss possible, but also contributes to energizing the mass loss in the form of discrete bubbles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order for}} bicycle helmets to {{maintain}} sufficient coverage {{and protection of}} riders, the helmets must be adequately positioned and secured on the head. This research investigates <b>helmet's</b> dynamic <b>stability</b> parameters {{in order to determine}} whether a customised liner can improve the retention and therefore safety. A specialist 3 D scanner was used to scan a total of 17 male participants who volunteered for this study. Through 3 D scanning the shape and depth of each section of a participant's head and facial structure was captured. All the heads scanned were orientated with respect to the same co-ordinates based on the Australian and New Zealand Standards in order to customize the liner design to fit the user's heads. The dynamic stability of the commercially available helmets and the customized helmet were assessed using relevant video and goniometer techniques. The results indicate that for frontal roll-off, the customised helmet liner passed in all simulations of the 160 mm drop height. It consistently performed better in the lateral roll-off at height of 40 mm and 80 mm compared with the commercially available helmets. While the dynamic stability measurements and the design strategies offer the potential to improve fit for different user's head, further studies should take into consideration a larger population size to draw more accurate conclusions...|$|R
40|$|The current sizing of {{a bicycle}} helmet is {{available}} to cater for the general head sizes, ranging from S/M and L/XL, {{but there is also}} a universal model that can fit all sizes through adjustable helmet straps. However, based on the reported human anthropometric data, the human head shape and dimensions are different according to ethnic group, age and gender [1 - 3]. Furthermore, numerous surveys addressed the discomfort in wearing a helmet, and the current sizing did not accommodate the range users [4 - 7]. Asian users also reported they were experiencing poor fit when wearing a helmet because most helmets are designed according to the size of Western heads [2, 8]. Therefore, it can be concluded that the general size of helmets currently available in the market could not accommodate the range of human head shapes and dimensions. One possible solution to overcome the helmet &ldquo;fit&rdquo; problem for each user is the customized &ldquo;user-centred&rdquo; or &ldquo;subject-specific&rdquo; helmet design approach. The key to facilitating this approach to bicycle helmet is to build the inner liner according to the contour and shape of the head of each person. However, it is also important to note that changing the liner thickness and shape to improve helmet fit might influence the safety aspects of the bicycle helmet, such as the helmet liner impact attenuation properties and <b>helmet</b> dynamic <b>stability.</b> Since the user-centred design approach is quite new and has not been adopted previously in the bicycle helmet design, there is a lack of information on this area in the literature. This has motivated the author to bridge the knowledge gap, and therefore the primary aim of this research is to investigate the safety performance of a user-centred helmet liner design in drop impact test and dynamic stability test. The tests were performed using validated finite element (FE) models specifically developed for each test. In the end, a new framework was developed to test and validate the mass customised system of a new automated user-centred bicycle helmet design. Apart from its primary function as a protective item, impact strength is one of the most important aspects to be considered when designing a bicycle helmet [9]. The author has performed experimental drop impact tests on three commercial helmet models to gather important information to develop an FE model of the drop impact test. The author has also used new correlation methods, specifically created for the helmet impact test, to validate the simulation model according to the experimental results. The correlation methods are the Peak Score (PS), the Impact Duration Score (IDS) and the statistical Pearson correlation score. Very good correlation scores (more than 80 %, in the scale of 0 %- 100 %) between experimental and simulation results have been achieved using the aforementioned methods, and this indicates that the simulation model is consistent, accurate and reliable. Another important criterion for the bicycle helmet is the dynamic stability performance. The degree of helmet rotation, usually called the roll-off angle is observed, and the helmet will fail the test if the helmet completely comes of the head form. From the literature review, it was found that a very limited FE model has been previously developed to simulate dynamic stability test of a bicycle helmet. To fill the knowledge gap, a dynamic stability FE model was developed using rotational velocity as the input load to the helmet assembly. Again, the author has performed experimental dynamic stability tests on commercial bicycle helmets using a test rig specifically constructed for that purpose. The FE helmet model was observed to move and roll on the headform, similar to the helmet movement and behaviour recorded in the experiment. The Roll-off Score (RoS) results also showed that the FE model achieved comparably very similar results to those from the experiment. It should also be noted that a high-accuracy 3 D (45 &mu;m accuracy) scanner was used to capture an accurate 3 D representation of bicycle helmet components for both FE models. Another high-accuracy portable scanner (resolution up to 0. 5 mm, accuracy up to 0. 1 mm) was also used to scan the head shapes of participants in this study to create the customized user-centred bicycle helmet. The author also used the developed FE models to compare the performance of the user-centred bicycle helmet with the current helmet model in the drop impact tests and dynamic stability tests. Geomagic Studio 12 software was used to create the user-centred bicycle helmet based on the original commercial bicycle helmet design, where the inside part of the helmet was modified to follow the scanned head shape and size of participants, while the outside part of the helmet remained unchanged. This comparison has not been published in the literature before, and therefore it is a significant new knowledge. The result revealed that the user-centred bicycle helmet design influences the peak linear acceleration (PLA) of a helmet in an impact test. Due to the different head shape of each participant, it was observed that PLA increased when liner thickness is reduced at certain test area and decreased when liner thickness is increased. This information is important when designing the framework of customization of user-centred bicycle helmet design to make sure each user-centred helmet would pass the test without testing each of this custom helmet every time. It was also revealed that the rate of increase of the PLA is different according to the impact location when different liner thicknesses of the same helmet model were tested and compared. Moreover, foam density also influences the PLA, and higher PLA was noticed when the foam is either too hard (high-density) or too soft (low-density). A ranking of design factor influences on drop impact performance has also been established. The helmet liner thickness was found to have the most influence on impact properties of a bicycle helmet, followed by the impact location and liner density. In a dynamic stability test, the user-centred helmet was found to have a lower roll-off angle and hence performed better than the original helmet, when tested using the customised headform, made according to the head shape of each participant. This significant result strongly suggests that helmet fit improves the dynamic <b>stability</b> of bicycle <b>helmet.</b> It was also revealed that <b>helmet</b> dynamic <b>stability</b> performance was not strongly influenced by the helmet liner density because only a small difference in roll-off angles wasobserved for each helmet with different density. Conversely, dynamic stability was heavily influenced by the thickness of the liner. A helmet with thicker liner recorded a higher roll-off angle compared to one with a thinner liner. The fit of a user-centred helmet based on the commercial helmet model was compared to the original model with the standard sizing using Helmet Fit Index (HFI), using the standoff distance between the helmet and the head, as well as the helmet protection proportion. As expected, they have higher HFI than the original helmet with the standard size, indicating that the user-centred helmet has a better fit with the participant head shape compared to the helmet with the standard sizes. A new automated and customised bicycle helmet design has been developed within the research group. Using this tool, a customised bicycle helmet is developed using the digital data of head scan of an individual. For certification and testing purpose, the system created four headform groups based on the 122 participants of a cyclist community in Australia. A novel approach to creating the Maximum Head Shape (MaH) and Minimum Head Shape (MiH) of each group was proposed to test the new helmet design in a drop impact test and dynamic stability test. The worst-case helmet is created based on the Maximum Head Shape (MaH), while the best-case helmet is created using the Minimum Head Shape (MiH) of the group. This method was adopted in a case study of only a group, and we could ensure that each customised helmet design in that group would pass the drop impact test and dynamic stability test. The methods of using best-case and worst-case helmets as limitation eliminate the necessity to test each customised helmet created based on the head shape of the participant...|$|R
40|$|Observations and {{measurements}} of head dimensions, helmet position, adjustment, and stability {{were made on}} 216 motorcyclists. Helmet details were recorded. Participants completed a questionnaire on helmet usability and their riding history. <b>Helmet</b> <b>stability</b> was assessed quasistatically. Results: Differences between the dimensions of ISO headforms and equivalent sized motorcyclists&# 039; heads were observed, especially head width. Almost all (94 %) of the helmets were labeled {{to be compliant with}} AS/NZS 1698 (2006). The majority of riders were satisfied with the comfort, fit, and usability aspects of their helmets. The majority of helmets were deemed to have been worn correctly. Using quasistatic pull tests, it was found that helmet type (open-face or full-face) and the wearing correctness were among factors that affected the loads at which helmets became displaced. The forces required to displace the helmet were low, around 25 N. Conclusions: The size of the in-use motorcycle helmets did not correspond well to the predicted size based on head dimensions, although motorcyclists were generally satisfied with comfort and fit. The in vivo stability tests appear to overpredict that helmets will come off in a crash, based on the measured forces, tangential forces measured in the oblique impact tests, and the actual rate of helmet ejection. Objectives: One of the main requirements of a protective helmet is to provide and maintain appropriate and adequate coverage to the head. A helmet that is poorly fitted or fastened may become displaced during normal use or even ejected during a crash...|$|E
