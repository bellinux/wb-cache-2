This, though I hold it an entirely false view, is nevertheless a comprehensible and pardonable one, especially in a man familiar with the reasoning capacities of the public; though those capacities themselves owe half their shortcomings to being so unworthily treated. But, on the whole, and looking broadly at the way the speakers and teachers of the nation set about their business, there is an almost fathomless failure in the results, owing to the general admission of special pleading as an art to be taught to youth. The main thing which we ought to teach our youth is to see something,--all that the eyes which God has given them are capable of seeing. The sum of what we do teach them is to say something. As far as I have experience of instruction, no man ever dreams of teaching a boy to get to the root of a matter; to think it out; to get quit of passion and desire in the process of thinking; or to fear no face of man in plainly asserting the ascertained result. But to say anything in a glib and graceful manner,--to give an epigrammatic turn to nothing,--to quench the dim perceptions of a feeble adversary, and parry cunningly the home thrusts of a strong one,--to invent blanknesses in speech for breathing time, and slipperinesses in speech for hiding time,--to polish malice to the deadliest <b>edge,</b> <b>shape</b> profession to the seemliest shadow, and mask self-interest under the fairest pretext,--all these skills we teach definitely, as the main arts of business and life. There is a strange significance in the admission of Aristotle's Rhetoric at our universities as a class-book. Cheating at cards is a base profession enough, but truly it would be wiser to print a code of gambler's legerdemain, and give that for a class-book, than to make the legerdemain of human speech, and the clever shuffling of the black spots in the human heart, the first study of our politic youth. Again, the Ethics of Aristotle, though containing some shrewd talk, interesting for an old reader, are yet so absurdly illogical and sophistical, that if a young man has once read them with any faith, it must take years before he recovers from the induced confusions of thought and false habits of argument. If there were the slightest dexterity or ingenuity in maintaining the false theory, there might be some excuse for retaining the Ethics as a school-book, provided only the tutor were careful to point out, on first opening it, that the Christian virtues,--namely, to love with all the heart, soul, and strength; to fight, not as one that beateth the air; and to do with might whatsoever the hand findeth to do,--could not in anywise be defined as [...] "habits of choice in moderation." [...] But the Aristotelian quibbles are so shallow, that I look upon the retention of the book as a confession by our universities that they consider practice in shallow quibbling one of the essential disciplines of youth. Take, for instance, the distinction made between [...] "Envy" [...] and [...] "Rejoicing at Evil" [...] ([Greek: phthonos] and [Greek: epichairekakia]), in the second book of the Ethics, viz., that envy is grieved when any one meets with good-fortune; but [...] "the rejoicer at evil so far misses of grieving, as even to rejoice" [...] (the distinction between the good and evil, as subjects of the emotion, being thus omitted, and merely the verbal opposition of grief and joy caught at); and conceive the result, in the minds of most youths, of being forced to take tricks of words such as this (and there are too many of them in even the best Greek writers) for subjects of daily study and admiration; the theory of the Ethics being, besides, so hopelessly untenable, that even quibbling will not always face it out,--nay, will not help it in exactly the first and most important example of virtue which Aristotle has to give, and the very one which we might have thought his theory would have fitted most neatly; for defining [...] "temperance" [...] as a mean, and intemperance as one relative extreme, not being able to find an opposite extreme, he escapes with the apology that {{the kind of person who}} sins in the other extreme [...] "has no precise name; because, on the whole, he does not exist!" ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{research}} the effects of leading <b>edge</b> <b>shapes</b> {{on the strength of}} centrifugal compressor compeller, the shrouded impellers of a large centrifugal compressor were introduced for finite element analysis. In the present study, the geometric models of 3 shrouded impellers were established in Solidworks 2007, and then numerical simulations were carried out using ANSYS. Through visualization of the computational result of the impellers with a square leading edge, a semi-circular leading edge and a elliptical leading edge, it was clarified by comparison that different leading <b>edge</b> <b>shapes</b> had significant influences on the compressor strength. According to the charts of the Von Mises stress versus leading <b>edge</b> <b>shapes,</b> it was indicated that approximately a 27 % drop and a 32 % drop in maximum Von Mises stress value occurred in the shrouded impellers of a semi-circular leading edge and a elliptical leading edge compared to a square leading edge respectively. That is, the semi-circular leading edge or elliptical leading edge employed in a centrifugal compressor would dramatically improve structural strength.

50|$|Scrapers are {{typically}} formed by chipping {{the end of}} a flake of stone in order to create one sharp side and to keep the rest of the sides dull to facilitate grasping it. Most scrapers are either circle or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites in North America. Scrapers {{are one of the most}} varied lithic tools found at archaeological sites. Due to the vast array of scrapers there are many typologies that scrapers can fall under, including tool size, tool shape, tool base, the number of working edges, edge angle, <b>edge</b> <b>shape,</b> and many more.|$|E

The CFD RANS-SST with a commercial code ANSYS CFX simulation is performed for the fully submerged NACA 0012 aerofoil of 150 mm chord length with three tailing edge shapes: standard straight line, saw-toothed and sine-curved shapes. The results show that a 25 % increment of drag coefficient for saw-toothed tailing <b>edge</b> <b>shape</b> compared to the standard tailing edge shapes at Re = 5. 25 × 104, and the increase of 14 % at Re = 1. 05 × 105 and 2. 10 × 105.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{aims of the}} {{investigations}} {{presented in this paper}} were to measure the tool load under conditions of drilling and to analyze if changes of the cutting <b>edge</b> <b>shape</b> and profile significantly influence the edge stresses. The described methods to analyze the influences of <b>edge</b> <b>shape</b> modifications will contribute to the optimization of drilling tools. Based on a specific cutting <b>edge</b> <b>shape</b> of a drill, systematic changes to the edge were made. Forces and temperatures on the cutting edge were measured as well as the heat flow into the chips and the workpiece. Using a quick-stop device, length and type of chip for the different drills under various machining parameters were observed. It could be shown that the modification of the transition from the chisel to the cutting edge influences the stress developed, heat in chip and chip formation. Machining with a rounded cutting <b>edge</b> <b>shape</b> compared to a sharp edge reduces the mechanical load but slightly increases thermal tool load. The presented experimental and FEA method show the possibility of determining influences of modified cutting edge shapes and to adapt the drill {{to the needs of the}} drilling process. The cutting force and stress developed during drilling processes has direct influence on the generation of heat, tool wear, quality of machined surface and accuracy of workpiece. Due to complex tool geometry, cutting conditions and some unknown factors theoretical cutting force and stress calculation failed to produce accurate results. To see the behavior of drill either experimental or Finite Elemental Analysis can be used. By using both the methods validation of results can be possible...|$|E
