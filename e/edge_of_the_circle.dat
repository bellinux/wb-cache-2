500|$|In 1957, Coxeter {{obtained}} Escher's {{permission to}} use two of his drawings in his paper [...] "Crystal symmetry and its generalizations". He sent Escher {{a copy of the}} paper; Escher recorded that Coxeter's figure of a hyperbolic tessellation [...] "gave me quite a shock": the infinite regular repetition of the tiles in the hyperbolic plane, growing rapidly smaller towards the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> was precisely what he wanted to allow him to represent infinity on a two-dimensional plane.|$|E
500|$|The {{monument}} is sited in {{the center}} of Logan Circle, a 1.8 acre (0.73 ha) public park and traffic circle in the Logan Circle neighborhood at the convergence of 13th Street, P Street, Rhode Island Avenue and Vermont Avenue NW. [...] Sidewalks lead from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> to the monument on axis with the surrounding streets. [...] Around twenty oak trees are planted throughout the circle and a small, ornamental iron fence surrounds the statue base.|$|E
60|$|Wherever {{there was}} space and foothold, people swarmed, little people, small and {{minutely}} clear, except where the sunset touched them to indistinguishable gold. They clambered up the tottering walls, they clung in wreaths and groups about the high-standing pillars. They swarmed along <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> ruins. <b>The</b> air {{was full of}} their shouting, and they were pressing and swaying towards the central space.|$|R

50|$|On 21 June 2016 the club's {{management}} {{presented the}} official emblem at the 2016/2017 season press conference. The current symbol {{is based on}} the symbol that served the club from the 1995/1996 season to the 2015/2016 season: <b>the</b> lower half <b>circle</b> shape is half a soccer ball, the top half contains a chimney symbolizing the municipal building, a symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original executive, and <b>the</b> top <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> display <b>the</b> club's Hebrew and English name. In addition, the crest is displayed above the round star; this star represents that the club has won championships.|$|R
500|$|The Du Pont family chose {{architect}} Henry Bacon and sculptor Daniel Chester French {{to design}} a fountain that reflected the Beaux-Arts and neoclassical styles that were popular in the neighborhood at the time, such as the Patterson Mansion, located on the northeast <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> [...] Bacon {{is best known for}} designing the Lincoln Memorial while French's best known work is the statue of Abraham Lincoln inside the memorial. [...] French's other works in Washington, D.C. include the Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain, the First Division Monument and the [...] [...] The total cost of the commission was $77,521. [...] The CFA approved the design in 1917 and work began on the fountain shortly thereafter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circular}} patch shows {{a drawing}} of a Saturn V rocket with the letters USA on it. To its right, an Apollo CSM is shown next to an LM, with the CSM's nose pointed at the [...] "front door" [...] of the LM rather than at its top docking port. The CSM is trailing rocket fire in a circle. The crew's names are along the top <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> with APOLLO IX at the bottom. The [...] "D" [...] in McDivitt's name is filled with red to mark {{that this was the}} [...] "D mission" [...] in the alphabetic sequence of Apollo missions. The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.|$|E

50|$|Consistent hashing {{is based}} on mapping each object to a point on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>circle</b> (or equivalently, mapping each object to a real angle).The system maps each {{available}} machine (or other storage bucket) to many pseudo-randomly distributed points on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>circle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The radius {{is named}} so because the radius (bone) acts like <b>the</b> radius (<b>of</b> a <b>circle).</b> It rotates around the ulna {{and the far}} end (where it joins to <b>the</b> bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hand), known as <b>the</b> styloid process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius, is the {{distance}} from <b>the</b> ulna (center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle)</b> to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radius (<b>the</b> <b>circle).</b> <b>The</b> ulna acts as the center point to <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> because when <b>the</b> arm is rotated the ulna does not move.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aerobatic}} teams {{established on}} <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1st and 2nd squadrons already {{had their own}} names and symbols. Several proposals were raised for the 3rd group. The first one suggested the name [...] "Ants", while the commanding squadron favored [...] "Fugitive Hussars", but got rejected. The name [...] "Grizzlies" [...] also came up, but wasn't accepted because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct allusion to the Russia-North American relationship. It was then <b>the</b> commander <b>of</b> aviation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moscow Military District, Lt. Gen. Antoshkin proposed <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> [...] "Celestial Hussars" [...] that satisfied everyone. Coloring scheme was soon hammered down to white, blue and red, and a patterned buckle pelisse was painted at <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. The emblem was a circle on a white background, with for attack aircraft in a diamond formation, and the crossed hussar sabers directly, the [...] "Celestial Hussars, Kubinka" [...] inscription was put on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> <b>The</b> new scheme was shown on the Su-25s to the audience on 12 April 1992, at the [...] "Aviadvigateli-92" [...] international exhibition held in Kubinka.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the crackling, the shots, the yells ceased, or were {{drowned in}} {{a volume of}} greater sound. Neale ran to the window. The flare from the burning tents was dying down. But into the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of light he saw loom a line of horsemen.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this more thoroughly I walked round both fires and readjusted the logs, sending up showers of sparks as I did so. Then I went to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of light, in the centre of which our camp lay, and peered into the gloom of the dark forest.|$|E

5000|$|The above specification, {{given by}} Turkish Flag Law, {{implies that the}} {{distance}} between (<b>the</b> left <b>edge</b> <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crescent and a vertical line connecting the two pointed ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crescent is [...] G = 0.34875 G; thus, <b>the</b> left point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star intrudes about 0.0154 G beyond that line.|$|R
60|$|Amoraq {{jumped from}} the bench where she sat, and began to sweep things into the girl's lap--stone lamps, iron skin-scrapers, tin kettles, deer-skins {{embroidered}} with musk-ox teeth, and real canvas-needles such as sailors use--the finest dowry that has ever been given on <b>the</b> far <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic <b>Circle,</b> and <b>the</b> girl from the North bowed her head down to the very floor.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> main result <b>of</b> {{this paper}} is a (2 + epsilon) -approximation scheme for the minimum {{dominating}} set problem on circle graphs. We first present an O(n(2)) time 8 -approximation algorithm for this problem and then extend it to an O(n(3) + 6 /epsilonn([6 /epsilon+ 1]) m) time (2 + epsilon) -approximation scheme for this problem. Here n and m are <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> vertices and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> graph. We then present simple modifications to this algorithm that yield (3 + epsilon) -approximation schemes for the minimum connected and the minimum total dominating set problems on circle graphs. Keil (1993, Discrete Appl. Math. 42, 51 - 63) shows that these problems are NP-complete for circle graphs and leaves open <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> devising approximation algorithms for them. These are the first O(1) -approximation algorithms for domination problems on circle graphs. ...|$|R
60|$|Several times, as Dick {{stood in}} the waggon, rifle in hand, {{straining}} his eyes at the darkness, he fancied he saw indistinct shadowy forms moving at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of light Two or three times he raised his rifle to take aim, but the objects were so indistinct that he doubted whether his fancy had not deceived him.|$|E
60|$|Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and {{no doubt}} they were of the best): it {{unfortunately}} happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance {{between himself and the}} matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.|$|E

And the tribe gathered on a great space of beaten snow before my door, with the meat caches towering stilt-legged in the rear. Moosu came also, standing on the inner <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> opposite me, confident that I had some scheme afoot, and prepared at the first break to down me.

50|$|Hit circles, {{also known}} as notes, are a common object on nearly every beatmap. When a hit circle appears, a ring, called <b>the</b> {{approach}} <b>circle,</b> will appear around it and begin to shrink. In order to score points from a hit circle, players must place their cursor over <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> and click <b>the</b> hit button as <b>the</b> approach <b>circle</b> touches <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hit <b>circle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{school grounds}} include a large parking lot, and {{large amounts of}} open {{hillside}} on three sides, as it sits {{on top of a}} hill. Jerry Burton Drive, named after a much-loved coach who died from leukemia in the 1980s, runs along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, <b>circling</b> <b>the</b> school. In 2006, a second parking lot was created in the lot below the high school.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> ghost <b>of</b> Virgil leads <b>the</b> poet Dante to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Inferno. They {{descend into}} the second, where <b>the</b> wordless chorus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damned souls is heard. Virgil tells Dante {{that this is}} the realms where sinners given over to lust are punished, buffeted by an eternal whirlwind. Dante asks two such souls, Francesca and Paolo, to tell their story.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the {{quietness}} {{split to}} {{a chorus of}} snappy, high-strung, strange barks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or inquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded the camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a restless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after the chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes went away.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a second}} {{performance}} in the evening, and the tent was lighted up. Troy had taken his part very quietly this time, venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just concluding it when, whilst standing at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> contiguous to the first row of spectators, he observed within a yard of him {{the eye of a}} man darted keenly into his side features. Troy hastily shifted his position, after having recognized in the scrutineer the knavish bailiff Pennyways, his wife's sworn enemy, who still hung about the outskirts of Weatherbury.|$|E
60|$|Just {{within the}} inner <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> stood a soldier, in the {{military}} attire of a strange nation; and without it was his war-horse, in the centre {{of a collection of}} mounted domestics, seemingly in readiness to undertake some distant journey. The vestments of the stranger announced him to be one who held a responsible situation near the person of the captain of the Canadas; and who, as it would now seem, finding his errand of peace frustrated by the fierce impetuosity of his allies, was content to become a silent and sad spectator of the fruits of a contest that he had arrived too late to anticipate.|$|E

60|$|Wilson trudged to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighted <b>circle,</b> {{muttering to}} himself, {{and came back}} again; then he trudged farther, this time almost out of sight, but only to return; the third time he {{vanished}} in <b>the</b> impenetrable wall <b>of</b> light. <b>The</b> three men scarcely moved a muscle as they watched {{the place where he}} had disappeared. In a few moments he came stumbling back.|$|R

60|$|Soliloquising thus, I arose {{and shook}} myself. Then I slapped my chest {{several times and}} pulled my nose and sat down again. Only a few minutes elapsed before the same thing {{occurred}} to me again, so I leaped up, and mended the fires, and walked to and fro, until I felt thoroughly awake, {{but in order to}} make sure that it should not occur again, I walked to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of light and gazed for some time into the dark forest, as I had done before. While standing thus I felt my knees give way, as if they had been suddenly paralysed, and I awoke just in time to prevent myself falling to the ground. I must confess I was much amazed at this, for although I had often read of soldiers falling asleep standing at their posts, I had never believed the thing possible.|$|E
60|$|The astonishment seemed mutual, {{between the}} spectators {{and the subject}} of this strange exhibition. If the Tetons {{contemplated}} the mysterious attributes of the medicine, with awe and fear, the Doctor gazed on every side of him, with a mixture of quite as many extraordinary emotions, in which the latter sensation, however, formed no inconsiderable ingredient. Every where his eyes, which just at that moment possessed a secret magnifying quality, seemed to rest on several dark, savage, and obdurate countenances at once, from none of which could he extract a solitary gleam of sympathy or commiseration. At length his wandering gaze fell on the grave and decent features of the trapper, who, with Hector at his feet, stood in the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> leaning on that rifle which he had been permitted, as an acknowledged friend, to resume, and apparently musing on the events that were likely to succeed a council, marked by so many and such striking ceremonies.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as a}} {{view was}} {{obtained}} of this beacon, {{the progress of the}} adventurers became swifter and more certain. In a few minutes they got to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of little huts. Here they stopped to survey their ground, and to concert their movements. The darkness was so deep as to render it difficult to distinguish anything but the glowing brand, the trunks of the nearest trees, and the endless canopy of leaves that veiled the clouded heaven. It was ascertained, however, that a hut was quite near, and Chingachgook attempted to reconnnoitre its interior. The manner in which the Indian approached the place that was supposed to contain enemies, resembled the wily advances of the cat on the bird. As he drew near, he stooped to his hands and knees, for the entrance was so low as to require this attitude, even as a convenience. Before trusting his head inside, however, he listened long to catch the breathing of sleepers. No sound was audible, and this human Serpent thrust his head in at the door, or opening, as another serpent would have peered in on the nest. Nothing rewarded the hazardous experiment; for, after feeling cautiously with a hand, the place was found to be empty.|$|E
5000|$|The Japanese {{call their}} country's flag hinomaru, which {{translates}} literally to [...] "sun's circle", referencing <b>the</b> red <b>circle</b> {{on a white}} field. When the hinomaru was signed, the Japanese characters were usually written vertically, and radiated outward from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red <b>circle.</b> This practice is referenced in the second term, yosegaki, meaning [...] "sideways-writing". The phrase hinomaru-yosegaki {{can be interpreted as}} [...] "To write sideways around the red sun", describing <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signed flag.|$|R
5000|$|In Step 2, we {{construct}} two {{concentric circles}} centered at O with radii of length 1 and length [...] We then place P arbitrarily on <b>the</b> smaller <b>circle,</b> as shown.
