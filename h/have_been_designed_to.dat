5|$|Henry III's younger brother, Richard of Cornwall, {{was granted}} the earldom in 1227. Backed by the {{revenues}} from the lucrative Cornish tin mining industry, he reconstructed the defences at the castle. Richard only visited Cornwall occasionally during his life, probably using Berkhampsted and Wallingford castles as his primary residences in England, and the work may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> impress the Cornish nobility, with whom Richard had a difficult relationship.|$|E

5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> cooperate {{and to share}} the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed signals are switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|The pre-273 {{walls were}} narrow and while {{encircling}} the whole city, {{they do not}} seem to have provided real protection against an invasion. No signs of towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed the city as many gaps appears to have never been defended. The earlier walls seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> protect the city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier.|$|E
5|$|At {{the west}} end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, {{originally}} built in 1480, near to the chapel to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or lay clerks of the chapel. This curved brick and timber building is said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> resemble the shape of a fetlock, one of the badges used by Edward IV. George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular tracery. As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons.|$|E

5|$|Lotus' {{synthetic}} {{sound system}} was {{incorporated in the}} Lotus Evora 414E Hybrid, a concept plug-in hybrid unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show. The system, called HALOsonic Internal and External Electronic Sound Synthesis, is a suite of noise solutions that uses patented technologies from Lotus and Harman International. The audio system generates engine sounds inside the vehicle through the audio system. The system also generates the external sound through speakers mounted at {{the front and rear}} to provide a warning to increase pedestrian safety. The system comes with four driver-selectable engine sounds, two of which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> have characteristics of a multi-cylinder conventional V6 and V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} suggests that that fortification actually commanded the harbour adequately. No single site would have been completely effective due to the rugged coastline, and that Harry's Walls may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> work in concert with another fort. Furthermore, the fort would have fitted easily into its proposed location and {{have been easy to}} defend, due to the surrounding water and marshland. Instead, the high costs of England's wider fortification programme - Edward's government spent an unsustainable £35,228 on construction work during the five years of his reign - are blamed for making its completion unviable, particularly once the French invasion threat had passed.|$|E
5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct laryngoscopy {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope {{can also be used}} as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} {{statements about the}} nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets of doors and six portcullises, also appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E
5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E
