50|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds the {{difference}} between two numbers, the minuend minus the subtrahend. If the minuend {{is larger than the}} subtrahend, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> negative; if they <b>are</b> equal, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> 0.|$|R
50|$|In general, 8 of 10 {{positive}} <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> {{not significant}} (p = 0.11), but 9 of 10 positive <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> significant (p = 0.0215).|$|R
30|$|The A values {{greater than}} 0 {{indicated}} that the <b>difference</b> in intra-group <b>is</b> greater than that in inter-group, but less than 0 represented that the <b>difference</b> in inter-group <b>is</b> greater than that in intra-group. Observe-delta value is smaller which indicates that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> small within groups, and the Expect-delta value is greater which indicates that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> great between groups. The significance value below 0.05 indicate that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> significant.|$|R
5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} is monotypic, lacking any subspecies. Birds {{in the south}} east of New Guinea are {{sometimes}} separated into a proposed subspecies, P. d. monticola, but the <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> very slight and the supposed subspecies are generally regarded as inseparable.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{recognised}} subspecies, {{although the}} <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> mainly clinal; birds become smaller and paler {{in the east}} of the range and the males have larger white wing spots. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the subspecies' ranges overlap.|$|E
5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to termite attack; the <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
30|$|The {{significance}} of <b>differences</b> <b>was</b> assessed using two-tailed Student’s t tests or one-way ANOVA. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> {{considered to be}} significant {{at a level of}} p[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|R

30|$|Results were {{presented}} as mean ± SEM. For comparison between two groups, <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by 2 -tailed Student’s t-test. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> considered significant at {{a value of}} P < 0.05.|$|R
5|$|Wagiman {{speakers}} are {{conscious of}} {{a distinction between}} two dialects of Wagiman, which they refer to as matjjin no-roh-ma 'light language' and matjjin gu-nawutj-jan 'heavy language'.

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> due to the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E

On the other hand no significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found between the groups I and II at 6 th month VAS values (p >  0.05).|$|R
5|$|Because {{norms for}} {{language}} use {{are shared by}} members of a specific group, communicative style also becomes a way of displaying and constructing group identity. Linguistic differences may become salient markers of divisions between social groups, for example, speaking a language with a particular accent may imply membership of an ethnic minority or social class, one's area of origin, or status {{as a second language}} speaker. These kinds of <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> not part of the linguistic system, but {{are an important part of}} how people use language as a social tool for constructing groups.|$|E
5|$|Breed <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> {{expected}} to have reduced since the USMARC studies in the 1980s and 1990s because of the wide-scale introduction and use of performance recording and genetic improvement programmes. The reduction in yield reported for Limousins is possibly {{a result of the}} loss of French Limousin content and of F94L myostatin mutations from the US purebred population, which would be an expected result of the purebred grading up process practiced there. Earlier USMARC studies are reported to have evaluated high content pure French Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Fellow revolutionary Panayot Hitov later {{described}} the adult Levski as being of medium height and having an agile, wiry appearance—with light, greyish-blue eyes, blond hair, {{and a small}} moustache. He added that Levski abstained from smoking and drinking. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by Levski's contemporaries, revolutionary and writer Lyuben Karavelov and teacher Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of medium height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel.|$|E

This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> more marked than in the USA.

5|$|MFGM is a {{structurally}} complex bioactive milk component, {{found in}} human milk {{as well as}} the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in human milk contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some compositional <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which {{is similar to that of}} human MFGM.|$|E

Matheos, Moore and Portnoy decided against sending out promotional copies of the album before its release date {{in order to prevent}} an early Internet leak of it. The album was released in Europe on February 17, 2003.|$|E

5|$|Primatologist Carel P. van Schaik and {{biological}} anthropologist Cheryl D. Knott further investigated tool use in different wild orangutan populations. They compared geographic variations in tool use {{related to the}} processing of Neesia fruit. The orangutans of Suaq Balimbing (P. abelii) {{were found to be}} avid users of insect and seed-extraction tools when compared to other wild orangutans. The scientists suggested these <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> cultural. The orangutans at Suaq Balimbing live in dense groups and are socially tolerant; this creates good conditions for social transmission. Further evidence that highly social orangutans are more likely to exhibit cultural behaviours came from a study of leaf-carrying behaviours of ex-captive orangutans that were being rehabilitated on the island of Kaja in Borneo.|$|E

Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women in the workforce, as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E
