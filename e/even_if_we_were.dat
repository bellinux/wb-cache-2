For, on the record presented, it appears that he cannot fit within the terms of the very rule he proposes.|$|E
2500|$|Casual labourers {{and farm}} labourers have disappeared. Poor and middle peasants have all become members of {{agricultural}} producers' co-operatives, {{and before the}} distinction between them will have become merely a thing of historical interest ... The vast majority of our intellectuals have now {{come over to the}} side of the working class ... The conditions in which the urban poor and the professional people used to exist as independent social strata are virtually no longer present ... What is the point, then, of classifying these social strata into two different categories? And <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to try to devise a classification, how could we make it neat and clear-cut? ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Dreamgirls was {{the first}} film in Academy Award history to receive {{the highest number of}} {{nominations}} for the year, yet not be nominated for Best Picture. The film's failure to gain a Best Picture or Best Director nod was widely viewed by the entertainment press as a [...] "snub" [...] by the Academy. Some journalists registered shock, others cited a [...] "backlash". On the other hand, director Bill Condon stated that [...] "I think academy members just liked the other movies better" [...] and that he believed that [...] "we were never going to win <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> nominated." [...] Reports emerged of significant behind-the-scenes in-fighting between the DreamWorks and Paramount camps, in particular between DreamWorks' David Geffen and Paramount CEO Brad Grey, over decision making and credit-claiming during the Dreamgirls awards campaign.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes; he pretends {{that the}} camp wants {{a supply of}} fresh meat. He'd pretend that {{as an excuse for}} hunting <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all dying of surfeit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{that would}} be a very good story, Terence, and I think that there would be no great fear, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to go boldly into a town." ...|$|E

50|$|Our cars do {{not seem}} to <b>be</b> bigger <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{approaching}} them, their form do not become more distorted, their colour does not change <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> apply artificial lighting. This phenomenon is called perceptual constancy.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} home {{in a little more}} than an hour," [...] he said, [...] "and I don't suppose we could get any tea there, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> able to land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, {{there is}} no valid reason for staying away. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sure that Rose was right, nothing could well come of it, and your absence would be most invidious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whether {{there are}} few or whether {{there are many of}} them, we must wait till morning before we go out. There will be no working out that channel in the dark, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> unopposed." ...|$|E
50|$|A form of {{implicit}} memory used {{every day is}} called procedural memory. Procedural memory lets us perform some actions (such as writing or riding a bike) <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not consciously thinking about it.|$|R

6000|$|Beatrice {{could have}} answered, [...] "Not at all;" [...] but she said, [...] "O never mind, it can't be helped; {{we should be}} late <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> to set off now, and besides we might be caught and stopped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But she is innocent, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> guilty; {{she could}} be nothing else but innocent, for she knows nothing of this meeting and its business, both of which I am {{prepared}} {{at the right time}} and place to vindicate. She entered this room a moment only before yourself, entered and swooned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "General Ross, commandin' the British {{forces on}} land, has {{arrived at the}} Wood Yard, an' the chances are that, with troops {{accustomed}} to long marches, he will push on without much of a halt. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not needed in Washington, it would stand us in hand to move mighty quick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} hide our rifles and pistols," [...] Harry said, [...] "under that ragged bed {{that we did}} not care about {{sleeping}} on. We may possibly get them again <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> robbed of everything else." ...|$|R

6000|$|And these {{promises}} which, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not to {{take them}} as promises in the exact sense in which, let us say, the payment of five sovereigns is promised by a five-pound note, are yet assertions of practically inevitable veracity: ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{thing more}} {{he had to}} say. 'You know, Honor, this place will be entirely your own.

6000|$|... "We {{will begin}} at sunrise," [...] he said; [...] "work every {{possible}} hour, and start back for England whenever the yield falls off. It is better to make sure of a portion than risk the whole by straining for too much; and fortune {{does not appear to}} favor white men overlong in this country. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> but half satisfied, it should not be difficult to float a company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; we hadn't clear {{proof of}} {{identity}} then," [...] he returned coolly, [...] "but we had a reexamination of the body before witnesses afterward, and a verdict according to the facts. That was {{kept out of the}} papers in deference to the feelings of the family and friends. I fancy you wouldn't have liked to be cross-examined before a stupid jury about what you were doing with Jack's portmanteau, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>WE</b> <b>were</b> satisfied with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've heard," [...] said Jessie in the {{tones of}} the oracle, [...] "that {{drinking}} alone is a pernicious habit.

"There's {{no chance}} of our getting first water this time, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> taking the mascot with us," [...] Jerry Walters said with a laugh, and Amateur knew there were no less than three engines {{stationed}} nearer the signal-box, from which had come this alarm, than was Ninety-four.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Vane," [...] said Turnbull, pacifically, [...] "I {{will not}} pretend that either he or I acted quite decorously on that occasion. You were very lenient with us, {{and did not}} treat us as criminals when you very well might. So I am sure you will give us your {{testimony}} that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> criminals, we are not lunatics in any legal or medical sense whatever.

6000|$|... "No {{doubt there}} would be risk, but we came here {{prepared}} to encounter danger, {{and if it were}} well managed, I don't see why we should be found out. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> {{we ought to be able}} to slip away, in the darkness, and make our way to the point where we went up.

60|$|The {{essay on}} Geological Reform {{unfortunately}} brought me, I {{will not say}} into collision, but into a position of critical remonstrance with regard to some charges of physical heterodoxy, brought by my distinguished friend Lord Kelvin, against British Geology. As President of the Geological Society of London at that time (1869), I thought I might venture to plead {{that we were not}} such heretics as we seemed to be; and that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> recantation would not affect the question of evolution.|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{than you}} think. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> lost {{out here in}} the woolly West we get news. Everybody knows about Anglesbury.

2500|$|Obama then {{addressed}} {{the ideas of}} community and unity in America, that a person struggling somewhere affects us <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not directly involved.
