40|$|Abstract Background Needle EMG may be {{negative}} in mild or predominantly sensory lumbosacral radiculopathies. In such cases, {{an increase in}} the latency of the soleus H-reflex is a useful diagnostic criterion for establishing sensory fiber compromise at the <b>S</b> 1 <b>root</b> level. However, if clinical signs of radicular involvement are lacking, the latency of the H-reflex is normal. We therefore studied the recruitment curve of the soleus H-reflex to investigate whether a change in the electrical threshold for eliciting the H-reflex might be a more sensitive criterion for detecting subclinical <b>S</b> 1 <b>root</b> dysfunction. Methods Clinical and electrophysiological findings from 26 patients with chronic back pain and radiculopathy were compared with data obtained from 40 healthy subjects. Results An increase in the mean H-reflex threshold was the only abnormal electrophysiological finding in patients with no clinical sign of root injury (58 %). A decrease in the mean H-reflex amplitude and a prolongation of H-reflex latency was observed in patients with radicular signs (42 %). In both patients groups, F-wave and needle EMG studies were normal. No radiological evidence of <b>S</b> 1 <b>root</b> compression was found. Conclusions The study of the recruitment curve of the soleus H-reflex may be usefully associated to F-wave and needle EMG studies to detect possible <b>S</b> 1 <b>root</b> dysfunction in mild lumbosacral radiculopathies. An increase in H-threshold may be the earliest abnormality in the absence of focal neurological signs. </p...|$|R
