Cooperation, non-cooperation and predation are the main strategies of the two dominant players, namely OCP (Morocco) and Phosrock (USA) during the period 1960 - 2000. These strategies are analyzed by 'prisoner dilemma' and 'limit pricing' models. We consider a two-steps game within a duopoly according to Kreps-Scheinkman framework with Cournot and Bertrand duopoly hypothesis. The empirical results reveal the influence of stockpiles fluctuations and phosphate fertilizer price on the world phosphate rock prices. intersectoral relations, multipliers, labour qualifications, export promotion...|$|R

Annually, it imports larger quantities of vegetables than there are produced by agricultural holdings. The <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheet for vegetables {{is the basis of}} an analysis of vegetable consumption on the level of entire country and allows the comparison with other countries. Data have shown that the degree of self-sufficiency varies a lot between years due to weather conditions. Although the conditions for vegetable growing in Slovenia are favourable, domestic production is too low to meet the domestic consumption. Many investigations have also shown that Slovenian people consume too small amounts of vegetables. This statement is supported by the <b>supply</b> <b>balance</b> sheet for vegetables.
