As with the strawberry, so it is generally with the twining shoots of the Hibbertia dentata, which climbs laterally from bush to bush; for these shoots, if placed in a position inclined downwards, show little and sometimes no tendency to curve upwards.|$|E

The first {{precaution}} needful in {{the construction}} of the instrument was to avoid the recombination of the evolved gases, an effect which the positive electrode has been found so capable of producing (571.). For this purpose various forms of decomposing apparatus were used. The first consisted of straight tubes, each containing a plate and wire of platina soldered together by gold, and fixed hermetically in the glass at the closed extremity of the tube (Plate V. fig. 60.). The tubes were about eight inches long, 0.7 of an inch in diameter, and graduated. The platina plates were about an inch long, as wide as the tubes would permit, and adjusted as near to the mouths of the tubes as was consistent with the safe collection of the gases evolved. In certain cases, where it was required to evolve the elements upon as small a surface as possible, the metallic extremity, instead of being a plate, consisted of the wire bent into the form of a ring (fig. 61.). When these tubes were used as measurers, they were filled with the dilute sulphuric acid, inverted in a basin of the same liquid (fig. 62.), and placed in an <b>inclined</b> <b>position,</b> with their mouths near to each other, that as little decomposing matter should intervene as possible; and also, in such a direction that the platina plates should be in vertical planes (720).|$|E
60|$|A {{revolving}} tendril, though inclined {{during the}} greater part of its course at an angle of about 45 degrees (in one case of only 37 degrees) above the horizon, stiffened and straightened itself from tip to base in a certain part of its course, thus becoming nearly or quite vertical. I witnessed this repeatedly; and it occurred both when the supporting internodes were free and when they were tied up; but was perhaps most conspicuous in the latter case, or when the whole shoot happened to be much inclined. The tendril forms a very acute angle with the projecting extremity of the stem or shoot; and the stiffening always occurred as the tendril approached, and had to pass over the shoot in its circular course. If it had not possessed and exercised this curious power, it would infallibly have struck against the extremity of the shoot and been arrested. As soon as the tendril with its three branches begins to stiffen itself in this manner and to rise from an inclined into a vertical position, the revolving motion becomes more rapid; {{and as soon as the}} tendril has succeeded in passing over the extremity of the shoot or point of difficulty, its motion, coinciding with that from its weight, often causes it to fall into its previously <b>inclined</b> <b>position</b> so quickly, that the apex could be seen travelling like the minute hand of a gigantic clock.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{drifting}} accuracy of aerostatic bearings, the manufacturing errors effects on disturbing torque of aerostatic bearings is studied by using the finite element method. The finite element mathematic model of the major influence factors of disturbing torque is established. Then, the finite element equation in the gas film domain is solved and the disturbing torque {{in the presence of}} disturbing factors is calculated. The research focuses on elliptical error and prismatic error of journal and incline error of throttle slit. The setting angle of journal, <b>incline</b> <b>position</b> angle of throttle slit and radial eccentricity ratio which affect the disturbing torque is also studied. The results show that roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit affect the disturbing torque significantly, that is the greater roundness error of journal and incline error of throttle slit the greater disturbing torque. Disturbing torque is periodic function of setting angle of journal and <b>incline</b> <b>position</b> angle of throttle slit. Radial eccentricity ratio affects the disturbing torque, and there is specific radial eccentricity ratio makes disturbing torque to be extreme point or zero point. In the research, the theoretical disturbing torque value is compared with the experimental value of a certain aerostatic bearing, find that they are on the whole accordant with each other and then prove that the finite element model and the method use to solve the problem is correct. The research is of great significance for designing, manufacturing and assembling aerostatic bearings and for performance prediction of aerostatic bearings...|$|R

At c c, the lower extremities of the parts at the sides, the metal is bent round, so as to clasp a wire which runs from c to c, the ends of which wire are bent at right angles and run into the board.

"The screw {{consists}} of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen inches in length, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at fifteen degrees, pass a series of steel wire radii, two feet long, and thus projecting a foot on either side. These radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wire--the whole in this manner forming {{the framework of the}} screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface. At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop. In the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve. From the end of the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting the screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car. By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole. By means of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction. The spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being capable of raising forty-five pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound up. It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces. The rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a battle-door, and was about three feet long, and at the widest, one foot. Its weight was about two ounces. It could be turned flat, and directed upwards or downwards, {{as well as to the}} right or left; and thus enabled the æronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an <b>inclined</b> <b>position</b> it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he might desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction.|$|E
60|$|POLEMONIACEAE.--Cobaea scandens.--This is an {{excellently}} constructed climber. The tendrils on a fine plant were eleven inches long, {{with the}} petiole bearing {{two pairs of}} leaflets, only {{two and a half}} inches in length. They revolve more rapidly and vigorously than those of any other tendril-bearer observed by me, {{with the exception of one}} kind of Passiflora. Three large, nearly circular sweeps, directed against the sun were completed, each in 1 hr. 15 m.; and two other circles in 1 hr. 20 m. and 1 hr. 23 m. Sometimes a tendril travels in a much <b>inclined</b> <b>position,</b> and sometimes nearly upright. The lower part moves but little and the petiole not at all; nor do the internodes revolve; so that here we have the tendril alone moving. On the other hand, with most of the species of Bignonia and the Eccremocarpus, the internodes, tendrils, and petioles all revolved. The long, straight, tapering main stem of the tendril of the Cobaea bears alternate branches; and each branch is several times divided, with the finer branches as thin as very thin bristles and extremely flexible, so that they are blown about by a breath of air; yet they are strong and highly elastic. The extremity of each branch is a little flattened, and terminates in a minute double (though sometimes single) hook, formed of a hard, translucent, woody substance, and as sharp as the finest needle. On a tendril which was eleven inches long I counted ninety-four of these beautifully constructed little hooks. They readily catch soft wood, or gloves, or the skin of the naked hand. With the exception of these hardened hooks, and of the basal part of the central stem, every part of every branchlet is highly sensitive on all sides to a slight touch, and bends in a few minutes towards the touched side. By lightly rubbing several sub- branches on opposite sides, the whole tendril rapidly assumed an extraordinarily crooked shape. These movements from contact do not interfere with the ordinary revolving movement. The branches, after becoming greatly curved from being touched, straighten themselves at a quicker rate than in almost any other tendril seen by me, namely, in between half an hour and an hour. After the tendril has caught any object, spiral contraction likewise begins after an unusually short interval of time, namely, in about twelve hours.|$|E

60|$|LILIACEAE.--Gloriosa Plantii.--The stem of a half-grown plant {{continually}} moved, generally describing {{an irregular}} spire, but sometimes oval figures with the longer axes directed in different lines. It either followed the sun, or moved in an opposite course, and sometimes stood still before reversing its direction. One oval {{was completed in}} 3 hrs. 40 m.; of two horseshoe-shaped figures, one was completed in 4 hrs. 35 m. {{and the other in}} 3 hrs. The shoots, in their movements, reached points between four and five inches asunder. The young leaves, when first developed, stand up nearly vertically; but by the growth of the axis, and by the spontaneous bending down of the terminal half of the leaf, they soon become much inclined, and ultimately horizontal. The end of the leaf forms a narrow, ribbon- like, thickened projection, which at first is nearly straight, {{but by the time the}} leaf gets into an <b>inclined</b> <b>position,</b> the end bends downwards into a well-formed hook. This hook is now strong and rigid enough to catch any object, and, when caught, to anchor the plant and stop the revolving movement. Its inner surface is sensitive, but not in nearly so high a degree as that of the many before-described petioles; for a loop of string, weighing 1.64 grain, produced no effect. When the hook has caught a thin twig or even a rigid fibre, the point may be perceived in from 1 hr. to 3 hrs. to have curled a little inwards; and, under favourable circumstances, it curls round and permanently seizes an object in from 8 hrs. to 10 hrs. The hook when first formed, before the leaf has bent downwards, is but little sensitive. If it catches hold of nothing, it remains open and sensitive for a long time; ultimately the extremity spontaneously and slowly curls inwards, and makes a button-like, flat, spiral coil at the end of the leaf. One leaf was watched, and the hook remained open for thirty-three days; but during the last week the tip had curled so much inwards that only a very thin twig could have been inserted within it. As soon as the tip has curled so much inwards that the hook is converted into a ring, its sensibility is lost; but as long as it remains open some sensibility is retained.|$|E

40|$|Air gap {{membrane}} distillation (AGMD) experiments were performed with varied temperature and varied module inclination angles {{to characterize the}} effect of module angle on permeate production and thermal performance. While AGMD is potentially {{one of the most}} energy efficient {{membrane distillation}} configurations, transport resistances in the air gap typically dominate the thermal performance, resulting in degraded permeate production. Tilting the module away from vertical offers the opportunity to manipulate the condensate layer and its associated thermal resistance. In this study, we report experiments on varying module tilt angle performed with a flat plate AGMD module under fully characterized heat and mass transfer conditions. Numerical modeling is also performed to better understand the experimental results. The tests indicated that the AGMD system behaves as a “permeate gap”, or flooded membrane distillation system for declined and extremely <b>inclined</b> <b>positions.</b> A key finding relevant to all AGMD systems is that at highly negative tilt angles (more than 30 degrees), condensate may fall onto the membrane causing thermal bridging and increased permeate production. Near vertical and positive tilt angles (< 15 degrees from vertical) show no significant effect of module tilt on performance, in line with model predictions.

Transmissivity tests were then performed under the same conditions to obtain experimental values of the reduction ratios. A comparison showed that the theoretical and experimental values of the transmissivity reduction ratios were in agreement, and the relationships provide a useful tool to predict the drainage capacity of both tri-planar and bi-planar geonets influenced by loading pressure.

A certain stability of the kind desired is afforded by using an extended surface whose sides make an angle from the axis upwards.... But it is desirable to provide a more powerful action preventing rolling rotation of the body in this direction. For this purpose a rudder of the following construction may be adopted:—Vanes or movable surfaces are attached to arms projecting from the vessel laterally or at right angles to its length.
