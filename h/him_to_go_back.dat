5|$|The Doctor {{discovers that}} the volcano {{is being used}} by the Pyroviles to convert the human race and conquer Earth. The Doctor realises the volcano will not erupt if the energy {{converter}} is running, and tells Donna that the volcanic eruption is a fixed point in time and must always happen. The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which overloads the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply with history.

25|$|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, {{the third}} {{film in the}} popular Indiana Jones series, went through a flimsy {{scripting}} process before Boam was hired to write a draft. As early as 1984, George Lucas was playing {{with the concept of}} having the fictional archeologist-adventurer encounter the fabled Holy Grail, the cup said to have been used by Jesus Christ during the Last Supper. Director Steven Spielberg rejected Lucas's script outlines, disliking the Grail idea. Screenwriter Diane Thomas wrote a haunted house story for Indiana Jones, but Spielberg said that after producing Poltergeist, he didn't want to do a similar film. Lucas hired Chris Columbus to write a draft for the film, and he submitted Indiana Jones and the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung, a story with evil spirits, ghosts, and demons. Again, Spielberg rejected the story as not believable enough. Lucas convinced <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the Holy Grail idea, and Menno Meyjes was hired to develop another screenplay. The new script focused on the Arthurian legend aspect of the Holy Grail. Although the script was not to the liking of Lucas and Spielberg, it had elements that eventually became part of the finished film: the Holy Grail, and the introduction of Indiana Jones' father, Henry Jones, Sr.|$|E

500|$|Biographer Robert Shelton {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s, Dylan was {{frequently}} criticized for [...] "selling out" [...] and that people were pressuring <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to his earlier trend of composing protest songs. For Shelton, who noted the promotional photo for [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] depicting Dylan looking through a camera, the track expressed Dylan's wish just to be an observer, and not a political activist. Author Seth Rogovoy similarly interpreted the song as Dylan's desire to ignore politics and avoid getting involved in people's disputes. The line [...] " [...] keeps on rollin', though/No matter ... which way the wind does blow" [...] has been heard by writers Peter Vernezze and Carl J. Porter as evidence of Dylan's conviction that [...] "the river of time, the flow of facts, in reality remains unaffected by winds of beliefs, the flow of changing opinions." ...|$|E

A shocked Lois attempts to encourage <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and finish the test, and eventually chases him away with a vacuum cleaner called [...] "Mr. Hoover".|$|E
500|$|On {{realizing that}} NBC was {{switching}} {{away from the}} game, Goodman said to Lindemann by phone, [...] "Where the hell has our football game gone?" [...] During the station break which began with the network announcement, Goodman called a BOC phone to which only he knew the number and which {{was not part of}} NBC's CIrcle-7 exchange (which blew a fuse 26 times in an hour). When Cline answered it, Goodman ordered <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the game. Although Cline knew {{there was no way to}} reconnect the feed, he promised to do the best he could. By the time the game ended at 7:07, thousands of viewers were calling the network to complain about missing the end of the football game. Others called newspapers, television stations, even the New York City Police Department, both to seek the final score, and simply to vent. Humorist Art Buchwald wrote [...] "Men who wouldn't get out of their chairs in an earthquake rushed to the phone to scream obscenities [...]" [...] As people learned of the outcome, some became upset because Ridlehuber's touchdown meant the Raiders had won by more than the point spread of 7, and bets thought to be won were now lost. In Oakland, Gowdy and DeRogatis left the broadcast booth to tell Ellis that the final two minutes were the most exciting they had ever seen. Ellis replied, [...] "It's too bad America didn't see it."
