50|$|Approach {{lighting}} systems {{are designed to}} allow the pilot to quickly and positively identify visibility distances in Instrument meteorological conditions. For example, if the aircraft is at the middle marker, and the middle marker is located 3600 feet from the threshold, the Decision Bar is 2600 feet ahead. If the procedure calls for {{at least half a}} statute mile <b>flight</b> <b>visibility</b> (roughly 2600 feet), spotting the Decision Bar at the marker would indicate enough <b>flight</b> <b>visibility</b> to continue the procedure. In addition, the shorter bars before and after the Decision Bar are spaced either 100 feet or 200 feet apart, depending on the ALS type. The number of short bars the pilot can see can be used to determine <b>flight</b> <b>visibility.</b> Approaches with lower minimums use the more precise 100-foot spacing systems for more accurate identification of visibility.|$|E

The Marine sentries immediately rushed to awaken other Marines and Navy medical personnel in the compound. The C-130 was a Saudi Air Force transport plane flying back to Mishab after taking Senegalese soldiers on a visit to Mecca. The official assessment of the probable cause of the crash was the thick black smoke from hundreds of burning oil wells nearby in Kuwait, which combined with the dark and fog obscured the <b>flight</b> crew’s <b>visibility.</b> 92 Senegalese and 6 Saudis died in the crash.

5000|$|Only pilots may {{initiate}} {{a request for}} this type of approach, as regulations prohibit air traffic control (ATC) from asking pilots to perform them. [...] A contact approach will only be issued if the aircraft is operating clear of clouds with at least 1-mile of <b>flight</b> <b>visibility,</b> with a reasonable expectation of continuing to the destination airport under those conditions. [...] Additionally, the reported ground visibility at the destination airport must be at least 1 statute mile.|$|E
5000|$|To put {{instrument}} flight rules into context, {{a brief overview}} of visual flight rules (VFR) is necessary. It is possible and fairly straightforward, in relatively clear weather conditions, to fly a plane solely by reference to outside visual cues, such as the horizon to maintain orientation, nearby buildings and terrain features for navigation, and other aircraft to maintain separation. This is known as operating the aircraft under VFR, and is the most common mode of operation for small aircraft. However, it is safe to fly VFR only when these outside references can be clearly seen from a sufficient distance; when flying through or above clouds, or in fog, rain, dust or similar low-level weather conditions, these references can be obscured. Thus, cloud ceiling and <b>flight</b> <b>visibility</b> are the most important variables for safe operations during all phases of flight. [...] The minimum weather conditions for ceiling and visibility for VFR flights are defined in FAR Part 91.155, and vary {{depending on the type of}} airspace in which the aircraft is operating, and on whether the flight is conducted during daytime or nighttime. However, typical daytime VFR minimums for most airspace is 3 statute miles of <b>flight</b> <b>visibility</b> and a distance from clouds of 500' below, 1,000' above, and 2,000' feet horizontally. [...] Flight conditions reported as equal to or greater than these VFR minimums are referred to as visual meteorological conditions (VMC).|$|E

2500|$|Because {{baseball}} hitting is difficult, baseball rules {{prohibit the}} deliberate scratching or scuffing of a ball, or {{the application of}} any foreign substance that could conceivably affect the <b>flight</b> or <b>visibility</b> of a ball. Balls that are deliberately made more difficult to hit by applying foreign substances are often known as spitballs, regardless of the specific substance applied (such as Vaseline). Both spitballs and those that become scuffed or scratched through normal game play are immediately removed from play and never reused. The current rules regarding the condition of baseballs did not come into effect until 1920, {{after the death of}} Ray Chapman from being hit with a Carl Mays spitball. Before that point, the rules were similar to those still present in cricket. However, the new rules were not consistently enforced for several decades afterwards, and several pitchers (most notably Gaylord Perry) built careers around skirting these rules, doing such things as hiding nail files in their gloves or putting Vaseline {{on the underside of the}} peaks of their caps. In modern baseball, however, the prohibition against modifying the baseball in almost any way is strictly enforced and players found to be in violation of this rule are not only ejected from the game in which the infraction occurred, but are also subject to a suspension. The only substance applied to a baseball is the Delaware River mud formula that umpires rub in before a game to remove the [...] "shine" [...] from the ball and improve its grip. The pitcher is also allowed to use rosin on his hands (via a rosin bag) to improve his grip, and to blow on his hands in cold weather.|$|R

This paper explains how a cruise missile works. It will focus on the cruise missile’s launch, <b>flight,</b> low radar <b>visibility</b> and its guiding systems. Figure 1 In essence, the cruise missile is a small plane without a pilot. It is 6. 25 m long and 0. 52 m in diameter. As figure 1 shows, the missile incorporates a turbofan engine, a fuel tank, a conventional bomb, air intake and four different guiding systems. At launch a loaded cruise missile weighs about 1450 kg. A solid rocket booster causes the initial acceleration and launch of the cruise missile. After that the turbofan engine takes over, propelling the missile to a cruising speed of 880 km/h. The acceleration of a cruise missile and its flight involve Newton’s second and third laws of motion. Newton’s third law says that “to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction”.

40|$|General Aviation (GA) {{accidents}} involving ‘VFR into IMC ’ {{continue to be}} a major source of fatalities with a fatality rate more than four times greater than for GA accidents in general. We report two studies into the causes of cross-country weather-related accidents. In the first study we analyse the records of 77 New Zealand crashes where it could be determined that the aircraft was on a cross-country flight. We compared the characteristics of crashes that occurred after externally-driven events such as enginefailures with crashes where the pilot maintained on-going control over the aircraft. Significant differences were found for distance into the <b>flight,</b> <b>visibility,</b> altitude, crash severity and for the pilots ’ age and recent flight time. In the second study, 18 qualified GA pilots completed two simulated cross-country flights involving several commonly encountered weather conditions with or without the use of GPS. Detailed measures of decision making, risk assessment and situational awareness were collected during the flights. We discuss the implications of the findings for training and flight safety in general aviation. The accident rate in general aviation (GA) continues to be substantially higher than that in other sectors of aviation (O’Hare, 1999 a). Whilst the GA accident rate appears to be declining in some countries such as the United States (AOPA Air Safety Foundation, 2001) the rate appears to be static or even increasing in others such as Australia and New Zealan...|$|E
40|$|An aviator may control an {{aircraft}} by viewing {{the world through}} the windscreen (visual flight) or with information from the cockpit instruments (instrument <b>flight),</b> depending upon <b>visibility,</b> meteorological conditions, and the competence of the pilot. It seems intuitively obvious that instrument flight should be far more challenging than visual flight. However, since the same pilot controls the same aircraft through the same air using the same stick-and-rudder input devices, the only difference is the way the same information is presented. Consequently, instrument flight is harder than visual flight only {{because of the way the}} instruments display the information. Each instrument displays one flight parameter and it is up to the pilot to convert the numeric value of the displayed parameter into useful information. We think that it is possible to use modern display technologies and computational capabilities to make instrument flight safer, easier, and more efficient, possibly even beyond that of visual flight. The challenge is design of the instruments. Using emerging principles of knowledge engineering derived from such areas as human-centered computing, cognitive task analysis, and ecological display design, we are designing a suite of aircraft cockpit instruments to enhance instrument flight performance. Our presentation will describe our approach, methodology, instrumentation, and some experimental results. We have used commercially available, off-the-shelf desk-top flight simulators for which we have developed precise flight performance measures that may have broad application for training and performance testing...|$|R
40|$|Helicopter <b>flight</b> in reduced <b>visibility</b> due to poor weather {{conditions}} is highly demanding and often endangering flight safety {{due to high}} pilot workload, low situation awareness and spatial disorientation. Helmet-mounted displays (HMD) featuring enhanced and synthetic vision can provide pilots with symbology in their forward field-of-view to facilitate an accurate perception of the environment. When equipped with a head-tracker, HMD allow the symbols to be perfectly aligned with the outside scene. This is usually referred to as visual conformance. So far DLR has developed and investigated 2 D and 3 D symbology concepts for HMD {{within the scope of}} an expert online survey on obstacle and route designs, simulator trials and actual flight tests. Based on the findings a new en-route symbology as well as an advanced conformal landing zone representation were developed recently. To evaluate these concepts and to investigate selected designs from the online questionnaire a simulator study will be conducted with civil and military helicopter pilots until the end of April 2014. It is of interest to what extent the concepts support pilots in poor visibility compared to a state-of-the-art baseline condition with regard to task and flight performance, situation awareness and workload. The study will comprise an extensive analysis of human factors aspects, particularly focusing on attentional issues associated with binocular HMD and conformal symbology use. It will be investigated how attention can be selected, focused and divided between different display locations and the environment effectively, hence to what extent various tasks can be performed successfully during the flight depending on display type, visibility, event expectancy and task complexity. Moreover, psychophysiological measurements will be taken during the trials. Finally, objective flight performance will be analyzed as well as subjective helmet ratings on perceptual, visual, and somatic aspects, and system usability will be assessed. The paper will firstly illustrate the prominence of the new symbology concepts from a human factors standpoint, secondly provide details on the conducting of the study, and finally present and discuss selected results with regard to attentional aspects...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was not {{equipped with a}} flight data recorder (FDR). Indonesian regulations did not require a FDR to be fitted to the Twin Otter aircraft. However, the {{aircraft was}} equipped with a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). Indonesian Civil Aviation regulations required that a serviceable CVR was to be fitted to the Twin Otter aircraft. Search and Rescue personnel recovered the CVR from the wreckage and handed it over to NTSC investigators. The outer box had minor damage, but the contents were undamaged. About 20 minutes before the impact, the pilots were discussing the area they were flying over, and made comments about the local inhabitants. Fifteen minutes before impact, the pilot in command said to the copilot “Let's fly direct Oksibil”. The copilot asked “Direct brother?” The PIC replied “Direct, {{the sky is blue}} over there and the layer of the cloud is 10,000 feet”. One minute later the copilot gave a position report to ATC stating: One two three zero traffic, Merpati nine seven six zero delay, Sentani to Oksibil, position approaching Melam maintain nine thousand five hundred, estimate Abmisibil zero two zero one, arrival zero two zero eight.This transmission was blocked by other transmissions and there was no evidence on recorded communications that the position report was acknowledged by ATC. During the 20 minutes before the impact there was no discussion about aircraft problems or navigation difficulties.However, ten minutes before impact the pilot in command mentioned climbing to 10000 ft, and stated “if we cannot go visual I will turn left”. The cockpit conversations did not exhibit any signs of stress or concern until 2 minutes before the impact, when the copilot mentioned haze and asked the pilot in command if he could see. Fifty seconds before impact, the copilot expressed further concern and asked about the pilot in command’s intentions, and the pilot in command said “climb, to the left”. Forty-two seconds before impact the copilot asked if it was safe on the left. The copilot became increasingly uncertain about the safety of the <b>flight,</b> specifically mentioning <b>visibility</b> and speed. From the recorded sounds, it is apparent that 13 seconds before impact, engine power was increased symmetrically to a high power setting. From the pilots’ comments and the wreckage trail, the investigation determined that the aircraft was banking left at the time of impact. The investigation was unable to determine if the aircraft reached 10,000 feet. The impact was at 9300 ft.|$|R
