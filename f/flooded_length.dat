40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{principles}} of mass, momentum, and energy conservations {{as well as the}} Young–Laplace capillary equation, a mathematical model of triangular MHPs has been developed, primarily to investigate the effects of the thermal conductivity of the solid wall on their performance under overloaded conditions. For this purpose, two solids of significantly different thermal conductivities, copper and nickel, have been selected for the wall material. Using the model, a map encompassing the various possible operation zones of an MHP was constructed, to provide insight into the modes of operation under a given operating temperature but with varying heat loads and charge levels of the working fluid. The model predicts that in the overloaded zones, the dryout and <b>flooded</b> <b>lengths</b> increase with the applied heat load, resulting in a decrease in the effective length of the MHP. Moreover, it is also observed that the existence of dryout is accompanied by a large temperature rise over the dry region and, thus, a large total axial temperature drop, which increases rapidly with the applied heat load. Finally, comparison between copper and nickel MHPs on how the key performance indicators, such as the dryout and <b>flooded</b> <b>lengths,</b> the effective length, and the total axial temperature drop, response to the applied heat load shows that an MHP of solid wall of higher thermal conductivity out-performs one with lower solid thermal conductivity...|$|R

30|$|The CO 2 -WAG {{technique}} {{is a combination}} of two traditionally improved oil recovery techniques: waterflooding and gas injection. The waterflooding and gas <b>flooding</b> cycle <b>lengths</b> are alternated with the design parameters being the cycle timing of the WAG process and the ratio of water to gas, slug size of the injected CO 2 and water. The main advantage of this {{technique is}} to reduce the CO 2 channeling by filling the highly permeable channels with water to improve the macroscopic sweep efficiency during the CO 2 -injection. The optimum conditions of the oil displacement by the WAG processes are achieved when the velocities of the gas and water are the same in the reservoir and hence stabilize the sweeping front. The optimum WAG design varies from reservoir to reservoir depending on the reservoir heterogeneity and characteristic. The main advantages of the WAG process include reduced CO 2 utilization and production, and greater ultimate recovery.|$|R

40|$|Following {{the severe}} flood events of 1998 and 2000, the United Kingdom's Environment Agency prioritised {{the need to}} {{increase}} public flood risk awareness. Drawing on data collected during research undertaken for the Environment Agency, this paper contributes to understanding of one aspect of flood awareness: people's recognition that their property is {{in an area that}} is potentially at risk of flooding. Quantitative analyses indicate that class is the most influential factor in predicting flood risk awareness, followed by <b>flood</b> experience and <b>length</b> of time in residence. There are also significant area differences. Our qualitative work explores how those defined as ‘at risk’ account for their lack of awareness or concern about their risk status.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringSurfactants {{have been}} {{considered}} for enhanced oil recovery either by reduction of oil–water interfacial tension (IFT) or through wettability alteration. This study reveals the effect that reduced interfacial tension has on capillary trapping in heterogeneous reservoirs. This effect has been investigated by running numerical experiments on different synthetic simulation models. Rock capillary pressure is assumed to scale with IFT. Capillary contrast {{on the scale of}} a few centimeters to few tens of meters is reduced in the presence of surfactant. This reduction in IFT potentially may result in increased or accelerated oil production from mixed–wet reservoirs. The main focus {{of this study is to}} simulate the displacement process (water flood) at various IFT using Eclipse (Surfactant Model). Simulation studies of different mechanisms which are believed to occur in mixed–wet reservoirs are presented. The surfactant flooding model was applied to the synthetic reservoir models. Simulation results indicate that surfactant flooding has a promising effect on the oil recovery depending upon the types of reservoir. Detailed fine–scale simulation is carried out with representative relative permeability and imbibitions capillary pressure curves from mixed–wet cores. The efficiency of the surfactant flooding is investigated through sensitivity scenarios on formation rock/fluid parameters (e. g., Permeability, IFT, Flow Rate etc). It was found that the geological heterogeneity (layering, inclusions), imbibitions capillary pressure curve from mixed–wet reservoirs, viscous/capillary balance (Nc), gravitational forces, all have an impact on recovery by surfactant <b>flooding.</b> Lx/Lz (<b>Length</b> to thickness ratio of the model/ reservoir), permeability, IFT, density difference between oil and water and injection flow rates were found to be the critical parameters which influence simulation results...|$|R
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is {{the only}} cereal crop that {{possesses}} the ability to germinate under flooded or other oxygen-deficient conditions. Rapid elongation of the coleoptile is a perfect response to flooding during germination, with coleoptile length differing among various rice varieties. Despite multiple studies have uncovered valuable information concerning this trait {{by focusing on the}} physiological metabolism of oxygen stress, the underlying genetic mechanism still remains unknown. In the present study, we screened coleoptile lengths of 432 indica varieties germinated in two environments (normal and flooded) and found more variation existing in <b>flooded</b> coleoptile <b>length</b> (FCL) rather than in normal coleoptile length (NCL). With the phenotypic data of NCL, FCL and FTI (flooding tolerance index), a genome-wide association study was performed by using 5291 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. We detected 2, 11, and 9 significant SNPs under a mixed linear mode for NCL, FCL, and FTI, respectively. Of these SNPs, five were shared by FCL and FTI. Haplotype and phenotype effect analysis on the highest ranking locus indicated one of the two haplotypes contributed to coleoptile elongation remarkably. To better understand the controlling gene of this locus, reported expression profile data was applied. We focused on LOC_Os 06 g 03520, a candidate gene which was highly induced by anoxia (∼ 507 fold). Sequence analysis in 51 varieties demonstrated Hap. 2 associated perfectly with flooding tolerance. Further studies on this gene may help explore the molecular mechanism of rice flooding tolerance during germination.

40|$|In this article, a {{model for}} the {{determination}} of displacements, strains, and stresses of a submarine pipeline during its construction is presented. Typically, polyethylene outfall pipelines are the ones treated by this model. The process is carried out from an initial floating situation to the final laying position on the seabed. The following control variables are considered in the laying process: the axial load in the pipe, the <b>flooded</b> inner <b>length,</b> and the distance of the control barge from the coast. External loads such as self-weight, dead loads, and forces due to currents and small waves are also taken into account. This paper describes both the conceptual framework for the proposed model and its practical application in a real engineering situation. The authors also consider how the model might be used as a tool to study how sensitive the behavior of the pipeline is to small changes in the values of the control variables. A detailed description of the actions is considered, especially the ones related to the marine environment such as buoyancy, current, and sea waves. The structural behavior of the pipeline is simulated in the framework of a geometrically nonlinear dynamic analysis. The pipeline is assumed to be a two-dimensional Navier_Bernoulli beam. In the nonlinear analysis an updated Lagrangian formulation is used, and special care is taken regarding the numerical aspects of sea bed contact, follower forces due to external water pressures, and dynamic actions. The paper concludes by describing the implementation of the proposed techniques, using the ANSYS computer program with a number of subroutines developed by the authors. This implementation permits simulation of the two-dimensional structural pipe behavior of the whole construction process. A sensitivity analysis of the bending moments, axial forces, and stresses for different values of the control variables is carried out. Using the techniques described, the engineer may optimize the construction steps in the pipe laying proces...|$|R

Three major proximal to distal subenvironments are defined for the lake on the basis of surficial sediment character and dominant depositional process: (a) fluvial-glassy, quartzofeld-spathic, and lithic gravel-sand mixtures deposited from contact and saltation loads in less than 3 m depth; (b) (pro-) deltaic-quartzofeldspathic and glassy sand-silt mixtures deposited from graded and uniform suspension loads in 3 - 20 m depth; and (c) basinal-diatomaceous, argillaceous, and glassy silt-clay mixtures deposited from uniform and pelagic suspension loads in 20 - 50 m depth. The delta face has been prograding into the lake at a rate of 35 - 40 m/year and vertical accretion rates in pro-delta areas are 15 - 20 cm/year.

However, there was no research done in the country concerning household flood preparedness. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to assess household flood preparedness and associated factors in the flood-prone community of Dembia district, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to April 2014 in the Dembia district. A two-stage sampling technique was used. The study was conducted using 806 flood-prone participants. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The collected data were entered using Epi info version 3. 5. 1 and transported into SPSS version 16 for further analysis. Descriptive and analytic statistics were computed. Variables having association with the outcome variable were reported using odds ratio with 95 % confidence interval (CI). Model fitness was checked by Hosmer and Lemeshew chi-square test. Results: Household flood preparedness was found to be 24. 4 %. The age group of ≥ 46 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]= 2. 62; 95 % CI: 1. 12, 6. 00) above, monthly household income > 893 Ethiopian Birr, (AOR= 6. 72; 95 % CI: 2. 2 7, 19. 88) attending primary level education (AOR= 22. 08; 95 % CI: 8. 16, 59. 74), warning system in household (AOR= 5. 41; 95 % CI: 2. 38, 12. 32), knowledge of flood prevention, (AOR= 2. 52; 95 % CI: 1. 43, 5. 57) were positively associated with household flood preparedness. Conclusion and recommendation: This study has demonstrated that household flood preparedness was found to be low in the study area.

40|$|Turbid river plumes {{entering}} ocean or lake {{water of}} lesser density (i. e., hyperpycnal plumes) can plunge to form turbidity currents providing an important link between terrestrial sediment sources and marine depositional sinks. A leading hypothesis suggests that hyperpycnal-plume deposits accurately record the {{rising and falling}} discharge of a flooding river (in terms of sediment-size grading, bedform sequence, and deposit thickness), which, if correct, has significant implications for unraveling river dynamics, reservoir potential, and Earth history from marine-event beds. Herein, we present {{one of the first}} experimental flume studies aimed at testing this hypothesis. Results indicate that depth-averaged hyperpycnal-plume velocities can be uncorrelated or even anti-correlated with river discharge at certain seabed locations because of translation of the plunge point resulting from temporal variations in discharge and sediment concentration through the duration of a river <b>flood.</b> An advection <b>length</b> scale of settling sediment is found to be an important control on hyperpycnal-plume deposits, where coarse sediment (sand) is most likely to record multiple flow accelerations and decelerations related to plunge-point translation even for a river flood with a single-peaked hydrograph. In contrast, fine sediment (mud) is relatively insensitive to local plunge-point dynamics and is most likely to preserve directly rising and falling river discharge. Finally, {{it was found that the}} necessary fluvial sediment concentration to form a plunging plume can be much larger than the concentration typically used assuming density equivalence because of deposition upstream of the plunge point...|$|R
40|$|Flood {{frequency}} estimation {{is crucial}} in both engineering practice and hydrological research. Regional analysis of flood peak discharges is used for more accurate estimates of flood quantiles in ungauged or poorly gauged catchments. This {{is based on the}} identification of homogeneous zones, where the probability distribution of annual maximum peak flows is invariant, except for a scale factor represented by an index flood. The numerous applications of this method have highlighted obtaining accurate estimates of index flood as a critical step, especially in ungauged or poorly gauged sections, where direct estimation by sample mean of annual flood series (AFS) is not possible, or inaccurate. Therein indirect methods have to be used. Most indirect methods are based upon empirical relationships that link index flood to hydrological, climatological and morphological catchment characteristics, developed by means of multi-regression analysis, or simplified lumped representation of rainfall–runoff processes. The limits of these approaches are increasingly evident as the size and spatial variability of the catchment increases. In these cases, the use of a spatially-distributed, physically-based hydrological model, and time continuous simulation of discharge can improve estimation of the index flood. This work presents an application of the FEST-WB model for the reconstruction of 29 years of hourly streamflows for an Alpine snow-fed catchment in northern Italy, to be used for index flood estimation. To extend the length of the simulated discharge time series, meteorological forcings given by daily precipitation and temperature at ground automatic weather stations are disaggregated hourly, and then fed to FEST-WB.

40|$|Landforms, morphologically {{similar to}} aeolian yardangs but formed by erosion of bedrock by {{currents}} on an estuarine rock platform, are described {{for the first}} time. The geometries of the “yardangs” are described and related to semi-lemniscate shapes that minimize hydraulic drag. The processes of bedrock erosion by the reversing sediment-laden tidal currents are described, and a semi-quantitative model for landform evolution is proposed. The model casts doubt on the “simple” role of the maximum in the two-dimensional vertical suspended sediment flux distribution and the consequent distribution of potential kinetic energy flux {{in the process of}} shaping the rock wall facing the ebb flow. Rather, although the kinetic energy flux increases away from the bed, the sediment becomes finer and abrasion likely is insignificant compared with coarse sand abrasion lower in the profile. In addition, the vertical distribution of sediment flux is mediated by topographic forcing which raises the elevation at which bed load intersects the yardang prow. Consequent erosion leads to ebb-facing caprock collapse and yardang shortening. In contrast, the role of ebb-flow separation is paramount in mediating the abrasion process that molds the rock surface facing the <b>flood</b> flow. The <b>length</b> of yardangs is the least conservative dimension, reducing through time more rapidly than the height and width. Width is the more conservative dimension which implies that once the caprock is destroyed, scour over the obstacle is significant in reducing body height, more so than scour of the flanks which reduces width.

Similarities to aeolian yardang geometries and formation principles and processes are noted, as are the differences. The model has implications for aeolian yardang models generally...|$|R
40|$|The {{ministry}} of land, infrastructures, transportation and tourism (MLIT) of the Japanese government maintains governmental managed river levee {{for the safety}} against <b>flood</b> whose total <b>length</b> is more than 10, 000 km. The design standard of river levee had been traditionally done based on so called shape based specification, where levee is judged to be safe {{as long as a}} section satisfies the specified dimensions. In 2002, this policy had been changed and a new inspection guideline which is based on the modern soil mechanics principles had been introduced. The method mainly consists of the non-stationary seepage analysis followed by the circular slip line stability analysis. The exit gradient and uplift pressure are also checked based on specified safety factors. The way of the safety assessment is that, first a river is divided into so called a continuous strip (CS) which is judged to have similar configurations, geotechnical and hydraulic conditions. The typical length of a CS is half to several km long. Then a representative cross section (RCS) that is considered to represent all the CS section is selected. At RCS, detailed soil investigations are carried out, and the inspection is done to assess the safety of the section for stability and piping. A CS is judged to be safe if all the verification items satisfy the specified safety factor, but judged to be NG (no good) if any of the items could not fulfill the threshold value. The first round assessment at year 2011 indicated, only 60 % of the all levee is judged to be safe for all verification items. 25 % of the levee could not satisfy the stability requirement, 30 % piping requirement, and 14 % the both requirements. In the paper, the details of the verification methods are described. Furthermore, some recent flood events are introduced. Finally, further challenges for the second screening of the safety of levee are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} impact of sea level rise on Lake Ellesmere - Te Wiahora and the subsequent effect on the efficiency and performance of the L 2 Drainage network was investigated {{in relation to the}} operation of the L 2 Drainage scheme. Lake Ellesmere is currently manually opened for drainage to the sea when the lake levels reach 1. 05 m above mean sea level (asl) in summer and 1. 13 m asl in winter. With a rise in sea level, the lake opening levels for both summer and winter would have to increase {{in order to maintain the}} current hydraulic gradient. Higher lake levels would impact drainage schemes such as the L 2 drainage network. An integral research approach was used to study this {{potential impact}}, including fieldwork, analysis of data, hydrologic and hydraulic modelling. Both the hydrologic and hydraulic response of the L 2 catchment and river were reproduced with reasonable accuracy by the use of computational models. Simulations of 2, 10 and 20 year annual recurrence intervals (ARI) rainstorm events coupled with higher lake levels show increase <b>flooding</b> along the <b>length</b> of the river. An increase in the lake opening levels, coupled with south-easterly wind was shown to have increased the degree of flooding on adjacent farmlands, but only a 3. 50 per cent increase of water level (for all conditions simulated) 3. 5 km upstream of the L 2 River. The study clearly shows that weed growth within the L 2 River plays an important part in controlling the water level within the channel. Results show it was responsible for an observed water level rise of 0. 30 m from the winter to summer season. The combined use of hydraulic and hydrological models provides an effective tool to study future impacts on the drainage efficiency and performance of the L 2 drainage scheme and other similar systems. The potential for both models to be used as a predictive tool for improving the operation of the L 2 scheme and Lake Ellesmere was only limited by the difficulty in estimating model parameters especially for the hydrologic model...|$|R

Almost unexploited in Bolivia, #C. macropomum$ stocks are already in regression in central Amazonia. It inhabits flood-plain and is indifferent to the two main water types, white waters originally from the Andes and black waters formed in "pampas". It is oustandingly resistant to hypoxia through the development of lower lip extensions often observed in numerous adults. During high waters, #C. macropomum$ are scattered into the flooded areas; they gather together in the lakes when the water recedes and finally reach the Mamore river. At low water, they migrate upstream for reproduction which takes place {{in the last quarter of}} the year near the Securé riverbanks. In the breeding season, males remain at the spawning places while, after spawning, females move to recently <b>flooded</b> areas. The <b>length</b> at sexual maturity is 62 cm for females and 60 cm for males. There is a clear condition cycle composed of rapid fattening during high waters followed by a long thinning down beginning at fall and lasting till the middle of next flood. These results on feeding agree with those obtained in central Amazonia : intense feeding period on fruits and seeds falling from the trees during high waters followed by a long fast, total for adults, partial for youngs. This cycle is registered on otolith (asteriscus) sections by alternating broad opaque zones and hyaline rings well stained by toluidin blue. These marks were useful to age most fishes with a good accuracy and to study the growth. The growth is fast and similar in both sexes until sexual maturity, which occurs between 7 and 10 years. Adult male growth is slightly slower than that of female; the difference between the two average maximal lengths is only 2 cm (74 cm for females, 72 cm for males). #Colossoma macropomum$ can live a very long time, at least 40 years (maximum, 65 years).
