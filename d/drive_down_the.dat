5|$|The Australians {{travelled}} to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Harvey scored {{seven and}} struggled {{in contrast to}} the rest of the Australians, who prospered to total 632, laying the foundation for an innings victory. Harvey took three catches in the match, including two leaping catches in the second innings with his hands above his head. His feats prompted the local spectators to say that such acrobatic catches had never been seen at The Oval. The home team's captain Stuart Surridge lofted a <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ground, and Harvey ran 25m from wide long-on and leapt in the air to catch the ball, which would have cleared the boundary. Harvey managed only 16 before being run out while batting with Bill Brown as Australia piled on 4/414 declared and defeated Cambridge University by an innings in the following match.|$|E
5|$|The race {{started at}} 4:48p.m.; Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier went up the track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was black-flagged by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left on the track. On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> track. He also made contact with Jamie McMurray, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first caution flag {{and the appearance of}} the pace car. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained on the track.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. The tanks were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, the tanks still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove down the field for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving down the field on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove down the field, and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field, but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly down the field, and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E

25|$|In {{economic}} policy, Thatcher {{started out}} by increasing {{interest rates to}} <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> money supply. She had a preference for indirect taxation over taxes on income, and value added tax (VAT) rose sharply to 15% {{with the result that}} inflation also rose. These moves hit businesses, especially in the manufacturing sector, and unemployment – which had stood at 1,500,000 {{by the time of the}} 1979 general election – was above 2,000,000 by the end of 1980. It continued to rise throughout 1981, passing the 2,500,000 mark during the summer of that year – although inflation was now down to 12% compared to 27% two years earlier. The economy was now in recession.|$|E
25|$|Luke Eger and 39 other farmers began Eagle Grange No. 1 on March 4, 1871 at {{the base}} of Bald Eagle Mountain in {{southern}} Lycoming County. They quickly set about reaching their goals. One of their most important goals was to set up a plan of co-operative purchasing farming supplies to <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> prices. Merchants that refused to do business with the co-op were summarily boycotted by the members of the Grange. The farmers from Lycoming County also sought to have the rates charged to them by the railroads lowered and they pushed for rural free delivery from the Post Office. Eger and the other members of Eagle Grange No. 1 were quickly successful in establishing themselves as a force with which to be reckoned.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{started the}} fourth quarter with a new quarterback, Mickey Ellenburg, who then led the Gators {{into the end zone}} with a 14-yard pass to Perry McGriff, tying the game at 7–7. LSU {{received}} the kickoff and were forced to punt shortly after. Florida again began a <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field but were intercepted by Cannon at the LSU 18-yard line, who then lateraled to Hendrix, who ran it down to LSU's 40. Rabb completed a pass to Brodnax and Cannon rushed four times for twenty yards to get LSU within eight yards of the end zone. After two incomplete passes by Rabb, Cannon tried a run up the middle, but was stopped by Heckman for a one-yard gain to bring up fourth down. Dietzel then allowed the play clock to run down and took a five-yard delay of game penalty to give Tommy Davis a better angle for a field goal attempt. From the 19-yard line, Davis stepped back and kicked it through the uprights to give LSU a 10–7 lead with 2:59 left in the game. Florida was unable to score on its final possession.|$|E

25|$|Starting for the Nationals {{to begin}} a three-game series on the road against the Phillies on September 25, Cole notched his first career hit, a single up the middle off Phillies ace Aaron Nola. Cole outdueled Nola to earn the win in the 3−1 contest. The next day, the Nationals {{activated}} star right fielder Bryce Harper from the disabled list after he missed {{more than a month}} with a hyperextended right knee and strained calf. The Nationals lost the September 26 and September 27 games to the Phillies before heading back to Washington, D.C., for a four-game homestand to end the regular season against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Closer Sean Doolittle suffered his first blown save as a National since being acquired in trade from the Oakland Athletics in July, giving up a single to Andrew McCutchen and then a home run to Josh Bell on his first two pitches of the ninth inning on September 28. However, the Nationals rallied {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning after the Pirates had tied it, with Rendon leading off with a single that was consecutively followed by singles from Murphy and then De Aza, whose sharp line <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> right field line brought home Rendon to complete a 5−4 walkoff victory. Strasburg made his final start of the regular season on September 29, leading the Nationals to a 6−1 win with 7⅔ shutout innings of no-hit ball to earn his 15th win of the year, joining Scherzer and Gio González among Nationals pitchers with that many. Strasburg also passed the 200-strikeout mark, making him and Scherzer the only pair of pitchers in team history with at least 200 strikeouts in a season. Zimmerman turned in one of the best offensive performances of his career, notching four extra-base hits for the first time in a game as he doubled twice and homered twice. On September 30, the Nationals announced Kelley had been diagnosed with bone chips in his right elbow and placed him on the 60-day disabled list. Infielder Stephen Drew, out since late July, was activated from the 60-day disabled list. In the last game of the month on September 30, Scherzer had to leave his start after 3⅓ innings with what the team later announced was a hamstring cramp. Cole came on in long relief and fired 3⅔ hitless innings, preserving Scherzer's one-hitter, before Romero came on for the eighth inning and worked around a walk. Kintzler, inserted to vie for his 30th career save, could not hold the 1−0 lead in the top of the ninth inning and gave up four runs on four hits to take the loss.|$|E

500|$|The {{architecture}} of the Bucket family home was influenced by Burton's visit to Roald Dahl's writing hut. Like the book, the film has a [...] "timeless" [...] setting and is not set in a specific country. [...] "We've tried not to pinpoint it to any place," [...] production designer Alex McDowell explained. [...] "The cars, in fact, <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> middle of the road." [...] The town, whose design was shaped by {{the black and white}} urban photography of Bill Brandt, as well as Pittsburgh and Northern England, is arranged like a medieval village, with Wonka's estate on top and the Bucket shack below. The filmmakers also used fascist architecture for Wonka's factory exterior, and designed most of the sets on 360° sound stages, similar to cycloramas. Burton biographer Mark Salisbury wrote that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory [...] "melds 1950s and '70s visuals with a futuristic sensibility that seems straight out of a 1960s sense of the future." [...] The [...] "TV Room" [...] was patterned after photographs from the films , , and THX 1138. Danger Diabolik also served as inspiration for the Nut Room and Inventing Room.|$|E

500|$|In April 1984, {{after the}} Congressional hearings, the USAF was {{directed}} to promote FX actively. Several potential customers were briefed during May and June 1984 on the performance and cost of both the F-20 and F-16/79. The Air Force published an internal report on FX in late June 1984. The F-20 was characterized as having outstanding performance against viable threats; and seen {{as a candidate for}} the Air Force's aggressor requirement. The report additionally stated that the F-20 had been contractor-funded, totaling over $750million, compared to $60million on the F-16/79. However, the report concluded that it had little or no market to sell to. The USAF had a vested interest to encourage F-16 sales; larger production numbers would <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> cost per unit. Gregg Easterbrook noted that F-20 may have cast the Air Force in a bad light, as an aircraft developed independent of their input, [...] authors such as Donald Pattillo shared this conclusion. In contrast, the F-16 was heavily involved in the USAF hierarchy, originating from a group of officers known as the [...] "fighter mafia". By March 1985, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of State were reconsidering the policy. Despite some calls to support Northrop, FX was abandoned.|$|E
500|$|With {{time running}} out, Air Force {{seemingly}} had one last opportunity to <b>drive</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> field {{and send the}} game into overtime with a touchdown and extra point or to win it outright with a touchdown and two-point conversion. The Falcons began their drive at their 18-yard line after Tech's kickoff. At the start, Air Force was aided by a 15-yard penalty against Virginia Tech. From there, the going was less easy, as Air Force used short rushes by Anthony Butler, Harridge, and Steve Massie to gain two first downs and advance the ball into Virginia Tech territory. Then, facing third down at the Virginia Tech 47-yard line, Harridge completed an 18-yard pass to tight end Adam Strecker. It was just Harridge's second completion of the game—the first having {{taken place in the}} second play of the game. Following the pass, the Falcons were hampered by a 10-yard illegal blocking penalty, but a 19-yard pass to James Walker erased that deficit and gave Air Force a first down at the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. Time was rapidly running out, but there was still time for Air Force to attempt a few plays. Harridge threw two passes that fell incomplete, then attempted a desperation run towards the end zone. He was tackled five yards short of the goal line, however, and time expired.|$|E
