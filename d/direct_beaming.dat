40|$|Power beaming to {{satellites}} with {{a ground-based}} laser can {{be limited by}} clouds. Hole-boring through the clouds with a laser has been proposed {{as a way to}} overcome this obstacle. This paper reviews the past work on laser hole-boring and concludes that hole-boring for <b>direct</b> <b>beaming</b> to satellites is likely to require 10 [...] 100 MW. However, {{it may be possible to}} use an airborne relay mirror at 10 [...] 25 km altitude for some applications in order to extend the range of the laser (e. g., for beaming to satellites near the horizon). In these cases, use of the relay mirror also would allow a narrow beam between the laser and the relay, as well as the possibility of reducing the crosswind if the plane matched speed with the cloud temporarily. Under these conditions, the power requirement to bore a hole through most cirrus and cirrostratus clouds might be only 500 -kW if the hole is less than 1 m in diameter and if the crosswind speed is less than 10 m/s. Overcoming cirrus and cirrostratus clouds would reduce the downtime due to weather by a factor of 2. However, 500 kW is a large laser, and it may be more effective instead to establish a second power beaming site in a separate weather zone. An assessment of optimum wavelengths for hole boring also was made, and the best options were found to be 3. 0 [...] 3. 4 {mu}m and above 10 {mu}m...|$|E
30|$|The Planet-B neutral gas mass {{spectrometer}} {{is designed for}} in-situ measurements of the gas composition in the upper atmosphere of Mars. The sensor uses a dual frequency quadrupole mass analyzer with a mass range of 1 – 60 amu (atomic mass units) and two electron multipliers to cover the dynamic range required. The ion source, which is collinear with the analyzer, operates in two different modes: 1) a closed source mode measuring non-surface reactive neutral species that have thermally accommodated to the gas inlet walls; and 2) an open source mode measuring chemically surface active species by <b>direct</b> <b>beaming</b> with no surface collisions. The in-line Retarding Potential Analysis (RPA) system selects the mode of operation. An onboard Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used to control the instrument operating parameters in accordance with pre-programmed sequences and to package the telemetry data. The sensor is sealed and maintained in a vacuum prior to launch and will be opened to the environment of Mars after orbit insertion. Measurements of He, N, O, CO, N 2, NO, O 2, Ar, and CO 2 will be done at periapsis and the data {{will be used to}} determine the variation of the neutral atmosphere density and temperature with altitude, local solar time and season. Measurements are possible from 130 – 140 km to 500 km depending on the gas species, chemical background, and instrument measurement mode. The data will contribute to the studies of thermosphere energetics, lower atmosphere meteorology (e.g. dust storms) and serve as a resource for studies of the interaction of the upper atmosphere with the solar wind.|$|E

A procedure and solar radiation related data are presented from which the daily variation of the global, <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> and diffuse insolation on Mars are calculated. Given the optical depth of the Mars atmosphere, the global radiation is calculated from the normalized net flux function based on multiple wavelength and multiple scattering of the solar radiation.

The angular variation in the reflectance of diffuse radiation by the panel appears independent of the panel type but varies with the diffuse to global (D : G) irradiance ratio, especially at large solar zenith angles.

40|$|The 19 -channel {{rotating}} shadowband radiometer GUVis- 3511 {{built by}} Biospherical Instruments provides automated shipborne {{measurements of the}} direct, diffuse and global spectral irradiance components without a requirement for platform stabilization. Several direct sun products, including spectral <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> transmittance, aerosol optical depth, Ångström exponent and precipitable water, {{can be derived from}} these observations. The individual steps of the data analysis are described, and the different sources of uncertainty are discussed. The total uncertainty of the observed <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> transmittances is estimated to be about 4  % for most channels within a 95  % confidence interval for shipborne operation. The calibration is identified as the dominating contribution to the total uncertainty. A comparison of <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> transmittance with those obtained from a Cimel sunphotometer at a land site and a manually operated Microtops II sunphotometer on a ship is presented. Measurements deviate by less than 3 and 4  % on land and on ship, respectively, for most channels and in agreement with our previous uncertainty estimate. These numbers demonstrate that the instrument is well suited for shipborne operation, and the applied methods for motion correction work accurately. Based on spectral <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> transmittance, aerosol optical depth can be retrieved with an uncertainty of 0. 02 for all channels within a 95  % confidence interval. The different methods to account for Rayleigh scattering and gas absorption in our scheme and in the Aerosol Robotic Network processing for Cimel sunphotometers lead to minor deviations.

40|$|Plant canopy {{interception}} of {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR) drives carbon dioxide (CO 2), water and energy cycling in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Quantifying intercepted PAR requires accurate measurements of total incident PAR above canopies and <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> and diffuse PAR components. While some regional data sets include these data, e. g. from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program sites, they are not often applicable to local research sites because of the variable nature (spatial and temporal) of environmental variables that influence incoming PAR. Currently available instrumentation that measures diffuse and <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> radiation separately can be cost prohibitive and require frequent adjustments. Alternatively, generalized empirical relationships that relate atmospheric variables and radiation components can be used but require assumptions that increase the potential for error. Our goal here was to construct and test a cheaper, highly portable instrument alternative {{that could be used}} at remote field sites to measure total, diffuse and <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> PAR for extended time periods without supervision. The apparatus tested here uses a fabricated, solar powered rotating shadowband and other commercially available parts to collect continuous hourly PAR data. Measurements of total incident PAR had nearly a one-to-one relationship with total incident radiation measurements taken at the same research site by an unobstructed point quantum sensor. Additionally, measurements of diffuse PAR compared favorably with modeled estimates from previously published data, but displayed significant differences that were attributed to the important influence of rapidly changing local environmental conditions. The cost of the system is about 50 % less than comparable commercially available systems that require periodic, but not continual adjustments. Overall, the data produced using this apparatus indicates that this instrumentation has the potential to support ecological research via a relatively inexpensive method to collect continuous measurements of total, <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> and diffuse PAR in remote locations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMeteorological phenomena, such as {{fast moving}} clouds, cause rapid {{changes in the}} {{terrestrial}} <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> radiation. This introduces transients in both the temporal and spatial measurements of global horizontal radiation. These transients in radiation affect the performance of solar energy conversion systems (PV, CPV systems and solar thermal applications) and cause their output power to vary widely. Thus, to properly understand the dynamic fluctuations observed in the output energies of large solar farms and PV arrays, it becomes necessary to perform a high-resolution temporal and spatial measurement of solar radiation. It turns out that performing such high-resolution measurements is often cost-prohibitive. Studies were conducted to understand and quantify the temporal and the spatial variations of <b>direct</b> <b>beam,</b> diffused and global horizontal radiation. These studies {{were based on the}} radiation data collected at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore at a time interval of 1 s. It was inferred from these studies that the temporal variations in the instantaneous diffuse radiation are minimum and there was little spatial variations seen across distances of 500 m. The transients observed in global horizontal radiation are predominantly restricted to the changes occurring in the <b>direct</b> <b>beam</b> component of the solar radiation. Based on these inferences, a simple and costeffective method is proposed that would permit accurate large scale localised high-resolution measurements of individual components of the solar radiation...|$|R
