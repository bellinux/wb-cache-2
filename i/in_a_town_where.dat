25|$|The more {{developed}} and crowded a place is, the more public urination {{tends to be}} objectionable. In the countryside, it is more acceptable than in a street <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>town,</b> <b>where</b> {{it may be a}} common transgression. Often this is done after the consumption of alcoholic beverages, which causes production of additional urine as well as a reduction of inhibitions. One proposed way to inhibit public urination due to drunkenness is the Urilift, which is disguised as a normal manhole by day but raises out of the ground at night to provide a public restroom for bar-goers.|$|E

500|$|Peale, {{accompanied}} by his daughter Anna, arrived in Charlotte on September 23, 1837. [...] He found that necessary equipment had not yet arrived, and without it he could do little. [...] Peale ordered a search made, and reported to Patterson that he was [...] "in a trap" [...] in [...] "this fag end of creation" [...] <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>where</b> [...] "the only active beings are the hogs". Peale spent time visiting the mines on which the Charlotte Mint would rely for bullion. He proposed to Patterson that he continue to New Orleans after Dahlonega, to which the Mint Director replied that he would [...] "exercise my veto upon your proposed long delay" [...] and [...] "your presence [...] cannot be dispensed with". On October 27, much of the missing equipment arrived in Charlotte, and Peale was able to complete his mission there and leave for Dahlonega on November 10. Following a difficult journey over primitive mountain roads, Franklin and Anna Peale arrived there on November 15. After assessing the problems at the nascent Dahlonega Mint, Peale reported to Patterson, ...|$|E
500|$|Reverend Henry Michell Wagner was the Anglican vicar of Brighton {{for much}} of the 19th century. [...] His son Reverend Arthur Wagner was also an {{important}} part of religious life in the town throughout his adult life. [...] Both men were rich, charitably minded and proactive, and they established a series of churches in poor parts of Brighton to make Anglican worship more widely accessible <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>where</b> pew rental (a requirement to pay to worship) was still an established practice. [...] In 1824, when Henry Michell Wagner's tenure began, there were about 3,000 free places in the town's churches, but about 20,000 people were considered poor enough to need them. [...] Between them, the Wagners funded 11 new churches in densely populated lower-class areas of Brighton, which contributed to the near-doubling of Anglican church provision in Brighton in a 25-year period of the mid-19th century. [...] By the postwar period, as people moved to new suburbs and rising land values in central Brighton encouraged the replacement of houses with commercial and entertainment buildings, many of these churches were no longer needed. [...] Six of the eleven Wagner churches were demolished: only two of Arthur Wagner's six survive, along with three of his son's five.|$|E

[...] "The anarchists were still in virtual control of Catalonia and the revolution was still in full swing ... It {{was the first time}} that I had ever been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>where</b> the working class was in the saddle ... every wall was scrawled with the hammer and sickle ... every shop and café had an inscription saying that it had been collectivized." [...] "The Anarchists" [...] (referring to the Spanish CNT and FAI) were [...] "in control", tipping was prohibited by workers themselves, and servile forms of speech, such as [...] "Señor" [...] or [...] "Don", were abandoned. He goes on to describe the scene at the Lenin Barracks (formerly the Lepanto Barracks) where militiamen were given [...] "what was comically called 'instruction'" [...] in preparation for fighting at the front.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, {{even if the}} {{reasoning}} of the majority was correct, the dual sovereignty doctrine must [...] "not [...] legitimate the collusion between Georgia and Alabama in this case to ensure that petitioner is executed for his crime." [...] Specifically, {{in this case the}} defendant pleaded guilty in Georgia {{for the express purpose of}} avoiding the death penalty; then, he was put on trial in Alabama by a jury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>where</b> the crime was notorious, and where 75 of 82 prospective jurors were aware that Heath had already pleaded guilty in Georgia. The judge, rather than exclude the jurors who knew that the defendant had already plead guilty, simply asked them if they would be able to [...] "put aside their knowledge of the prior guilty plea in order to give petitioner a fair trial in Alabama." [...] It strains credibility that the jurors could remain impartial in spite of their knowledge of the guilty plea. Furthermore, given that the jurors had this knowledge, defense counsel [...] "could do little but attempt to elicit information from prosecution witnesses tending to show that the crime was committed exclusively in Georgia"; any argument tending to show actual innocence would likely be disbelieved by the jury, in spite of the fact that the guilty plea in Georgia was part of a plea bargain, and some defendants, to avoid execution, may plead guilty without actually being guilty.|$|E
