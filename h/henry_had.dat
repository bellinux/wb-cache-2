5|$|In {{the middle}} of this confrontation, Henry {{unexpectedly}} fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt. It is uncertain what, if anything, Henry said about the succession before his death. Contemporary chronicler accounts were coloured by subsequent events. Sources favourable to Matilda suggested that <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> reaffirmed his intent to grant all his lands to his daughter, while hostile chroniclers argued that <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> renounced his former plans and had apologised for having forced the barons to swear an oath of allegiance to her.|$|E

5|$|By {{contrast}} with the tensions in England, in Normandy <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> occasional disagreements with the Church but generally enjoyed very {{good relations with the}} Norman bishops. In Brittany, <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> the support of the local church hierarchy and rarely intervened in clerical matters, except occasionally in order to cause difficulties for his rival Louis of France. Further south, however, the power of the dukes of Aquitaine over the local church was much less than in the north, and Henry's efforts to extend his influence over local appointments created tensions. During the disputed papal election of 1159, Henry, like Louis, supported Alexander III over his rival Victor IV.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> a {{considerable}} sexual appetite and enjoyed {{a substantial number}} of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported. It was normal for unmarried Anglo-Norman noblemen to have sexual relations with prostitutes and local women, and kings were also expected to have mistresses. Some of these relationships occurred before Henry was married, but many others took place after his marriage to Matilda. <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> a wide range of mistresses from a range of backgrounds, and the relationships appear to have been conducted relatively openly. He may have chosen some of his noble mistresses for political purposes, but the evidence to support this theory is limited.|$|E

5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> come to Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 {{as the year}} of the crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact that}} also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as {{the year of the}} crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E
5|$|Carroll died {{only two}} years later, with his wealth intact but having failed to regain any {{political}} rights for Catholics in Maryland. Carroll's eldest son <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> died a year before; the family fortune and burden of heading a Catholic family in Protestant-dominated Maryland were passed on to his younger sons Charles and Daniel.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{ability to}} bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, {{at the age}} of 15, <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> taken as his {{mistress}} the 38-year-old Diane de Poitiers, whom he adored {{for the rest of his}} life. Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the basilica of Saint-Denis on 10 June 1549.|$|E

5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> Anne {{investigated}} for high treason in April 1536. On 2 May {{she was arrested}} {{and sent to the}} Tower of London, where she was tried before a jury of peers – which included Henry Percy, her former betrothed, and her own uncle, Thomas Howard – and found guilty on 15 May. She was beheaded four days later. Modern historians view the charges against her, which included adultery, incest and plotting to kill the king, as unconvincing. Some say that Anne was accused of witchcraft but the indictments make no mention of this charge.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> a {{problematic}} relationship with Louis VII of France throughout the 1150s. The {{two men had}} already clashed over Henry's succession to Normandy and the remarriage of Eleanor, and the relationship was not repaired. Louis invariably attempted to take {{the moral high ground}} in respect to Henry, capitalising on his reputation as a crusader and circulating rumours about his rival's behaviour and character. <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> greater resources than Louis, however, particularly after taking England, and Louis was far less dynamic in resisting Angevin power than he had been earlier in his reign. The disputes between the two drew in other powers across the region, including Thierry, the Count of Flanders, who signed a military alliance with Henry, albeit with a clause that prevented the count from being forced to fight against Louis, his feudal lord. Further south, Theobald V, the Count of Blois, an enemy of Louis, became another early ally of Henry. The resulting military tensions and the frequent face-to-face meetings to attempt to resolve them has led historian Jean Dunbabin to liken the situation to the period of the Cold War in Europe in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{maintained}} {{peace with}} Scotland during his reign, {{where he was}} the feudal lord of Alexander II. Henry assumed that he had the right to interfere in Scottish affairs and brought up the issue of his authority with the Scottish kings at key moments, but he lacked the inclination or the resources to do much more. Alexander had occupied parts of northern England during the First Barons' War but had been excommunicated and forced to retreat. Alexander married Henry's sister Joan in 1221, and after he and Henry signed the Treaty of York in 1237, <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> a secure northern frontier. Henry knighted Alexander III before the young King married Henry's daughter Margaret in 1251 and, despite Alexander's refusal to give homage to Henry for Scotland, the two enjoyed a good relationship. <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> Alexander and Margaret rescued from Edinburgh Castle when they were imprisoned there by a rebellious Scottish baron in 1255 and took additional measures to manage Alexander's government during the rest of his minority years.|$|E

5|$|Henry's {{complicated}} marital {{situation and}} his high-handed {{dissolution of the}} monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> agreed to attack France together with Emperor CharlesV, and English forces captured Boulogne at great cost in September, but soon England {{was left in the}} lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a separate peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1189, Hugh {{was one of}} {{only five}} sitting sheriffs who {{retained}} their office when Richard took the throne; the others included Geoffrey fitzPeter, William Briwerre, and Ranulf de Glanvill. However, in 1189, Bardulf did lose custody of Salisbury Castle, which he had held under Henry. <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> given Bardulf the manor and barony of Brampton in Devonshire, but when Richard took the throne, the king took back Brampton, and gave Bardulf the manor of Hoo in Kent instead.|$|E

5|$|It {{is a sign}} of Edward's {{high regard}} for Lancaster that he would bestow such {{extensive}} privileges on him. The two men were second cousins through their great-grandfather Henry III and practically coeval (Edward was born in 1312), so it is natural to assume that a strong sense of camaraderie existed between them. Another factor that might have influenced the king's decision was the fact that <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> no male heir, so the grant was made for the Earl's lifetime only, and not intended to be hereditary.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1595 Clement VIII had {{accepted}} the decision of Henry IV of France to convert to the Catholic Church, which <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> previously made to secure the French monarchy, and presided over a ceremony of papal absolution. This removed the excommunication order placed on him by Sixtus V. The Spanish faction had previously opposed the pope taking these actions, but the French negotiators had talked {{of the possibility of}} schism, which along with Henry's victories in the French Wars of Religion, overcame their opposition.|$|E
5|$|The 1174 peace did {{not deal}} with the long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s. The two kings now began to compete for control of Berry, a prosperous region of value to both kings. <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fiancée Alice the whole province {{as part of the}} marriage settlement. If Louis accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away in the first place, and would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf. To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war. The papacy intervened and, probably as <b>Henry</b> <b>had</b> planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a non-aggression treaty in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint crusade. The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an arbitration panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing La Marche from the local count. This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.|$|E
