40|$|The shoe {{manufacturing}} industry {{has undergone a}} revolution during the last 50 years, due {{to the introduction of}} task specific machinery. Great technological strides {{have been made in the}} areas of shoe manufacture prior to actual component assembly. Computer systems are now becoming the norm for the design of shoes for today's market place. Technological innovations have also started to be applied in the assembly and construction processes of modern shoes. Computer controlled cutting machines calculate the optimum usage of leather from any given hide, new machines allow <b>decorative</b> <b>stitch</b> patterns to be associated with a given shape and size of component and automatically stitched on to the presented workpiece. However the majority of assembly operations have remained predominantly manual with technology playing a secondary role to the human operator due to complexities either in manipulation, control or sensing. In these machines electronic and mechanical innovations have been used to add new features to often simple machines and in some cases to simplify some of the more complex operations, thus increasing productivity but reducing the required dexterity and knowledge of an operator. Modern preferences in industry are to utilise fully automated machines, that are as operator independent as possible, thus improving quality, consistency and production speed whilst at the same time reducing production costs. Due to the nature of the shoe {{manufacturing industry}} and the complex operations that have to be performed in order to construct a shoe, machinery manufacturers who have ventured into this field of automation have generally struggled to gain acceptance from the shoe makers as the machinery is generally complex and slow in operation. This together with the fact that a large proportion of the world's main footwear production is centred in the far east, with their correspondingly low labour costs, has held back the automation of the shoe  manufacturing industry. This thesis examines a selection of operations encountered in the construction of a typical shoe. These include operations for processing single flat component parts as well as more complex three-dimensional operations encountered when lasting and soling a shoe. The aim of the research was to develop an understanding of processes encountered in specific areas within the shoe manufacturing industry in order to identify areas where further advances in automation could be achieved. This understanding has been applied to produce proposals and in some cases hardware, to allow for the development of working systems...|$|E
50|$|The Craft {{involves}} embroidering and stitching. For {{attaching the}} pieces of cloth articians use straight stitch, satin stitch, blind stitch, or buttonhole stitch. Sometimes they also make mirror work and many <b>decorative</b> <b>stitches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gloves are well-knitted with <b>decorative</b> <b>stitches</b> on {{the upper}} palms and gauntlets. They are similar to other gloves of the period. The palm of the right glove is more worn and patched than the left glove, {{suggesting}} he was right-handed.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{embroidery}} is {{any form}} of embroidery in which the pattern is worked {{by the use of}} <b>decorative</b> <b>stitches</b> and laid threads on top of the foundation fabric or canvas rather than through the fabric; it is contrasted with canvas work.|$|R
50|$|Hand hemstitching can be imitated by a hemstitching machine {{which has}} a piercer that pierces holes into the fabric and two {{separate}} needles that sew the hole open. There are also hemstitcher attachments for home sewing machines, and simple <b>decorative</b> <b>stitches</b> can be used over drawn threads to suggest hand-hemstitching.|$|R

The shallow waters around Nunivak Island {{generally}} host low cetacean populations, although beluga (Delphinapterus leucas), Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli), killer whales (Orcinas orca) occasionally visit the area. Dark beluga whale sinew (cetuat yualuit) was occasionally used for <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching</b> by Nunivaarmiut Cup'ig.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} fabric, <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching</b> {{patterns}} {{also play a}} role. Lehengas come {{with a wide variety}} of decoration and embroidery work like Gota, Phulkari, Shisha, Chikankari, Zari, Zardozi, Nakshi, Kundan, etc. For festivals like Navratri, the ethnic Shisha embroidery is popular with a bit of patchwork. For formal wear and weddings, the embroidery is heavier in pearls, silk, sequins and zari.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{industrial}} lockstitch machines sew only {{a straight}} line of stitches. Industrial zig-zag machines are available, but uncommon, and there are essentially no fancy-pattern stitching industrial machines other than dedicated embroidery and edge decoration machines. Even {{something as simple as}} a bar-tack or a buttonhole stitch is usually done by a dedicated machine incapable of doing anything else. When a variety of <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching</b> is required rather than a single stitch, a [...] "commercial" [...] machine (basically a heavy duty household machine) is usually employed.|$|R
25|$|For {{the second}} series, the Moonbase uniforms were updated and {{coloured}} <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching</b> and turtleneck collars were added, as were various badges and patches. Red, navy, or dark-green jackets also appeared, originally on just the senior staff, then {{on many of}} the male extras. The female characters tended to wear skirts and knee high boots throughout the second series, rather than the flared trousers used in Year One. The costumes for Year Two were designed by Emma Porteous, who later designed the wardrobes for several James Bond films.|$|R
50|$|Decoration varied widely. Early {{boots were}} cowhide leather pieced {{together}} with single rows of top stitching, but as custom boots were made, cowboys asked for <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching,</b> cutouts {{in the high}} tops (early on, often Texas stars), and different materials. The interaction of wild west shows and, later, western movies influenced styles that working cowboys at times adopted. Modern cowboy boots are available in all colors and {{can be made from}} just about every animal whose skin can be made into leather, including exotic materials such as alligator and ostrich.|$|R
50|$|Like Lacis, Armenian needlelace {{seems to}} be an obvious {{descendant}} of netmaking. Where lacis adds <b>decorative</b> <b>stitches</b> to a net ground, Armenian needlelace involves making the net itself decorative. There is some archaeological evidence suggesting the use of lace in prehistoric Armenia and the prevalence of pre-Christian symbology in traditional designs would certainly suggest a pre-Christian root for this art form.In contrast to Europe where lace was the preserve of the nobility, in Armenia it decorated everything from traditional headscarves to lingerie. Thus lacemaking was part of many women's lives.|$|R
5000|$|Sashiko (刺し子, {{literally}} [...] "little stabs") is a Japanese tradition, {{that evolved}} over time {{from a simple}} technique for reinforcing fabric made for heavy use in fishing villages. It {{is a form of}} <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching,</b> with no overlap of any two stitches. Piecing {{is not part of the}} tradition; instead, the focus is on heavy cotton thread work with large, even stitches on the base fabric. Deep blue indigo-dyed fabric with white stitches is the most traditional form, but inverse work with blue on white is also seen. Traditional medallion, tessellated, and geometric designs are the most common.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{consumer}} embroidery machines quickly stitch appliqué designs {{by following}} a program. The programs {{have a minimum}} complexity of two thread colours, meaning the machine stops during stitching to allow the user to switch threads. First, the fabric {{that will be the}} background and the appliqué fabric are affixed into the machine's embroidery hoop. The program is run and the machine makes a loose basting stitch over both layers of fabric. Next, the machine stops for a thread change, or other pre-programmed break. The user then cuts away the excess appliqué fabric from around the basting stitch. Following this, the machine continues on program, automatically sewing the satin <b>stitches</b> and any <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching</b> over the appliqué for best results.|$|R

5000|$|Cloth {{destined for}} huipils is joined {{together}} by complicated and <b>decorative</b> hand <b>stitching.</b> [...] In addition to designs {{woven into the}} cloth, clothing, napkins and more are further embellished with embroidery with designs depicting geometric figures, animals. Most embroidery is done using commercial thread as it is cheaper.|$|R
40|$|The price {{offered for}} the {{garments}} is called garments cost. Cost of a garment is depending on its style and materials used. If the style is so complicated like having pockets, fancy seams, lining & trims, <b>decorative</b> <b>stitches</b> etc the cost will be high. On the other hand, if garments {{are made from}} only basic fabric their cost willbe low. The prime factor of costing is fabric cost because it occupies maximum portion of garments price. Here, {{it has been observed}} that 52 %- 55 % of garments price is occupied by fabric price. But this percentage varied from garment to garment according to their fabric specification. It has been also identified that the fabric costpercentage will be reduced in terms of its FOB price when the garments are characterized by design and viceversa...|$|R
50|$|Bangladeshi quilts, {{known as}} Kantha, are not pieced {{together}}. Rather, they consist {{two to three}} pieces of cloth sewn together with <b>decorative</b> embroidery <b>stitches.</b> They are made out of worn-out clothes (saris) and are mainly used for bedding, although they {{may be used as}} a decorative piece as well. They are made by women mainly in the Monsoon season before winter.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{fasteners}} {{are seen in}} fashion boots. Laces are commonly used in ankle boots, but are too time-consuming for longer styles. Zip fasteners are widely employed in all styles of boot - they may run {{the entire length of}} the shaft, or just the ankle and lower calf - these partial-length zips make it easier to insert the foot into the toe of the boot by relaxing the fit around the ankle. Pull-on boots have no fasteners and tend to have a looser fit than zip or lace-up boots; they sometimes have a loop of leather at the top of the shaft, called a boot-strap, to assist with pulling the boot on. Finally, button-fastened boots were common at the beginning of the last century but are rarely seen today. If present, buttons are usually employed as design accents on boots; other decorative features include straps, buckles, studs, and <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although in many {{instances}} collars are worn solely by a submissive partner {{in a relationship with}} a dominant, in some cases the dominant partner or an unattached person may also wear a collar. People across social layers can now be seen wearing casual collars, purely for fashion. Collars used for fashion are worn by both men and women, and made from various materials such as soft leather, cotton, neoprene, nylon etc. often in bright friendly colors but varying from bright, neutral into darker colors. The lining ranges from bare leather to lambskin, to faux fur. The collar most often has a buckle either in black, nickel or brass design, but snaps and velcro closures are also found. Adornments range from plain collars, to <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching,</b> to studs of all kinds to gems to ruby domes and gemocites etc. Attachments are common too, but often discreet, e.g. a thin black D-ring in front of the collar.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{its early}} {{introduction}} and extended production year, the 1969 model had several running changes made. Cars produced prior to July 1968 had a steering wheel pad {{with a much}} larger wood applique and Continental star logo than later cars. Cars produced prior to July 1968 featured a <b>decorative</b> <b>stitching</b> pattern {{on the face of}} the rear seat above the center arm rest. After July 1968 the seatbelt retractors were relocated and eight additional exterior color choices were added. Cars produced before the second week of December 1968 had white indicator needles for all instruments and controls, and an electric clock with Arabic Numerals was used. Cars Produced after the second week of December 1968 utilized orange indicator needles for all instruments and controls, and a Cartier Chronometer with Roman Numerals was installed. All cars produced after December 31, 1968 were equipped with driver and front passenger head rests as required by Federal mandate.|$|R
5000|$|Sashiko (literally [...] "little stabs") {{is a form}} of <b>decorative</b> {{reinforcement}} <b>stitching</b> (or functional embroidery) from Japan. Traditionally used {{to reinforce}} points of wear or to repair worn places or tears with patches, this running stitch technique is often used for purely decorative purposes in quilting and embroidery. The white cotton thread on the traditional indigo blue cloth gives sashiko its distinctive appearance, though decorative items sometimes use red thread.|$|R
