In protest, the Ulster Says No movement led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.|$|E

The Progressive Conservatives won {{a majority of the}} votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the Second Punic War, Hannibal crossed into Italy by {{traversing}} the Pyrenees and the Alps during the summer and early autumn. He quickly won major victories over the Romans at Trebia and at Lake Trasimene. After these losses, the Romans appointed Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator to deal with the threat. Fabius used attrition warfare against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding pitched battles. These tactics proved unpopular with the Romans who, as they recovered from the shock of Hannibal's victories, began to question the wisdom of the Fabian strategy, which <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Carthaginian army a chance to regroup. The majority of Romans were eager to see a quick conclusion to the war. It was feared that, if Hannibal continued plundering Italy unopposed, Rome's allies might defect to the Carthaginian side for self-preservation.|$|E
5|$|Showtime began {{developing}} the series {{at the start}} of 2005, planning for it {{to be based on the}} novel by Jeff Lindsay. By February, Emmy-winning writer James Manos, Jr. (a writer for The Sopranos) was on board to write the pilot script with John Goldwyn, with Sara Colleton as executive producer. By June 13, 2005, Showtime <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> show a green-light to be aired for the next year. The premise of the episode follows the same storyline as Jeff Lindsay's novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the first in the series of novels on which the television show is based, albeit with many additional elements and altered characters. Dexter was released on Showtime as part of a batch of new programs for the network, along with Brotherhood, This American Life and a reality TV series called Sexual Healing.|$|E

5|$|The American {{takeover}} {{meant the}} Philippine Revolution bled into the Philippine–American War, as Filipinos fought for their independence, but U.S. forces, led by military governor General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. had {{the upper hand}} by 1900. MacArthur felt the commission was a nuisance, and their mission a quixotic attempt to impose self-government on a people unready for it. The general was forced to co-operate with Taft, as McKinley <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> commission control over the islands' military budget. The commission took executive power in the Philippines on September 1, 1900; on July 4, 1901, Taft became civilian governor. MacArthur, until then the military governor, was relieved by General Adna Chaffee, who was designated only as commander of American forces.|$|E
5|$|The Convention <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> Committee {{extraordinary}} {{authority to}} provide for state security ever since {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolutionary War in early 1793. Committee members were originally intended to serve for periods of only thirty days before replacements were elected, so they needed to work quickly. Saint-Just took charge of the issue and led the development of the French Constitution of 1793. Before the end of his first term, the new document was completed, submitted to the Convention, and ratified as law on 24 June 1793.|$|E
5|$|The Finns {{had many}} reasons {{to turn down the}} Soviet proposals. Finland had started {{negotiations}} for a military co-operation with Sweden, and the Finns had great hopes for the joint Finnish–Swedish defense for the Ålands islands {{and did not want to}} jeopardize these negotiations. In addition, the violent collectivization, purges, show trials and executions in Stalin's Soviet Union <b>had</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> country a bad reputation. Furthermore, most of the Finnish Communist leadership in the Soviet Union was executed during the Great Purge. The Soviet Union did not therefore seem to be a reliable contracting party. The Soviet envoys sent to negotiate with Finns were officially of relatively low rank, but as Väinö Tanner put it later, the Finns assumed rightly that they represented of some higher organ of State, probably the Soviet secret police NKVD.|$|E
