5000|$|Needle coke, {{also called}} {{acicular}} coke, {{is a highly}} crystalline petroleum coke used {{in the production of}} electrodes for the steel and aluminium industries and is particularly valuable because the electrodes must be replaced regularly. Needle coke is produced exclusively from either FCC <b>decant</b> <b>oil</b> or coal tar pitch.|$|E
50|$|The {{bottom product}} {{oil from the}} main {{fractionator}} contains residual catalyst particles which were not completely removed by the cyclones {{in the top of}} the reactor. For that reason, the bottom product oil is referred to as a slurry oil. Part of that slurry oil is recycled back into the main fractionator above the entry point of the hot reaction product vapors so as to cool and partially condense the reaction product vapors as they enter the main fractionator. The remainder of the slurry oil is pumped through a slurry settler. The bottom oil from the slurry settler contains most of the slurry oil catalyst particles and is recycled back into the catalyst riser by combining it with the FCC feedstock oil. The clarified slurry oil or <b>decant</b> <b>oil</b> is withdrawn from the top of slurry settler for use elsewhere in the refinery, as a heavy fuel oil blending component, or as carbon black feedstock.|$|E
40|$|The {{final report}} {{summarizes}} the accomplishments toward project goals during {{length of the}} project. The goal of this project was to integrate coal into a refinery {{in order to produce}} coal-based jet fuel, with the major goal to examine the products other than jet fuel. These products are in the gasoline, diesel and fuel oil range and result from coal-based jet fuel production from an Air Force funded program. The main goal of Task 1 was the production of coal-based jet fuel and other products that would need to be utilized in other fuels or for non-fuel sources, using known refining technology. The gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil were tested in other aspects of the project. Light cycle oil (LCO) and refined chemical oil (RCO) were blended, hydrotreated to removed sulfur, and hydrogenated, then fractionated in the original production of jet fuel. Two main approaches, taken during the project period, varied where the fractionation took place, in order to preserve the life of catalysts used, which includes (1) fractionation of the hydrotreated blend to remove sulfur and nitrogen, followed by a hydrogenation step of the lighter fraction, and (2) fractionation of the LCO and RCO before any hydrotreatment. Task 2 involved assessment of the impact of refinery integration of JP- 900 production on gasoline and diesel fuel. Fuel properties, ignition characteristics and engine combustion of model fuels and fuel samples from pilot-scale production runs were characterized. The model fuels used to represent the coal-based fuel streams were blended into full-boiling range fuels to simulate the mixing of fuel streams within the refinery to create potential 'finished' fuels. The representative compounds of the coal-based gasoline were cyclohexane and methyl cyclohexane, and for the coal-base diesel fuel they were fluorine and phenanthrene. Both the octane number (ON) of the coal-based gasoline and the cetane number (CN) of the coal-based diesel were low, relative to commercial fuels ({approx} 60 ON for coal-based gasoline and {approx} 20 CN for coal-based diesel fuel). Therefore, the allowable range of blending levels was studied where the blend would achieve acceptable performance. However, in both cases of the coal-based fuels, their ignition characteristics may make them ideal fuels for advanced combustion strategies where lower ON and CN are desirable. Task 3 was designed to develop new approaches for producing ultra clean fuels and value-added chemicals from refinery streams involving coal {{as a part of the}} feedstock. It consisted of the following three parts: (1) desulfurization and denitrogenation which involves both new adsorption approach for selective removal of nitrogen and sulfur and new catalysts for more effective hydrotreating and the combination of adsorption denitrogenation with hydrodesulfurization; (2) saturation of two-ring aromatics that included new design of sulfur resistant noble-metal catalysts for hydrogenation of naphthalene and tetralin in middle distillate fuels, and (3) value-added chemicals from naphthalene and biphenyl, which aimed at developing value-added organic chemicals from refinery streams such as 2, 6 -dimethylnaphthalene and 4, 4 {prime}-dimethylbiphenyl as precursors to advanced polymer materials. Major advances were achieved in this project in designing the catalysts and sorbent materials, and in developing fundamental understanding. The objective of Task 4 was to evaluate the effect of introducing coal into an existing petroleum refinery on the fuel oil product, specifically trace element emissions. Activities performed to accomplish this objective included analyzing two petroleum-based commercial heavy fuel oils (i. e., No. 6 fuel oils) as baseline fuels and three co-processed fuel oils, characterizing the atomization performance of a No. 6 fuel oil, measuring the combustion performance and emissions of the five fuels, specifically major, minor, and trace elements when fired in a watertube boiler designed for natural gas/fuel oil, and determining the boiler performance when firing the five fuels. Two different co-processed fuel oils were tested: one that had been partially hydrotreated, and the other a product of fractionation before hydrotreating. Task 5 focused on examining refining methods that would utilize coal and produce thermally stable jet fuel, included delayed coking and solvent extraction. Delayed coking was done on blends of <b>decant</b> <b>oil</b> and coal, with the goal to produce a premium carbon product and liquid fuels. Coking was done on bench scale and large laboratory scale cokers. Two coals were examined for co-coking, using Pittsburgh seam coal and Marfork coal product. Reactions in the large, laboratory scaled coker were reproducible in yields of products and in quality of products. While the co-coke produced from both coals was of sponge coke quality, minerals left in the coke made it unacceptable for use as anode or graphite grade filler...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{design and}} {{operation}} of a custom-built thermogravimetric apparatus for the distillation of liquid fuels are reported. Using a sensitive balance with scale of 0. 001 g and ASTM distillation glassware, several petroleum and petroleum-derived samples have been analyzed by the thermogravimetric distillation method. When the ASTM distillation glassware {{is replaced by a}} micro-scale unit, sample size could be reduced from 100 g to 5 - 10 g. A computer program has been developed to transfer the data into a distillation plot, e. g. Weight Percent Distilled vs. Boiling Point. It also generates a report on the characteristic distillation parameters, such as, IBP (Initial Boiling Point), FBP (Final Boiling Point), and boiling point at 50 wt% distilled. Comparison of the boiling point distributions determined by TG (thermogravimetry) with those by SimDis GC (Simulated-Distillation Gas Chromatography) on two liquid fuel samples (i. e. a <b>decanted</b> <b>oil</b> and a filtered crude oil) are also discussed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effect of three different acids (sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid and nitric acid), on three different clay deposit samples, to recycle used lubricating oil. To achieve this objective, filtration of the used oil was carried out first to remove impurities like: sand, metal chip and other micro impurities using: Buncher funnel, filter papers and vacuum pump. The filtered oil was allowed to settle for twelve hours (12 hrs), before being centrifuged for another 20 mins at 10000 rpm so any particles in the oil can settle and be <b>decanted.</b> Next, the <b>oil</b> was preheated to degrade some additives, which helped to reduce the work load when acid was added. 100 ml of the preheated oil was measured and treated with 10 ml of various acids (Sulphuric acid, Nitric acid and hydrochloric acid) in varied strengths, and then allowed to stand for thirty minutes in a separating funnel before being allowed {{to pass through the}} bed of clay using a vacuum pump. Caustic Soda was then added to the extracted oil to help neutralize the acid in the oil. The resulting oil was slightly dark in colour. Tests carried out were: flash point, cloud point, pour point, viscosity index, sulphur content and water content. The result show that compared with the standard value of fresh lube oil, the resultant oil from the analysis compared favourably. An appreciable increase in the flash point, cloud point, viscosity index, and sulphur content of the oil was noted when compared to the fresh lube oil...|$|R

Istraživanje je imalo cilj definirati gospodarski i stambeni dio vile što je uspješno i napravljeno. U gospodarskom dijelu otkriven je dio uljare, a u stambenom manje terme. Institute of {{archaeology}} (Zagreb), CNRS Centre Camille Jullian (Aix–en–Provence), Universite Paris-Est (Marne-la Vallee) and Community of Selca continued with excavation of Novo Selo Bunje site (October 17 th– 28 th 2016). It presents {{the first phase}} of a 5 year project named Recherches sur l’exploitation economique de la Dalmatie a l’ epoque romaine (IIe s. av. J. -C. – IIe s. ap. J. -C.) In sector 5 we found small thermae with two construction phases. The excavated part belonged to the caldarium as we found a small basin and hypocaust. The find of multiple tubuli fragments in this room confirms the purpose of this room as caldarium. Slabs of marble and green porphyry (Carrara marble and Spartan basalt or Lapis Lacedaemonius) were found here too, testifying of luxury of the decoration in this villa. One of the rooms next to the caldarium could have served as latrinae during the first phase. Sector 5 belonged to the pars urbana of this villa. The sector 6 as presumed last year belonged to the pars rustica with trapetum. Excavation brought to light position of the trapetum in a space opened on the western side to the court. In the room next to it there was a basin for <b>oil</b> <b>decanting</b> covered with white mosaic and with central stone vessel on the bottom. Both parts of the villa were connected with one, southern wall, telling us that the building was planned and well organized...|$|R
40|$|Many {{years of}} {{research}} have been done on extraction of residue oil from palm oil solid wastes. Decanter cake is the solid waste produced from palm oil milling company after <b>decanting</b> the palm <b>oil</b> mill effluent, while spent bleaching clay is the solid waste from palm oil refinery. Basically, this wastes still contains 30 - 40 % of oil and this solid wastes are currently disposed directly in landfills without treatment, causing severe water and air pollution problems. Recovery of oil and the reuse of spent bleaching clay and decanter cake is the areas where great opportunity exists for cost saving in the oil processing industry. This study described the extraction of residual oils of spent bleaching earth (SBE) from palm oil refinery and also described the extraction of residue oil from palm oil milling industry. Here, two methods are used for comparison to extract the oil from decanter cake and also spent bleaching clay. There are soxhlet extraction method and also solvent decanting method. The comparison of two methods shows that soxhlet extraction can give higher yield. The optimum temperature and best duration of time to dry the decanter cake and spent bleaching clay also determined. In this case, the samples were dried at the temperatures 600 C- 1100 C, and the best temperature is 900 C. The optimum time was determined as 12 hours. Four different solvents were used to extract the residue oil from the waste samples. The results shows {{that the percentage of}} oil extracted from Methyl ethyl ketone and acetone was high compared to hexane and petroleum ether. The iodine value was also determined to compare the quality of the oil extracted. The range of iodine value obtained was 40 - 80. According to PORIM analysis mean value of crude oil is 51. 3. -Author...|$|R
