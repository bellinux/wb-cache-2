500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Badler had joined the cast of Neighbours as [...] "super-bitch" [...] Diana Marshall. Badler said that when she met with the writers, they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together. Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours executive producer, Susan Bower and when she tried to get her music featured on the show, she was asked to play Diana instead. Badler said that she still had to audition for the role, which she said was [...] "depressing" [...] as she hates auditioning. However, she said it was fun as the part was for a bad girl, which is the kind of role she enjoys playing. She added [...] "Now I'm happy that I had to earn the role; <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it was made for me." ...|$|E
500|$|In May2007, Usher {{split with}} Patton as his manager. This {{prompted}} [...] "gossip" [...] that Usher had [...] "fired" [...] {{her because of}} his growing relationship with Foster. He denied the claims, saying, [...] "I love my mother ... I decided not to fire, not get rid of, but to give [...] the ultimate complimentto retire {{her to be a}} full-time grandmother." [...] He continued by stating that the split was a mutual decision. It was speculated that Patton's dismissal was due to his engagement with Foster; Usher dismissed these claims on Total Request Live (TRL) in May2008. In what MTV News' Shawn Adler called an [...] "angry tirade", Usher stated, [...] "My wife {{had nothing to do with}} me firing my mother — nothing like that, that's trash. I hear y'all talking crazy out there. She's a beautiful black woman. Stop. Stop talking. And I love her. Stop it." [...] The outbreak was compared to Mariah Carey's unannounced 2001 appearance on TRL, when she handed out popsicles to the show's audience and performed a [...] "striptease", while some fans noted Usher's speech as evidence that Foster was being controlling of Usher. Usher hired Benny Medina as his new manager; Medina said of Usher, [...] "The thing that excited me most is the intense commitment to his art, his incredible professionalism and the fact that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> he's just hitting a stride." ...|$|E
2500|$|I gave a lot {{of support}} to Bahá'í people in the '80s and '90s … Bahá'í people, as people of all religions, is {{something}} I'm attracted to … I don't belong to any religion. … I have a huge religious faith or spiritual faith but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> religion … is the first thing that racketeers exploit. … But that doesn't turn me against religion … ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have {{no heart}} for it, Mildred, <b>I</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could work; and, if you cannot make me forget, I am sure I {{do not know}} what will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{dare say}} I shall marry some day. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> now <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{should like to}} break my neck, but I don't suppose I shall. Good-bye, Lady Staveley." ...|$|R
2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him. The {{librettist}} Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: [...] "Farinelli has surprised me so much that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I had hitherto heard {{only a small part}} of the human voice, and now have heard it all. He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...." [...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!" [...] and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth's [...] "A Rake's Progress" [...] (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series [...] "Marriage à la mode" [...] of 1745).|$|E
2500|$|In 1951, {{his family}} moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, when Isaac took a job as an {{assistant}} {{professor of medicine at the}} University of North Carolina School of Medicine. They built a house in the Morgan Creek area off the present Morgan Creek Road, which was sparsely populated. James would later say, [...] "Chapel Hill, the Piedmont, the outlying hills, were tranquil, rural, beautiful, but quiet. Thinking of the red soil, the seasons, the way things smelled down there, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> my experience of coming of age there was more a matter of landscape and climate than people." [...] James attended public primary school in Chapel Hill. Isaac's career prospered, but he was frequently away from home, on military service at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, or as part of Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica in 1955 and 1956. Isaac Taylor later rose to become dean of the UNC School of Medicine from 1964 to 1971. Beginning in 1953, the Taylors spent summers on Martha's Vineyard.|$|E
2500|$|Derek Martin {{said he was}} {{surprised}} by the new baby swap storyline when it was published in the media. Speaking on This Morning, Martin commented: [...] "I'm one of those actors – I don't know how many others do it – but when I get the scripts, I only read my bits. So I looked , 'Charlie leaves his grandson upstairs, goes downstairs, gets on the drink, gets drunk – the baby's dead'. So that's terrible guilt obviously – because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> it's my fault that he's died. I {{was surprised}} when I saw the story come out – because I don't read the others' [...] – that it was a baby swap." [...] Discussing the surrounding controversy of the plot, Martin added: [...] "Don't forget, there's millions of people – there's 60 odd million here, and they've all got different opinions. Every subject, everything that comes up… everybody will have opinions about that. So therefore you have to accept that's the public – some are for, some are against, and that's the way it is." [...] He continues: Over the years, don't forget, EastEnders have always had subjects. When [...] brother had raped Kat and we didn't find out until later on, that was a very strong storyline. And when Little Mo was bashed by her husband Trevor. These stories are all part of real life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, with {{a little}} gasp, [...] "I don't think I'm killed, though I felt quite sure of it at first. Now <b>I</b> only <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I'd been through an earthquake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps. I hope so, Godfrey, but {{at present}} <b>I</b> often <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} in nothing, except that I am I {{and you are}} you, and my father is--there he's calling me. Goodbye," [...] and she was gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Honora. [...] "I {{should want}} to go on and see {{everything}} in the world worth seeing. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> positively <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should die if I had to stay here in St. Louis." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. I need the rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hide that!" [...] he whispered, [...] "hide that, lest {{it should}} bewitch me. Indeed, already <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I were being bewitched. It is the Great Medicine itself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't be frightened," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have not}} been acquitted, but the {{execution}} has been stopped for the present, and I am out on bail. <b>I</b> really <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> the wound in my neck had healed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am hard sometimes," [...] Philippa confessed. [...] "You {{know that}} quite well. There {{are times when}} <b>I</b> just <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> had no heart at all, nor any sympathy; when every {{sensation}} I might have had seems shrivelled up inside me." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{seemed to}} me to answer this a bit reluctantly. [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> {{sometimes}} <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> little shining threads went out from me and those in the circle, and sometimes these threads meet and twine themselves around the cone or the pencil. This means that I draw power from all my sitters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O gin I {{could see}} a {{mountain}} top again, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I could lay me down and die content. What garred ye come daundering to these weary flats of France?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man will}} tell you what has happened. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I was [...] mad. I do not know who to send to. Will you come to me, only for [...] a few minutes? ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{the clear}} dark holds up unblemished. The only warning is the {{electric}} skin-tension (<b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I were a lace-maker's pillow) and an irritability which the gibbering of the General Communicator increases almost to hysteria.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want to get}} away. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{at moments}} <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> could bolt for it.... Silly, isn't it? Undisciplined." ...|$|R
40|$|I seem to {{have heard}} a lot about {{thresholds}} lately. In fact, <b>I</b> sometimes <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> am {{standing at the edge of}} an abyss.

6000|$|... "I {{know that}} there is none," [...] he continued. [...] "I feel, Mrs. Fenwick, that I do {{not know what to do}} with myself or how to hold myself. Of course it is {{nonsense}} to talk about dying, but <b>I</b> do <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> if <b>I</b> didn't die I should go crazy. I can't settle my mind to a single thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "I like it very much; {{it is so}} restful, and I sleep sound {{upon that}} cartel. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I should like to trek on {{for the rest of}} my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can’t {{tell you}} any more," [...] ses Miss Gill, [...] "and I wouldn’t ’ave {{told you that}} only you asked me, and somehow <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I ’ave to tell you things, when you want me to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a blessed}} soul," [...] {{he heard her}} mutter, [...] "and yet <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> that devil Billy was {{creeping}} about after me. Ugh! {{it must be the}} horrors. I can see the look he gave me now." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I feel {{from my own}} {{point of}} view that I don't like it. Whenever <b>I</b> play and <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> have done well, I don't know if I will play the next game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{understanding}} you are!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Do you know, although I {{love our}} dinners here, <b>I</b> sometimes <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> this room {{were a little}} cage, a little {{corner of the world}} across the threshold of which you had drawn a chalk line, so that no one of your world or mine might enter. The coming of Mr. Thain was almost like an earthquake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No ship!" [...] he repeated, {{and seemed}} to forget my denial forthwith. [...] "I suppose," [...] said he slowly, [...] "we're both dead. But the rummy part is <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> just <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> still had a body. Don't {{get used to it}} all at once, I suppose. The old shop was struck by lightning, I suppose. Jolly quick thing, Bellows--eigh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Parker, {{being an}} amateur botanist, {{was filled with}} delight of the {{thickening}} flowers. [...] "It is exactly {{as if we had}} begun in August and were moving backward towards spring. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> violets were near. It is positively enchanting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But (here again <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> preaching in the wilderness) {{it never}} occurs {{to you that}} there may exist some small {{difference}} between the wholly animal--ah--rumination of bovine minds and the discerning, well- apportioned leisure of the finer type of intellect?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frank, I wrote you {{a letter}} and {{described}} it all. How I got {{the courage to do}} it I do not know. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> I could not bring myself to say it now. I wonder whether you would have the courage." ...|$|E
6000|$|Privately <b>I</b> did not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were {{answered}} {{at all and}} I was sure that I know {{nothing of the kind}} she indicated, but thinking it best to leave the subject, I went on, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even then," [...] he answered, [...] "I {{doubt whether}} I still possess the {{capacity}} for happiness. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> at times <b>as</b> <b>though</b> what had gone before had frozen the blood in my veins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Algernon," [...] {{she said}} quietly, [...] "you know that I am not very scrupulous.
