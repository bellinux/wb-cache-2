60|$|No; {{the naval}} warfare {{of the future}} is for light, swift ships, almost {{recklessly}} not defensive and with splendid guns and gunners. They will hit hard and ram, and warfare which is taking to cover on land will abandon it at sea. And the captain, and the engineer, and the gunner will have to be all of the same sort of men: capable, headlong men, with brains and no ascertainable social position. They will differ from the officers of the British Navy {{in the fact that the}} whole male sex of the nation will have been ransacked to get them. The incredible stupidity that closes all but a menial position in the British Navy to the sons of those who cannot afford to pay a hundred a year for them for some years, necessarily brings the individual quality of the British naval officer below the highest possible, quite apart from the deficiencies that must exist on account of the badness of secondary education in England. The British naval officer and engineer are not made the best of, good as they are, indisputably they might be infinitely better both in quality and training. The smaller German navy, probably, has an ampler pick of men relatively, is far better educated, less confident, and more strenuous. But the abstract navy <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>writing</b> of will be superior to either of these, and like the American, in the absence of any distinction between officers and engineers. The officer will be an engineer.|$|E
40|$|I have in {{my thesis}} {{examined}} what a leisure pedagogue does in school. I have asked the questions how it is with interaction between leisure pedagogues and teachers according to policy documents {{and according to the}} interviews I did with three professionals. In the literature part I began by describing the historical background to the after-school and leisure pedagogue profession until the new teacher education in 2011 th.  My theory section, in previous research and theory, focuses on interaction between leisure pedagogue and teacher. In the research part I describe the interviews I did with three leisure pedagogue on three separate occasions. The results show that there are variations in the profession and that the interaction takes place if the teacher and the principal want. Also that reality is not as it is written in all policy documents. In my conclusion and discussion I talk about the leisure pedagogue’s competence, interaction and life skills for a discussion on how it looks according to the leisure pedagogues I interviewed, but also based on previous literature that I have also mentioned. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>writing</b> about the answer to my questions that I partly have been able to answer based on my investigation...|$|E

60|$|June 2.--This is {{the fourth}} day of a dark {{northeast}} storm, wind and rain. Day before yesterday <b>was</b> my birthday. <b>I</b> have now enter'd on my 60th year.

40|$|In February 2008, the Nebraska Supreme Court held in State v. Mata that Nebraska’s {{electrocution}} procedure {{violated the}} Nebraska constitution’s prohibition against {{cruel and unusual}} punishment. Mata left Nebraska in the curious position of having the death penalty on the books without a constitutional method of executing death sentences. In December 2008, Nebraska Attorney General Jon Bruning submitted {{a report to the}} Governor recommending that Nebraska adopt lethal injection as a new means to carry out a sentence of death. General Bruning’s report included LB 36, a proposed statute that would institute lethal injection in Nebraska. On January 29, 2009, the Judiciary Committee of the Nebraska legislature conducted hearings about LB 36 and LB 306, a competing bill that proposed repealing the death penalty in Nebraska and replacing it with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Several lawyers, doctors, professors, and other citizens (including former Nebraska Senator Ernie Chambers) testified on either or both bills. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> among the people who testified on LB 36 (the lethal injection bill). Specifically, I argued that LB 36 contained several provisions that would insulate Nebraska’s lethal injection procedure from democratic review and would therefore risk creating a flawed, dangerous procedure. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> attaching <b>here</b> my <b>written</b> testimony from that day...|$|R
5000|$|Jacobi, Hegel, and C.S. Lewis {{wrote about}} Christianity in {{accordance}} with their understanding but Kierkegaard didn't want to do that because he felt that it was too dangerous to put in writing what was most holy to himself. He said, [...] "Not even what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>writing</b> <b>here</b> <b>is</b> my innermost meaning. I cannot entrust myself to paper in that way, even though I see it in what is written. Think what could happen! The paper could disappear; there could be a fire where I live and I could live in uncertainty about whether it was burned or still existed; I could die and thus leave it behind me; I could lose my mind and my innermost being could be in alien hands; I could go blind {{and not be able to}} find it myself, not know whether I stood with it in my hands without asking someone else, not know whether he lied, whether he was reading what was written there or something else in order to sound me out." [...] Kierkegaard was of the opinion that faith is something different from other things, something unexplainable, and inexplicable. The more a person tries to explain personal faith to another the more entangled that person becomes in language and semantics but [...] "recollection" [...] is [...] "das Zugleich, the all-at-once," [...] that always brings him back to himself.|$|R

I had never seen the salmon run before, nor did <b>I</b> know it <b>was</b> in my backyard. For 16 years I lived in this city in two {{separate}} spans of my life. Only today did I take a walk along the Humber River and witness the salmon run, thanks to a chance encounter with our course administrator who taught me about this yearly ritual. It was a welcome distraction from the weight of anxiety about the exam <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> to <b>write</b> in less than 24 hours. I checked myself into the Old Mill for a quiet night’s sleep. My kids thought it was the most curious thing that their mom was studying. After all, I had already finished university and had a job. Why would I need to study? I spent the last few months trying to explain why I would voluntarily subject myself to hours of studying, missing precious hours at the pool or on the lake during family vacation time. Last year, I submitted my application to write the first Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC) General Internal Medicine (GIM) certification exam. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a true skeptic. I did not buy into the idea that GIM was unique from Internal Medicine (IM), so how could there be a valid exam distinguishing the two specialties? “You should write the exam, ” was the advice from my senior colleague in the upper echelons of our college. I perceived a conflict of interest. Or was it a warning that ultimately my career and billings would depend on having this new designation of General Internist to validate my credentials? No one knew. But I do know that I won’t do something “just because. ” Nor did I believe I would suddenly lose my job because I didn’t have the new certification. If I did not write and pass, however, I would have to order new business cards that reflected my new identity, dropping the “General ” from General Internist. However, if my family and friends are any indication, my patients are equally unaware of the distinction between IM and GIM, and so whether I woul...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> careful <b>here</b> to <b>write</b> [...] "for labour" [...] and not [...] "of Labour," [...] {{because it}} is entirely against {{the spirit of the}} Great State that any section of the people should be set aside as a class to do most of the monotonous, laborious, and uneventful things for the community. That is {{practically}} the present arrangement, and that, with a quickened sense of the need of breaking people in to such a life, is the ideal of the bureaucratic Servile State to which, in common with the Conservators, we are bitterly opposed. And <b>here</b> <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at my most difficult, most speculative, and most revolutionary point. We who look to the Great State as the present aim of human progress believe a state may solve its economic problem without any section whatever of the community being condemned to lifelong labour. And contemporary events, the phenomena of recent strikes, the phenomena of sabotage, carry out the suggestion that in a community where nearly everyone reads extensively travels about, sees the charm and variety in the lives of prosperous and leisurely people, no class is going to submit permanently to modern labour conditions without extreme resistance, even after the most elaborate Labour Conciliation schemes and social minima are established Things are altogether too stimulating to the imagination nowadays. Of all impossible social dreams that belief in tranquillised and submissive and virtuous Labour is the wildest of all. No sort of modern men will stand it. They will as a class do any vivid and disastrous thing rather than stand it. Even the illiterate peasant will only endure lifelong toil under the stimulus of private ownership and with the consolations of religion; and the typical modern worker has neither the one nor the other. For a time, indeed, for a generation or so even, a labour mass may be fooled or coerced, but in the end it will break out against its subjection, even if it breaks out to a general social catastrophe.|$|R
