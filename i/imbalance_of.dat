Schmittberger (1992) even reveals some workarounds to produce more balanced play without modifying the rules of gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Although {{selenium}} is {{an essential}} trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400µg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> brain metal {{homeostasis}} {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal imbalance. Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E
5|$|Since the 19th century, {{humans have}} {{impacted}} Banff's environment through introduction of non-native species, controls on other species, {{and development in}} the Bow Valley, among other human activities. Bison once lived in the valleys of Banff, but were hunted by indigenous people and the last bison were killed off in 1850s. In 2017 a small herd of sixteen plains Bison were reintroduced into an eastern section of the park. Elk are not indigenous to Banff, and were introduced in 1917 with 57 elk brought in from Yellowstone National Park. The introduction of elk to Banff, combined with controls on coyote and wolves by Parks Canada beginning in the 1930s, has caused <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> the ecosystem. Other species that have been displaced from the Bow Valley include grizzly bears, cougars, lynx, wolverine, otter, and moose. Beginning in 1985, gray wolves were recolonizing areas in the Bow Valley. However, the wolf population has struggled, with 32 wolf deaths along the Trans-Canada Highway between 1987 and 2000, leaving only 31 wolves in the area.|$|E

The hypothetico-deductive method allows us to investigate the causes of occurrence of disparities between the rates of development of the financial and real sectors of the Ukrainian economy. The method of analysis allows us to investigate the penetration rate of bank credit mechanisms in the past five years (2011 - 2015) in the processes of financing of the needs of the real sector for capital investments. Methodology. The survey is based on the theoretical analysis of the scientific literature in order to identify the causes <b>of</b> <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> movement of financial resources, the result of their influence on the pace of development of the real and financial sectors of the economy. The work displays the main approaches to the definition of the term of "financialization". Different points of view of scientists about the impact of financialization on investment processes and the flow of financial resources are grouped in this article. Also, there are presented visions of the major economic schools on the interaction of financial and real sectors of the economy. On the basis of special non-fiction the author of this research worked out the simplified scheme <b>of</b> <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> movement of financial resources in the economy. Also, in this article are studied the theoretical basis of bank investment lending, and is justified its role in managing the process of convergence of the financial and real sectors of the economy. Results of the survey showed that the cause <b>of</b> the <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> movement of financial resources is the processes of financialization. This process leads to distortion of the key role of the financial sector, which is to serve the real sector. Banking investment lending may be an effective mechanism for the convergence of the financial and the real sector. However, the result of analysis has shown that it does not work in modern conditions. Practical implications. The theoretical and practical analysis can be the basis for future research, especially with regards to the reasons of non-usage of banking investment lending as a tool of the control <b>of</b> <b>imbalances</b> <b>of</b> movement of financial resources in terms of prevailing financial sector relative to the real. Value/ originality. The results of the study make it possible to provide a better understanding of the role and practical importance of banking lending as a tool of investment in real sector, which is used by banks with the purpose to control the motions of financial resources...|$|R

However, there are 27 ex officio members of the district council (the Rural Committee Chairmen in the New Territories) as of the fifth District Council Assembly, and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in Hong Kong through the functional constituency. The <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of its inability to represent Hongkongers' socio-economic needs. In addition, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of Hong Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in Hong Kong, and led to the Umbrella Revolution. Plans to expand the voting population had begun to appear in the 2000s, and political figures liaised with the government to provide universal suffrage.|$|E

Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major <b>imbalance</b> <b>of</b> power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below).
