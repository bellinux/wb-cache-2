40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the analysis of}} the parameters of symmetrical <b>full-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> antenna based on multi – fed techniques. The current distributions were measured, followed by the measurement of parameters of antenna like gain, radiation patterns and input impedance. Based on these observations four equations for current distribution were eventually formulated. These equations were then used to compute the values of the same parameters of the antenna. Finally, the values of parameters obtained practically and theoretically were compared to analyse the validity of the developed equation...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{analysis}} of the current distribution of symmetrical <b>full-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> antenna based on double and triple feeding techniques; the current distributions were measured using a shielded loop protruding through a slit in the antenna surface along its axis, gives exact and accurate measurement rather than sinusoidal approximation. However, the sinusoidal distributions of current and voltage are approximations rather than exact descriptions.   Next the current distributions were modeled and formulated whose parameters were deduced from the measured current distribution by applying the current distribution data in models as derived by IEEE standar...|$|E
50|$|The {{transmitter}} operated at 90 MHz (3.3 m) {{and had a}} {{power of}} about 500 W. The pulse was 20-μs in width and the PRF was 50 Hz, synchronized with the power-line. The receiver was super-regenerative, using type 955 and 956 Acorn tubes in the front end and a 9-MHz IF amplifier. Separate, rotatable antennas with stacked pairs of <b>full-wave</b> <b>dipoles</b> were used for transmitting and receiving. The beams were about 30 degrees wide, but the azimuth of the reflected signal was determined more precisely by using a goniometer. Pulses were displayed on the CRT of a commercial oscilloscope.|$|R

Mathematical expressions for the radiation patterns are developed and calculations are made to predict the effect of feed points displacement on the radiation patterns of the centre fed half-wave and <b>full-wave</b> non-planar <b>dipole</b> antenna immersed in a weakly ionized warm plasma.

40|$|The {{approximate}} {{nature of}} radiative transfer equation (RTE) {{leads to a}} bunch of considerations on the effect of "dependent scattering" in random media, especially particulate media composed of discrete scatterers, in the last a few decades, which usually indicates those deviations RTE (combined with ISA) lead to from experimental and exact numerical results due to electromagnetic wave interference. Here we theoretically and numerically demonstrate the effect of dependent scattering on absorption in disordered media consisting of highly scattering scatterers. By making comparison between the independent scattering approximation-radiative transfer equation (ISA-RTE) and the <b>full-wave</b> coupled <b>dipole</b> method (CDM), we find that deviations between the two methods increase as scatterer density in the media increases. The discrepancy also grows with optical thickness. To quantitatively take dependent scattering effect into account, we develop a theoretical model using quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA) to derive dependent-scattering corrected radiative properties, based on the path-integral diagrammatic technique in multiple scattering theory. The model results in a more reasonable agreement with numerical simulations. The present work has profound implications for the coherent scattering physics in random media with absorption, correctly modeling light absorptance in random media and interpreting the experimental observations in various applications for random media such as solar energy concentration, micro/nanofluids, structural color generation, etc. Comment: 30 pages, 8 figures, submitte...|$|R
40|$|The {{terminal}} impedance of a <b>full-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> {{as a function}} of centre spacing has been measured for dipoles with the ratio of wave length to diameter (λ/D) equal to : 188, 94. 3, 75. 7, 62. 9, 47. 2, and 23. 6 for centre spacings (S/λ) of. 0212,. 0423,. 074, and. 105. All measurements were made at 1000 megacycles using a standing wave measuring method with the half dipole above an image plane. The variation of resistance and reactance of the {{terminal impedance}} with centre spacing is shown in a series of graphs. A considerable increase in anti-resonant resistance and in antenna length for anti-resonance is observed to occur with increased gap length. The results are shown to agree well with existing literature...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the analysis of}} antenna pattern and gain for different designs of <b>full-wave</b> <b>dipole</b> antenna feeding techniques. Seven such techniques were studied and analyzed; symmetrical dual feeding in phase, symmetrical dual feeding out of phase, asymmetrical dual feeding in phase, asymmetrical dual feeding out of phase, symmetrical triple feeding in phase and symmetrical triple feeding out of phase. Symmetrical dual feeding in phase produced high gain {{as compared to the}} single and center-fed antennas. An improvement of about 3 to 3. 5 dB was achieved comparing to center tap fed and off center fed. It was found that an asymmetrical dual feeding in-phase provides good performance, considering the directivity, pattern, and input impedance. A 2. 46 dB gain has been attained. It was found that a symmetrical triple feeding provides an overall best performance with respect to gain, radiation pattern, beam width and input impedance...|$|E
