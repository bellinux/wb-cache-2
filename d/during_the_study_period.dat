25|$|Cecil was {{the best-known}} {{animal in the}} {{national}} park and was identifiable by his black-fringed mane and a GPS tracking collar. The lions in the park, including Cecil, have been studied by scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit at the University of Oxford {{as part of a}} scientific project that has run since 1999, and his movements had been followed since 2008. Of the 62 lions tagged <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period,</b> 34 have died, thereof 24 through sport hunting. Of adult male lions that were tagged inside the park, 72% were killed through sport hunting on areas near the park.

500|$|Six {{areas were}} studied for wild pallid {{sturgeon}} population estimates and recovery recommendations by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) between 1990, when the species was declared endangered, and 2006. The USFWS {{has referred to}} these six areas of wild population studies as [...] "recovery priority management areas" [...] (RPMAs). In the northernmost region of the study, known as RPMA 1, located between the Marias River in Montana and the western reaches of Fort Peck Reservoir, only 45 wild (nonhatchery) individuals remain. Of these, no juveniles were observed and the population was declining. In RPMA 2, located between Fort Peck Dam, the headwaters of Lake Sakakawea, and the lower Yellowstone River up to {{the confluence of the}} Tongue River, Montana, only 136 wild specimens remain. In RPMA 3, stretching from upstream of the Niobrara River to Lewis and Clark Lake along the Missouri River, no native populations were recorded. All collected specimens appeared to be hatchery-raised. However, these specimens were apparently maturing and adjusting well to this section of the river. Recovery priority management area 4 extends from Gavins Point Dam to the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. This region also includes the Platte River. Here, at least 100 unique nonhatchery specimens were collected <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period.</b> Evidence also indicates some wild reproduction is going on in this region. In RPMA 5, between the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico, several hundred specimens were documented. Again, some evidence suggests natural reproduction is occurring, as demonstrated by the recovery of a few examples of immature, nonhatchery-raised individuals. The Atchafalaya River basin is designated as RPMA 6 and the findings there were similar to those in RPMAs 4 and 5, but with greater numbers of unique individuals, near 500 in total.|$|E

40|$|Agricultural {{management}} {{practices such as}} soil tillage may influence decay rates of dead biomass, leading to the changes of soil CO 2 emission. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) combined with unamended control (N 0) and addition of nitrogen fertilizers (N 1) on soil CO 2 emission from cropland <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>period</b> (April-December in 2012). Weekly CO 2 flux, soil temperature, and soil water content were monitored <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>period</b> in western Slovakia. Soil CO 2 emission generally did not differ between conventional tillage compared with reduced tillage for both nitrogen treatments. Daily soil CO 2 emission averaged 87. 2, 87. 1, 98. 2 and 102. 9 kg CO 2 ha- 1 day- 1 for CTN 0, RTN 0, CTN 1, and RTN 1, respectively. A significant correlation (p < 0. 05) between the CO 2 flux and soil temperature in conventionally and reduced tilled plots could lead to the easy conclusion that only the soil temperature (and not the soil moisture) was a controlling factor for fertilized and not fertilized plots, which wasn’t our case.
