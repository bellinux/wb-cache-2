40|$|Atom-field {{entanglement}} {{is shown}} to {{play a crucial role}} for the onset of spatial self-organization of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice within a high-Q cavity. Like particles on a seesaw, the atoms feel a different potential depending on their spatial distribution. The system possesses two stable configurations, where all atoms occupy either only even or only odd lattice sites. While for a classical cavity <b>field</b> <b>description</b> a distribution balanced between even and odd sites is a stationary equilibrium state at zero temperature, the possibility of atom-field entanglement in a quantum <b>field</b> <b>description</b> yields an instant simultaneous decay of the homogeneous atomic cloud into an entangled superposition of the two stable atomic patterns correlated with different cavity fields. This effect could be generic for a wide class of quantum phase transitions, whenever the quantum state can act back on the control parameter. Comment: 4 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} Fock {{quantization}} of scalar fields of Klein-Gordon type in nonstationary scenarios propagating in spacetimes with compact spatial sections, allowing for different <b>field</b> <b>descriptions</b> {{that are related}} by means of certain nonlocal linear canonical transformations that depend on time. More specifically, we consider transformations that do not mix eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which {{are supposed to be}} dynamically decoupled. In addition, we assume that the canonical transformations admit an asymptotic expansion for large eigenvalues (in norm) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator {{in the form of a}} series of half integer powers. Canonical transformations of this kind are found in the study of scalar perturbations in inflationary cosmologies, relating for instance the physical degrees of freedom of these perturbations after gauge fixing with gauge invariant canonical pairs of Bardeen quantities. We characterize all possible transformations of this type and show that, independently of the initial <b>field</b> <b>description,</b> the combined criterion of requiring (i) invariance of the vacuum under the spatial symmetries and (ii) a unitary implementation of the dynamics, leads to a unique equivalence class of Fock quantizations, all of them related by unitary transformations. This conclusion provides even further robustness to the validity of the proposed criterion, completing the results that have already appeared in the literature about the uniqueness of the Fock quantization under changes of <b>field</b> <b>description</b> when one permits exclusively local time dependent canonical transformations that scale the field configuration.

However, all of the instantaneous magnetospheric quantities considered in this study produced large correlation coefficients. Therefore, they all could be considered useful predictors of the net adiabatic energy gain of the ring current. Long integration times over the parameters lessen the significance of the correlation.

Despite lack of intrinsic phases, the interference phase can be inferred from the particle number registered at one detector by using the classical mean fields. If the conditional number distributions for the other detectors, given the outcome of the first detector, exhibit sufficiently narrow peaks around the values specified by the estimated phases, the mean <b>field</b> <b>description</b> is valid in a single run of interference. The widths in the conditional distribution are determined by the number statistics of the sources, among which notable scaling behavior is found depending on the detector configurations with the boundary at the Poissonian.
