He explained that while he did not miss playing, both he and Forsberg desired to help their former club out of financial troubles and a last-place standing in the league, facing potential relegation. The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund said he and Forsberg would play without salary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that he prefers to keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E

5|$|During the Second Fronde, between 1650 and 1653, Louis, the Prince of Condé, {{controlled}} much of Paris {{alongside the}} Parlement, while Broussel, through his son, continued {{to control the}} Bastille. In July 1652, {{the battle of the}} Faubourg St Antoine took place just outside the Bastille. Condé had sallied out of Paris to prevent the advance of the royalist forces under the command of Turenne. Condé's forces became trapped against the city walls and the Porte Saint-Antoine, which the Parlement refused to open; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> under increasingly heavy fire from the Royalist artillery and the situation looked bleak. In a famous incident, La Grande Mademoiselle, the daughter of Gaston, the Duke of Orléans, convinced her father to issue an order for the Parisian forces to act, before she then entered the Bastille and personally ensured that the commander turned the fortress's cannon on Turenne's army, causing significant casualties and enabling Condé's army's safe withdrawal. Later in 1652, Condé was finally forced to surrender Paris to the royalist forces in October, effectively bringing the Fronde to an end: the Bastille returned to royal control.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's 2012 season {{would be}} short-lived. With the Giants leading the Colorado Rockies 4–1 {{entering}} {{the bottom of}} the ninth inning on April 12, he made his second appearance of the season to get the save for the Giants. He walked in a run to make it 4–2, but retired Marco Scutaro with the bases loaded to earn the save. He injured his elbow during the game and underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career on April 19, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. During his injury shortened season, Wilson made only 2 appearances with an ERA of 9.00 and 1 save. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years. Wilson expressed confidence in an interview on April 15 that he would return to the Giants in 2013. However, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> off an injury and would be owed at least $6.8 million for 2013, he was non-tendered after the season, which made him a free agent for the first time in his career. As of the end of the 2012 season, he ranked third all-time in saves as a Giant with 171, behind only Robb Nen (206) and Rod Beck (199).|$|E

25|$|The year 1869 {{began with}} Livingstone finding himself {{extremely}} ill {{while in the}} jungle. He was saved by Arab traders who gave him medicines and carried him to an Arab outpost.

25|$|April 21 – Cornerback Darrelle Revis {{was traded}} by the Jets to the Buccaneers. The Jets {{received}} the Bucs' first round draft pick in 2013, the 13th overall selection (which the Jets {{used to select}} Sheldon Richardson) and a conditional pick which would become the Bucs' fourth-round selection in 2014, the 104th overall pick. Revis, a three time All-Pro, was widely considered {{to be among the}} league's top defensive players, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> off a knee injury and the Jets did not feel {{they would be able to}} retain him after the 2013 season.

25|$|The {{highlight}} of the season's seventh week was the return of Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning to Indianapolis to play the Colts. Manning had played for the Colts the first fourteen years of his career before he was released by the team in March 2012, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> off a serious neck injury which {{kept him out of}} the 2011 season. Manning was honored prior to the game in a 90-second video of the highlights of his years with the Colts. The Colts won the game 39–33 behind a four touchdown performance by Manning's replacement as the Colts starting quarterback, Andrew Luck. It was the Broncos' first loss on the season and broke a string of 19 consecutive regular season wins.|$|E

After the murder, his coworker told investigators that Bermúdez Zacarías saw two suspicious men on a motorcycle one day in his neighborhood when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> back home from work. Bermúdez Zacarías decided to turn around in his car and drive away. Minutes later, he arrived home escorted by a Metepec police car.

25|$|Dominic {{heads to}} Cuba {{and tries to}} kill Castro, but is {{prevented}} by Don Esteban Almeida (Sasha Roiz), who knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming.</b> Dominic manages to escape Cuba, but as his plane leaves, Roth arrives and ensures Almeida the assassination attempt will not interrupt their plans. Back in New York, Michael demands to know why Dominic and Fredo didn't turn to him after the Manganos tried to have them killed. Fredo reveals Roth was behind everything; it was all planned to get Dominic to Cuba to kill Castro so Roth and Almeida could align with Batista. Sick of being passed over and ignored, Fredo agreed to help Roth, who had promised him his own family. Disgusted, Michael disowns Fredo. Meanwhile, Michael is worried about Pentangeli's testimony, and has his brother, Vincenzo (Ralph Peduto) brought over from Sicily, hoping to shame Frank into not testifying. Dominic learns Roth has had Vincenzo kidnapped, but is able to rescue him in time for Pentangeli's testimony. Frank doesn't testify against Michael, and Geary dismisses the hearing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Mark Jones gave the Buccaneers {{the ball at}} their own 49-yard line on a 24-yard punt return. Tampa Bay's offense then went on a 7-play, 51-yard drive that ended with quarterback Chris Simms' two-yard {{touchdown}} run. In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay drove to the Redskins 19-yard line, but linebacker Lemar Marshall tackled fullback Mike Alstott for no gain on third down and 1, and then Simms threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Buccaneers defensive back Brian Kelly intercepted a pass from Mark Brunell on the Redskins' next drive and returned it to the Redskins 35-yard line. With three {{minutes left in the}} game, Tampa Bay wide receiver Edell Shepherd caught {{what appeared to be a}} 35-yard touchdown reception, but he lost control of the ball as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> down in the end zone for an incomplete pass. The Buccaneers got one last chance to tie the game when they received a punt at their own 46-yard line with 1:05 left in regulation, but Simms threw a pass that was tipped at the line of scrimmage and went into the arms of Marcus Washington for a game-ending interception.|$|E

25|$|Sakuraba {{was then}} {{scheduled}} {{to compete in}} Hero's Light Heavyweight Tournament. His first opponent was the 16–5 Lithuanian Kęstutis Smirnovas. Sakuraba opened the fight striking aggressively, even flooring Smirnovas with a kick, but as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> in to follow up he was caught and knocked down {{to his knees and}} hands. Kazushi then turned over, sliding beneath the bottom rope, and Smirnovas unleashed repeated blows to his head. As Sakuraba seemed at this point unable to defend himself, when the referee stepped between the two fighters it seemed likely he was moving {{to put an end to}} the contest. However, instead of halting the battle, the referee re-positioned the fighters from underneath the bottom rope into the ring and resumed the bout. Though the restarting of fighters who have found themselves near or outside the ropes is common practice, it was nonetheless controversial. Following the restart, Smirnovas picked up where he'd left off and proceed to pound a turtled Sakuraba, but the Japanese managed to escape to his feet and land a sharp combination, staggering Smirnovas and bloodying his face. Having turned the tide of the match, Sakuraba began dominating the Lithuanian on the striking segments until Smirnovas dropped to the ground to escape the assault. Sakuraba then accomplished an armbar, focing his opponent to give up.|$|E
25|$|To the west, Maréchal Bernadotte, {{in command}} of the Saxon IX Corps, was {{preparing}} his own assault, planning to attack the Austrians at Deutsch-Wagram from the west. This attack was delayed, as Bernadotte had to wait for the arrival of Zezschwitz's division, but at around 21:00 the Saxons moved towards the village. As Lecoq's Saxon brigade approached the position, they were instantly met with sustained musketry fire from the Austrian defenders, two battalions of infantry regiment 17 (Reuss-Plauen) and the 2nd Jäger regiment, but the Saxons pushed on and entered the village. Once they reached the vicinity of the village church, the Saxons were steadily met by the third battalion of infantry regiment 17 and the attack at once broke down, with the attackers forced to take shelter in the buildings nearby. Moments later, Zeschau's Saxon brigade, with Prince Maximilian's regiment attached to it, came in support, but these troops had been much disordered when crossing the Russbach, and upon entering the smoke filled streets of the village, they too lost impetus. With visibility much reduced by smoke, the situation at Deutsch-Wagram soon turned into chaos as all the troops inside spoke German and all, except the Austrian Jägers, wore white uniforms. There were thus several instances in which Saxon troops fired at each other and their situation took {{a turn for the worse}} towards 22:30, when Generalmajor Hartizsch brought fresh Saxon troops against the position. Hartizsch was not informed that friendly troops were already in the village and, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>coming</b> up for the attack, he saw a large number of white-coats moving out of the position. The commander at once ordered his men to fire and minutes of friendly fire and hand-to-hand combat ensued before it became obvious that these men were actually Saxons too. This fortuitous event had a significant impact on the attack, as the Saxons in the village now thought themselves surrounded and at once broke and retreated in disorder. The Saxon troops of the IX Corps were now completely demoralised and any attempts to rally and reform them at Aderklaa towards 23:00 failed.|$|E
