50|$|Lithography was {{discovered}} in 1797, at first used in printing paper images. An image is drawn with a greasy crayon on a smooth stone or zinc surface, which is then wetted. The water remains on the stone but is repelled by the grease. Ink is spread on and is repelled by the water but remains on the grease. Paper is than pressed onto the slab. It picks up the ink from the grease, thus reproducing the drawing. The process can be repeated to make many copies.A multicolored print could be made using different blocks for different colors.

Paper II is a structural study of the incorporation of 1 -(1 ', 3 '-O-anhydro-β-D-psicofuranosyl) thymine in the T 7 position of the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer. NMR constrained molecular dynamics and hydration studies show the base-base distortions caused {{by the introduction of}} a North-type locked sugar in an otherwise B-type DNA•DNA <b>duplex.</b> <b>Paper</b> III shows that the stacking distortion caused by the 1 -(1 ', 3 '-O-anhydro-β-D-psicofuranosyl) thymine building block perturbs the charge transfer similar to a DNA mismatch. Paper IV highlights how the sequence context affects the physico-chemical properties, monitored by the pKa of guanine itself as well as how the charge perturbation is experienced by the neighboring bases, in ssDNA and ssRNA. Paper V focuses on the differences between the structural equilibria of single-stranded ssDNA and ssRNA. Directional differences in single-stranded stacking between ssDNA and ssRNA are identified and provide a basis to explain directional differences in pKa modulation and dangling-end stabilization.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on ten {{publications}} (Papers I-X). The phosphodiester backbone makes DNA or RNA to behave as polyelectrolyte, the pentose sugar gives the flexibility, and the aglycones promote the self-assembly or the ligand-binding process. The hydrogen bonding, stacking, stereoelectronics and hydration are few of the important non-covalent forces dictating the self-assembly of DNA/RNA. The pH-dependent thermodynamics clearly show (Papers I and II) that a change of the electronic character of aglycone modulates the conformation of the sugar moiety by the tunable interplay of stereoelectronic anomeric and gauche effects, which are further transmitted to steer the sugar-phosphate backbone conformation in a cooperative manner. 3 '-anthraniloyl adenosine (a mimic of 3 '-teminal CC A OH of the aminoacyl-tRNAPhe) binds to EF-Tu*GTP in preference over 2 '-anthraniloyl adenosine, thereby showing (Paper III) that the 2 ’-endo sugar conformation is a more suitable mimic of the transition state geometry than the 3 ’-endo conformation in discriminating between correctly and incorrectly charged aminoacyl-tRNAPhe by EF-Tu during protein synthesis. The presence of 2 '-OH in RNA distinguishes it from DNA both functionally as well as structurally. This work (Paper IV) provides straightforward NMR {{evidence to show that}} the 2 '-OH is intramolecularly hydrogen bonded with the vicinal 3 '-oxygen, and the exposure of the 3 '-phosphate of the ribonucleotides to the bulk water determines the availability of the bound water around the vicinal 2 '-OH, which then can play various functional role through inter- or intramolecular interactions. The pH-dependent 1 H NMR study with nicotinamide derivatives demonstrates (Paper V) that the cascade of intramolecular cation (pyridinium) -π(phenyl) -CH(methyl) interaction in edge-to-face geometry is responsible for perturbing the pKa of the pyridine-nitrogen {{as well as for the}} modulation of the aromatic character of the neighboring phenyl moiety, which is also supported by the T 1 relaxation studies and ab initio calculations. It has been found (Papers VI-IX) that the variable intramolecular electrostatic interaction between electronically coupled nearest neighbor nucleobases (steered by their respective microenvironments) can modulate their respective pseudoaromatic characters. The net result of this pseudoaromatic cross-modulation is the creation of a unique set of aglycones in an oligo or polynucleotide, whose physico-chemical properties are completely dependent upon the propensity and geometry of the nearest neighbor interactions (extended genetic code). The propagation of the interplay of these electrostatic interactions across the hexameric ssDNA chain is considerably less favoured (effectively up to the fourth nucleobase) compared to that of the isosequential ssRNA (up to the sixth nucleobase). The dissection of the relative strength of basepairing and stacking in a duplex shows that stability of DNA-DNA duplex weakens over the corresponding RNA-RNA duplexes with the increasing content of A-T/U base pairs, while the strength of stacking of A-T rich DNA-DNA duplex increases in comparison with A-U rich sequence in RNA-RNA <b>duplexes</b> (<b>Paper</b> X) ...|$|R

A SC-FD transceiver is capable of transmitting and receiving on the same frequency at the same time, which will have a great impact on the design and performance of current wireless networks that are based on half <b>duplex</b> designs. This <b>paper</b> analyzes the effects of adopting SC-FD enabled base stations in a cellular system with legacy mobile stations.

To validate the performance using a realistic setting, we conduct extensive simulations for a multi-cell OFDMA system. Both sets of results show that a full-duplex design for a cellular system, while not quite doubling system capacity, does greatly increases capacity over traditional cellular systems. Our results show that the uplink, compared with the downlink, is more susceptible to the extra interference caused by using the same frequency in both directions. I...|$|R

40|$|Stainless steels were {{developed}} in the early 20 th century and are used where both the mechanical properties of steels and corrosion resistance are required. There is continuous research to allow stainless steel components to be produced in a more economical way and be used in more harsh environments. A necessary component in this effort is to correlate the service performance with the production processes. The central theme of this thesis is the mechanical grinding process.   This is commonly used for producing stainless steel components, and results in varied surface properties that will strongly affect their service life. The influence of grinding parameters including abrasive grit size, machine power and grinding lubricant were studied for 304 L austenitic stainless steel (Paper II) and 2304 <b>duplex</b> stainless steel (<b>Paper</b> I). Surface integrity was proved to vary significantly with different grinding parameters. Abrasive grit size {{was found to have}} the largest influence. Surface defects (deep grooves, smearing, adhesive/cold welding chips and indentations), a highly deformed surface layer up to a few microns in thickness and the generation of high level tensile residual stresses in the surface layer along the grinding direction were observed as the main types of damage when grinding stainless steels. A large degree of residual stress anisotropy is interpreted as being due to mechanical effects dominating over thermal effects. The effect of grinding on stress corrosion cracking behaviour of 304 L austenitic stainless steel in a chloride environment was also investigated (Paper III). Depending on the surface conditions, the actual loading by four-point bend was found to deviate from the calculated value using the formula according to ASTM G 39 by different amounts. Grinding-induced surface tensile residual stress was suggested as the main factor to cause micro-cracks initiation on the ground surfaces. Grinding along the loading direction was proved to increase the susceptibility to chloride-induced SCC, while grinding perpendicular to the loading direction improved SCC resistance. The knowledge obtained from this work can provide a reference for choosing appropriate grinding parameters when fabricating stainless steel components; and {{can also be used to}} help understanding the failure mechanism of ground stainless steel components during service.
