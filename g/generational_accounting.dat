50|$|Fiscal gap and <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> {{have their}} critics. Some {{commentators}} believe the government faces no intertemporal budget, {{which is the}} foundation of the fiscal gap and <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> frameworks. They believe the government can meet its obligations by either cutting taxes and raising spending to stimulate the economy by enough such that the endogeneous increase in taxes will more than pay for the initial loss in net revenues. Other critics believe <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> is based on specious arguments and a fundamental misunderstanding of government debt.

5000|$|<b>Generational</b> <b>accounting</b> is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the fiscal burdens facing today's and tomorrow's children. Laurence Kotlikoff's individual and co-authored work on the relativity of fiscal language demonstrates that conventional fiscal measures, including the government's deficit, are not well defined {{from the perspective of}} economic theory. Instead, their measurement reflects economically arbitrary fiscal labeling conventions. [...] "Economics labeling problem," [...] as Kotlikoff calls it, has led to gross misreadings of the fiscal positions of different countries, starting with the United States, which has a relatively small debt-to-GDP ratio, but is, arguably, in worse fiscal shape than any developed country. Kotlikoff's identification of economics labeling problem, beginning with his 1984 Deficit Delusion article in The Public Interest led him to push for <b>generational</b> <b>accounting,</b> a term he coined and that provides the title for his 1993 book, <b>Generational</b> <b>Accounting.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, in {{understanding}} this argument, {{it must also}} be considered, as Alan Auerbach, Jagadeesh Gokhale, and Laurence Kotlikoff do in [...] "Generational Accounting: A Meaningful Way to Evaluate Fiscal Policy", what the implications to optimal taxation are for future generations. They propose that <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> represents a new method for fiscal planning in the long-run, and that unlike the budget deficit, this <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> is not arbitrary. Instead, it is a remedy for how to approach the generation burden and effects of fiscal policy on a macroeconomic level. Ethically, it is a problem to have low taxes now, and therefore low revenue now, because it inevitably puts the burden of responsibility to pay for those expenditures on future generations. So through <b>generational</b> <b>accounting,</b> it is possible to analyze this and provide the necessary information for policy makers to change the policies needed to alter this trend. However, according to Auerbach, politicians are currently only relying on accounting and are not seeing the potential consequences that will ensue in future generations.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses <b>generational</b> <b>accounts</b> {{to analyse}} {{the long term}} {{sustainability}} of Belgian public finances. We derive age-profiles of detailed tax and expenditure categories from micro data and microsimulation models, and plug them into a long run demographic projection. We assess fiscal long term sustainability under current fiscal and budgetary policy for the base year 2010, and perform simulations of counterfactuals to determine the relative contribution {{of the most important}} factors of the long run unsustainability. This update of the <b>generational</b> <b>accounts</b> for Belgium shows that, not unexpectedly, the budgetary situation in Belgium violates the intertemporal budget constraint and hence is unsustainable in the long run. The current level of explicit debt, however, only plays a minor role in explaining this sustainability problem. Ageing and the related increase in age related expenditures are the main drivers of the long run fiscal imbalance and the high level of implicit debt. We disentangle the Belgian <b>generational</b> <b>accounts</b> into their regional components and show that the major explanation for regional differences in <b>generational</b> <b>accounts</b> is not divergent demographic projections, but the wide differences in socio-economic situations, as revealed by the region specific age-profiles. status: publishe...|$|R

Carrying out a simulation, we furthermore calculate the costs of implementing fairness into utility.

50|$|<b>Generational</b> <b>accounting</b> {{considers}} {{how much}} each adult generation, {{on a per}} person basis, is likely to pay in future taxes net of transfer payments, {{over the rest of}} their lives. Aggregating these remaining lifetime net tax payments of adults and subtracting them from the fiscal gap reveals how much today's and tomorrow's children must pay to resolve the country's fiscal gap in current adults don't pay more, on net. This residual burden facing today's and tomorrow's children is allocated to them in proportion to their projected levels of lifetime labor income. I.e., if each successive generation of children is expected to experience, on average, a 1 percent high level of lifetime earners, <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> allocates to successive generations net lifetime tax payments that are 1 percent higher.|$|E

With regard to transparency, <b>Generational</b> <b>Accounts</b> can, under sensible assumptions, provide a useful summary statistic to supplement our analysis of government policy. Interpreting differences in the accounts across groups as measures of the incidence or redistributiveness of existing or proposed policies is more problematic. With respect to UK pension reform, within-cohort differences raise important issues. Finally we argue that past pension reforms have been characterised by inaccurate forecasts as opposed to a lack of understanding of the generational incidence of proposed policy. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, the rise in educational attainment is not strong enough to restore the generational balance. Balancing the budget requires increasing taxes by 1. 2 % or reducing transfers by 2. 7 %.

50|$|A similar {{argument}} is that deficit spending today will require increased taxation in the future, thus burdening future generations. (See <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> for discussion.)

50|$|Wealth may be {{measured}} in nominal or real values, that is in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes. The assets include those that are tangible (land and capital) and financial (money, bonds, etc.). Measurable wealth typically excludes intangible or nonmarketable assets such as human capital and social capital. In economics, 'wealth' corresponds to the accounting term 'net worth'. But analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting (such as in national accounts). An example of the latter is <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> of social security systems to include the present value projected future outlays considered to be liabilities.

50|$|Two {{developments}} {{relevant to}} the national accounts since the 1980s include the following. <b>Generational</b> <b>accounting</b> is a method for measuring redistribution of lifetime tax burdens across generations from social insurance, including social security and social health insurance. It has been proposed as a better guide to the sustainability of a fiscal policy than budget deficits, which reflect only taxes minus spending in the current year. Environmental or green national accounting is the method of valuing environmental assets, which are usually not counted in measuring national wealth, {{in part due to}} the difficulty of valuing them. The method has been proposed as an alternative to an implied zero valuation of environmental assets and as a way of measuring the sustainability of welfare levels in the presence of environmental degradation.|$|E
50|$|Neither {{fiscal gap}} {{accounting}} nor <b>generational</b> <b>accounting</b> are perfect measures of fiscal sustainability. Neither suffers from economics severe labeling problem. But both raise the thorny {{issue of how}} to discount future taxes and transfers when they are uncertain. The Social Security Trustees Report, in Table IVB6, provides an infinite horizon fiscal gap analysis each year for the Social Security System by itself in which the actuaries use a 3 percent real discount rate. The size of the fiscal gap can {{be sensitive to the}} choice of the discount rate. But so is the size of the present value of future GDP against which it is compared. Hence, the ratio of the fiscal gap to the present value of GDP is much less sensitive to the choice of discount rate. It is this ratio that determines what adjustment is needed to eliminate the fiscal gap. In the U.S. case, the fiscal gap is now 12 percent of the present value of GDP, suggesting that an immediate and permanent fiscal adjustment equal to 12 percent of GDP would be required to eliminate the fiscal gap.|$|E
