5|$|Prabhu further {{asserts that}} Tipu's hatred of Christians was {{compounded}} by fears that as they shared the same faith as their European co-religionists, the Christians were viewed as a potential fifth column {{in the event of}} a British attack. To this, <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Tipu also had future territorial ambitions in Goa and wanted to rid himself of any potential dissent from the Christians within his domain. Therefore, according to Prabhu, through coerced confessions of prominent Mangalorean Catholics, Tipu fabricated evidence of a large-scale Christian conspiracy against him, even though he knew it wasn't true.|$|E
5|$|According to the 1993 book by Russian {{psychiatrist}} Mikhail Buyanov, {{the harm}} inflicted by Soviet punitive psychiatry {{on the image}} of domestic medicine is, of course, great, but bears no comparison to the crimes of the Nazi doctors. Now, when all the passions have cooled, one {{can say that the}} zeal of Soviet psychiatrists inflicted suffering on up to 100 or 120 people of all 280 million citizens of the former Soviet Union, Buyanov writes. <b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> among the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, сrammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E

Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> mankind would never stoop to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E

25|$|According to Mark R. Cohen, {{during the}} rise of Islam, the first {{encounters}} between Muslims and Jews resulted in friendship when the Jews of Medina gave Muhammad refuge.

25|$|Abrikosov {{distinguishes between}} {{ordinary}} metals, and transition metals where the inner shells are not filled.

Gray identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, nihonium, tin, lead, flerovium, bismuth, moscovium, and livermorium. <b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that,</b> 'in reality most of the metals that people think of as ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.|$|E
25|$|Olivier Blanchard {{suggests}} that a fiscal union in the EZ can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the EZ peripheral countries. But <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|E

25|$|Doyle is {{sometimes}} seen as downplaying {{the importance of}} Robinson's contribution to The Hound of the Baskervilles. The literary scholar and critic, Professor William Wallace Robson wrote that it is 'impossible to determine' the precise extent of Robinson's role, but in all probability he merely acted as a 'creative trigger'. <b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> once the element of Sherlock Holmes {{was added to the}} original idea, the novel evolved beyond the joint project that was originally posited. Robinson himself conceded that his part in the collaboration was restricted to that of an 'assistant plot producer'.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{praises the}} Spartans {{as the best}} {{people in the world}} not only because of their fierceness in battle but because of their wisdom and {{philosophical}} skills. This is contrary to the common belief that the Spartans lacked in these issues and devoted themselves exclusively to physical training but Socrates claims that they are masters at concealing their skills. While they appear to be unimpressive speakers, at just the right moment, they can provide pithy phrases of wisdom (342e). <b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> Laconic brevity was the earliest characteristic of philosophy (343b).|$|E

25|$|It is {{dated to}} the early 11th century, {{because that was the}} time when the ordeal by boiling water made its {{appearance}} in Scandinavia and the poet speaks of it as a practice of foreign origin. According to Henry Adams Bellows, the poem is based on material that came from northern Germany, where the ordeal by boiling water had long been current. <b>He</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> it has so little local colour that it was probably composed based on a story that the poet had heard from a German.|$|E
