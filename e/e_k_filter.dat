40|$|While we {{successfully}} isolated a certain filtrable agent by inoculation to guinea pigs of emulsion of choriocarcinoma, {{in order to}} elucidate {{as to whether or}} not this agent is choriotropic, we performed the neutralization or cross-neutralization test with serum of choriocarcinoma patients or with filtrable agent from stomach cancer. For the neutralizaion test of filtrable agent isolated from guinea pigs, to which the successive inoculation of emulsion of tumor tissue of choriocarcinoma had been performed, with serum of choriocarcinoma patients, the emulsion of the lungs and brains of the guinea pigs of the seventh generation after having passed through Seitz <b>E.</b> <b>K.</b> <b>filter</b> were employed. In regard to cross-neutralization with filtrable agent isolated from guinea pigs which were successively inoculated, those of sixteenth generation after having passed through the filter were employed. A anti-choriocarcinoma-agent serum of rabbits we first obtained 2 cc of supernate of emulsion made from lungs and brains of guinea pigs of the twelvth to nineteenth generation each after having passed through Seitz <b>E.</b> <b>K.</b> <b>filter,</b> and then we obtained the serum from 2 rabbits 14 days after the last injection which had follwed 8 times injections previously performed into the auricular veins of rabbits with 10 days intervals. The filtrable agent of stomach cancer was obtained after having passed the brains of guinea pigs as usual procedure. The anti-stomach cancer filtrable agent serum of rabbits were obtained from serum of rabbit which were repeatedly injected intravenously by the emulsion of rabbits of seventeenth generation as with the case of choriocarcinoma. The following results summarily were obtained. In the neutralization test of choriocarcinoma filtrable agent with serum of choriocarcinoma patients the agent was almost perfectly neutralized, showing the value of ID(50) > 10 (- 2. 0). The neutralization with serum of the normal women contrarily showed ID(50) = 10 (- 3. 75). The former revealed the remarkably high value of neutralization body. The crossneutralization test with the filtrable agent isolated from human stomach cancer as the control experiment disclosed that the neutralization test of choriocarcinoma filtrable agent with serum of normal rabbits showed ID(50) = 10 (- 5. 0), and that those with anti-stomach cancer filtrable agent serum of rabbit showed ID(50) = 10 (- 4. 0), and also that the neutralization test of choriocarcinoma filtrable agent by anti-choriocarcinoma filtrable agent serum of rabbit revealed ID(50) = 10 (- 2. 0). From the result shown above it is highly understandable that the value of the neutralization test of choriocarcinoma filtrable agent by anti-serum of rabbit for choriocarcinoma agent is more striking compared with those by 2 other kind of anti-serum. The neutralization test of stomach cancer filtrable agent by anti-stomach cancer serum of rabbit, furthermore, disclosed ID(50) = 10 (- 3. 45) and that by anti-choriocarcinoma agent serum of rabbit showed ID(50) = 10 (- 4. 25) and also that by serum of normal rabbit was ID(50) = 10 (4. 0) in value. Therefore, the establishment of the neutralization test apparently failed between the choriocarcinoma filtrable agent and stomach cancer agent. From the result shown above, we would like to conclude that the filtrable agent isolated from choriocarcinoma after passage through the brain of guinea pigs has the potentiality to neutralize and moreover is choriotropic in nature...|$|E
40|$|We {{sterilely}} homogenized the tumorous {{tissue of}} 3 choriocarcinomas confirmed by histological examination {{and made them}} emulsion by adding five times volumes of normal saline. After then it was centrifuged 3. 000 r. p. m. for 5 minutes and each of these supernate were inoculated to 2 healthy guinea pigs which then were killed 2 weeks later by blood-loss. We autopsized them to take out sterilely their brain which then were made into 10 % emulsion by adding normal saline. 0. 2 cc of these emulsion was inoculated to healthy guinea pigs which we called 2 nd generation. We successively incculated with same procedure. And also these guinea pigs were microscopically examined by H-E staining on their brains, lungs, livers and spleens. Regarding 1 st case and 3 rd case {{on the time of}} inoculation from fourth to fifth generation, and 2 nd case frcm 5 th to 6 th generation the passage through Seitz <b>E.</b> <b>K.</b> <b>filter</b> was performed. The inoculation was continuously performed up to 22 nd for 3 rd case. The histological changes in the organs of guinea pigs were mainely found as the hyperplasia of septal cells and hypertrophies of septum, resulting in frequent narrowing or disappearing of alveolar cavities. There were present the infiltrations of lymphocytes and monocytes in septum. Around the vessels and bronchioles the hyperplasia of mesenchymal cells was revealed. The pathological findings shown above were indentical with interstitial pneumonia what we call virus pneumonia. There were present the hyperplasia of spider cells and infiltrations of monocytes and lymphocytes around the bile duct as liver concerned. Spleen showed the hyperplasia of reticulocytes in red marrow. All three cases were revealed to have histological changes even after the passage through Seitz filter and mede it possible to continue the successive inoculation. There was, however, found in 1 st and 3 rd cases the tendency of gradual withdrawal of histological changes. 2 nd case, contrary to this, kept the almost same pictures after having passed through the filter. Using the brains of guinea pig proper for isolation of tumor filtrable agents and avoiding the infection from experimental room, we successfully isolated the filtrable agent from choriocarcinoma, and believe that this agent is choriotropic...|$|E

The (<b>Ed)</b> <b>K</b> values of the tested materials have a positive correlation to their biodegradation rates in the simulated soil environment, and they indicated the relative biodegradation rate of each material among all the tested materials.
