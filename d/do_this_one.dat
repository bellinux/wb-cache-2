She also claimed that [...] "Because of You" [...] was not the {{original}} song {{to be included in}} the album; it was another song that she recorded with Clarkson, titled [...] "A Lot Like You." [...] McEntire explained that it was Narvel, her husband, who convinced her to go back in the studio and record [...] "Because of You" [...] after he heard both McEntire and Clarkson rehearsing the song. She expressed, [...] "Narvel saw it. That wasn't one of the songs we had talked about recording – matter of fact, Kelly and I had already recorded a song, 'A Lot Like You,' for the duet project, and he said, 'You've got to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> together,' so we did." [...] Musically, the song is different from the original version. Thom Jhurek of Allmusic described the duet version as [...] "a big, overblown power ballad" [...] which incorporates [...] "guitars compressed to the breaking point, sweeping strings, and enormous crashing cymbals." [...] The use of violin was also incorporated into the duet, giving it a melodramatic quality that was deemed [...] "unnecessary" [...] by Nancy Dunham of Blogcritics. The song was officially sent to radio stations on May 15, 2007, as the lead single from the album. It was added to country radio playlists on May 28, 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Generally speaking, {{surface bonding}} is {{different}} from the bonding within the bulk of a material. [...] In order to accurately model and describe the surface characteristics and properties of a material, it is necessary to understand the specific bonding mechanisms at work at the surface. [...] To <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> <b>one</b> must employ a technique that is able to probe only the surface, we call such a technique [...] "surface-sensitive". [...] That is, the 'observing' particle (whether it be an electron, a neutron, or an atom) {{needs to be able to}} only 'see' (gather information from) the surface. [...] If the penetration depth of the incident particle is too deep into the sample, the information it carries out of the sample for detection will contain contributions not only from the surface, but also from the bulk material. [...] While there are several techniques that probe only the first few monolayers of a material, such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), helium atom scattering is unique in that it does not penetrate the surface of the sample at all! [...] In fact, the scattering 'turnaround' point of the helium atom is 3-4 Angstroms above the surface plane of atoms on the material. [...] Therefore, the information carried out in the scattered helium atom comes solely from the very surface of the sample.|$|E

2500|$|Noise is also {{generated}} by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation {{of the background}} surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so [...] "cold" [...] that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by kB T B, where T is temperature, B is bandwidth (post matched filter) and kB is Boltzmann's constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface {{it would appear that}} then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Plank spectrum) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.|$|E
