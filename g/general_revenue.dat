25|$|During {{the years}} before {{the changes in the}} state law related to the {{enactment}} of the federal PPACA, the state still used the free care pool—renamed the Health Safety Net—both as originally intended and to fund the subsidies for free (under 150% of FPL) and almost free (151–300% of FPL) networked health care insurance. In addition the state spent a substantial amount of <b>general</b> <b>revenue</b> on the insurance reform. Based on the combination of the increased Health Safety Net tax, <b>general</b> <b>revenue</b> (state income and sales taxes were increased 20%) and smaller additional taxes, the cost of the reform reached about 2% of the state's annual budget in fiscal year 2013, which ended June 30, 2013, up from 1.5% in fiscal 2011.|$|E

In essence, as indicated in Section  2, after fixing the tax on savings, any deficits of the unemployment benefit system would be covered through <b>general</b> <b>revenues.</b> This would imply budget reallocations between programs and spending categories that can have general equilibrium economic and welfare effects. Clearly, one would need to understand who are the winners and looser of such reallocations.

25|$|According to {{the second}} reading speech of the Health Insurance Bill 1973 {{delivered}} by Hayden (who had become Minister for Social Security) on 29 November 1973, {{the purpose of the}} new universal health insurance system, called Medibank, was to provide the 'most equitable and efficient means of providing health insurance coverage for all Australians'. There was opposition to the system from the Liberal-Country Party Coalition-controlled Senate. The Health Insurance Bill 1973 and the accompanying bills were rejected by the Senate on three occasions (12 December 1973, 2 April 1974 and 18 July 1974). The Medibank legislation was one of the bills which resulted in a double dissolution of Parliament on 11 April 1974, and was passed at a subsequent joint sitting of Parliament on 7 August 1974. The original Medibank scheme was to be financed by a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but the bills were rejected by the Senate, and so Medibank was originally funded from <b>general</b> <b>revenue.</b>|$|E

25|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{point out that}} Congress appropriates money {{directly}} to the D.C. government to help offset some of the city's costs. However, proponents of a tax-centric view against D.C. representation do not apply the same logic to the 32 states that received more money {{from the federal government}} in 2005 than they paid in taxes. Additionally, the federal government is exempt from paying city property taxes and the Congress prohibits the District from imposing a commuter tax on non-residents who work in the city. Limiting these revenue sources strains the local government's finances. Like the 50 states, D.C. receives federal grants for assistance programs such as Medicare, accounting for approximately 26% of the city's total revenue. Congress also appropriates money to the District's government to help offset some of the city's security costs; these funds totaled $38million in 2007, approximately 0.5% of the District's budget. In addition to those funds, the U.S. government provides other services. For example, the federal government operates the District's court system, which had a budget of $272million in 2008. Additionally, all federal law enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Park Police, have jurisdiction in the city and help provide security. In total, the federal government provided about 33% of the District's <b>general</b> <b>revenue.</b> On average, federal funds formed about 30% of the states' general revenues in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Due to the {{reduction}} in revenue generated from property tax, local governments have become more dependent on [...] sales taxes for <b>general</b> <b>revenue</b> funds, which some maintain {{has resulted in the}} “fiscalization of land use”. The fiscalization of land use means that land use decisions are influenced by the ability of a new development to generate revenue. Proposition 13 has created an incentive for local governments to attract new commercial developments such as big box retailers and car dealerships instead of residential housing developments. This is the result of commercial development's ability to generate revenue for the general fund through sales tax and business licenses tax. The jobs and ongoing sales tax those stores provide may discourage growth of other sectors and job types that may provide better opportunities for residents. Office and retail development are further incentivized because they do not cost the local governments as much as residential developments in terms of public services. Additionally, cities have decreased services and increased fees to compensate for the shortfall, with particularly high impact fees levied on developers building new houses or industrial outlets. Impact fees are a way to impose the cost of the additional services and infrastructure that new developments will require. These costs are typically shifted to the building's buyer, who may be unaware of the thousands in fees included with the building's cost.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, Smith {{outlined}} the proper expenses {{of the government}} in The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I. Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence and regulate banking. It was the role of the government to provide goods [...] "of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual" [...] such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: [...] "Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves [...] [...] [...] are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the <b>general</b> <b>revenue</b> of the state" [...] (Wealth of Nations, V.i.d.18). Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because [...] "we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge".

2500|$|There {{were two}} {{institutions}} of higher education: Haile Selassie I University in Addis Ababa, formed by imperial charter in 1961, and the private University of Asmara, founded by a Roman Catholic religious order based in Italy. The government expanded {{the public school system}} and in 1971 there were 1,300 primary and secondary schools and 13,000 teachers. But the system suffered from a shortage of qualified personnel, a lack of funds, and overcrowded facilities. Often financed with foreign aid, school construction usually proceeded faster than the training and certification of teachers. In addition, most schools were in the major towns. Crowded and understaffed, those schools in small towns and rural areas provided a poor education. The inadequacies of public education before the mid-1970s resulted partly from the school financing system. To finance primary education, the government levied a special tax on agricultural land. Local boards of education supervised the disbursement of tax receipts. The system's inequities fostered the expansion of primary education in wealthier regions rather than in poorer ones. Moreover, urban inhabitants, who did not have to pay the tax but who were predominantly represented in the schools, sent their children {{at the expense of the}} taxpaying rural landowners and poor peasants. The government attempted to rectify this imbalance in 1970 by imposing an education tax on urban landowners and a 2 percent tax on the personal income of urban residents. But the Ministry of Finance treated the funds collected as part of the <b>general</b> <b>revenue</b> and never spent the money for its intended purpose. [...] Expenditure on education was only 1.4 to 3 percent of the gross national product (GNP) between 1968 and 1974, compared with 2.5 to 6 percent for other African countries during the same period. Under the pressure of growing public dissatisfaction and mounting student activism in the university and secondary schools, the imperial government initiated a comprehensive study of the education system. Completed in July 1972, the Education Sector Review (ESR) recommended attaining universal primary education as quickly and inexpensively as possible, ruralizing the curricula through the inclusion of informal training, equalizing educational opportunities, and relating the entire system to the national development process.|$|E
