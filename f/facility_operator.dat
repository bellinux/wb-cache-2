2500|$|The {{measurements}} {{above are}} not fixed {{for a given}} storage facility. For example, deliverability depends on several factors including the amount of gas in the reservoir and the pressure etc. Generally, a storage facility’s deliverability rate varies directly with {{the total amount of}} gas in the reservoir. It is at its highest when the reservoir is full and declines as gas is withdrawn. The injection capacity of a storage facility is also variable and depends on factors similar to those that affect deliverability. The injection rate varies inversely with the total amount of gas in storage. It is at its highest when the reservoir is nearly empty and declines as more gas is injected. The storage <b>facility</b> <b>operator</b> may also change operational parameters. [...] This would allow, for example, the storage capacity maximum to be increased, the withdrawal of base gas during very high demand or reclassifying base gas to working gas if technological advances or engineering procedures allow.|$|E

The industrial <b>facility</b> <b>operator</b> would {{have no way of}} knowing the data has been compromised, until someone such as a security engineer recognized the attack was occurring.

In a resilient control system, as per Fig. 1, cyber and physical data is fused to recognize anomalous situations and warn the operator.|$|E
