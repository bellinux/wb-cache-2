50|$|The company rapidly {{developed}} {{a range of}} traction engines, steam rollers, ploughing engines, agricultural implements and stationary engines. One of their forgotten achievements is the invention (see British Patent 763 of 1880) of the traction-centre engine, for driving steam-powered fairground roundabouts. This is often wrongly attributed to Savage of King's Lynn. In the 1890s, McLaren {{developed a}} range of vertical triple-expansion engines for the new industry of electricity generation. The zenith of this effort {{was a pair of}} 3000 ihp engines for Leeds Corporation’s Whitehall Road Power Station. After the start of the 20th century, the company introduced a tractor for <b>direct</b> <b>haulage</b> and a range of powerful direct-ploughing engines. The largest of these, rated 125 ihp, was fitted with superheater, feedwater heater and fully lagged cylinders. This provided a very efficient engine, which won many awards both at home and abroad. Other minor products were, showmen's engines, crane engines, portable engines, railway locomotives and Darby Steam-Diggers.|$|E
40|$|The Mpumalanga cane growing {{region is}} characterised by {{harvesting}} groups using direct haul transport systems to the mills. A major drawback to infield loading and direct-haul is the resulting soil compaction and stool damage, {{which has been}} documented in sugar industries worldwide. Megatons (Pty) Ltd is a harvesting and transport group that was formed {{by a group of}} growers committed to long-term high quality cane yields with minimal infield damage. The group have opted for purpose-built, infield tractor/trailer combinations fitted with low pressure, high flotation tyres. The ability of the haulage equipment to minimise compaction and work in adverse infield conditions is an important consideration in a performance driven industry where growers are paid for delivering fresh cane in a contracted length of milling season. A comprehensive computer program manages harvesting and transport logistics. By combining an efficient logistics programme and purpose-built <b>direct</b> <b>haulage</b> equipment, Megatons is able to optimise machinery use and vehicle efficiencies, and minimise infield damage...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{comparison}} is made between <b>direct</b> road <b>haulage</b> and combined transport (inland navigation with oncarriage by truck) for {{the transport of}} containers from a seaport to the hinterland. The analysis {{is based on the}} concept of total logistics costs, a central concept in the theory of logistics. It is shown that the frequency of sailings between the seaport and the inland terminal is a key factor determining the competitiveness of combined transport vis-à-vis <b>direct</b> road <b>haulage.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|In many {{circumstances}} {{intermodal transport}} is not competitive to <b>direct</b> road <b>haulage.</b> Intermodal transport is often less cost-effective, more time-consuming and less reliable than road transport. The necessary handling {{and the initial}} and final road section in an intermodal transport chain {{play an important role}} in this respect. Cost savings and quality improvements in the handling systems at container terminals as well as in the initial and final road section are therefore vital instruments for enhancing the competitiveness of intermodal transport. The concept of 'integrated centres for the transshipment, storage, collection and distribution of goods', presented in this article, integrates these policy intruments. The integrated centre is characterized by the spatial and functional integration of container handling, storage plus businesses having intensive container transport. The key element of the centre is the centre's own internal transport system. This paper outlines where, and under what conditions, these integrated centres could be best developed. Finally, the possibilities for developing such a centre at the Rotterdam Maasvlakte area are more fully discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Malaysian ports’ {{container}} volumes {{are expected}} to increase to 36. 6 million TEUs in 2020 compare to 12 million TEUs in 2005. Almost 45 % of the container volumes are local containers entering the Malaysian hinterland. The hinterland container transport movements are dominated by road haulage (90 %), alongside road-rail intermodal that currently handles the remaining 10 %. The aim {{of this research is}} to develop possible strategies for improving the logistics of the intermodal hinterland container transport system based on customer demand, cost-efficiency, environmental impacts and quality. Intermodal began to capture more container volumes from ports, especially Port Klang, in 1989. This was initiated by the opening of Ipoh Cargo Terminal (ICT). Other inland terminals such as Padang Besar (Perlis), Nilai Inland Port (Negeri Sembilan), Segamat Inland Port (Johore) and three other ICDs have seen a good share of intermodal movements during that time. But for the past 10 years, the intermodal share has declined. The government is concerned with the congestion, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from road haulage and security issues. The Prime Minister has pledged that by the year 2020, Malaysia will reduce its CO 2 emissions by 40 % and it is believed that intermodal {{could be one of the}} solutions to achieve this. The need to shift from road haulage to road-rail intermodal has been mentioned in Industrial Master Plan 3 (2006) and the Logistics Road Map (2009) to alleviate these problems. Intermodal hinterland container transport is a trend in many European ports to solve road haulage problems. The current hinterland container transport in Malaysia showed that the share of intermodal in Malaysia is still low. Most of the inland terminals in Malaysia are underutilised. Based on a customer survey, the major issues for customers to shift to intermodal is not only cost but also service quality. The lack of strategic policies and effective institutional aspects also contributes to make intermodal services less attractive. The Port Klang-Ipoh Corridor has a huge potential to be the main intermodal corridor in Malaysia. The case study showed that this corridor has the container volume to support intermodal services. The case study indicated a cost saving of 51 % compared to <b>direct</b> road <b>haulage,</b> whereby CO 2 emissions would be reduced by 36 %. However, all the cost savings and reductions in CO 2 emissions are not viable if there is no implementation of the most effective strategies to promote intermodal movement. The strategies include 1) introducing the Intermodal Transport Department and new policies, 2) introducing specific intermodal services, 3) setting up the green corridor concept, 4) developing a reward system for actors in intermodal transportation, 5) collaboration and coordination issues and 6) quality of service monitoring. Implementations of these strategies is vital to enhance the intermodal share in the Malaysian environment. QC 20150116 </p...|$|R
