Lloyd Percival once called Kennedy the [...] "Billy the Kid" [...] of hockey. Derek Sanderson, considered the best at faceoffs in the late 60s and 70s, related how his father had him watch Kennedy on the TV to learn the skill. In a 1987 interview Kennedy told a reporter, [...] "I went all-out at face-offs. Your centre is your quarterback and our other guys knew exactly what I was trying to do." [...] In the 1970s, GM of the Leafs, Jim Gregory asked Kennedy if he would help the team to improve their face-off performance. Kennedy agreed but with one stipulation.

This extensive building is used during the milder {{months of the year}} for horticultural shows, concerts and miscellaneous gatherings. In the winter the doors of this place are thronged with a crowd of sleighs and sleigh drivers, while inside, skaters and spectators form a living, moving panorama, pleasant to look upon. The place is lighted by gas, and men and women, old and young, with a plentiful sprinkling of children, on skates, are practicing all sorts of gyrations. The ladies are prettily and appropriately dressed in skating costumes, {{and some of them are}} proficient in the art of skating. The spectators sit or stand on a raised lege around the ice parallelogram, while the skaters dart off, singly or in pairs, executing quadrilles, waltzes, curves, straight lines, letters, labyrinths, and every conceivable figure. Now and then some one comes to grief in the surging, moving throng; but is quickly on his or her feet again, the ice and water shaken off, and the zigzag resumed. Children skate; boys and girls; ladies and gentlemen, and even dignified military officers. Some skate well, some medium, some shockingly ill; but all skate, or essay to do so. It is the grand Montrealese pastime, and though the ice is sloppy, and the air chill and heavy with moisture, <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> good time.” ...|$|E
500|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} Angela Frandina, who was found strangled in her bed clutching a note reading, [...] "Ed did it", although it proves to be a false lead. Their investigation leads the detectives to discover Angela had several strange boyfriends and worked at an S fashion store and a phone sex hotline. The two detectives visit the Eastern Shores Marketing Phone Sex operation where they speak with the manager, Ed. [...] Ed tells them about a boyfriend of Angela's named Chris Novoselic (Dan Garrett) who used {{to spend time with}} her at an S club called 'The Eve of Destruction' on Fayette Street. [...] Pembleton and Bayliss go to the Eve of Destruction to question Novoselic. [...] During questioning, Bayliss gets angry and loses his cool with Novoselic slamming the leather-clad, multi-pierced freak against the wall telling him that if he doesn't start giving them some answers, he is gonna slap some cuffs on him, take him downtown and knock him around' whereby Novoselic responds by telling Bayliss, 'If you do that, I might have to kiss you!'. [...] Pembleton calms Bayliss and they leave. [...] While driving, Bayliss claims to be disgusted by the sexual taboos, but Pembleton insists <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> darker side and that until Bayliss recognizes his own, his virtues can never truly be tested. Pembleton and Bayliss return to the S fashion store and ask about leather belts with bead patterns matching the marks on Angela's neck. Store owner Tanya (Adrienne Shelly) tells them Angela's neighbor Jeremy (Scott Nielson) has a jacket with a matching belt. After an interrogation, Jeremy confesses to choking and accidentally killing Angela with the belt during quirky and violent (but consensual) sex. As a thank you for solving the case, Tanya brings Bayliss a leather jacket as gift, which he reluctantly accepts. That night, Bayliss visits Baltimore's red light district wearing the jacket, as a way to test himself as Pembleton suggested. He is approached by a prostitute but rejects her, thus passing the test.|$|E

2500|$|Lacey Burrows (Gabrielle Miller) {{took over}} the {{previously}} unnamed coffee shop in Dog River after her aunt's death and renamed it The Ruby in her honour. Originally from Toronto, Ontario, she is perpetually trying to fit into small-town life, with mixed, often disastrous, results. She is a terrible liar, quick to jump to conclusions, a poor winner, and thinks <b>everybody</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> crush on her, and frequently exhibits insecurity and regret about the path her life has taken. She has also expressed frustration at being unable to find [...] "a stable guy" [...] to date in Dog River. She considers herself a sweetheart and secretly believes that she alone of the town's women deserves the [...] "Woman of Distinction" [...] award (which she eventually wins).

It is implied that she and Brent Leroy have feelings for each other, although neither will admit or act upon them. In season five Karen describes Lacey as [...] "too upbeat, overly fastidious, a little needysame old Lacey!". Her fashion sense trends toward the revealing. This was mocked in the episode [...] "Doc Small", in which she welcomes to Dog River Dr. Chris Garner, a doctor from an even smaller town, and she's shocked by Lacey's [...] "slutty" [...] top, which is actually one of her more conservative tops. After the series' end she opened a second Ruby in Wullerton, but the local health inspectors quickly shut it down.
