It is {{the first}} space mission launched by China to investigate Earth's magnetosphere. It consists of two satellites: an <b>Equatorial</b> <b>satellite</b> (TC-1) and Polar satellite (TC-2). Double Star follows {{in the footsteps of}} ESA's Cluster mission by studying the effects of the Sun on the Earth's environment. After a nominal mission of one year (from the launch of TC-2 in July 2004), the Double Star mission was extended twice by both agencies till the end of September 2007.|$|E

40|$|Because {{atmospheric}} attenuation is greater for EHF frequencies than lower frequencies, {{it is necessary}} to design EHF satellite constellations so that the minimum elevation angles of the ground station antennas are larger than for satellite communication links using lower frequencies. The need for larger elevation angles reduces the coverage provided by geosynchronous <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellites.</b> This paper examines how the size of the polar regions not receiving adequate EHF coverage varies with the number of equally spaced <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellites.</b> The suitabilities of 24 hour Tundra, 12 hour Molniya, and six hour circular orbits for providing the missing coverage are then examined. The geographical location requirements for ground stations which link these satellites into global communication networks are analyzed. Three standard small satellite launch vehicles (SSLVs) can launch either three 12 hour Molniya satellites or six circular orbit satellites. While three Molniya satellites complete coverage of the northern hemisphere, six circular orbit satellites complete coverage of the entire globe. Finally, ground station location is shown to be critical for networking Molniya constellations, while circular orbit constellations offer the use of existing defense communication system architecture EHF terminals...|$|R
40|$|Description of {{a system}} which uses two {{synchronous}} <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellites.</b> Aircraft location is determined by measuring {{the range of the}} aircraft to each satellite as well as aircraft altitude, and transmitting this information periodically to a ground station. There, the aircraft's geographic position at the time of transmission is computed. This information is then combined with past position measurements in a suboptimal filter to determine aircraft position and velocity (the velocity being used to estimate aircraft position between transmissions). The suboptimal filter is a simplification of the optimal Kalman filter. Except for altitude information, the system is independent of the aircraft navigation system...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{existence}} of prograde <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellites</b> is consistent with a collisional tilting scenario for Uranus. In fact, if the planet was surrounded by a proto-satellite disk {{at the time of the}} tilting and a massive ring of material was temporarily placed inside the Roche radius of the planet by the collision, the proto-satellite disk would have started to precess incoherently around the equator of the planet, up to a distance greater than that of Oberon. Collisional damping would then have collapsed it into a thin equatorial disk, from which the satellites eventually formed. The fact that the orbits of the satellites are prograde requires Uranus to have had a non-negligible initial obliquity (comparable to that of Neptune) before it was finally tilted to 98 °...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{equilibrium}} positions of a synchronous <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellite</b> are situated in the directions of the extreme positions of the radius of the equatorial section of the synchronous, and not the Earth's geoid. It is further established that the motion of 13; a synchronous <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellite</b> is best explained {{on the basis of}} a much-more-than elliptically longitudinally heterogeneous shape of the curve of Earth's equator, and with the inclusion of more harmonics of the Earth's gravitational potential in the analysis. The accuracy and adequacy of the known geopotential constants, called for in the numerical determination of the locations of the equilibrium positions of the satellite, is examined 13; next. The paper concludes with a discussion of the stability of the satellite around an equilibrium position, subject to an orbital injection error from the uncertainty in the knowledge of exact location of the equilibrium position. It is found that the stable geostationary equilibrium position in the East, south of West Coast of India, above the Indian Ocean, is better suited for experiments towards exact determination of the locations of equilibrium positions of the satellite...|$|E

40|$|Abstract We analyze a {{conjunction}} event {{between the}} Van Allen Probes and the low-altitude Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite (POES) to quantify hiss-driven energetic electron precipitation. A physics-based technique based on quasi-linear diffusion theory {{is used to}} estimate the ratio of precipitated and trapped electron fluxes (R), which could be measured by the two-directional POES particle detectors, using wave and plasma parameters observed by the Van Allen Probes. The remarkable agreement between modeling and observations suggests that this technique is applicable for quantifying hiss-driven electron scattering near the bounce loss cone. More importantly, R in the 100 - 300 keV energy channel measured by multiple POES satellites over a broad L magnetic local time region can potentially provide the spatiotemporal evolution of global hiss wave intensity, which is essential in evaluating radiation belt electron dynamics, but cannot be obtained by in situ <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellites</b> alone.

Current primary limitations on this wide utilization are the availability of frequency and/or synchronous <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellite</b> positions {{and the cost of}} individual user Earth terminals. The former could be ameliorated through the reuse of frequencies, the use of higher frequency bands, and the reduction of antenna side lobes.

Fluxes of these ions are interpreted as oxygen ions and are found to maximize in the L shell range 3 - 3. 5 with peak equatorially mirroring flux of 0. 38 ions/(sq cm s sr keV).

The eastward electric fields reported correspond to vertical plasma drifts. The examples studied here are similar in signature and polarity to the pre-reversal electric field enhancements seen near sunset from ground-based radar systems. The morphology of these sunrise events, which are observed on about 14 % of the morning-side satellite passes, are studied as a function of local zonal velocity, magnetic activity, geographic longitude and altitude.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. In Part 1, four {{stages in the}} accretion of planetesimals are described. The initial stage is the condensation of dust particles from the gaseous solar nebula as it cools. These dust particles settle into a thin disk which is gravitationally unstable. A first generation of planetesimals, whose radii range up to 10 [ [...] . ] kilometer, form from the dust disk by direct gravitational collapse to solid densities on a time scale of order one year. The resulting disk, composed of first generation planetesimals, is still gravitationally unstable and the planetesimals are grouped into clusters containing approximately 10 [ [...] . ] members. The contraction of these clusters {{is controlled by the}} rate at which gas drag damps their internal rotational and random kinetic energies. On a time scale of a few thousand years, the clusters contract to form a second generation of planetesimals having radii of the order of a few kilometers. Further coalescence of planetesimals proceeds by collisions which seem capable of producing objects with a growth rate of 15 cm. yr[ [...] . ] at one A. U. The final stage of accretion during which planet-sized objects form is not considered here. In Part 2 of this thesis, an investigation of a dynamical problem which has considerable application to the solar system is undertaken. The evolution of the obliquity of an object is determined when under the influence of three phenomena: (1) the precession of the object's orbit plane, (2) the precession of the object's spin axis, and (3) tidal friction. 	In the absence of tidal friction, it is concluded that if the period for precession of the spin axis is much shorter than the orbit precession period, the obliquity of the object will remain very nearly constant in spite of the movement of the orbit normal. It is further concluded, that since the obliquity is not changed by the motion of the orbit plane, the decay of the obliquity towards zero by tidal friction is not significantly altered by this motion. These results are applied to Mercury, Venus, Iapetus, Triton, as well as the <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellites</b> of Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.

Second, a new concept for estimating the three angles which specify the orientation in space of a rigid body is presented.

Two examples are discussed: constant orientation in space, and constant rate of change of the three angles with time. Third, two synchronous <b>equatorial</b> orbit communication <b>satellite</b> designs which use sunlight pressure to control their attitude are analyzed.

40|$|In {{studying}} the _ geomagnetism {{it has always}} been a challenge to separate the external currents originating from the ionosphere and magnetosphere. While the internal magnetic field changes very slowly in time scales of years and more, the ionospheric and magnetospheric current systems driven by the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction are very dynamic. They are intimately controlled by the ionospheric electrodynamics and ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. Single spacecraft observations are not able to separate their spatial and temporal variations, and thus to accurately describe their configurations. To characterize and understand the external currents, satellite observations require both good spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper reviews our observations of the external currents from two recent Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite missions: Space Technology 5 (ST- 5), _ first three-satellite constellation mission in LEO polar orbit and Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS), an <b>equatorial</b> <b>satellite</b> developed by the US Air Force Research Laboratory.

The nightly television satellite weather picture, the intercontinental telecommunications of television transmissions and telephone conversations, and the establishrnent of educational programs in remote regions on Earth are constant reminders of the presence of these satellites. As used here, the term 'geo­ stationary' must be taken loosely because, in the long run, the satellites will not remain 'stationary' with respect to an Earth-fixed reference frame. This results from the fact that these satellites, as is true for all satellites, are incessantly subject to perturbations other than the central-body attraction of the Earth. Among the more predominant pertur­ bations are: the ellipticity of the Earth's equator, the Sun and Moon, and solar radiation pressure. Higher harmonics of the Earth's potential and tidal effects also influence satellite motion, but they are of second­ order when compared to the predominant perturbations. This volume deals with the theory of geostationary satellites. It consists of seven chapters. Chapter 1 provides a general discussion including a brief history of geostationary satellites and their practical applications. Chapter 2 describes the Earth's gravitational potential field and the methodology of solving the geostationary satellite problem. Chapter 3 treats the effect of Earth's equatorial ellipticity (triaxiality) on a geostationary satellite.

40|$|Observing {{artificial}} satellites is {{a relatively}} new and unique branch of astronomy that is very interesting and dynamic. One specific aspect of observing these objects is that although they appear amongst the celestial background, as deep-sky objects do, their apparent locations amongst this background depend on where you are standing on Earth at a given time. This effect is known as parallax. When a satellite is observed at a specific time from a specific location, the <b>satellite's</b> <b>equatorial</b> coordinates can be determined using astrometric means. Its range from the observer, however, is still unknown unless the observer knows the satellite's precise orbit elements or has easy access to a radar station. However, when two or more observers, separated by some distance, observe the same satellite at the same time, their observations can be used to determine the range of the satellite using the satellite's observed trigonometric parallax.
