5000|$|... ===Population I stars=== Population I, or metal-rich stars, {{are young}} stars {{with the highest}} {{metallicity}} out of all three populations. The Earth's Sun {{is an example of}} a metal-rich star. These are common in the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. Generally, the youngest <b>stars,</b> the extreme <b>Population</b> I, are found farther toward the center of a galaxy, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> I <b>stars</b> are farther out. The Sun is an <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> I <b>star.</b> <b>Population</b> I <b>stars</b> have regular elliptical orbits of the galactic centre, with a low relative velocity. It was hypothesized that the high metallicity of <b>Population</b> I <b>stars</b> makes them more likely to possess planetary systems than the other two populations, because planets, particularly terrestrial planets, are thought to be formed by the accretion of metals. However, observations of the Kepler data-set have found smaller planets around stars with a range of metallicities, while only larger, potential gas giant planets are concentrated around stars with relatively higher metallicity — a finding that has implications for theories of gas giant formation. Between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> I and the <b>Population</b> II <b>stars</b> comes the intermediary disc population.|$|R

The upper limits to the frequency of <b>intermediate</b> <b>population</b> <b>stars</b> are derived for the absolute visual magnitude range of 5 - 8.

50|$|Population II, or metal-poor stars, {{are those}} with {{relatively}} low metallicity which can have hundreds (e.g. BD +17° 3248) or thousands (e.g. Sneden's Star) times less metallicity than the Sun. These objects formed during {{an earlier time}} of the universe. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>population</b> II <b>stars</b> are common in the bulge {{near the center of}} the Milky Way, whereas <b>Population</b> II <b>stars</b> found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor.

40|$|The lambda Bootis (LB) {{stars are}} {{located at the}} upper main {{sequence}} of the H-R diagram and exhibit a peculiar abundance pattern. The light elements (C, N, O, and S) present solar abundances whereas all other elements are moderately to strongly underabundant. It {{has not yet been}} determined whether that abundance pattern is intrinsic, or is restricted to the stellar surface. If we follow the hypothesis that the LB stars are intrinsically metal-weak, then there should be a connection with the <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> II and F-weak objects. Such a possible affinity has not been previously investigated. We present detailed elemental abundances, including those of the light elements carbon and oxygen, for 38 bright <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> II and F-weak objects. In addition, we investigate the kinematic characteristics of the groups. From photometric, spectroscopic, and kinematic data, there is no distinction between the <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> II and F-weak type stars. We therefore conclude that the two groups are identical. However, it is possible to distinguish the LB <b>stars</b> from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> II <b>stars</b> on the basis of elemental abundances, though not in terms of their kinematics.

5000|$|... ===Population II stars=== Population II, or metal-poor stars, {{are those}} with {{relatively}} little metal. The {{idea of a}} relatively small amount must be kept in perspective as even metal-rich astronomical objects contain low percentages of any element other than hydrogen or helium; metals constitute only a tiny percentage of the overall chemical makeup of the universe, even 13.8 billion years after the Big Bang. However, metal-poor objects are even more primitive. These objects are formed during an earlier time of the universe. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Population</b> I <b>stars</b> are common in the bulge near the centre of our galaxy, whereas <b>Population</b> II <b>stars</b> found in the galactic halo are older and thus more metal-poor. Globular clusters also contain high numbers of <b>population</b> II <b>stars.</b> It is thought that <b>population</b> II <b>stars</b> created all the other elements in the periodic table, except the more unstable ones. An interesting characteristic of <b>Population</b> II <b>stars</b> is that despite their lower overall metallicity, they often have a higher ratio of alpha elements (O, Si, Ne, etc.) relative to Fe as compared to Population I stars; current theory suggests {{this is the result}} of Type II supernovae being more important contributors to the interstellar medium {{at the time of their}} formation, whereas Type Ia supernovae metal enrichment came later in the universe's evolution.|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper (Pel et al. 1988, Paper I) {{photoelectric}} photometry in the Walraven VBLUW system was presented for magnitude limited samples of F-G stars in three high latitude {{fields of the}} Basel halo survey. The stars were selected from the photographic RGU survey using the color criterion (G - R) < 1. 15, i. e. spectral types earlier than about G 7. The primary aim of this project is to study the stellar metallicity gradient perpendicular to the galactic plane for a kinematically unbiased in situ sample of main sequence turnoff stars in the disk-halo transition region, and to compare the observed metallicity distributions with multi-component Galaxy models. In this paper we interpret the VBLUW data for 112 stars in field SA 141 (South Galactic Pole). This sample is complete down to V = 14. 8 mag. Detailed reddening corrections are derived from the IRAS 100 mu map of SA 141. The mean reddening in this field appears to be very low: E(B - V) = 0. 007 mag; most program stars have color excesses below 0. 02 mag. Values of T-eff, log g and [Fe/H] are determined by means of new calibrations of the VBLUW colors of F-G stars. The photospheric parameters are combined with theoretical isochrones to determine absolute magnitudes, distances and (for the brightest stars) ages. Most observed metallicities {{are in the range}} - 1. 0 {{less than or equal to}} [Fe/H] less than or equal to 0, confirming that the Basel halo survey contains mostly <b>intermediate</b> <b>population</b> <b>stars.</b> Up to z = 900 pc a rather steep mean metallicity gradient in the z direction is found: - 0. 55 +/- 0. 1 dex/kpc. This tends to flatten out to - 0. 18 dex/kpc at z = 1 - 2 kpc. Including 160 additional fainter stars from the Basel survey for which (less accurate) [Fe/H] values can be estimated from the photographic RGU photometry, we determine an overall mean [Fe/H]-gradient for z < 4 kpc of - 0. 23 +/- 0. 04 dex/kpc. A comparison with multi-component models of the Galaxy shows that a simple disk-halo model does not fit the observed [Fe/H] distribution for SA 141. The agreement is very satisfactory, however, when a thick disk component is included, with ([Fe/H]) = - 0. 6 and sigma [Fe/H] = 0. 3 dex. No attempt is made yet to determine a ''best solution'' for the three-component fit to the SA 141 data; this will be done in combination with the data for two additional Basel fields, SA 94 and SA 107. The results for SA 141 are consistent with Sandage (1987) who proposed a local density normalization of 10 % and a vertical scale height of 1 kpc for the thick disk. The observed stellar number-distance distribution for SA 141 is in excellent agreement with the prediction by the three-component model. This is an important independent check on the reliability of our absolute magnitudes and photospheric parameters...|$|R

This <b>intermediate</b> <b>population</b> could account for up to 40 % of the entire cell population.

40|$|There {{are only}} a few ways to {{constrain}} the Era of Reionization and the properties of high redshift (z> 6) stars through observations. Here, we discuss one of these observables - the spectrum of the Near Infrared Background - and how it is potentially affected by the transition from Population III to <b>Population</b> II <b>stars.</b> The stronger Lyman-alpha emission expected from massive <b>Population</b> III <b>stars</b> could result in a 'bump' in the spectrum of the Near Infrared Background (referred to in this work as the Lyman-alpha bump). The strength and shape of this bump can reveal properties of <b>Population</b> III <b>stars.</b> The Lyman-alpha bump is predicted to be higher if <b>Population</b> III <b>stars</b> are more massive and present at lower redshifts. The shape of the bump is governed by the star formation rate and the time it takes <b>Population</b> III <b>stars</b> to transition to <b>Population</b> II <b>stars.</b> If <b>Population</b> III <b>stars</b> are indeed massive, a bump is predicted as long as <b>Population</b> III <b>stars</b> exist at z < 15, even if their star formation rate is as low as 10 ^- 7 M_sun yr^- 1 Mpc^- 3.
