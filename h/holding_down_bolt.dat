40|$|The <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>bolt</b> of {{the fans}} of an air cooler has failed by fatigue. Investigation showed that jamming of the link rod at the eye-end due to {{corrosion}} restricted {{the rotation of the}} link rod when the positioner acted to adjust the pitch of the blade. This has resulted in excessive stresses on the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>bolt</b> leading to failure by fatigue. The damages seen on other parts of the air cooler are secondary and subsequent to the failure of the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>bolt.</b> Use of stainless steel grade material for the construction of the linkages and periodic lubrication at the eye-end of the link rod are recommended to prevent the recurrence of similar failure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fatigue {{cracking}} {{reported in}} a lighting pole on an elevated bridge structure near Wellington {{raised the question of}} how to better design for and predict the fatigue life of lighting poles subject to wind induced fatigue. There have been concerns as to the reliability and currency of the methods commonly used in New Zealand. The paper therefore reviews current international design methods and describes the development of an improved fatigue design method for lighting poles in New Zealand. The new method uses fracture mechanics based crack growth formulations in conjunction with a modified J. D. Holmes Method for wind response analysis of the pole to varying wind speeds. Cumulative crack growth is calculated iteratively rather than using an S-N curve based Palmegran-Miner summation. Wind spectra used in the method are developed from long term meteorological records at representative locations. Software has been prepared to enable quick assessment of the expected fatigue life of lighting poles, and associated gear openings and <b>holding</b> <b>down</b> <b>bolts</b> The method and software has been calibrated with reference to full scale laboratory fatigue proof testing of representative base stubs and natural wind response testing of a 12 m high lighting pole...|$|R
25|$|On USS Atlanta, {{over 500}} {{high-speed}} cameras {{on the ship}} recorded {{the effects of the}} blast. During the tests, the ship was manned by a 169-man navy crew and 60 scientific personnel who remained below deck. In spite of the topside damage, the crew below deck experienced only a shock equivalent to a nine gun 16-inch salvo from an Iowa-class battleship. Had there been personnel in the superstructures, they would have been violently thrown about. Topside, the SPS-37 and SPS-10 antennas as well as the URD-4 radio direction finder were torn off by the blast, while other structures were severely deformed. The AN/SPG-51 Tartar guided missile radar was put out of operation for one hour. While the anti-submarine ASROC launcher and Mark 32 torpedo tubes were damaged, the rockets and Mark 44 and Mark 46 torpedoes inside were intact. The Mark 25 torpedo tube was severely damaged, aluminum casting cracked, <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>bolts</b> elongated, the insulating blanket destroyed and the muzzle door sprung, but surprisingly, the tube remained operational. The tripod mast carrying electronics gear was destroyed and fell to the deck. On the blast side, components of the hardened deck house sustained a permanent 2 inch deflection. The entire DLG 16 deck-house between two levels was blown in after welds were ruptured.|$|R

40|$|Small {{satellites}} create unique {{challenges in}} the design of deployment mechanisms and attachments to launch vehicles. The SAPPHIRE satellite, designed and built by students at Stanford University, is 35 pounds and is designed to be launched as a secondary payload on any of a variety of launch vehicles. The design of the interface and separation system is intended to optimize simplicity, size, weight, and cost. The SAPPHIRE design uses a single <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>bolt</b> with a single separation spring. Deployment is achieved {{through the use of a}} Frangibolt (TiNi Alloy Co.). This device utilizes properties of the shape memory alloy Nitinol which forcefully expands when heated in order to fracture a quarter inch Titanium bolt. The Frangibolt was used previously on the Clementine mission to the moon to deploy solar arrays but has not been proven yet to actually deploy a satellite. The power requirement of the Frangibolt (60 Watts minimum) is met through the use of a thermal battery designed for use with ejection seats. The interface between the satellite and the launch vehicle provides four attachment points to the rocket, supports the satellite and separation system components and isolates the satellite from high frequency vibrations during launch and ascent.

40|$|Källsner and Girhammar [1] have {{presented}} a new plastic design method for wood-framed shear walls at ultimate limit state. This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not anchored against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided by anchor bolts in the bottom rail and <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> at the leading stud. Anchor bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. <b>Hold</b> <b>downs</b> are directly connecting the vertical leading stud to the foundation. Sometimes <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> are not provided and only the bottom rail is anchored to the substrate. In this case the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the bottom rail (instead of the stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. In this report <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> have been experimentally studied {{with respect to the}} strength and stiffness of the connection. Four different types of <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> have been tested. The specimen was subjected to tension load applied to the stud. Four tests series are presented. Each series was divided into different sets according to the type of fastener used with the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> device. The results show that the failure load is higher when <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> with anchor <b>bolts</b> are used, up to ten times higher than the anchorage that uses only screws or nails. The failure mode vary with the type of <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> and the type of fasteners used. The tests showed three primary failure modes: failure of the stud when a bolt is used as the fastener between <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> device and stud, failure due to pull-out of the screws or nails from the rail and failure due to failure or pull-out of screws or nails from stud. Also, failure of the stud itself occurred in some tests caused by some defect of the timberGodkänd; 2012; 20120116 (giucap...|$|R
40|$|Källsner and Girhammar [1] have {{presented}} a new plastic design method for wood-framed shear walls at ultimate limit state. This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of shear walls partially anchored, where the leading stud is not fully anchored against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided from anchor <b>bolts</b> and <b>hold</b> <b>downs.</b> Anchor <b>bolts</b> provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. <b>Hold</b> <b>downs</b> are directly connected from the vertical end stud to the foundation. When <b>hold</b> <b>downs</b> are not provided, the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the bottom rail (instead of the vertical stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. Because of the eccentric load transfer, due to forces acting in the same vertical plane, transverse bending is created in the bottom rail and splitting often occurs. It is important to evaluate this cross-wise bending {{and to ensure that}} no brittle failure occur in the bottom rail. The bottom rail is experimentally studied with respect to two primary failure modes, splitting along the bottom of the bottom rail due to cross-wise bending and splitting along the edge side of the bottom rail due forces perpendicular to the grain from the sheathing-to-framing connections. The parameters varied are the size of the washer and the orientation of the pith. The bottom rail was subjected to loading perpendicular to grain through two-sided sheathing. In this report the different set of series are presented. Five sets were conducted {{depending on the size of}} the washer and in each set the pith was placed upwards and downwards. The tests showed three different failure modes. In addition to the failure modes that the testing program was aimed at, splitting along the bottom or side of the bottom rail, the final failure was also due to plastic bending and withdrawal of the sheathing-to-framing nails. The results show that the size of the washer has a significant influence on the maximum load and the failure modes. The results show also that the orientation of the pith have a significant influence on the maximum load. Godkänd; 2012; 20120116 (giucap...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{friction}} at {{the connection of}} the Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) aft skirt and the mobile launch platform (MLP) <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> posts was analyzed. A simplified model of the shuttle response during the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) buildup was constructed. The model included the effect of stick-slip friction for {{the rotation of the}} skirt about the spherical bearing. Current finite element models assume the joint is completely frictionless in rotation and therefore no moment is transferred between the skirt and the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> posts. The model was partially verified against test data and preliminary parameter studies were performed. The parameter studies indicated that the coefficient of friction strongly influenced the moment on the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> posts. The coefficient of friction had little effect on <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> post vertical loads, however. Further calibration of the model is necessary before the effect of friction on the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> post horizontal loads can be analyzed...|$|R
