40|$|The last 130 {{years of}} musical {{invention}} are punctuated with fascinating musical instruments {{that use the}} electromechanical actuation to turn various natural phenomena into sound and music. But this history is very sparse compared to analog and PC-based digital synthesis. The development of these <b>electromechanical</b> musical <b>instruments</b> presents a daunting array of technical challenges. Musical pioneers wishing to develop new <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> often {{spend most of their}} finite time and resources solving the same set of problems over and over. This difficulty inhibits the development of new <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> and often detracts from the quality of those that are completed. As a solution to this problem, I propose Nervebox - a platform of code and basic hardware that encapsulates generalized solutions to problems encountered repeatedly during the development of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments.</b> Upon its official release, I hope for Nervebox to help start a small revolution in electromechanical music, much like MAX/MSP and others have done for PC-based synthesis, and like the abstraction of basic concepts like oscillators and filters has done for analog electronic synthesis. Anyone building new <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> can start with much of their low-level work already done. This will enable them to focus more on composition and the instruments' various aesthetic dimensions. The system is written in Python, JavaScript and Verilog. It is free, generalized, and easily extensible. by Andrew Albert Cavatorta. Thesis (S. M.)

Laboratory sessions for measurement by using advanced technologies must be performed in the training activity. Two implemented tools are presented. In the first one a virtual instrument is implemented, {{it can be used}} in distance learning sections: the system includes <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> <b>for</b> {{a better understanding of the}} system operation. The last tool provides different features from the previous one; moreover, it can be realized as an electronic power meter, active and reactive, in a wide range of values.

50|$|EFIS {{installations}} vary greatly. A {{light aircraft}} might {{be equipped with}} one display unit that displays flight and navigation data. A large, commercial aircraft {{is likely to have}} six or more display units. Typical EFIS displays and controls can be seen at this B737 technical information web site. The equivalent <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> are also shown here.|$|R
50|$|At {{various stages}} of a flight, a pilot needs {{different}} combinations of data. Ideally, the avionics only show the data in use—but an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instrument</b> must be in view all the time. To improve display clarity, ADIs and HSIs use intricate mechanisms to remove superfluous indications temporarily—e.g., removing the glide slope scale when the pilot doesn't need it.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} era of glass cockpits—where designers merely copied {{the look and}} feel of conventional <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> onto cathode ray tubes—the new displays represent a true departure. They look and behave very similarly to other computers, with windows and data that can be manipulated with point-and-click devices. They also add terrain, approach charts, weather, vertical displays, and 3D navigation images.|$|R
50|$|A mirror {{galvanometer}} is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instrument</b> {{that indicates}} that it has sensed an electric current by deflecting a light beam with a mirror. The beam of light projected on a scale acts as a long massless pointer. In 1826, Johann Christian Poggendorff developed the mirror galvanometer for detecting electric currents. The apparatus {{is also known as}} a spot galvanometer after the spot of light produced in some models.|$|R
5000|$|A {{galvanometer}} is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> detecting {{and measuring}} electric current. The most common use of galvanometers was as analog measuring instruments, called ammeters, {{used to measure}} the direct current (flow of electric charge) through an electric circuit. A galvanometer works as an actuator, by producing a rotary deflection (of a [...] "pointer"), in response to electric current flowing through a coil in a constant magnetic field.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} commercial modular synthesizers were developed, in parallel, by R.A. Moog Co., and Buchla in 1963. Their designs {{drew from}} innovations by inventor Hugh Le Caine, particularly his implementation of control voltage {{in the electronic}} sackbut. The synthesizer both broadened the spectrum, and greatly eased the creation of electronic music, which before was made via tape splicing, use of primitive electronic oscillators, and earlier electronic or <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments</b> such as the theremin and the Ondes Martenot. ARP (in 1970), Serge (1974), and EMS (1969) versions were soon to follow.|$|R
50|$|Transporting {{the heavy}} Hammond organ, bass pedalboard (a B-3 organ, bench and pedalboard weighs 425 pounds/193 kg) and Leslie speaker {{cabinets}} to performance venues makes it cumbersome for artists to tour with a vintage electromechanical organ. As well, the Hammond, {{as with all}} vintage <b>electromechanical</b> <b>instruments,</b> faces the risk of technical problems with the tonewheels or electric motor, which {{may be difficult to}} resolve in a touring situation. As such, there was a strong demand amongst musicians for a way of recreating the Hammond sound in a more portable, reliable fashion.|$|R
