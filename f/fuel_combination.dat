By adding small nodules of paraffin into the HTPB fuel, a non-homogeneous mixture was created resulting in increased regression rates. The goal {{was to develop a}} fuel with a simplified single core geometry and a tailorable regression rate. The new fuel would benefit from the structural stability of HTPB yet not suffer from the large void fraction representative of typical HTPB core geometries. Regression rates were compared between traditional HTPB single core grains, 85 % HTPB mixed with 15 % (by weight) paraffin cores, 70 % HTPB mixed with 30 % paraffin cores, and plain paraffin single core grains.

40|$|In 2008 Oak Ridge National Laboratory began {{a series}} of {{experiments}} to evaluate the compatibility of fueling infrastructure materials with intermediate levels of ethanol-blended gasoline. Initially, the focus was elastomers, metals, and sealants, and the test fuels were Fuel C, CE 10 a, CE 17 a and CE 25 a. The results of these studies were published in 2010. Follow-on studies were performed with an emphasis on plastic (thermoplastic and thermoset) materials used in underground storage and dispenser systems. These materials were exposed to test fuels of Fuel C and CE 25 a. Upon completion of this effort, it was felt that additional compatibility data with higher ethanol blends was needed and another round of experimentation was performed on elastomers, metals, and plastics with CE 50 a and CE 85 a test fuels. Compatibility of polymers typically relates to the solubility of the solid polymer with a solvent. It can also mean susceptibility to chemical attack, but the polymers and test fuels evaluated in this study are not considered to be chemically reactive with each other. Solubility in polymers is typically assessed by measuring the volume swell of the polymer exposed to the solvent of interest. Elastomers are a class of polymers that are predominantly used as seals, and most o-ring and seal manufacturers provide compatibility tables of their products with various solvents including ethanol, toluene, and isooctane, which are components of aggressive oxygenated gasoline as described by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J 1681. These tables include a ranking based on the level of volume swell in the elastomer associated with exposure to a particular solvent. Swell is usually accompanied by a decrease in hardness (softening) that also affects performance. For seal applications, shrinkage of the elastomer upon drying is also a critical parameter since a contraction of volume can conceivably enable leakage to occur. Shrinkage is also indicative of the removal of one or more components of the elastomers (by the solvent). This extraction of additives can negatively change the properties of the elastomer, leading to reduced performance and durability. For a seal application, some level of volume swell is acceptable, since the expansion will serve to maintain a seal. However, the acceptable level of swell is dependent on the particular application of the elastomer product. It is known that excessive swell can lead to unacceptable extrusion of the elastomer beyond the sealed interface, where it becomes susceptible to damage. Also, since high swell is indicative of high solubility, there is a heightened potential for fluid to seep through the seal and into the environment. Plastics, on the other hand, are used primarily in structural applications, such as solid components, including piping and fluid containment. Volume change, especially in a rigid system, will create internal stresses that may negatively affect performance. In order to better understand and predict the compatibility for a given polymer type and fuel composition, an analysis based on Hansen solubility theory was performed for each plastic and elastomer material. From this study, the solubility distance was calculated for each polymer material and test <b>fuel</b> <b>combination.</b> Using the calculated solubility distance, the ethanol concentration associated with peak swell and overall extent of swell can be predicted for each polymer. The bulk of the material discussion centers on the plastic materials, and their compatibility with Fuel C, CE 25 a, CE 50 a, and CE 85 a. The next section of this paper focuses on the elastomer compatibility with the higher ethanol concentrations with comparison to results obtained previously for the lower ethanol levels. The elastomers were identical to those used in the earlier study. Hansen solubility theory is also applied to the elastomers to provide added interpretation of the results. The final section summarizes the performance of the metal coupons...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest in improving the efficiency and lowering the emissions from operating combustors, e. g. internal combustion (IC) engines and gas turbines. Different fuels, additives etc. are used in these combustors to try to find the optimal operating conditions and <b>fuel</b> <b>combination</b> which gives the best results. This process is ad-hoc and costly, and the expertise gained on one system cannot easily be transfered to other situations. To improve this process a more fundamental understanding of chemistry and physical processes is required. The fundamental constants like rate coefficients of elementary reactions are readily transferable enabling us to use results from one set of experiments or calculations in a different situation. In our group we have taken this approach and developed the software Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG), which generates chemical mechanism for oxidation and pyrolysis of a given fuel under a set of user-defined physical conditions. RMG uses group additivity values to generate thermochemistry of molecules and has a database of rate coefficients of elementary reactions. These two sets of data are used to generate chemical kinetic mechanism in a systematic manner. The reaction mechanisms generated by RMG are purely predictive and elementary rate coefficient from any reliable source can be added to RMG database {{to improve the quality of}} its predictions. The goal of my thesis was two fold, first to extend the capabilities and database of RMG and to release it as an open source software for the chemical kinetic community to use. (cont.) The second was to take a practical system of interest and use RMG to generate the chemical mechanism and thereby demonstrate the utility of RMG in generating predictive chemical mechanisms for practical situations. As a part of the second step our hope was to generate new chemical insights into soot formation processes which are of great interest. The three most important contributions of the thesis are listed below. 1. My work with RMG has resulted in order of magnitude improvements in the cpu and memory usage of RMG and it has added many useful features to RMG like ac- curate sensitivity analysis for better interpreting the final mechanism. I have also worked on extending the database of RMG, by adding thermochemistry of ringed species that cannot be treated adequately by group additivity. Also kinetic rate rules for intramolecular-H-migration reactions in OOQOOH molecules were added to RMG database, which are important in predicting the low temperature oxidation of alkanes. 2. Recently there have been considerable advances in the methodology for rate coefficient calculations for loose transition states, i. e transition states that are not saddle points. These type of transition states are encountered often in radical-radical reactions. In addition to these advances {{there has been}} significant progress in accurate calculation of the pressure dependent rate coefficients for complicated potential energy surfaces with multiple wells and multiple product channels. The method is based on the master equation formulation of the problem. These detailed equations are then appropriately coarse-grained to calculate the phenomenological rate coefficients. (cont.) I have used these state of the art techniques to calculate the rate coefficients for the formation of various aromatic species like benzene and styrene. The rate coefficients predicted by these methods were tested under certain conditions and are in good agreement with experimental data. 3. Finally to model a two-dimensional diffusion flame we have developed a solver that is able to solve a complicated set of highly coupled differential equations in an efficient manner to give accurate results. The solver in conjunction with chemistry that is developed using techniques mentioned in the last two points is used to solve the mole fraction profiles in the diffusion flame. The results of the simulations are compared to the experimental measurements and this process gives us insight into soot formation in diffusion flames. by Sandeep Sharma. Thesis (Ph. D.)
