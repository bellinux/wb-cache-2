5|$|When {{it came to}} biography, Johnson {{disagreed}} with Plutarch's use of biography to praise and to teach morality. Instead, Johnson believed in portraying the biographical subjects accurately and including any negative aspects of their lives. Because his insistence on accuracy in biography was little short of revolutionary, Johnson had to struggle against a society that was unwilling to accept biographical details that {{could be viewed as}} tarnishing a reputation; this became the subject of Rambler 60. Furthermore, Johnson believed that biography should not be limited to the most famous and that the lives of lesser individuals, too, were significant; thus in his Lives of the Poets he chose both great and lesser poets. In all his biographies he insisted on including what others would have considered trivial details to <b>fully</b> <b>describe</b> the lives of his subjects. Johnson considered the genre of autobiography and diaries, including his own, as one having the most significance; in Idler 84 he explains how a writer of an autobiography would be the least likely to distort his own life.|$|E

500|$|Flower {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. Alice Liang of 1UP.com applauded the game, saying that [...] "the {{freedom of movement}} makes the game feel as relaxing as a gently wafting breeze". She felt that [...] "fun" [...] did not <b>fully</b> <b>describe</b> the game experience, saying {{that it had a}} [...] "well-constructed movie's emotional arc" [...] and that the game's music, visuals, and gameplay all drew the player into a compelling emotional experience. She also felt that it was very replayable, which offset its brevity. Ryan Clements of IGN agreed with Liang's opinion, saying that it provided [...] "more enjoyment, emotion and enlightenment than any game" [...] he had played in years. Though he noted that the game would not appeal to everyone, he described it as [...] "something very unique and very powerful", referring to it as a [...] "must-play". Michael Kontoudis of PALGN called it an [...] "utterly unique, brave and moving game brimming with personality and intent", though he noted that as it was closer to a work of art than a game, many players would not be interested in it. Gerard Campbell of The Press similarly described it as something more than a game, calling it a [...] "perfect foil" [...] to [...] "ultra-violent shoot-'em-up" [...] games and summarizing it as [...] "one of the most refreshing and relaxing games around".|$|E

2500|$|Wave–particle duality is {{the concept}} in quantum {{mechanics}} [...] that every particle or quantic entity may be partly described in terms not only of particles, but also of waves.

2500|$|The {{moment of}} inertia about an axis of a body is {{calculated}} by summing [...] for every particle in the body, where [...] is the perpendicular distance to the specified axis.

2500|$|The Young's modulus {{enables the}} {{calculation}} {{of the change in}} the dimension of a bar made of an isotropic elastic material under tensile or compressive loads. [...] For instance, it predicts how much a material sample extends under tension or shortens under compression. The Young's modulus directly applies to cases of uniaxial stress, that is tensile or compressive stress in one direction and no stress in the other directions. Young's modulus is also used in order to predict the deflection that will occur in a statically determinate beam when a load is applied at a point in between the beam's supports. Other elastic calculations usually require the use of one additional elastic property, such as the shear modulus, bulk modulus or Poisson's ratio. Any two of these parameters are sufficient to <b>fully</b> <b>describe</b> elasticity in an isotropic material.|$|E
2500|$|The fur {{trade and}} its actors {{has played a}} certain role in films and popular culture. It was the topic of various books and films, from James Fenimore Cooper via Irving Pichels Hudson's Bay of 1941, the popular Canadian musical My Fur Lady (music by Galt MacDermot) of 1957, till Nicolas Vaniers documentaries. However, in {{contrast}} to [...] "the huddy buddy narration of Canada as Hudson's country", propagated either in popular culture as well in elitist circles as the Beaver Club, founded 1785 in Montreal the often male-centered scholarly description of the fur business does not <b>fully</b> <b>describe</b> the history.

The posts of this bed were richly carved, and the top of each was ornamented with an imposing ball. The whole was tastefully draped with red damask so dark with age as to be almost black. Altogether this piece of furniture was so grand that words cannot <b>fully</b> <b>describe</b> it, and it stood so high on its carved legs that Mrs Gaff and Tottie were obliged to climb into it each night by a flight of three steps, which were richly carpeted, and which folded into a square box, which was extremely convenient as a seat or ottoman during the day, and quite in keeping with the rest of the furniture of the [...] "boodwar." ...|$|E
60|$|But, {{to return}} to our Observation.

And how infinitely smaller then must be the Vessels of a Mite, or the pores of one of those little Vegetables I have discovered to grow on the back-side of a Rose-leaf, and shall anon more <b>fully</b> <b>describe,</b> whose bulk is many millions of times less then the bulk of the small shrub it grows on; and even that shrub, many millions of times less in bulk then several trees (that have heretofore grown in England, and are this day flourishing in other hotter Climates, as we are very credibly inform'd) if at least the pores of this small Vegetable should keep any such proportion to the body of it, as we have found these pores of other Vegetables to do to their bulk.
