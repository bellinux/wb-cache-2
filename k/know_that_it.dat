5|$|The {{provenance}} of {{the manuscript}} before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in van Vliet's collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by Franciscus Junius, from whose library {{it came to the}} Bodleian as part of the Junius donation (Holt 1878, pp. liv–lvi).|$|E
5|$|Two Israeli sappers {{were sent}} to mine {{the area of the}} {{quarantine}} station, but did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was already under Syrian control. Their vehicle was blown up, but they managed to escape alive. On the same day, the Syrian company that attacked the water station from Tel ad-Dweir proceeded towards Sha'ar HaGolan and Masada. Its advance was halted by the village residents as well as a platoon of reinforcements armed with 20 mm cannons. The company retreated to its position and commenced artillery fire on the two kibbutzim.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the last}} members were signing it Doctor. Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which a rising sun {{happened}} to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun. I have said he, often and often {{in the course of the}} Session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that behind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting: But now at length I have the happiness to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a rising and not a setting Sun.|$|E

5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E
5|$|The Countess sends Sandor {{to fetch}} her {{a model to}} paint; he returns with Lili (Nan Grey). Countess Zaleska {{initially}} resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. The Countess gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth him to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.|$|E

On enquiry, he came <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not uncommon to kill girls {{in such a manner}} in kulin (orthodox upper caste) Brahmin families. He was so shocked that he vowed not to go in for polygamous marriage, a system in vogue in orthodox upper caste society in those days.|$|E
25|$|Abraham Stenbock {{was forced}} to sign an incriminating letter to Josua Genewitz, which was later {{presented}} as evidence. From the diary of Erik XIV, {{it is known that}} Abraham Stenbock and Ivar Ivarsson were sentenced to death right away, and that on 14 May the court let Erik <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was willing to also sentence Svante Sture to death. According to Peterson, Erik Sture was sentenced to death, too. All prisoners were then sent to Uppsala Castle for further investigation.|$|E
25|$|Vibrissae aid {{sensation}} and navigation. The upper {{two rows}} of whiskers are able to be moved independently from the lower two rows for greater precision during measurement. A cat's whiskers are {{more than twice as}} thick as ordinary cat hairs, and their roots are three times deeper in a cat's tissue than other hairs. They have numerous nerve endings at their base, which give cats extraordinarily detailed information about nearby air movements and objects with which they make physical contact. They enable a cat to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is near obstacles without it needing to see them.|$|E

The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, to whom it naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; until we are told the heaviness of the body we do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
25|$|The {{boat was}} located and {{excavated}} at Hasholme, {{on the north}} bank of the River Foulness in the broad river channel. The boat was situated in mostly waterlogged clay (silty-clay, silt, and sand) deposits, which greatly helped {{the preservation of the}} timbers. Apart from the boat itself, the excavations did not produce any major associated artifacts, {{with the exception of a}} single pottery shard. For dating purposes two techniques, tree-ring dating and radiocarbon 14C/thermoluminescence, were employed. Both methods gave rather comparable results of some time between 750 and 390 BC, which approximately correlates with the later European Iron Age. Based on reconstruction of the landscape around the site, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was dominated by mixed oak, birch, and alder woodland, with some meadows and marshes, as well as many river tributaries and oxbow lakes.|$|E

25|$|Like {{others before}} and after him, he also noticed that the Moon has a {{noticeable}} parallax, i.e., that it appears displaced from its calculated position (compared to the Sun or stars), and the difference is greater when closer to the horizon. He knew that this is because in the then-current models the Moon circles {{the center of the}} Earth, but the observer is at the surface—the Moon, Earth and observer form a triangle with a sharp angle that changes all the time. From the size of this parallax, the distance of the Moon as measured in Earth radii can be determined. For the Sun however, there was no observable parallax (we now <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is about 8.8", several times smaller than the resolution of the unaided eye).|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of war with}} Prussia on 15 July 1870 led to a chaotic mobilization of the French Army. The mitrailleuse batteries faced particularly acute problems. Although on paper they had been organized into proper batteries, at the {{outbreak of}} war the guns were still in storage at Meudon and in the forts of Montrouge, Issy, and Mont-Valerien around Paris. The crews had been designated but {{had not yet been}} assembled. Many had little or no training {{in the use of the}} weapons and so were unaware of its sighting and ranging characteristics. Detailed instruction manuals had been printed in January 1870, but had only been distributed at the very beginning of the hostilities. Such was the secrecy surrounding the weapon that not only did few artillery commanders know how to deploy it effectively, many did not even <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> existed. Marshal MacMahon, commander of the Army of Châlons, claimed that he had never even seen a mitrailleuse until one was wheeled past him at the Battle of Sedan on 2 September 1870, nearly two months after war had been declared.|$|E
25|$|Octavian {{returned}} to Rome {{two years after}} defeating Mark Antony at the Battle of Actium. With Mark Antony's defeat, no one remained to oppose Octavian. Decades of war had taken a terrible toll on the People of Rome. The political situation was unstable, {{and there was a}} constant threat of renewed warfare. Octavian's arrival alone caused a wave of optimism to ripple throughout Italy. As soon as he arrived, he began addressing the problems that were plaguing Rome. He declared a general amnesty for the former supporters of his enemies, and provided land for over 120,000 former soldiers. As soon as these reforms had been implemented, the price of land began to rise and trade was revived. Octavian's popularity soon reached new heights, which ultimately gave him the support he needed to implement his reforms. When Octavian deposed Mark Antony in 32 BC, he resigned his position as triumvir, but was probably vested with powers similar to those that he had given up. In 29 BC, another alteration was made to his legal status, of which we know very little. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> involved the granting to Octavian of Consular imperium (command authority), and thus control over the army and the provinces. This alteration probably also gave him the authority to take a census.|$|E

25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
