5000|$|During the film's production, as USS Besugo {{was about}} to get underway, an {{argument}} ensued between the director and one of the unions. Note: it was difficult for a submarine tied up in San Diego to get underway while a tide was running, so there was only a short window of opportunity to maneuver the boat away from the pier. Besugo {{was one of the first}} submarines to employ nylon rope lines, and when stretched, the lines could get about [...] "as big around as a pencil" [...] and become lethal if they broke under strain. The order was given to the helmsman to answer all bells. Reagan happened to be on deck practicing his dialog lines and <b>hollering</b> <b>out,</b> [...] "Ahead one third, starboard back full ..." [...] About this time, the nylon ropes were stretched to their breaking point when an officer gave the command, [...] "All stop, ALL STOP, Goddammit, ALL STOP!"

40|$|Jazz {{music was}} born in America in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the early 20 th century. Founded from blues music, which was based off of African American slave’s hymns and field <b>hollers</b> sang <b>out</b> as they worked, {{it led to the}} {{creation}} of new American musical genres, like bebop and rock and roll. Despite critics’ attempts to discourage it, jazz also was one of the first types of music that people could really swing dance to, causing many integrated social gatherings.

"Well," [...] Reverdy {{continued}} with a reluctance that passed {{as he went}} on, [...] "what Dylks told him {{was that he would}} increase his faith, so't he could see the sights of his power, and glorify him among men, and then Enraghty he commenced to git warm ag'in, and Dylks he turned up his eyes and kep' still, and it was so bright all round him that it made the daylight like dusk, and Dylks made him hark if he didn't hear a kind of rush in the air, and Dylks said it was the adversary of souls, but he would conquer him. They came into a deep holler in the woods and there they see the devil standun' in their way, and Dylks he lights and <b>hollers</b> <b>out,</b> 'Fear not, Paul; this day my work is done,' and he went towards Satan and Satan he raised his burnun' wings and bristled his scales, and stuck out his forked tongue and dropped melted fire from it; and he rolled his eyes in his head, hissun' and bubblun' like sinners boilun' in hell's kittles. Then Dylks he got down on his knees and prayed, and got up and give his shout of Salvation, and the devil's wings fell, and he took in his tongue, and his eyes stood still, and Dylks he blowed his breath at him, and Satan he turned and jumped, and every jump he give the ground shook, and Dylks and the balance of 'em follered him till the devil come to Brother Mason's house, and then he jumped through the shut winder out of sight. They found Brother Mason's son David in bed sick, but he got up and took Dylks in his arms and called him his Savior, and everybody got down on their knees and prayed, and their faces was shinun' beautiful, and Dylks he walks round David Mason, and rubs his hands over him, and says, 'I bind the devil for a thousand years,' and he hugged David, and said, 'The work is done.' And he wouldn't stay to preach there, but told 'em they must come back with him to the Temple here in Leatherwood.

So after a while madam saw the rights of it, and gave consent that means should be taken as Madge and other wise folk would have it; but he was too old by that time for the egg shells, for he could talk, talk, and ask questions enough to drive you wild. So they took him out under the privet hedge, Madge and her gossip Deborah Clint, and had got his clothes off to flog him with nettles till they changed him, when the ill-favoured elf began to squall and shriek like a whole litter of pigs, and as ill luck would have it, the master was within hearing, though they had watched him safe off to one of his own 'venticles, but it seems there had been warning that the justices were on the look-out, so home he came.

So then it was all over with them, as though that were not proof enow what manner of thing it was! Madge tried to put him off with washing with yarbs being good for the limbs, but when he saw that Deb was there, he saith, saith he, as grim as may be, [...] "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live," [...] which was hard, for she is but a white witch; and he stormed and raved at them with Bible texts, and then he vowed (men are so headstrong, my dears) that if ever he ketched them at it again, he would see Deb burnt for a witch at the stake, and Madge hung for the murder of the child, and he is well known to be a man of his word.

The red-nosed man warn't by no means the sort of person you'd like to grub by contract, but he was nothin' to the shepherd.
