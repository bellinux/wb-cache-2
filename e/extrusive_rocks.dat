Its mix of granitic, sedimentary, metamorphic, and <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> contrasts with the predominantly volcanic rocks of the Cascades ecoregion to the northeast. The mild, subhumid climate of the region is characterized by a lengthy summer drought. It supports a mosaic of both northern Californian and Pacific Northwestern conifers and hardwoods.|$|E
25|$|The city {{lies within}} the Sidlaw-Ochil anticline, and the {{predominant}} bedrock type is Old Red Sandstone of the Arbuthnott-Garvock group. Differential weathering {{of a series}} of igneous intrusions has yielded a number of prominent hills in the landscape, most notably the Dundee Law (a late Silurian/early Devonian Mafic rock intrusion) and Balgay hill (a Felsic rock intrusion of similar age). In the east of the city, in Craigie and Broughty Ferry, the bedrock geology is of <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks,</b> including mafic lava and tuff.|$|E

2500|$|Igneous rock (derived {{from the}} Latin word ignis meaning fire), or magmatic rock, {{is one of}} the three main rock types, the others being {{sedimentary}} and metamorphic. Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Solidification into rock occurs either below the surface as intrusive rocks or on the surface as <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks.</b> Igneous rock may form with crystallization to form granular, crystalline rocks, [...] or without crystallization to form natural glasses.|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{volcanic}} activity {{has created a}} northwest trending line of volcanic rocks called the Wrangell Volcanic Belt. This volcanic belt lies largely in the U.S. state of Alaska, but extends across the Alaska-Yukon border into southwestern Yukon where it contains scattered remnants of subaerial lavas and pyroclastic rocks which are preserved along the entire eastern fringe of the ice covered Saint Elias Mountains. The Wrangell Volcanic Belt formed {{as a result of}} arc volcanism related to subduction of the Pacific Plate under the northern portion of the North American Plate. Over large areas <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> lie in flat undisturbed piles on a Tertiary surface of moderate relief. Locally, however, strata of the same age have been affected by a late pulse of tectonism, during which they were faulted, contorted into tight symmetrical folds, or overridden by pre-Tertiary basement rocks along southwesterly dipping thrust faults. Considerable recent uplift, accompanied by rapid erosion, has reduced once vast areas of upper Tertiary volcanic rocks to small isolated remnants. Although no eruptions have occurred in the Yukon portion of the Wrangell Belt for the past five million years, two large (VEI-6) explosive eruptions from Mount Churchill [...] west of the Alaska-Yukon border, created the White River Ash deposit. [...] This volcanic ash deposit is estimated 1,890and 1,250years old, covering more than [...] of northwestern Canada and adjacent eastern Alaska. Unproven legends from indigenous people in the area indicate the final eruption from Mount Churchill 1,250years ago disrupted food supplies and forced them to move further south.|$|E

50|$|Intrusions {{are one of}} the {{two ways}} igneous rock can form; the other is <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock,</b> that is, a {{volcanic}} eruption or similar event. Technically speaking, an intrusion is any formation of intrusive igneous rock; rock formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the planet. In contrast, an extrusion consists of <b>extrusive</b> rock; <b>rock</b> formed above the surface of the crust.|$|R

50|$|Specimens of thorite {{generally}} {{come from}} igneous pegmatites and volcanic <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks,</b> hydrothermal veins and contact metamorphic rocks. It {{is also known}} to occur as small grains in detrital sands. Crystals are rare, but when found can produce nicely shaped short prismatic crystals with pyramidal terminations.It is commonly associated with zircon, monazite, gadolinite, fergusonite, uraninite, yttrialite and pyrochlore.|$|E
50|$|The {{elemental}} and {{mineralogical composition}} of primary rocks {{is determined by}} the chemical composition of the volcanic or magmatic flow from which it is formed. <b>Extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> (such as basalt, rhyolite, andesite and obsidian) and intrusive rocks (such as granite, granodiorite, gabbro and peridotite) contain primary minerals including quartz, feldspar, plagioclase, muscovite, biotite, amphibole, pyroxene and olivine in varying concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{minerals}} are mostly fine-grained, {{it is much}} more difficult to distinguish between the different types of <b>extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> than between different types of intrusive igneous rocks. Generally, the mineral constituents of fine-grained <b>extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> can only be determined by examination of thin sections of the rock under a microscope, so only an approximate classification can usually be made in the field.|$|R
50|$|The {{footwall}} to the Widgiemooltha Komatiite is the Mt Edwards Basalt, {{which is}} a low to medium MgO mafic <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock,</b> metamorphosed to upper greenschist facies. Mineralogy is chlorite, actinolite, rare epidote, quartz and albite. The Mt Edwards Basalt has uncommon interflow sedimentary intervals and some well developed pillow basalt flow tops which give regional facing directions. The true thickness of the Mt Edwards Basalt is unknown.|$|R
25|$|<b>Extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks,</b> {{also known}} as {{volcanic}} rocks, are formed at the crust's surface {{as a result of}} the partial melting of rocks within the mantle and crust. <b>Extrusive</b> igneous <b>rocks</b> cool and solidify quicker than intrusive igneous rocks. They are formed by the cooling of molten magma on the earth's surface. The magma, which is brought to the surface through fissures or volcanic eruptions, solidifies at a faster rate. Hence such rocks are smooth, crystalline and fine-grained. Basalt is a common <b>extrusive</b> igneous <b>rock</b> and forms lava flows, lava sheets and lava plateaus. Some kinds of basalt solidify to form long polygonal columns. The Giant's Causeway in Antrim, Northern Ireland is an example.|$|R
50|$|The volcano {{is part of}} the {{so-called}} Tin belt, a territory in the Andes where large tin mineral deposits are found in granitic and <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks,</b> formed from sulfidation reactions involving the numerous volcanoes in the area. Magmas in the territory are derived from crystal fractionation and were heavily modified by interactions with the crust that reaches a thickness of 70 km beneath the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E
50|$|The basaltic and andesitic dikes and sills {{that occur}} within the strata {{underlying}} the Cardenas Basalt {{are similar in}} mineralogy and chemistry to the Cardenas volcanic rocks. This suggests that these intrusive and <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> are coeval and share a common source. The sills range in thickness from a few tens of meters to as thick as 300 m. The dikes typically are much thinner and locally follow fault planes.|$|E
50|$|Mineralization occurs {{either as}} {{structurally}} controlled veins and breccias discordant to the stratigraphy and less commonly as stratabound mineralization either in <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> or permeable sedimentary facies. Mineralization may be primary, that is magmatic-related or as secondary mineralization due to leaching, remobilization and re-precipitation. The principal uranium mineral in volcanic deposits is pitchblende, {{which is usually}} associated with molybdenite and minor amounts of lead, tin and tungsten mineralization.|$|E

50|$|Quartzolite or silexite is an {{intrusive}} igneous rock, {{in which}} the mineral quartz is more than 90% of the rock's felsic mineral content, with feldspar at up to 10%. Typically, quartz forms more than 60% of the rock, the rest being mostly feldspar although minor amounts of mica or amphibole may also be present. Quartzolite occurs as dykes, sills, veins, bosses and segregation masses. It is an extremely rare type of <b>rock.</b> No <b>extrusive</b> <b>rock</b> equivalent of quartzolite is known.

50|$|Aphanitic (a = not, phaner = visible) {{rocks in}} {{contrast}} to phaneritic rocks, typically form from lava which crystallize rapidly on or near Earth' surface. Because <b>extrusive</b> <b>rocks</b> {{make contact with the}} atmosphere they cool quickly, so the minerals do not have time to form large crystals. The individual crystals in an aphanitic igneous rock are not distinguishable to the naked eye. Examples of aphanitic igneous rock include basalt, andesite and rhyolite.|$|E
