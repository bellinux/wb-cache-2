5|$|<b>Irreducible</b> {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of <b>irreducible</b> complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} it is {{possible}} for a commutative ring with identity to be non-atomic (that is, there exist non-zero nonunits that cannot be factored into <b>irreducibles)</b> and yet have a strongly atomic polynomial extension. In particular, we produce a commutative ring with identity, R, that is antimatter (that is, R has no <b>irreducibles</b> whatsoever) such that R[t] is strongly atomic. What is more, given any nonzero nonunit f(t) in R[t] then there is a factorization of f(t) into <b>irreducibles</b> of length no more than deg(f(t)) + 2...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the function field analogue of the Lehmer's totient problem. Let p(x) ∈F_q[x] and φ(q,p(x)) be the Euler's totient function of p(x) over F_q[x], where F_q is a finite field with q elements. We prove that φ(q,p(x)) |(q^ deg(p(x)) - 1) {{if and only if}} (i) p(x) is irreducible; or (ii) q= 3, p(x) is the product of any 2 non-associate irreducibes of degree 1; or (iii) q= 2, p(x) is the product of all <b>irreducibles</b> of degree 1, all <b>irreducibles</b> of degree 1 and 2, and the product of any 3 <b>irreducibles</b> one each of degree 1, 2 and 3.

5|$|The Lorentz {{group and}} its Lie algebra have the {{complete}} reducibility property. This means that every representation reduces to a direct sum of <b>irreducible</b> representations. The reducible representations will therefore not be discussed.|$|E
5|$|When {{constructing}} theories such as QED {{which is}} invariant under space parity and time reversal, Dirac spinors may be used, while theories that do not, {{such as the}} electroweak force, must be formulated in terms of Weyl spinors. The Dirac representation, , is usually taken to include both space parity and time inversions. Without space parity inversion, {{it is not an}} <b>irreducible</b> representation.|$|E

5000|$|As {{explained}} above, if our {{assignment was}} to [...] "factor into <b>irreducibles</b> over C" [...] {{we know that}} would have {{to find some way to}} dissect the quartic and look for its irrational and/or complex roots.

25|$|A {{character}} is called <b>irreducible,</b> if the corresponding representation is <b>irreducible.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{action is}} <b>irreducible</b> {{and is the}} unique such <b>irreducible</b> {{representation}} of these relations.|$|E
25|$|In {{favourable}} circumstances, every {{representation is}} a direct sum of <b>irreducible</b> representations: such representations {{are said to be}} semisimple. In this case, it suffices to understand only the <b>irreducible</b> representations. In other cases, one must understand how indecomposable representations can be built from <b>irreducible</b> representations as extensions of a quotient by a subrepresentation.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{integral}} domain R is a half-factorial domain (HFD) {{if every}} nonzero nonunit of R {{is a product}} of <b>irreducibles</b> and any two factorizations of a nonzero nonunit of R into the product of <b>irreducibles</b> have the same length.

25|$|The {{rings in}} which {{factorization}} into <b>irreducibles</b> is essentially unique are called unique factorization domains. Important examples are polynomial rings over the integers or over a field, Euclidean domains and principal ideal domains.|$|R
25|$|We {{now give}} a brief {{indication}} of how <b>irreducible</b> root systems classify simple Lie algebras over , following the arguments in Humphreys. A preliminary result says that a semisimple Lie algebra is simple {{if and only if}} the associated root system is <b>irreducible.</b> We thus restrict attention to <b>irreducible</b> root systems and simple Lie algebras.|$|E
25|$|An {{algebraic}} set {{is called}} <b>irreducible</b> if it cannot be written as {{the union of}} two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of <b>irreducible</b> algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the <b>irreducible</b> components of the algebraic set. An <b>irreducible</b> algebraic set is also called a variety. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety {{if and only if}} it may be defined as the vanishing set of a prime ideal of the polynomial ring.|$|E
25|$|That means, if we {{consider}} infinite groups, {{it is possible that}} a representation, although being not <b>irreducible,</b> can not be decomposed in a direct sum of <b>irreducible</b> subrepresentations.|$|E
40|$|The {{decomposition}} of tensor products of representations into <b>irreducibles</b> is studied for a continuous family of integrable operator representations of $U_q(sl(2,R) $. It {{is described by}} an explicit integral transformation involving a distributional kernel {{that can be seen}} as an analogue of the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Moreover, we also study the relation between two canonical decompositions of triple tensor products into <b>irreducibles.</b> It can be represented by an integral transformation with a kernel that generalizes the Racah-Wigner coefficients. This kernel is explicitly calculated.

40|$|Descartes {{is usually}} {{taken to be}} a strict reductionist, and he {{frequently}} describes his work in reductionist terms. This dissertation, however, makes the case {{that he is a}} nonreductionist in certain areas of his philosophy and natural philosophy (biology and the mind–body union in particular). This might seem like simple inconsistency, or a mismatch between Descartes's ambitions and his achievements. I argue that here it is more than that: nonreductionism is compatible with his wider commitments, and allowing for <b>irreducibles</b> increases the explanatory power of his system. Moreover, Descartes depends on nonreductionist knowledge and on <b>irreducibles</b> in order to maintain his epistemology and metaphysics. That is, there is more in the Cartesian world than mind, matter, and God...|$|R

25|$|However, the <b>irreducible</b> {{representations}} of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of modules rather than representations. The representation obtained from an <b>irreducible</b> representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be <b>irreducible.</b> The modules so constructed are called Specht modules, and every <b>irreducible</b> does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their dimensions are not known in general.|$|E
25|$|In general, the {{tensor product}} of <b>irreducible</b> {{representations}} is not irreducible; {{the process of}} decomposing a tensor product as a direct sum of <b>irreducible</b> representations is known as Clebsch–Gordan theory.|$|E
