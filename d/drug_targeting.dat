40|$|Abstract Background During {{the past}} decades, {{research}} and development in drug discovery have attracted much attention and efforts. However, only 324 <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are known for clinical drugs up to now. Identifying potential <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> {{is the first step}} in the process of modern drug discovery for developing novel therapeutic agents. Therefore, the identification and validation of new and effective <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are of great value for drug discovery in both academia and pharmaceutical industry. If a protein can be predicted in advance for its potential application as a <b>drug</b> <b>target,</b> the <b>drug</b> discovery process <b>targeting</b> this protein will be greatly speeded up. In the current study, based on the properties of known <b>drug</b> <b>targets,</b> we have developed a sequence-based <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> prediction method for fast identification of novel <b>drug</b> <b>targets.</b> Results Based on simple physicochemical properties extracted from protein sequences of known <b>drug</b> <b>targets,</b> several support vector machine models have been constructed in this study. The best model can distinguish currently known <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> from non <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> at an accuracy of 84 %. Using this model, potential protein <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> of human origin from Swiss-Prot were predicted, some of which have already attracted much attention as potential <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> in pharmaceutical research. Conclusion We have developed a <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> prediction method based solely on protein sequence information without the knowledge of family/domain annotation, or the protein 3 D structure. This method can be applied in novel <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> identification and validation, as well as genome scale <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> predictions. </p...|$|R

In the past decade, the accumulation of various types of omics data {{makes it possible to}} develop computational approaches to predict <b>drug</b> <b>targets.</b> In this paper, we make a survey on the recent progress being made on computational methodologies that have been developed to predict <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> based on different kinds of omics data and drug property data...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and validation of <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are crucial in biomedical research and {{many studies have}} been conducted on analyzing <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> features for getting a better understanding on principles of their mechanisms. But most of them are based on either strong biological hypotheses or the chemical and physical properties of those targets separately. In this paper, we investigated three main ways to understand the functional biomolecules based on the topological features of <b>drug</b> <b>targets.</b> There are no significant differences between targets and common proteins in the protein-protein interactions network, indicating the <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are neither hub proteins which are dominant nor the bridge proteins. According to some special topological structures of the <b>drug</b> <b>targets,</b> there are significant differences between known targets and other proteins. Furthermore, the <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> mainly belong to three typical communities based on their modularity. These topological features are helpful to understand how the <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> work in the PPI network. Particularly, it is an alternative way to predict potential targets or extract nontargets to test a new <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> efficiently and economically. By this way, a <b>drug</b> <b>targetâ€™s</b> homologue set containing 102 potential target proteins is predicted in the paper...|$|R

30|$|Integration with <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> ontology: Most <b>drugs</b> act by binding to a {{specific}} protein, namely the <b>drug</b> <b>target,</b> in order to change its biochemical or biophysical activities (Lin et al. 2009).

40|$|The {{discovery}} of novel <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> {{is a significant}} challenge in drug development. Although the human genome comprises approximately 30, 000 genes, proteins encoded by fewer than 400 are used as <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> {{in the treatment of}} diseases. Therefore, novel <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are extremely valuable as the source for first in class drugs. On the other hand, many of the currently known <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are functionally pleiotropic and involved in multiple pathologies. Several of them are exploited for treating multiple diseases, which highlights the need for methods to reliably reposition <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> to new indications. Network-based methods have been successfully applied to prioritize novel disease-associated genes. In recent years, several such algorithms have been developed, some focusing on local network properties only, and others taking the complete network topology into account. Common to all approaches is the understanding that novel disease-associated candidates are in close overall proximity to known disease genes. However, the relevance of these methods to the prediction of novel <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> has not yet been assessed. Here, we present a network-based approach for the prediction of <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> for a given disease. The method allows both repositioning <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> known for other diseases to the given disease and the prediction of unexploited <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> which are not used for treatment of any disease. Our approach takes as input a disease gene expression signature and a high-quality interaction network and outputs a prioritized list of <b>drug</b> <b>targets.</b> We demonstrate the high performance of our method and highlight the usefulness of the predictions in three case studies. We present novel <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> for scleroderma and different types of cancer with their underlying biological processes.

40|$|Abstract Background Systematic {{approach}} for drug discovery is an emerging discipline in systems biology research area. It aims at integrating interaction data and experimental data to elucidate diseases and also raises new issues in drug discovery for cancer treatment. However, <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> discovery {{is still at}} a trial-and-error experimental stage {{and it is a}} challenging task to develop a prediction model that can systematically detect possible <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> to deal with complex diseases. Methods We integrate gene expression, disease genes and interaction networks to identify the effective <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> which have a strong influence on disease genes using network flow approach. In the experiments, we adopt the microarray dataset containing 62 prostate cancer samples and 41 normal samples, 108 known prostate cancer genes and 322 approved <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> treated in human extracted from DrugBank database to be candidate proteins as our test data. Using our method, we prioritize the candidate proteins and validate them to the known prostate cancer <b>drug</b> <b>targets.</b> Results We successfully identify potential <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> which are strongly related to the well known drugs for prostate cancer treatment and also discover more potential <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> which raise the attention to biologists at present. We denote {{that it is hard to}} discover <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> based only on differential expression changes due to the fact that those genes used to be <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> may not always have significant expression changes. Comparing to previous methods that depend on the network topology attributes, they turn out that the genes having potential as <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are weakly correlated to critical points in a network. In comparison with previous methods, our results have highest mean average precision and also rank the position of the truly <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> higher. It thereby verifies the effectiveness of our method. Conclusions Our method does not know the real ideal routes in the disease network but it tries to find the feasible flow to give a strong influence to the disease genes through possible paths. We successfully formulate the identification of <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> prediction as a maximum flow problem on biological networks and discover potential <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> in an accurate manner. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Efficient {{identification}} of <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> {{is one of}} major challenges for drug discovery and drug development. Traditional approaches to <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> identification include literature search-based target prioritization and in vitro binding assays which are both time-consuming and labor intensive. Computational integration of different knowledge sources is a more effective alternative. Wealth of omics data generated from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic techniques changes the way researchers view <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> and provides unprecedent opportunities for <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> identification. Results In this paper, we develop a method based on flux balance analysis (FBA) of metabolic networks to identify potential <b>drug</b> <b>targets.</b> This method consists of two linear programming (LP) models, which first finds the steady optimal fluxes of reactions and the mass flows of metabolites in the pathologic state and then determines the fluxes and mass flows in the medication state with the minimal side effect caused by the medication. <b>Drug</b> <b>targets</b> are identified by comparing the fluxes of reactions in both states and examining the change of reaction fluxes. We give an illustrative example {{to show that the}} <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> identification problem can be solved effectively by our method, then apply it to a hyperuricemia-related purine metabolic pathway. Known <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> for hyperuricemia are correctly identified by our two-stage FBA method, and the side effects of these targets are also taken into account. A number of other promising <b>drug</b> <b>targets</b> are found to be both effective and safe. Conclusions Our method is an efficient procedure for <b>drug</b> <b>target</b> identification through flux balance analysis of large-scale metabolic networks. It can generate testable predictions, provide insights into drug action mechanisms and guide experimental design of drug discovery. </p...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two broad}} aspects of {{pharmacogenomics}} that are applicable to new drug discovery, development {{and evaluation of}} the drug response.
