5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The Shrines of Ise {{have been}} celebrated as the {{prototype}} of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Japanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among {{the oldest of the}} Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese aesthetics and adaptation of imported ideas.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Navy {{has stated}} that the {{carriers}} could withstand three times the damage sustained by the Essex class inflicted by Japanese air attacks during World War II. The hangars on the ships are divided into three fire bays by thick steel <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> are designed to restrict the spread of fire. This addition has been present on U.S. aircraft carriers since World War II, after the fires caused by Kamikaze attacks.|$|E

5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|The west {{elevation}} {{is covered}} with white-painted clapboarding and is undecorated, {{with the exception of}} an off-center concrete block chimney and a single drop pendant similar to the one located {{at the top of the}} gable. The concrete block perimeter foundation is visible on the south side of the church, as is the metal embankment <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> allow access to the church's basement.|$|E
5|$|This CATOBAR {{arrangement}} {{allows for}} faster launching and recovery {{as well as}} a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or arrestor wires. The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> are designed to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E

5|$|Completing stages {{allow the}} player to {{progress}} through the overworld map and to succeeding worlds. Each world features a final stage with a boss to defeat; the first seven worlds feature an airship controlled {{by one of the}} Koopalings, while the player battles Bowser in his castle in the eighth world. Other map icons include large boulders and locked <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> impede paths, and mini-games and bonus screens that provide the player a chance to obtain special power-ups and additional lives. Power-ups obtained in these mini-games are stored in a reserve until activated by the player from the map screen.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E
5|$|From stanzas 22 to 24, {{more details}} are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy {{doors of the}} ancient gate Valgrind stand before Valhalla, Valhalla has five hundred and forty <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> eight hundred men can exit from at once (from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök). Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, {{and of all the}} halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the {{branches}} of the tree Læraðr. Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E

5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be grounded in established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
5|$|The GWR {{provided}} special wagons, {{handling equipment}} and storage facilities for its largest traffic flows. For example, the coal mines in Wales sent {{much of their}} coal to the docks along the coast, {{many of which were}} owned and equipped by the railway, as were some in Cornwall that exported most of the china clay production of that county. The wagons provided for both these traffic flows (both those owned by the GWR and the mining companies) were fitted with end <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> allowed their loads to be tipped straight into the ships' holds using wagon-tipping equipment on the dockside. Special wagons were produced for many other different commodities such as gunpowder, aeroplanes, milk, fruit and fish.|$|E
5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> would be closed otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located on the board and unlock <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E
5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain <b>doors</b> <b>that</b> can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
