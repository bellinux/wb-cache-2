Cao Zhen turned furious and he shouted at Wu Zhi, [...] "Are you and your men seeking a fight with me and my men?" [...] Cao Hong and Wang Zhong egged Wu Zhi on by saying, [...] "If you want to make the General (Cao Zhen) admit that he is fat, you have to show that you're thin."

[...] Wu Zhi also drew his sword and insulted Cao Zhen by saying, [...] "Cao Zidan, you're not meat under a butcher's cleaver. My throat won't tremble when I swallow you and my teeth won't chatter when I chew on you. How dare you behave so rudely!" [...] Zhu Shuo stood up and tried to reduce tensions by telling Wu Zhi, [...] "His Majesty ordered you to host entertainment for everyone. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this?" [...] Wu Zhi then shouted at Zhu Shuo, [...] "Zhu Shuo, how dare you leave your seat!" [...] Everyone then returned to their seats. Zhu Shuo felt outraged but did not say anything, and returned to his seat and used his sword to hit the ground.|$|E

The one in the middle was named „Erica. ‟ Above the stand was a banner that read, „Most farmers prefer Blondes, ‟ a reference to the name given to this particular breed, the Blonde D‟Aquitaine. The following conversation took place: Erika: What‟s special about this breed? Why should farmers prefer them?

40|$|In 1987, Peter van Inwagen asked a good {{question}}. (Asking {{the right}} question is often the hardest part.) He asked: what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to some objects {{to get them to}} compose something—to bring into existence some further thing made up of those objects? Glue them together or what? 1 Some said that you don’t have to do anything. 2 No matter what you do to the objects, they’ll always compose something further, no matter how they are arranged. Thus we learned of the fusion of the coins in our pockets and the Eiffel tower. Others said that the objects have to be fastened together in some way, the way the parts of the things we usually think about are. But van Inwagen taught us of people stuck or glued or sewn or fused to each other. Such entanglements, van Inwagen thought, create no new entities. Others said that nothing you could do to the objects would make them compose something further. According to these “mereological nihilists”, tables, chairs, computers, molecules, people, and other composite objects, simply don’t exist. All that exist are simples—entities without further parts; subatomic particles presumably — which are “arranged table-wise” 3, “arranged chair-wise”, and so on. 4 Van Inwagen himself also dispensed with tables and chairs, but departed from the nihilists by admitting people and other living things into his ontology.

40|$|Comunicació presentada a: 9 th annual International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies EDULEARN 17, celebrat del 3 al 5 de juliol de 2017 a Barcelona. Designing {{learning}} experiences for students {{is a key}} responsibility of teachers. This involves designing stimulating and engaging tasks, selecting and creating appropriate resources, and deciding how best to support students to successfully complete the tasks. This is a complex process in which many factors need to be considered. Learning design research and tooling is focused on how to support this teacher design work. Existing learning design tools support the authoring and sharing of learning activities, which - if represented computationally - can also be enacted in virtual learning environments. An {{important part of the}} learning design process is thinking about what it is that students are to learn. This then informs the design of the learning activities. However, research on how to support this early phase of the learning design process is scarce. Indeed, an emerging finding from research investigating teacher design practices is that teachers’ design work exhibits some characteristics synonymous with the broader field of design. Specifically, teachers formulate and work with a design problem. But, teachers generally don’t consider their work in terms of design. Thus there is scope to encourage and support design thinking in teachers along the whole learning design process, including in the initial phase of identifying a design problem. This paper reports on a pilot study where a learning design Problem Generation Tool was created, in the form of 20 stimulus questions, to generate deeper thinking about the design problem. The stimulus questions are based on 3 foci, which are to be considered in an iterative way to think about and generate the problem: Understand the nature of the design problem and your goals (e. g, What kind of problem is this? Why is this design being done?) Map your context (e. g., Who are the students? How will the course be taught? Who will teach in this course?), Plan your design approach (e. g., What preparation <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> What is your initial plan or steps you will follow for your design process?) The tool was incorporated in the Integrated Learning Design Environment (ILDE), a community platform that integrates a number of learning design tools supporting conceptualization, authoring and implementation of learning activities. The Problem Generation Tool integrated in ILDE was used with eight participants, who were already familiar with ILDE, in a workshop setting in a postgraduate program at a local University in Barcelona, Spain. Participants had between one and five or more years of teaching experience. Results showed that participants found the Problem Generation Tool helpful. The level of perceived usefulness by question varied across participants, while a few questions were not sufficiently clear and need to be revised. Overall, there was evident elaboration of the participants’ design problems thus suggesting design thinking was stimulated and identification of the design problems scaffolded.

40|$|Nationally vehicle theft is {{associated}} with approximately 40 fatalities per year with an estimated annual cost of one billion dollars. During 2000 - 2001 almost 139, 000 motor vehicles (cars, motor cycles, campervans, and trucks) were stolen across Australia. Vehicle theft is an overwhelmingly adolescent male crime yet gender has not been considered in either policy or program initiatives. [...] - This thesis used Spence's Multifactorial Gender Identity theory to examine the relationships between vehicle theft, offending, and adolescent male gender identity. Four central research questions were posed: [...] - 1. 	Is vehicle theft a gendered behaviour, that is, do some adolescent males engage in vehicle theft to create a particular adolescent male gender identity? [...] - 2. 	Do vehicle theft offenders engage in other offending behaviours? [...] - 3. 	Are these other offences also {{used to create a}} particular adolescent male gender identity and [...] - 4. 	Will the use of a variety of gender-related scales to measure gender identity support Spence's Multifactorial Gender Identity Theory that gender identity is multifactorial? [...] - Study One Parts A and B provided the empirical basis for Studies Two and Three. Part A of Study One examined the "maleness" of vehicle theft and two other problem behaviours: problem drinking and traffic offence involvement. Cross-sectional and longitudinal methodologies were used to investigate a representative sample of 4, 529 male high school students in relation to vehicle theft, problem drinking, and traffic offence involvement as a novice driver. Results indicated that "maleness" was significantly related to vehicle theft, problem drinking, and traffic offence involvement. Subsequent analyses, based on Jessor's Problem Behaviour Theory, found a significant relationship between vehicle theft offenders and problem drinking. Study One Part B examined the relationship between masculinity as measured by the Australian Sex Role Scale (ASRS) and problem drinking in a rural sample of 1, 248 male high school students. Using a cross sectional methodology, Masculine students were more likely than students in the other gender trait groups to report a range of problem drinking behaviours. Contrary to previous research, both socially desirable and socially undesirable masculine traits were significantly related to most problem drinking behaviours. [...] - Having established significant relationships between "maleness" and vehicle theft and masculinity and the adolescent problem behaviour of underage drinking, Study Two qualitatively examined the perceptions of adolescent males with histories of vehicle theft in relation to "doing masculinity". Using semi-structured interviews, 30 adolescent males, clients of the juvenile justice system were asked "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to be a man?" Vehicle theft was clearly identified as a masculine defining behaviour as were other offending behaviours. Overall, participants nominated very traditional behaviours such as having a job and providing financially for families as essential behaviours in "doing masculinity". It was suggested that in the absence of legal options for creating a masculine gender identity, some adolescent males adopted more readily accessed illegal options. Study Two also canvassed the driving behaviour of adolescent males in stolen vehicles. Crash involvement was not uncommon. Speed, alcohol, and the presence of other adolescent males were consistent characteristics of their driving behaviour. Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants were similar in their responses. [...] - Study Three compared the gender identity of offender and non-offender adolescent males as measured by three gender-related measures: the ASRS, the Toughness Subscale of the Male Role Norm Scale (TSMRNS) and the Doing Masculinity Composite Scale (DMCS). While the ASRS measured gender traits, the TSMRNS measured masculinity ideology. The DMCS was developed from the responses of participants in Study Two and sought to measure how participants "do masculinity". Analyses indicated vehicle theft was endorsed by just over a third of the sample as a masculine defining behaviour. Overall, offenders were again very traditional in the behaviours they endorsed. When compared to non-offenders, offenders were more likely to endorse illegal behaviours in "doing masculinity" while non-offenders were more likely to endorse legal behaviours. Both offenders and non-offenders strongly endorsed having a car and the ability to drive as masculine defining behaviours. [...] - In relation to gender traits, non-offenders were more likely than offenders to be classified as Masculine by the ASRS. Surprisingly offenders {{were more likely to be}} classified as Androgynous. In relation to masculinity ideology, offenders and non-offenders were similar in their results on the TSMRNS however offenders were more likely to endorse beliefs concerning the need to be tough. Overall Indigenous and non-Indigenous offenders were similar in their responses though Indigenous males were more likely to endorse beliefs concerning the need to be tough. Spence's Multifactorial Gender Identity theory was supported in that the relations between the three gender-related measures were significant but low. [...] - Results confirmed that vehicle theft was endorsed by a minority of participants as a gendered behaviour. Other offending behaviours were also endorsed by some adolescent males as means to create masculine gender identity. Importantly though both offenders and non-offenders endorsed very traditional behaviours in relation to "doing masculinity". The implications for policy and program initiatives include the acknowledgement of gender identity as an important component in relation to vehicle theft and offending and the desire of adolescent male offenders to engage in legal, traditional male behaviours. In the absence of legal avenues however, some adolescent males may use illegal behaviours to create gender identity. Cars and driving also feature as important components of gender identity for both offenders and non-offenders and these needs to be considered in relation to road safety initiatives...|$|E
