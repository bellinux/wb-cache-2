5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E

25|$|The {{story begins}} with a winding road and a cart {{approaching}} an unnamed city and focuses {{on a pair of}} goitered elders, Don Chepe and Niña Tina, who are laden with the country's heritage. To stitch together the legends that compose the rest of the book told by these elders, the character, “Cuco de los Sueños,” is introduced. The narrator then tells two anecdotes, one about Brother Pedro de Betancourt and another about Fray Payo Enriquez de Rivera. Both stories emphasize transformation and contrasting elements. Asturias' main argument is that Guatemala <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> built on nations and that change is possible.|$|E
500|$|Gonzalo's {{description}} of his ideal society (2.1.148–157, 160–165) thematically and verbally echoes Montaigne's essay Of the Canibales, translated into English in a version published by John Florio in 1603. Montaigne praises {{the society of the}} Caribbean natives: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation...</b> that hath no kinde of traffike, no knowledge of Letters, no intelligence of numbers, no name of magistrate, nor of politike superioritie; no use of service, of riches, or of poverty; no contracts, no successions, no dividences, no occupation but idle; no respect of kinred, but common, no apparrell but natural, no manuring of lands, no use of wine, corne, or mettle. The very words that import lying, falsehood, treason, dissimulation, covetousnes, envie, detraction, and pardon, were never heard of amongst them." [...] In addition, much of Prospero's renunciative speech (5.1.33–57) echoes a speech by Medea in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses.|$|E

A controversial political issue {{in recent years has been}} the question of bilingualism. Many immigrants have come from Hispanic America, who are native Spanish speakers, in the past centuries and have become a significant minority and even a majority in many areas of the Southwest. In New Mexico the Spanish speaking population exceeds 40%. Disputes have emerged over language policy, since a sizeable part of the population, and in many areas the majority of the population, speak Spanish as a native language. The biggest debates are over bilingual education for language minority students, the availability of non-English ballots and election materials and whether or not English is the official language. It has evolved into an ethnic conflict between the pluralists who support bilingualism and linguistic access and the assimilationists who strongly oppose this and lead the official English movement. The United States does not have an official language, but English is the default national language, spoken by the overwhelming majority of the country's population.|$|E

2500|$|During World War I, Chamberlain {{published}} several propaganda texts {{against his}} {{country of birth}} – Kriegsaufsätze (Wartime Essays). In the first four tracts, he maintains that Germany <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nation</b> of peace; England's political system is a sham, while Germany exhibits true freedom; German is the greatest and only remaining [...] "living" [...] language; and {{the world would be}} better off doing away with English and French-styled parliamentary governments in favour of German rule [...] "thought out by a few and carried out with iron consequence." [...] The final two discuss England and Germany at length. Chamberlain's basic argument was that democracy was an idiotic system as equality was a myth-humans were very different with different abilities and talents, so democratic equality where the opinions of one voter mattered much as the next was a completely flawed system. Quoting the French scientist Gustave Le Bon, Chamberlain wrote {{the vast majority of people}} were simply too stupid to properly understand the issues, and as such Germany with its rule by elites was a much better governed nation than France. In Germany, Chamberlain asserted true freedom existed as freedom came from the state which alone made it possible for society to function, not the individual as was the case in Britain and France, which Chamberlain claimed was a recipe for chaos. Field summarized Chamberlain's thesis [...] "...the essence of German freedom was the willing submission as a matter of conscience to legitimately constituted authorities; it implied duty more than rights and was something spiritual and internal for which each moral being had to strive. Cosigning [...] "liberty" [...] to an inner, [...] "nonpolitical" [...] moral realm, Chamberlain closed off any discussion of the specific conditions for a free society and simply asserted that freedom was perfectly compatible with an authoritarian system of government". Quoting-sometimes wildly out of context-various British, French and American authors such as John Richard Green, William Edward Hartpole Lecky, John Robert Seeley, John Ruskin, Thomas Carlyle, Paul Bourget, Francis Delaisi, James Bryce, John Burgess, Woodrow Wilson, and H. G. Wells, Chamberlain argued that in democratic states, it was always big business that was really in charge; as such democracy was a fraud and democratic governments only served the rich; and democratic states only existed [...] "to further the interests of money making all over the globe". Chamberlain's attacks on democracy as a sham designed to allow [...] "Jewish plutocrats" [...] to rule the world were not only very anti-British and anti-French, but also anti-American. Right from the start of the war, Chamberlain attacked all democratic governments in the world including the neutral United States as a fraud perpetrated by the Jews. Chamberlain wrote that America [...] "is a hellish whirlpool, in which all the contradictions of the world, all the greed, envy and lust brew and simmer; a wild struggle of millions of ignorant egotists, men without ideas, ideals, or traditions, without shared values, without any capacity for sacrifice, an atomic chaos endowed with no true power of nature". Until the United States entered the war in 1917, the Auswärtiges Amt worked hard to prevent Chamberlain's essays with their strong anti-American content from appearing abroad out of the fear that they would offend opinion in America. Chamberlain's wartime writings also gained much attention, albeit of a highly negative sort in his native Britain with The Times Literary Supplement declaring: [...] "The most ignorant of the Germans has not written greater nonsense". In 1915, an unauthorised translation of Chamberlain's wartime essays was published in London under the unflattering title of The Ravings of a Renegade.|$|E
