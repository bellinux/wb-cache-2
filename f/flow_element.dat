50|$|A {{compound}} meter is used where {{high flow}} rates are necessary, but where at times {{there are also}} smaller rates of flow {{that need to be}} accurately measured. Compound meters have two measuring elements and a check valve to regulate flow between them. At high flow rates, water is normally diverted primarily or completely to the high <b>flow</b> <b>element.</b> The high <b>flow</b> <b>element</b> is typically a turbine meter. When flow rates drop to where the high <b>flow</b> <b>element</b> cannot measure accurately, a check valve closes to divert water to a smaller element that can measure the lower flow rates accurately. The low <b>flow</b> <b>element</b> is typically a multi-jet or PD meter.

50|$|Linear {{resistance}} meters, {{also called}} laminar flow meters, measure very low flows {{at which the}} measured differential pressure is linearly proportional to the flow and to the fluid viscosity. Such flow is called viscous drag flow or laminar flow, {{as opposed to the}} turbulent flow measured by orifice plates, Venturis and other meters mentioned in this section, and is characterized by Reynolds numbers below 2000. The primary <b>flow</b> <b>element</b> may consist of a single long capillary tube, a bundle of such tubes, or a long porous plug; such low flows create small pressure differentials but longer flow elements create higher, more easily measured differentials. These flow meters are particularly sensitive to temperature changes affecting the fluid viscosity and the diameter of the <b>flow</b> <b>element,</b> {{as can be seen in}} the governing Hagen-Poiseuille equation.|$|E
5000|$|Rotary meters {{are highly}} {{machined}} precision instruments {{capable of handling}} higher volumes and pressures than diaphragm meters.

50|$|These are {{the most}} common type of gas meter, seen in almost all {{residential}} and small commercial installations. Within the meter there are two or more chambers formed by movable diaphragms. With the gas flow directed by internal valves, the chambers alternately fill and expel gas, producing a nearly continuous flow through the meter. As the diaphragms expand and contract, levers connected to cranks convert the linear motion of the diaphragms into rotary motion of a crank shaft which serves as the primary <b>flow</b> <b>element.</b> This shaft can drive an odometer-like counter mechanism or it can produce electrical pulses for a flow computer.|$|E

40|$|Summary A {{new method}} for {{modelling}} multi-zone air infiltration and ventilation simulation {{and a simple}} test case are described. The network approach was used, and the solution {{was based on a}} fully implicit formulation of the flow equations. In the present version of the building simulation model (BUS version 2. 1), the thermal behaviour of a building is neglected, and constant and uniform air temperatures are assumed. Convergence of the program was tested by test runs. The simulated steady-state mass flow rates and pressures were checked by analytical calculations. The results are found to satisfy both mass balance equations for every node and momentum equations for each <b>flow</b> <b>element</b> when a simple test case is simulated.
