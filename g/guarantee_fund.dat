40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of hedging discrete stochastic jumps and their tradeoffs in <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds</b> under discrete dynamic hedging. Since a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> price process is composed of diffusion and jump process, its expected rate of return is above the risk-free rate of interest. When delta dynamic hedging occurs at discrete instants, the rate differential will be manifested in non-zero expected hedging errors. We employ the dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>fund</b> as our example, whose exotic fund structure excludes {{the possibility of}} static hedge. We derive a pricing model and develop hedging formulas for discrete dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds.</b> We show our discrete-time delta hedging formulas induce smaller hedging errors than those based on applying the continuous-time hedging formula of Gerber and Pafumi (2000) at discrete instants. Nevertheless, this discrete-time model still incurs significant negative expected hedging errors induced partly by the guarantee jumps. We introduce a gamma-adjusted delta hedging strategy. The simulation {{results indicate that the}} strategy can effectively improve the discrete hedging performance of dynamic <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds.</b> ...|$|R

The guarantee operates to secure a percentage of monies loaned by banks to film production companies. The Fund has received a mixed reception from industry participants, and less than enthusiastic reception from financial institutions who perceive investment in local films as high risk ventures with little collateral. Film guarantee legal documents commissioned by the Hong Kong Government in late April 2003 are based on Canadian documents, which have limited relevance to the local industry.|$|E

The FGS is a stabilization fund also established {{in response to the}} 2008 financial crisis, {{as well as to the}} rapid growth in the number of ANSES accounts. This latter development began when the transfer of AFJP accounts was made possible in 2007, and was bolstered by the Social Security Inclusion Plan, which allowed the entry of 2.5 million retirees into the system who had earlier been excluded due to insufficient contributions. Boudou was appointed Economy Minister in July 2009, and he was succeeded by Mortgage Bank Director Diego Bossio.|$|E

The agency maintains a stabilization fund, the Sustainability <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> (FGS), which held approximately us$46 billion in a variety of financial instruments as of December 2011, of which 58% was held in government securities, 14% in productive investment, 12% in time deposits, and 9% in the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.|$|E

500|$|Gedde-Dahl was {{replaced}} by Kristian Åreskjold in March 1988. The company lost NOK15 million in 1987 and budgeted with a deficit of NOK13 million the following year. To cover the losses, the airline issued a private placement for NOK12 million and a public issue of NOK18 million. The airline retained only a single aircraft in operation until late 1989 and the staff of 50 to 60 employees {{was too much for}} the revenue form a single aircraft to cover. The airline planned to acquire a third aircraft in 1990 and budgeted with a profit of NOK7 million in 1989 and NOK32 million in 1990. Sun Tours filed for bankruptcy in late May 1988. However, Åreskjold stated that the bankruptcy [...] "came at a convenient time" [...] as in the short term Norway Airlines would fly back Sun Tours customers {{at the expense of the}} Norwegian Travel <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Fund</b> and that there was a deficit of aircraft on the European charter market. Within a week, Norway Airlines had signed a contract to fly with both aircraft for Britannia Airways out of London Gatwick Airport. A new issue of shares for NOK25 to 30 million took place in June 1988 and the company stated its intent to list itself on the Trondheim Stock Exchange.

Unfortunately, many examples of framing exist whereby a change in the wording of a problem leads to other preferences. We apply the idea of framing to capital <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds.</b> Capital <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds</b> provide individual investors with an efficient way to build in capital protection and still earn a return proportional to e. g. the performance of the stock market. Based on an experiment, we show that investors are willing to put the interest on a time deposit at stake in order to earn a higher income. In this way, capital <b>guaranteed</b> <b>funds</b> serve a good purpose. However, the frame used to disclose information about the fund to the investor, matters. Investors tend to choose in a different way when they know characteristics of the probability distribution of the potential gains/losses. These findings clearly call for a closer attention of regulators...|$|R

6000|$|But such a Guild at best is {{only one}} of many {{possible}} expedients in this matter. Another is for a few people of means to subsidize a magazine for the exhaustive criticism of contemporary work for a few years. Quite a small number of people, serious in this matter, a couple of thousand or so, could float such a magazine by the simple expedient of guaranteeing subscriptions. [Footnote: It may be suggested that among other methods of putting the criticism of contemporary literature upon a better footing is one that might conceivably be made to pay its own expenses. There is so much room for endowments nowadays that where one can get at the purse of the general public one should certainly prefer it to that of the generous but overtaxed donor. The project would require a strong endowment, but that endowment might be of the nature of a <b>guarantee</b> <b>fund,</b> and might in the end return unimpaired to the lender. The suggestion is the establishment of a well-planned and reasonably cheap monthly or weekly critical magazine, written on a level at present unattainable--chiefly because of the low rate of payment for all literary criticism. There can be no doubt among those who read much among literary and quasi-literary periodicals in English that there is a very considerable amount of high critical ability available. Buried and obscured to an ineffectual degree among much that is formal, foolish, and venial, there is to be found to-day a really quite remarkable number of isolated reviews, criticisms and articles in which style is apparent, in which discrimination shines fitfully, in which there is the unmistakable note of honest enthusiasm for good work. For the most part, such criticism bears also the marks of haste-- as, indeed, it must do when a review as long as the column of a daily paper, a day's work, that is, of steady writing, earns scarcely a pound. But the stuff is there. Scarcely a number of the Academy, or the Spectator, scarcely a week of the Morning Post, the Daily News, or the Daily Chronicle, but there is a review, or a piece of a review, that has the stigmata of literature. And this suggestion is that some of these writers shall be got together, shall be paid at least as well as popular short-story writers are paid, shall each have a definite department marked out under a trustworthy editor, and be pledged to limit their work to the pages of this new critical magazine. Their work would be signed, and there they would be, conspicuously urged to do the best that was in them, apropos of more or less contemporary books and writers. They would have leisure for deliberate judgments, for the development of that consistency of thought which the condition of journalism renders so impossible. This review would mean for them status, reputation, and opportunity. They would deal with contemporary fiction, with contemporary speculative literature, and with the style, logic, methods and vocabulary of scientific and philosophical writers. Their work would form the mass of the magazine, but there would also be (highly paid) occasional writers, towards whose opinions the regular staff would very carefully define their attitude. The project, of course, in foolish hands, might be very foolishly misinterpreted. It might be quite easy to drive a team of egregious asses in this way over contemporary work, leaving nothing but hoof-marks and injuries, but we are assuming the thing to be efficiently done. It is submitted that such a magazine, patiently and generously sustained for a few years, would at last probably come to pay its way. Unless the original selection of the staff was badly done, it would by sheer persistent high quality win its way to authority with the reading public, and so fill its covers with a swelling mass of advertisement pages. And once it paid, then forthwith a dozen rivals would be in the field, all of them, of course, also paying highly for critical matter and competing for critics of standing. Such an enterprise would be a lever for criticism through the whole of our literary world.] ...|$|E
