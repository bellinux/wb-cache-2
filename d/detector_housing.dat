The nuclear recoil events seen are consistent with a remaining low level background from the decay of progeny of radon daughters attached to the central cathode of the detector. However, energy depositions from such events must drift across the entire width of the detector, and thus display large diffusion upon reaching the readout planes of the device. Exploiting this feature, it is shown to be possible to reject energy depositions from these radon decay progeny events while still retaining sensitivity to nuclear recoil events. The response of the detector is then interpreted, using the F nuclei content of the gas, in terms of sensitivity to proton spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon interactions, displaying a minimum in sensitivity cross section at 0. 5 pb for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV/c^ 2.
