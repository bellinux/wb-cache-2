5|$|Initially, Cruz {{focused on}} dance, having studied {{classical}} ballet {{for nine years}} at Spain's National Conservatory. She took three years of Spanish ballet training and four years of theatre at Cristina Rota's New York school. She says that ballet instilled in her discipline that would be important in her future acting career. When she became a cinephile at 10 or 11, her father bought a Betamax machine, which was then a very rare thing to own <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Working out of Tony Leech's apartment, Cory Edwards sketched the film's storyboards, Todd Edwards {{wrote the}} script while {{simultaneously}} writing the songs, and Leech edited the story reel on his Mac computer. Producer Sue Bea Montgomery showed test screenings {{of the story}} reel to children <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> and gained input from their reactions. The filmmakers had been considering removing Japeth, but chose not to when he proved popular at these screenings. The children also particularly liked Twitchy, {{which led to the}} expansion of the character's role.|$|E

50|$|Having {{grown up}} in New York City and lived there for {{multiple}} decades, Osborne has stated that she feels a particular attachment to the city, particularly the borough of Brooklyn. <b>Her</b> interest <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood's</b> culture, history, and society has multiple influences on her music. As well, she's expressed admiration for American poetry, especially the works of Walt Whitman, and cited that as a major inspiration for her songwriting.|$|R

25|$|Although Jackson was {{internationally known}} and had {{moved up to}} the {{northern}} states, she still encountered racial prejudice. One account of this was {{when she tried to}} buy a house in Chicago. Everywhere she went, the white owners and real estate agents would turn her away, claiming the house had already been sold or they changed their minds about selling. When she finally found a house, the neighbors were not happy. Shots were fired at her windows and she had to contact the police for protection. White families started moving out and black families started moving in. Everything remained the same <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> except for the skin color of the residents.|$|E
500|$|A hardworking [...] Monica is {{introduced}} in the pilot as one of five close-knit friends who live in New York City, including her older brother Ross (David Schwimmer), neighbors Joey (Matt Leblanc) and Chandler (Matthew Perry), and former roommate Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow). When her privileged, inexperienced childhood best friend Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), {{with whom she had}} long lost contact, suddenly arrives <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> unannounced as a runaway bride after abandoning her own wedding, Monica allows her to move in with her while she attempts to reorganize her life, and the two reconnect.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 2000, Camden {{resident}} and grassroots organizer Lillian Santiago began {{a movement to}} rebuild abandoned lots <b>in</b> <b>her</b> North Camden <b>neighborhood</b> into playgrounds. The movement was met with resistance from the Camden government, citing monetary issues. As Santiago's movement gained more notability <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> {{she was able to}} move other community members into action, including Reverend Heywood Wiggins. Wiggins was the president of the Camden Churches Organized for People, a coalition of 29 churches devoted to the improvement of Camden's communities, and with his support Santiago's movement succeeded. Santiago and Wiggins were also firm believers in Community Policing, which would result in their fight against Camden's corrupt police department and the eventual turnover to the State government.|$|R

50|$|She directed, co-wrote, and co-starred in Return to Me. It {{was filmed}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> Chicago <b>neighborhood</b> and {{included}} bit parts {{for a number}} of her relatives. The film, which received a positive reception from critics, was largely influenced by Hunt's blue-collar Catholic upbringing in Chicago.|$|R
500|$|A {{few days}} after Díaz's and Johnson's statements, the web browsers of the tablets {{embedded}} into the Links were disabled indefinitely due to concerns of illicit activities such as drug deals and NSFW website browsing. LinkNYC cited [...] "lewd acts" [...] {{as the reason for}} shutting off the tables' browsing capabilities. One Murray Hill resident reported that a homeless man [...] "enthusiastically hump" [...] a Link <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> while watching pornography. Despite the tablets being disabled, the 9-1-1 capabilities, maps, and phone calls would still be usable, and people can still use LinkNYC Wi-Fi from their own devices.|$|E
500|$|In the video, LaBelle {{plays the}} part of Lolita, defined as a [...] "badass baby girl", and seduces boys <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> The video reverses the imagery of the {{heart-shaped}} glasses from Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film Lolita, by having the shirtless men wear them as they pursue LaBelle. She is shown watering flowers while wearing a skirt, dancing in the streets, and counting money while sitting on a lemonade stand. The men serve as LaBelle's [...] "heart eyed entourage" [...] and [...] "her own personal secret service"; they are seen washing a toy car in a carwash and presenting the singer with a life-sized teddy bear.|$|E
500|$|Lois becomes {{involved}} in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to use his powers in public {{for the first time}} to save her, and goes on to thwart a jewel thief attempting to scale a building using suction cups, captures robbers fleeing police on the river by depositing their boat at the police station, rescues a girl's cat from a tree <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> and saves Air Force One after a lightning strike destroys the port outboard engine, making the [...] "caped wonder" [...] an instant celebrity. He visits Lois at her home the next night and takes her for a flight over the city, allowing her to interview him for an article in which she names him [...] "Superman".|$|E
50|$|One year later, Karen {{finds out}} about Elizabeth's death and her letter, {{which had been}} misplaced, informing her {{that she has a}} granddaughter named Ella.

5000|$|The Changelings is a {{novel by}} Jo Sinclair (Ruth Seid) first {{published}} in 1955 by McGraw Hill.

30|$|Enginalp {{and other}} respondents’ {{practical}} and symbolic neighborhood use {{is directed to}} {{other places in the}} city, mostly ethnically diverse neighborhoods. Ferda has moved from the ethnically diverse inner-city area of Kreuzberg to a residential area in Berlin’s South-West, to find a better school for her children (Barwick, 2016). She never really warmed up to the new neighborhood and neighbors, and spends much of <b>her</b> free-time <b>in</b> <b>her</b> old <b>neighborhood,</b> where she wants to move back to as soon as her youngest child leaves primary school. Ferda highly appreciates <b>her</b> old <b>neighborhood,</b> particularly that life takes place outside in the streets and you always meet people you know and can chat with. This is a public familiarity she does not find <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own <b>neighborhood</b> of residence. Due to experiences of exclusion and marginalization in predominantly white neighborhoods, these second-generation Turks thus develop a feeling of belonging to neighborhoods other than their own.|$|R
500|$|Trimmer also {{founded and}} oversaw charity schools <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> She {{directed}} promising students from her Sunday schools, which met {{only once a}} week, to these charity schools, which met several times a week. As she wrote in her journal, these schools seemed to her to [...] "afford a happy prospect of rescuing many poor children from vice and profligacy". While the Sunday schools were funded by subscription, that is, donations from people within the parish, the charity schools were largely funded by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge (SPCK), which had funded the first charity schools around a century earlier. Trimmer criticized the rote learning {{that went on in}} traditional charity schools and tried to institute a more dynamic catechetical method in her own schools that would stimulate students to ask questions. She wrote in her journal, [...] "my earnest desire is to compose a course of teaching for Charity Schools, by which the children may learn in reality, and not by rote, the principles of the Christian Religion, as taught in the Scriptures". Trimmer also established schools of industry to which she directed her less promising pupils. These schools would teach girls, for example, how to knit and spin. Initially, Trimmer believed that the schools would turn a profit since the girls would spin and knit all day long; however, the girls were unskilled and turned out poor products that could not be sold. Trimmer viewed this project as a failure.|$|E
2500|$|Repeatedly bullied {{by white}} {{children}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> Parks often fought back physically. She later said that [...] "As {{far back as}} I remember, I could never {{think in terms of}} accepting physical abuse without some form of retaliation if possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iris (voiced by Ron) was {{an elderly}} Jewish {{woman who lived}} in Brooklyn, and was the most {{frequent}} character on the show. She spoke with a hoarse voice and often reported [...] "News for the Jews that You Can Use." [...] Her husband was in a coma, and she frequently worried about the constant change in ethnic groups <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{moved by}} Obama's election, Cousins chose {{to collect and}} wear {{different}} African fabrics from South Africa, Mali, Senegal and Ghana that were printed with Obama’s image.

2500|$|Johnston {{lived alone}} and {{had lived in}} that house for about 17 years. Her house was in a crime-ridden {{neighborhood}} in west Atlanta. People in the neighborhood speculated {{that the police had}} the wrong person, but police denied that they had the wrong house. Neighbors and family said that Johnston kept a [...] "rusty revolver" [...] for self-defense; another elderly woman <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> had recently been raped, and drug dealing was common. In the year before her death, Johnston had installed extra locks and burglar bars.|$|E
2500|$|A walk <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> {{inspired}} her first children's story, My Bent Tree. She was walking her dog {{and saw a}} crooked pine scarred by an old lightning strike. It reminded Brodsky of her own childhood encounter with polio, {{as well as her}} many clients' challenges with adversity, yet [...] "reveal great courage, inner strength and joy” by overcoming those challenges. The poem became a reflection upon early life experiences marking us permanently, but also becoming aspects of our lives that help us to grow into who we become.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} create Boxer Girl, Thalhammer applied for {{a grant from the}} DC Commission of Arts and Humanities and waited a year to receive it. After {{receiving}} the grant, Thalhammer decided to paint Boxer Girl <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own <b>neighborhood,</b> Bloomingdale, Washington D.C, {{on the side of the}} home of a long time supporter and friend, Veronica Jackson.|$|R

60|$|There {{would be}} rest there and repose. His judgment, his keen wit, his penetrating, {{powerful}} influence, made him seem a giant to her, a giant who disdained effort and gave out {{an appearance of}} indifference and lassitude. She had known physical giants <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> who spoke in soft drawl, and slouched lazily in action, but who were invincible when aroused.|$|E
60|$|Jenny Wren is a busybody. Yes, Sir, she {{certainly}} is a busybody. If there is anything going on <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> that she doesn't know about, it isn't because she doesn't try to find out. She is so small and spry {{that it is hard}} work to keep track of her, and she pops out at the most unexpected times and places. Then, before you can say a word, she is gone.|$|E
60|$|She {{waved her}} hand and rode away, and George, getting into the saddle, started his team, and thought about her while {{he listened to the}} {{crackling}} of the stubble going down beneath the hoofs, and the soft thud of thrown-back soil as the lengthening rows of clods broke away from the gleaming shares. What she might have meant by her last remark he could not tell, though so far as it concerned him, he was ready to admit that he was addicted to steady plodding. Then his thoughts took a wider range, and he began to make comparisons. Flora was not characterized by Sylvia's fastidious refinement; she was more virile and yet more reposeful. Sylvia's activities spread bustle around her; she required much assistance and everybody <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>neighborhood</b> was usually impressed into her service, though their combined efforts often led to nothing. Flora's work was done silently; the results were most apparent.|$|E
