500|$|Thorpe {{spoke to}} reporters after his 100m race, saying: [...] "When I started this I {{wanted to get}} back into the pool. I wanted to start racing again, I wanted to be {{competitive}} again and I wanted to go to the Olympics. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do all of those things. I've missed out on what was a huge goal for me to accomplish in this short period of time, but still the desire I had previous to this, it's still there." [...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E

2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play with you’. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these ‘firing somebody without firing them’ scenarios." ...|$|E

Glazer's producer Jim Wilson sent him a script that closely adapted the novel; Glazer admired the script but {{had no interest in}} filming it, saying: [...] "I knew then that I absolutely didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> film the book.

As I don't want you to do {{anything}} for me in the house at present I do not see that it will be of any use getting you livery, so we won't talk about that now.

It's like the feeling one would have going out into a storm on a dark night, away from a warm fire--only of the spirit not the body--which makes it worse. I had to tell you this; you mustn't think of it again, I mean to fight it away and forget that it has ever been there. But Uncle Nic--what am I to do? I hate myself because I am young, and he is old and weak--sometimes I seem even to hate him.

According to his own words, he was [...] "overwhelmed with patriotic feelings" [...] and decided to become a soldier instead. Vasilevsky took his exams in January 1915 and entered the Alexander Military Law Academy in February. As he recalls, [...] "I did not decide to become an officer to start a military career. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be an agronomist and work in some remote corner of Russia after the war.

5000|$|Stan Lee {{originally}} portrayed Betty Ross as {{a strong}} willed and independent-minded, yet conventionally polite woman. Mid-1980s Incredible Hulk writer/artist John Byrne portrayed her as more wilful and confrontational, characterizations which would remain in place during Peter David's long run as the series' writer. Betty has a miscarriage in The Incredible Hulk vol.2, #360. Though this occurred during David's run on the series, the issue was instead written by editor Bob Harras. David recalled, [...] "The reason I refused to do it was because Betty was really losing her child to editorial fiat. It was decided by the powers-that-be that Betty and Bruce were not to become parents because {{that would make the}} characters seem ‘too old’ to the younger readers. My run on the book almost ended with that issue; I nearly walked over it.

Nuggets were these pre-punk, psychedelic, garage albums. They produced a bunch of influential compilations in the early Seventies. So currently this is an ongoing project, laying down as many tracks as I feel like and maybe releasing a seven- or eight-song EP of the best ones once they're done." [...] In announcing the album in June 2015 he stated [...] "I had to put it out now or else there would be so many songs I'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do that I wouldn't be able to do it.
