5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident in the first week of June 1917.|$|E

Dexter accompanies {{her to the hospital}} and then returns home, apparently with Debra. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks into Dexter's apartment and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.|$|E

25|$|The 1971 TV special Play It Again, Charlie Brown was {{the first}} time that someone other than Peter Robbins voiced Charlie Brown which in this case was Chris Inglis.

25|$|Dennett {{finds that}} many people find it {{difficult}} to see this, so he uses the case of RoboMary to further illustrate what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for Mary to possess such a vast knowledge of the physical workings of the human brain and color vision. RoboMary is an intelligent robot who, instead of the ordinary color camera-eyes, has a software lock such that she is only able to perceive black and white and shades in-between.|$|E

60|$|Dale {{had shaken}} his head doubtfully when interrogated about the cowboy's absence. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just <b>like</b> Las Vegas {{never to be}} heard of again. Also <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more <b>like</b> him to remain away until all trace of his drunken, savage spell had {{departed}} from him and had been forgotten by his friends. Bo took his disappearance apparently less to heart than Helen. But Bo grew more restless, wilder, and more wilful than ever. Helen thought she guessed Bo's secret; and once she ventured a hint concerning Carmichael's return.|$|R

Their apartment is frequented by a large rat, but he finds himself unable to kill it because it is pregnant. This causes the hostess to stay at her friend's place. When Shoji visits her bar, he tells her that none of the rat's six babies came out like Hitler, and leaves her.|$|E
25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals. He enjoyed {{watching}} animals kill each other {{as well as the}} feeling he got from taking their lives. This continued as he got older. He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to do the same to a human.|$|E
25|$|As the {{two women}} sip coffee Kitty admits {{she has to go}} to {{hospital}} for a few days and wants Laura to feed her pet dog. She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. She feels a sense of what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E

25|$|Dinner is {{interrupted}} by Don Gabriel del Lago, a friend of Don Santiago's and a neighboring Spanish-Mexican landowner, who brings news that Texas has been taken from Mexico by the Americans, and that American soldiers {{under the leadership of}} Zachary Taylor have infiltrated the territory and are busy establishing defensive outposts. Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption that Americans are not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
500|$|At {{the height}} of Akhmatova's fame, in 1918, she {{divorced}} her husband and that same year, though many of her friends considered it a mistake, Akhmatova married prominent Assyriologist and poet Vladimir Shilejko. She later said “I felt so filthy. I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a cleansing, like going to a convent, knowing {{you are going to}} lose your freedom.” [...] She began affairs with [...] theatre director Mikhail Zimmerman and composer Arthur Lourié, who set many of her poems to music.|$|E
6000|$|He couldn't do it. He couldn't mock. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>like</b> sneering at a happy child. He lied ponderously: [...] "You bet! Best party this year, {{by a long}} shot." ...|$|R

500|$|One of Sunny's most {{high-profile}} storylines was a kiss between {{herself and}} female character, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said [...] "For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to kiss Zeke. Now Donna's gone and stolen the moment – and Sunny's not happy, to say the least..." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Long John Peter" [...] {{contained}} several {{pop culture}} references. When Chris sees Anna {{for the first}} time, he starts singing the song [...] "Crazy for You", which was originally performed by Madonna in the film Vision Quest (1985). When Peter is fighting a British man, the title music from The Sea Hawk (1940), composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, is used. The episode imagines what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if Michael J. Fox, who has [...] Parkinson's disease, would star as Zorro. In a trailer for a film, the tune from Coldplay's [...] "Clocks" [...] is played.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E

60|$|This, {{she took}} it, {{was a fair}} sample of what she might expect after marriage. Marriage meant--to come to essentials--that two people were very often and for lengthy periods alone together, {{dependent}} on each other for mutual entertainment. What exactly <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> being alone often and for lengthy periods with Freddie? Well, <b>it</b> <b>would,</b> she assumed, <b>be</b> <b>like</b> this.|$|R
500|$|The Guardian {{columnist}} Zoe Williams criticised {{the actual}} waterboarding in the torture scene, saying [...] "it's really unpleasant, [...] concurred. 'I only lasted five to 10 seconds, {{and the sound}} of my voice crying out to stop isn't me acting.' Pal, that's nice that you're not showing off but this is all wrong and despicable: it's like locking yourself and 10 friends into a loo on a commuter train, to see what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> on the train to Auschwitz. If you can make it stop whenever you like, you're learning nothing and kicking people in the face while you're at it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Astronaut Mike Dexter {{was first}} referenced in this episode, in which Liz considers {{him to be}} her imaginary perfect husband. In [...] "Sun Tea", [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown) pretends to be Mike Dexter, Liz's [...] "crazy black boyfriend", to help her get Brian out of his apartment. In the following episode, [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show", actor John Anderson played the character, when Liz fantasizes about what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> following the success of her talk show, and is then notified by Mike Dexter {{that he has to}} go back to outer space. Astronaut Mike Dexter would be mentioned further in the season.|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} [...] "Apollo, Apollo", Jack wonders what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> {{to see the world}} through NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) eyes, {{revealing}} that Kenneth sees everyone as Muppets. To accommodate this, Sesame Street puppeteers Joey Mazzarino, Carmen Osbahr, and Matt Vogel were brought in to do the muppet versions of Jack, Liz, and Tracy Jordan. This angle would later be used again in the show's fourth season episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Kenneth appears as a muppet while walking by a high-definition camera. In addition, the program was parodied by Sesame Street, in the show's 39th season, entitled [...] "30 Rocks".|$|E
6000|$|... "How funny!" [...] she exclaimed, {{knitting}} her brows. [...] "I can't {{remember any}} prisoner at the villa. Perhaps it <b>was</b> the cat. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> just <b>like</b> Silvio {{to consider the}} release of a cat a important event." ...|$|R
