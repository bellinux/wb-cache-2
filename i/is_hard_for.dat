5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, as he did not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E

25|$|This motivates {{the concept}} of a problem being hard for a {{complexity}} class. A problem X <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.|$|E

25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> her to understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of}} the play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
25|$|Performance jobs include {{playing as}} a freelancer in small groups, {{playing in a}} chamber music group, large ensembles, or {{performing}} solo music, either live onstage or as a session player for radio or TV broadcasts or for recordings; and working as the employee of an orchestra, big band, or recording studio. Many cello players find extra work by substituting ("subbing") for cellists who are double-booked or ill. It <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> many cello players {{to be able to}} find full-time, full-year work at a single job. About the closest that a cellist can come to this is in the case of those who win an audition at a professional orchestra. Even full-time orchestra jobs do not usually last for the entire year. When the orchestra stops playing (which is often in the summer), orchestral cellists have to find other work, either as a teacher or coach, or in another group.|$|E

25|$|A species {{could benefit}} greatly from better {{abilities}} to reason about, predict {{and understand the}} world. French social and cognitive scientist Dan Sperber, with his colleague Hugo Mercier, describes {{the idea that there}} could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. Sperber points out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> individuals to doubt their own beliefs. Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective - as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. Sperber says this could suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. They also claim that reason may {{have more to do with}} winning arguments than with the search for the truth.|$|E
25|$|Despite initial {{problems}} caused by Natalie's overbearing mother who tries {{to take over the}} wedding plans, Natalie and Barry marry on New Years Eve in 1999, in a joint wedding with Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Melanie Healy (Tamzin Outhwaite). They live with Barry's father Roy (Tony Caunter) and stepmother Pat (Pam St. Clement) and are relatively happy until Natalie becomes pregnant. Preferring to concentrate on her career, and unable to make Barry realise how she feels, Natalie plans an abortion. When Barry comes to the clinic, pledging to support her decision, Natalie changes her mind and does not have the termination. Barry is overjoyed and agrees to give up work and look after the baby so she can work, giving birth to son Jack (Samuel and Joseph Timson) early in 2002—the birth is traumatic as Jack was born feet first. Motherhood <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Natalie; she begins to feel that she has two children, Jack and Barry. When Barry's half brother, Nathan Williams (Doug Allen), moves in briefly, he makes Natalie an unsuspecting pawn in his vendetta. Determined to ruin Barry, Nathan tries to seduce Natalie and they kiss briefly but she soon realises that Nathan wants to ruin Barry and banishes him from their lives. Barry forgives Natalie; their marriage remains intact but Natalie grows increasingly unhappy with Barry's immaturity.|$|E
25|$|In Jared Diamond's {{groundbreaking}} Guns, Germs, and Steel, he {{lays out}} the basic arguments for Environmental determinism - that environments and geography determine the political institutions of a certain region. Starting from the same attempt to explain why Eurasian civilizations have outlived other civilizations that used {{to exist in the}} world, Diamond looks at the geographical differences among different civilizations and the agricultural practices that have arisen from those differences. For example, because of the latitudinal differences between the Eurasian continent and American/African continents—the Eurasian continent has a large longitudinal span while the American/African continents are longitudinally narrow—it is easier for inhabitants of the Eurasian continent to spread the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals like wheat, cows and horses. On the other hand, for African and American continents, because of the wide latitudinal differences of different regions, it <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the same kind of agricultural products and domesticated animals to spread. Because of this difference, people on Eurasian continent are more likely to develop stronger immune systems and thus their civilizations are more likely to survive. However, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, the theory is incapable of explaining the {{gap between rich and poor}} countries after 1500. It is also powerless in explaining the difference of economic growth between two places with similar or same geographic conditions, like Nogales, Sonora and Nogales, Arizona, North Korea and South Korea and East Germany and West Germany. In comparison, according to the book, geographical factors do not have as strong an explanatory power as institutional factors. Especially in the modern age when advanced technology is widely available, the reason why Equatorial Guinea or Sierra Leone still suffer from diseases like Malaria is not because of the weather, but because of the poor institutions underlying those states.|$|E

Thus, according to their conjecture, clique has no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. Moreover, this result provides the basis for proofs of W-hardness of many other problems, and thus serves as an analogue of the Cook–Levin theorem for parameterized complexity.|$|E
