40|$|Citrulline malate that is {{essential}} for the biosynthesis of arginine promotes dehydration of ammonium endotoxins, by participating in the urea cycle. The indications for the use of citrulline malate are <b>functional</b> <b>asthenia,</b> asthenic syndrome, overfatigue, increased fatigue, and rehabilitation during recovery following diseases. Objective: to simulate the biological properties of citrulline malate. Material and methods. Reliable estimates of more than 2, 500 biological activities were obtained for this molecule, which were compared with those of the reference molecules of acetylcarnitine and meldonium. Results and discussion. The data obtained from chemoreactome simulation may suggest that there are substantial differences between the pharmacological effects of citrulline malate and the reference molecules. Malate anion as a component of citrulline malate significantly enhances the absorption of citrulline molecules in the gastrointestinal tract regardless of gastric acidity. Citrulline malate improves renal bicarbonate anion absorption, which contributes to the overcoming of acidosis. The results of chemoreactome simulation indicate that citrulline malate has antidepressant, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties, which can make a substantial contribution to the development of anti-asthenic and detoxifying effects of the drug. Citrulline malate can also show anticoagulant, antivasopressor, hypoglycemic, antihypercholesterolemic, and antimicrobial effects. These properties of citrulline malate can contribute to the earliest recovery of patients after asthenia or intensive strenuous exercises as compared to those of the reference molecules (meldonium, acetylcarnitine). Conclusion. The findings are consistent with the available experimental and clinical data and are indicative of promising clinical applications of citrulline malate.  </p...|$|E
40|$|Multiple extraintestinal {{diseases}} {{are present in}} 0. 3 - 4. 5 % of inflammatory bowel disease patients. A 39 -year-old woman was admitted with a 3 months history of cervicalgia with <b>functional</b> incapacity, <b>asthenia,</b> tibio-tarsal bilateral arthritis and bloody diarrhoea. She had ferropenic anemia, SR- 120 mm, creatinine clearance- 42 mL/min, proteinuria- 1. 2 g/ 24 h. Colonoscopy with biopsy showed active ulcerative rectossigmoiditis. She had bilateral sacroileitis more pronounced at the right side which was suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. HLA B 27 was positive. Because of colestasis, colangio-MRI and CPRE were done and were suggestive of primary sclerosing colangitis. Renal disease was interpreted as an analgesic nephropathy versus glomerulonephritis associated with ulcerative colitis. Cardiac ecodoppler showed pericardial thickening with a thin pericardial effusion. Full improvement of gastrointestinal complaints was observed with 5 -ASA topic enemas, sulfassalazine, corticosteroids and azathioprine and full remission of ankylosing spondylitis with adalimumab. This case illustrates extraintestinal wide involvement as the initial presentation of ulcerative colitis, remarking its systemic nature.

40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of {{psychological}} relaxation on the heart rate variability (HRV) in subjects with a number of negative <b>functional</b> states: <b>asthenia,</b> depression, and neurotic symptoms. The analysis performed allowed us to reveal the dynamics of the HRV variables characteristic of each negative functional state and to determine indicators, which are significant for their diagnosis. The effectiveness of using HRV analysis for the control and management of the psychological relaxation process and the diagnosis of a number of negative functional states in humans is substantiated by the study results. In 1997, a special course for the development of self-regulation and autotraining habits in NPS operators that included the system of psychotechnical exercises, autogenic immersion according to M. M. Reshetnikov's variant, and psychological relaxation sessions based on the method of image identification using theatrical and musical compositions was developed at the Psychophysiological Survey Laboratory (PSL) of the Novovoronezh Center for Training NPS Personnel. Physiological control of the functional state of the human during psychological relaxation played an important role when administering this course. To solve this task, we decided to use the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis that is used at the PSL when carrying out a psychophysiological survey of NPS personnel. HRV analysis gained wide acceptance over the last ten years as a method that allows us to quantitatively characterize the activity of different divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) through their influence on the function of the sinus node of the heart, which is reflected in variations in the duration of the RR-intervals [I]...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{integrated}} {{assessment of}} adolescent health in Kemerovo including quality of life. Methods: The case history, objective physical examination, {{the quality of}} life questionnaire, clinical, laboratory, instrumental, sociological and statistic. Results: Adolescent health status of industrial city is characterized by moderate aggravation of genealogical anamnesis, high risk of aggravation of biological anamnesis; more than half of adolescents (57. 9 %) have good indicators of social anamnesis, 18. 8 % of them are in the dispensary group on social anamnesis, 23, 2 % of them are in risk group. Slowdown of accelerated growth and development, the increasing number of adolescents with low stature and weight deficit; body size circumference and breadth reduction, reduction of <b>functional</b> measures, <b>asthenia</b> (increase in people with asthenic constitution); gracilization (body size circumference and breadth decrease, decrease of the total mass of skeletal muscles) is typical for adolescents living in Kemerovo; most adolescents refer to the group of people with normal neuro-psychological development, 28. 26 % of adolescents refer to a group of attention. Adolescents mostly have good (50. 86 %) and decreased (31. 67 %) levels of resistance. According to integrated assessment of adolescent health the first group of health includes 11. 32 % of teenagers, the second group - 58. 16 %, the third group - 27. 83 % of teenagers; the fourth group - 2, 11 % ± and 0. 59 % - the fifth group of health. Quality of life indicator related to health of Kemerovo adolescents are characterized by high level of social and moderate level of emotional functioning and the low assessment of life at school. Scope of the results: The author suggests including the investigation of quality of life in a comprehensive studing methods of health of adolescents...|$|R
