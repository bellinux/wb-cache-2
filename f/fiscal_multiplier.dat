The reason for this is that imperfect competition in the output market tends to reduce the real wage, leading to the household substituting away from consumption towards leisure. When government spending is increased, the corresponding increase in lump-sum taxation causes both leisure and consumption decrease (assuming that they are both a normal good). The greater the degree of imperfect competition in the output market, the lower the real wage and hence the more the reduction falls on leisure (i.e. households work more) and less on consumption.

40|$|<b>Fiscal</b> {{spending}} <b>multiplier</b> calculations {{have been}} revived {{in the aftermath}} of the global financial crisis. Much of the current literature is based on VAR estimation methods and DSGE models. The aim of this paper is not a further deepening of this literature but rather to implement a calculation method of multipliers which is suitable for open economies like EU member states. To this end, Input-Output tables are used as by this means the import intake of domestic demand components can be isolated in order to get an appropriate base for the calculation of the relevant import quotas. The difference of this method is substantial – on average the calculated multipliers are 15 % higher than the conventional GDP <b>fiscal</b> spending <b>multiplier</b> for EU members. Multipliers for specific spending categories are comparably high, ranging between 1. 4 and 1. 8 for many members of the EU.

This thesis studies the effectiveness of EERP by reviewing the studies behind the <b>fiscal</b> policy <b>multiplier.</b> The primary focus is on the newest research in the euro are context. Based on the literature review, it’s evident that EERP had positive effects on the real GDP growth. The focus of this thesis was both on the theories and models on the determinants of effective fiscal policy and on empirical studies estimating the multiplier. When EERP was launched, interest rates were closing the zero lower bound, which historically and theoretically leads to more effective fiscal policy. Several studies that use modern DSGE-models with the assumptions of co-existing Ricardian and non-Ricardian households estimate the <b>fiscal</b> policy <b>multiplier</b> for the EERP to have been positive but under unity in the short run, in the zero-interest context that prevailed. In the long run, the effects were estimated to be more moderate, under some assumptions even negative.

40|$|The {{reactions}} to the stimulus package of the Obama administration have been controver-sial. Some predict a multiplier effect {{in the order of}} 1. 5, others argue that the multiplier will be less than 0. 5. Multiplier estimates typically stem from estimated linear vector autoregres-sions (VARs) or simulations generated generated by DSGE models. The latter, presuming intertemporally optimizing agents, largely negate any impact of the fiscal stimulus package. In this paper, we will argue that neither conventional VAR analysis nor DGSE simulations may be appropriate to evaluate demand effects arising from such a stimulus package. The reason is that, as recent research suggests, the timing of demand shocks matters. To assess the multiplier’s variability, we adopt regime–dependent VAR approach. As we show in detail, our model specification is grounded on theoretical considerations. The empirical analysis presented here suggests that a regime–dependent VAR–specification is favored for U. S. output and employment data, and that the standard (one–regime) VAR methodology is inappropriate for multi–regime processes. Although we employ a nonlinear VAR framework, the chosen setup allows us to make largely use of familiar macroecono-metric modeling tools. Estimating a two–regime VAR, we show that responses to shocks depend {{on the state of the}} business cycle and the particular nature of the shock.

The analysis focuses on two dimensions {{that are critical}} for understanding government investment as a fiscal stimulus: implementation delays for building public capital and expected fiscal adjustments to deficit-financed spending. Implementation delays can produce small or even negative labor and output responses to increases in government investment in the short run.

40|$|We {{study the}} size of fiscal {{multipliers}} {{in response to a}} government spending shock under different household leverage conditions in a general equilibrium setting with search and matching frictions. We allow for different levels of household indebtedness by changing the intensive margin of borrowing (loan-to-value ratio), as well as the extensive margin, defined as the number of borrowers over total population. The interaction between the consumption decisions of agents with limited access to credit and the process of wage bargaining and vacancy posting delivers two main results: (a) higher initial leverage makes it more likely to find output multipliers higher than one; and (b) a positive government expenditure shock always produces a positive multiplier for vacancies and employment. The latter result is in sharp contrast with models in which some households {{do not have access to}} the financial market (RoT consumers), in which the implied labor market responses to fiscal shocks are inconsistent with the empirical evidence. We also find that the impact on GDP of consolidations is lower when consumers have a more limited capacity to borrow, and that increasing government spending in an episode of intense private deleveraging can still generate positive and significant effects on consumption and output, although the <b>fiscal</b> output (employment) <b>multiplier</b> decreases (increases) with the intensity of the credit crunch.

50|$|In economics, the <b>fiscal</b> <b>multiplier</b> (not to be {{confused}} with monetary multiplier) is the ratio of a change in national income to the change in government spending that causes it. More generally, the exogenous spending multiplier is the ratio of a change in national income to any autonomous change in spending (private investment spending, consumer spending, government spending, or spending by foreigners on the country's exports) that causes it. When this multiplier exceeds one, the enhanced effect on national income is called the multiplier effect. The mechanism that can give rise to a multiplier effect is that an initial incremental amount of spending can lead to increased consumption spending, increasing income further and hence further increasing consumption, etc., resulting in an overall increase in national income greater than the initial incremental amount of spending. In other words, an initial change in aggregate demand may cause a change in aggregate output (and hence the aggregate income that it generates) that is a multiple of the initial change.|$|E

5000|$|If {{increased}} borrowing {{leads to}} {{higher interest rates}} by creating a greater demand for money and loanable funds and hence a higher [...] "price" [...] (ceteris paribus), the private sector, which is sensitive to interest rates, will likely reduce investment due to a lower rate of return. This is the investment that is crowded out. The weakening of fixed investment and other interest-sensitive expenditure counteracts to varying extents the expansionary effect of government deficits. More importantly, a fall in fixed investment by business can hurt long-term economic growth of the supply side, i.e., the growth of potential output.Thus, {{the situation in which}} borrowing may lead to crowding out is that companies would like to expand productive capacity, but, because of high interest rates, cannot borrow funds with which to do so.

[...] Another American economist, Paul Krugman, pointed out that, after the beginning of the recession in 2008, the federal government's borrowing increased by hundreds of billions of dollars, leading to warnings about crowding out, but instead interest rates had actually fallen. When aggregate demand is low, government spending tends to expand the market for private-sector products through the <b>fiscal</b> <b>multiplier</b> and thus stimulates - or [...] "crowds in" [...] - fixed investment (via the [...] "accelerator effect").

This dissertation analyzes the Indonesian economy with special emphasis on the period from 1968 to 1980, and attempts to build a quarterly macro-monetary model to trace the effect of money on prices, real output and the balance of payments. The model is a simultaneous model where prices, money supply, and real output are determined endogenously. While retaining the monetary phenomenon of inflation, we can also examine the direct impact of import prices in the price equation and make a distinction between imports of intermediate goods and consumer goods. The income concept used in this study is the monetized income concept. Despite its relatively small size, the model is rich in implications for stabilization policies. The estimation results show that the model has captured the Indonesian economy quite well both in terms of validity and predictability. It also reveals that for each 10 percent domestic inflation, other things remaining equal, some 3 percent is caused by foreign inflation. In the non-oil export function, all the coefficients have the correct signs and are statistically significant. The imports of consumer goods does not seem to respond to foreign prices and the availability of foreign exchange. On the other hand, the imports of intermediate goods, which are not domestically substitutable, is very inelastic with respect to its prices, relative to domestic prices, {{and there seems to be}} a very slow speed of adjustment.
