5|$|On July 26, 2013, the executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson filed a {{petition}} in the United States Tax Court {{as a result}} of a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) over U.S. federal <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> imposed on the value of Jackson's Estate at the time of his death. The executors claim that the Estate was worth about $7 million. The IRS asserts that the Estate was worth over $1.1 billion, and that over $700 million in federal <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> (including penalties) are due. A trial was held from February 6 to 24, 2017. As of early July 2017, no decision has been rendered.|$|E

50|$|An NRA {{is subject}} to a {{different}} <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> regime than a U.S. taxpayer. The <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> is imposed only {{on the part of}} the gross NRA's estate that at the time of death is situated in the United States. These rules may be ameliorated by an <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> treaty. The U.S. does not maintain as many <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> treaties as income tax treaties, but there are <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> treaties in place with many of the major European countries, Australia, and Japan.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, {{there were}} 7,000 {{students}} {{whose parents were}} employed {{by the federal government}} which pays no local real <b>estate</b> <b>taxes.</b> The budget is fairly dependent on real <b>estate</b> <b>taxes.</b> As a result, the federal government contributes money through the Federal Impact Aid program by way of compensation. However, in 2010, the amount had dropped from an expected $43 million to $5 million due to cuts in the federal budget.|$|E

5000|$|The {{gift tax}} is a {{backstop}} to the United States <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> Without the gift <b>tax,</b> large <b>estates</b> {{could be reduced}} by simply giving the money away prior to death, and thus escape any potential <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> Gifts above the annual exemption amount act to reduce the lifetime gift tax exclusion. Congress initially passed the gift tax in 1932 {{at a much lower}} rate than the <b>estate</b> <b>tax,</b> a full 25% under the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> rate, while also providing a $50,000 exemption, separate from the $50,000 exemption under <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b> The benefits were clear: a $10,000,000 gift would be taxed only $2,300,000, effectively only 23.0%, well below the <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> rate.|$|R
50|$|An <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> was {{included}} in the War Revenue Act. This was not the first <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> enacted {{in the history of the}} United States, but its graduated nature made it the precursor to the modern federal <b>estate</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|R

25|$|When Alfred died in 1935, {{his estate}} was valued at over $56 million, which, after <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> of $30 million, left $26 million.

On 23 December 1971, following a particularly tough series of battles, he left Canada, ostensibly because of the estate tax situation: the Federal government planned to abolish <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> while the government of Premier Richard Hatfield (along with the other Maritime governments) planned to introduce an estate tax in its place.

40|$|Although the Ricardian Equivalence Theorem holds under {{a linear}} <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> schedule, {{it fails to}} hold under a {{nonlinear}} <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> schedule. In a representative consumer economy, a temporary lump-sum tax increase reduces contemporaneous consumption. If different consumers face different marginal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> rates because they leave bequests of different sizes, a lump-sum tax increase redistributes resources from consumers in low marginal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> brackets to consumers in high marginal <b>estate</b> <b>tax</b> brackets; aggregate consumption may rise, fall, or remain unchanged.

25|$|Dynasty trust (also {{known as}} a generation-skipping trust): A type of trust in which assets are passed down to the grantor's grand{{children}}, not the grantor's children. The children of the grantor never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to avoid the <b>estate</b> <b>taxes</b> that would apply if the assets were transferred {{to his or her}} children first. Generation-skipping trusts can still be used to provide financial benefits to a grantor's children, however, because any income generated by the trust's assets can be made accessible to the grantor's children while still leaving the assets in trust for the grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, wealthy {{individuals}} started choosing to reside in low tax jurisdictions to reduce their taxable income. Gibraltar being such a jurisdiction attracted these wealthy individuals. In the 1930s refugees of extreme political regimes sought sanctuary for their goods and assets in Gibraltar. Asset holding and protection still continues in Gibraltar and usually involves trust companies with low taxation. Gibraltar functions as an offshore financial centre. Offshore companies in Gibraltar became popular during the blockade and provided business for lawyers and accountants. Gibraltar used to offer offshore companies a 25-year guarantee against income and <b>estate</b> <b>taxes.</b> This aspect of Gibraltar influenced nationality in that it allowed high-net-worth individuals to be granted residence on a discretionary basis.|$|E
