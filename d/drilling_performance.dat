There are different methods to manage the dust make often based on some form of “wet” drilling which can cause further issues.

50|$|Initially in 1989 the Reviews {{consisted}} of twelve operators, who agreed {{a process for}} sharing offset drilling data for the first time. A standard set of metrics and definitions were employed by all twelve, and quality control was added to ensure the data was sufficiently reliable to be of real use to them. This {{became known as the}} <b>Drilling</b> <b>Performance</b> Review (DPR).Until 1993 the DPR was managed by the Operators themselves. However this was not a core activity for them and it was agreed that the DPR would be outsourced to Rushmore Reviews, who worked to increase the scope of the Reviews, as requested by the existing participants. Eventually the DPR grew to hold data for more than 50,000 wells.|$|E
5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} {{rolling cutter}} drill bit design was disclosed in U.S. patents granted to Howard R. Hughes, Sr. on August 10, 1909, and {{which led to}} the creation of what became the Hughes Tool Company. This bit employed two conical steel rolling elements with milled teeth that engaged the formation, when the device was rotated, to produce the cutting action. This design represented a significant improvement in <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> over the so-called [...] "fish tail" [...] scraper type bits commonly used in rotary drilling at the time, and over the next two decades, rotary drilling with rolling cutter bits largely replaced all other drilling methods in the oilfield. The significance of the Hughes Two-Cone Drill Bit was recognized on its 100th anniversary when it was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.|$|E
40|$|Drilling {{operations}} management will face hurdles {{to reduce costs}} and increase performance, and {{to do this with}} less experience and organizational drilling capacity. A technology called Drilling Simulators Software has shown an extraordinary potential to improve the <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> and reduce risk and cost. Different approaches have been made to develop drilling-simulator software. The Virtual Experience Simulator, geological drilling logs, and reconstructed lithology {{are some of the most}} successful. The drilling simulations can run multiple scenarios quickly and then update plans with new data to improve the results. Its storage capacity for retaining field drilling experience and knowledge add value to the program. This research shows the results of using drilling simulator software called Drilling Optimization Simulator (DROPS?) in the evaluation of the Aloctono block, in the Pirital field, eastern Venezuela. This formation is characterized by very complex geology, containing faulted restructures, large dips, and hard and abrasive rocks. The <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> in this section has a strong impact in the profitability of the field. A number of simulations using geological drilling logs and the concept of the learning curve defined the optimum drilling parameters for the block. The result shows that DROPS? has the capability to simulate the <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> of the area with reasonable accuracy. Thus, it is possible to predict the <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> using different bits and the learning-curve concept to obtain optimum drilling parameters. All of these allow a comprehensive and effective cost and drilling optimization...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{demonstrated}} in laboratory tests that drilling with surface-charge-neutralizing concentrations of polyethylene oxide (PEO) polymer solutions simultaneously improves penetration rates and extends bit life. The applicability of this additive to improve <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> in coal measure rocks was demonstrated {{under field conditions}} at an abandoned mine land site in Pennsylvania and a producing coal mine property in Ohio. Penetration rate improvements ranging from 15 to 50 pet were obtained when core drilling {{through a variety of}} coal measure lithologies. Drilling cost analysis indicates that the small added cost of using the polymer is more than offset by the savings that result from demonstrated increased drilling penetration rates, which translate into drilling cost savings of about 10 to 30 pct. This report also gives chemical analyses of a variety of coal measure rocks and some corresponding local drilling water samples, obtained from a wide geographical base, along with threshold concentrations of PEO required to effect the improved <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> in these rocks. From these data, the threshold PEO concentrations needed to ensure improved <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> can be estimated for any coal measure rock suite.

40|$|Hydraulic pulse {{tools are}} one of the {{well-known}} tools to create vibrational forces in drill-strings. It is known that these vibrational forces applied behind the bit can affect the drilling rate in medium strength formations. This thesis investigates the action of these types of tools behind the bit through the series of Distinct Element Method (DEM) simulations. Two types of hydraulic pulse tools are evaluated and characterized in this thesis. The Valved-flow tool (AGT) and the Hydropulse tool. A unique simulation scenario was designed to simulate these tools in the DEM environment. Then this scenario combined with simulation of drilling process to simulate the drilling with the AGT and the Hydropulse tool. Results of the simulations showed significant increase in <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> when the AGT was used in the process. Simulation results of the two types of tools were analyzed and compared to each other. The results showed that the AGT tool with accompanying shock tool has better performance than the integrated Hydropulse tool and drilling bit. The shock tool produces axial compliance in the drill-string. Results of additional simulations revealed the effect of compliance on <b>drilling</b> <b>performance.</b> These results showed that if the AGT is deployed without accompanying shock tool, it can have strong negative effect on drilling rate. On the other hand, the results suggested the use of shock tool in Hydropulse tool assembly since the <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> improved when shock tool was used in combination with the Hydropulse tool. It was observed from the iii simulation results that the <b>drilling</b> <b>performance</b> of the Hydropulse tool was increase by more than 100...|$|E

40|$|Rotary {{blasthole}} drills {{operating in}} a western Canadian surface coal mine were instrumented with microprocessor-based monitoring equipment. During routine production <b>drilling,</b> the <b>performance</b> parameters of penetration rate, torque, rotary speed, pulldown and bailing air pressure were monitored at sampling intervals of 10 centimeters (4 inches). The acquired digital data were subsequently correlated with both geological and geomechanical rock properties permitting a detailed examination of machine-rock interaction. The results from a statistical analysis of the drill data identified unique ranges of performance parameters for the sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and coal units encountered at the mine. Correlation of these ranges with geophysical logs in the monitored boreholes, enabled a further calibration of drilling parameter variation to rock type. A relationship between <b>drill</b> <b>performance</b> parameter responses and rock compressive and shear strength was established. This correlation demonstrated the possibility of estimating rock strength properties based on <b>drill</b> <b>performance</b> data. Trend analysis techniques applied to the monitored drill data permitted a further {{understanding of the nature}} of tricone bit wear for the particular study environment.

40|$|The dual-reciprocating drill (DRD) is a biologically-inspired low-mass {{alternative}} to traditional drilling techniques, using backwards-facing teethed halves to grip the surrounding substrate, generating a traction force {{that reduces the}} required overhead penetration force. Previous experiments using a proof-of-concept test bench have provided evidence as to the significant role of sideways movements and lateral forces in improving <b>drilling</b> <b>performance.</b> The system is also progressing to a first system prototype concept, in which an actuation mechanism is integrated within the drill heads. To experimentally {{determine the effect of}} lateral motions, a new internal actuation mechanism was developed to allow the inclusion of controlled sideways movements, resulting {{in the creation of the}} circular and diagonal burrowing motions. This paper presents an investigation into the performance of the reciprocation and burrowing motions by testing them in a planetary regolith simulant. Analysis of force sensor measurements has shown a relationship between the penetration and traction forces and the internal friction of the mechanism and depth achieved. These tests have also experimentally demonstrated the benefit of lateral motions in <b>drilling</b> <b>performance,</b> with both the burrowing mechanisms and drilling tests performed at an angle able to penetrate further than traditional vertical reciprocation, leading to the proposition of new burrowing and diagonal drilling mechanics. From this, a new fully integrated system prototype can be developed which incorporates lateral motions that can optimise the <b>drilling</b> <b>performance...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Automated rock {{recognition}} {{is a key}} step for building a fully autonomous mine. When characterizing rock types from <b>drill</b> <b>performance</b> data, the main challenge {{is that there is}} not an obvious one-to-one correspondence between the two. In this paper, a hybrid rock recognition approach is proposed which combines Gaussian Process (GP) regression with clustering. <b>Drill</b> <b>performance</b> data is also known as Measurement While Drilling (MWD) data and a rock hardness measure- Adjusted Penetration Rate (APR) is extracted using the raw data in discrete drill holes. GP regression is then applied to create a more dense APR distribution, followed by clustering which produces discrete class labels. No initial labelling is needed. Comparisons are made with alternative measures of rock hardness from MWD data as well as state-of-the-art GP classification. Experimental results from an actual mine site show the effectiveness of our proposed approach. I...|$|R
40|$|High speed {{twist drills}} are {{probably}} the most common of all metal cutting tools and also the least efficient. In this study, detailed research was undertaken into aspects of <b>drill</b> <b>performance</b> and ways in which drilling could be improved in short hole depths of up to two diameters. The work included an evaluation of twist drill geometry and grinding parameters. It was established that errors in point grinding lead to increased hole oversize and reduced drill life. A fundamental analysis was made to establish predictive equations for the drill torque and thrust using modified orthogonal cutting equations and empirical data. A good correlation was obtained between actual and predicted results. Two new techniques for extending twist drill life by the use of coolant feeding holes and also the application of titanium nitride coatings were evaluated. Both methods were found to have potential for improving <b>drill</b> <b>performance.</b> A completely new design of carbide tipped drill was designed and developed. The new design was tested and it compared favourably with two commercially available carbide tipped drills. In further work an entirely different type of drill point geometry was developed for the drill screw. A new design was produced which enabled the drilling time to be minimised for the low thrust forces that were likely to be used with hand held power tools...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} recent {{results of}} an investigation on failure mode and wear of rock-bits used to drill geothermal wells located {{in the area of}} Larderello (Italy). A new wear mechanism, conceived from drilling records and dull bit evaluation analysis, has been identified and a particular configuration of rock-bit has been developed and tested in order to reduce drilling costs. The role of high Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) on rock-bit performances seems not yet very well understood: so far, only drillability and formation abrasiveness are generally considered to account for poor <b>drilling</b> <b>performances.</b> In this paper, the detrimental effects of high BHT on sealing and reservoir system of Friction Bearing Rock-bits (FBR) have been investigated, and a new bearing wear pattern for FBR's run in high BHT holes has been identified and further verified via laboratory inspections on dull bits. A novel interpretation of flat worn cutting structure has been derived from the above wear pattern, suggesting the design of a particular bit configuration. Test bits, designed {{in the light of the}} above criteria, have been prepared and field tested successfully. The paper reports the results of these tests, which yielded a new rock-bit application, today considered as a standad practice in Italian geothermal fields. This application suggests that the correct evaluation of rock-bit wear can help to improve the overall <b>drilling</b> <b>performances</b> and to minimize drilling problems through a better interpretation of the relationships amongst rock-bits, formation properties and downhole temperature...|$|R
