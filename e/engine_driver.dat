5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Welensky found {{employment}} with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become a locomotive <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E
5|$|Born in Tasmania, McGee gained {{employment}} as an <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> with the Tasmanian Department of Railways. In March 1916, he {{enlisted in the}} Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. He was posted to the 40th Battalion, and completed training in Tasmania and the United Kingdom, where {{he was promoted to}} lance corporal. Transferring to the Western Front in November 1916, McGee was rapidly promoted to corporal then sergeant, and took part in the Battle of Messines. He was killed in action on 12 October 1917, eight days after his Victoria Cross exploit.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find work, Fisher and {{his brother}} emigrated to Queensland in 1885. Despite leaving Scotland, Fisher {{is said to have}} {{retained}} a distinctive Scottish accent {{for the rest of his}} life. Here, Fisher worked as a miner, first in Burrum and then in Gympie. He became an <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> (a role involving the operation of machinery to raise and lower cages in the mine shaft) after attaining the necessary qualifications in 1891. In the same year, he was also elected as the president of an engine driver's union. He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union, becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> at a cotton factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E
25|$|In older locomotives, it was {{necessary}} for the <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the load meter (an indicator that shows the <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.|$|E

30|$|Based on the interviewed trespassers {{the most}} {{effective}} measures to prevent trespassing would be fencing the tracks or building an underpass. However, building an underpass {{did not belong to}} the most frequently suggested countermeasures among <b>engine</b> <b>drivers.</b> This finding suggests that <b>engine</b> <b>drivers</b> were more realistic while including the cost of countermeasures in their assessment. Specifically, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that <b>engine</b> <b>drivers</b> know that the resources available for countermeasures are limited and building an underpass is one of the most expensive ones. (The Finnish Rail Administration is responsible for building and maintenance of railway infrastructure in Finland.) The trespassers primarily suggested countermeasures that were the most convenient for them.|$|R
25|$|Albert Lowerson, nicknamed Alby, {{was born}} in Myrtleford, a town {{in the state of}} Victoria, on 2 August 1896. His father worked for the {{railways}} as an <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> but later turned his hand to farming. Lowerson worked as a gold miner after leaving school.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of a loss of braking due to {{reservoir}} depletion, the <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> may be able to regain control with an emergency brake application, as the emergency portion of each car's dual-compartment reservoir should be fully chargedit is not affected by normal service reductions. The triple valves detect an emergency reduction based on the rate of brake pipe pressure reduction. Therefore, as long as a sufficient volume of air can be rapidly vented from the brake pipe, each car's triple valve will cause an emergency brake application. However, if the brake pipe pressure is too low due to an excessive number of brake applications, an emergency application will not produce a large enough volume of air flow to trip the triple valves, leaving the <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> with no means to stop the train.|$|E

25|$|April 1970. A train hauled by {{locomotive}} No 2 Northern Chief was in {{collision with}} a car at Botolph's Bridge level crossing, south of Palmarsh. The swift action of the <b>engine</b> <b>driver,</b> Cyril Carter, resulted in a low impact collision, and nobody was injured. The locomotive was slightly damaged. The car, an Austin 1100, was damaged, but not destroyed.|$|E
30|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>drivers</b> also {{indicated}} that old, disused level crossings are problematic. Specifically, they reported that people are still using these sites despite their use no longer being legal. This suggests that old roads leading there should be removed. The <b>engine</b> <b>drivers</b> also suggested {{that some of the}} sites, where trespassing occurs a lot, should be made legal pedestrian crossings by improving the visibility of the sites and installing alarm equipment.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey is}} {{presented}} {{of data on}} noise and vibration sources in modern locomotives and their influence on <b>engine</b> <b>drivers.</b> An attempt is made hierarchize noise and vibration sources in terms of importance and to correlate the noise level with the influence of noise on the engine drivers' organ of hearing.

30|$|First, {{the survey}} was {{conducted}} to explore the sites were trespassing occur. In the survey form, drivers were asked about locations where they have frequently observed trespassers and for their suggestions of potential preventive measures. The survey forms were delivered to all workplaces across the whole railway network in Finland. Thus, the <b>engine</b> <b>drivers</b> could focus on problematic sites {{in the area where}} they usually drive trains. The survey form included a map of the area close to the workplace and a table where problematic sites were to be listed. In addition, drivers could refer to problematic sites elsewhere in Finland. Finally, the <b>engine</b> <b>drivers</b> could propose preventive measures. The survey forms were delivered to the engine drivers’ mailboxes in their workplaces, making them available to all <b>engine</b> <b>drivers.</b>|$|R

25|$|A {{train is}} a {{connected}} series of rail vehicles that move along the track.

Most trains carry a revenue load, although non-revenue cars exist for the railway's own use, such as for maintenance-of-way purposes. The <b>engine</b> <b>driver</b> (engineer in North America) controls the locomotive or other power cars, although people movers and some rapid transits are under automatic control.|$|E

Half of the respondents assessed that the trespassing is safe and 15 % assumed that trespassing is legal. Furthermore, they indicated that the most effective measures to prevent trespassing is fencing the tracks or building an underpass.
