And I'm {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff – I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all.|$|E

If part of your work is travelling, and the person you are with also works and travels, you find yourself separated a lot {{and it can be}} very frustrating, [...] I'm American and he [...] is British, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to America all the time. [...] Especially at the beginning of our relationship, that long-distance thing was very frustrating. I also think it's easier for people to say things from a distance; it's safer." ...|$|E

Everytime I think about what I'm about to do I get the biggest {{butterflies}} [...] For over a year, I've been in the studio writing my own songs and working towards making my own record. The time has come where <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out of my safe bubble that is the studio and share my music with you... butterflies just got worse [...] I've had the incredible opportunity to work with some of my favourite artists, DJs and producers on my album. I have had the most amazing time and I have learnt so much. It was important that my record was personal to me. I {{wanted to be able to}} look back on the album and know that I have honestly put 100% of myself into it. I've written songs and stories that I have wanted to write for a long time. I really hope that you're able to relate to my music, because that really is what it's all about.. So here goes, I'm taking a big leap, but it's going to be the best fun ever.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, critics {{focused on}} the {{technique}} of the poem and how {{it relates to the}} meaning. In 1941, G. W. Knight claimed that [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] "needs no defence. It has a barbaric and oriental magnificence that asserts itself with a happy power and authenticity too often absent from visionary poems set within the Christian tradition." [...] Humphrey House, in 1953, praised the poem and said of beginning of the poem: [...] "The whole passage is full of life because the verse has both the needed energy and the needed control. The combination of energy and control in the rhythm and sound is so great" [...] and that Coleridge's words [...] "convey so fully the sense of inexhaustible energy, now falling now rising, but persisting through its own pulse". Also in 1953, Elisabeth Schneider dedicated her book to analysing the various aspects of the poem, including the various sound techniques. When discussing the quality of the poem, she wrote, [...] "I sometimes think we overwork Coleridge's idea of 'the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities.' <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to it here, however, for the particular flavor of [...] "Kubla Khan", with its air of mystery, is describable in part through that convenient phrase. Yet, the 'reconciliation' does not quite occur either. It is in fact avoided. What we have instead is the very spirit of 'oscillation' itself." [...] Continuing, she claimed, [...] "The poem is the soul of ambivalence, oscillation's very self; and that is probably its deepest meaning. In creating this effect, form and matter are intricately woven. The irregular and inexact rhymes and varied lengths of the lines play some part. More important is the musical effect in which a smooth, rather swift forward movement is emphasized by the relation of grammatical structure to line and rhyme, yet is impeded and thrown back upon itself even from the beginning". She then concluded: [...] "Here in these interwoven oscillations dwells the magic, the 'dream,' and the air of mysterious meaning of [...] "Kubla Khan". I question whether this effect was all deliberately [...] out by Coleridge, though it might have been. It is possibly half-inherent in his subject ... What remains is the spirit of 'oscillation,' perfectly poeticized, and possibly ironically commemorative of the author." [...] Following in 1959, John Beer described the complex nature of the poem: [...] "'Kubla Khan' the poem is not a meaningless reverie, but a poem so packed with meaning as to render detailed elucidation extremely difficult." [...] In responding to House, Beer claimed, [...] "That there is an image of energy in the fountain may be accepted: but I cannot agree that it is creative energy of the highest type." ...|$|E
