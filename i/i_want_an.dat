By his own admission, he was addicted to extravagant make-up, and unlike Richardson and Gielgud, he excelled at different voices and accents. His own description of his {{technique was}} [...] "working from the outside in"; he said, [...] "I can never act as myself, I {{have to have a}} pillow up my jumper, a false nose or a moustache or wig... I cannot come on looking like me and be someone else." [...] Rattigan described how at rehearsals Olivier [...] "built his performance slowly and with immense application from a mass of tiny details". This attention to detail had its critics: Agate remarked, [...] "When I look at a watch it is to see the time and not to admire the mechanism. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> actor to tell me Lear's time of day and Olivier doesn't. He bids me watch the wheels go round." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos, President Barack Obama praised the protesters, but cautioned against protest tactics that he felt stifled open dialogue at the University of Missouri and other campuses. He said, [...] "There is clearly a problem at the University of Missouri, and that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest—what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> activist student body just like <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>an</b> activist citizenry." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Wildhearts next {{planned a}} double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the {{recording}} sessions. Instead the band released {{a collection of}} six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track [...] "Geordie In Wonderland". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with Wolfsbane's Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included [...] "If Life Is Like A Lovebank, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>An</b> Overdraft", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic [...] "Sky Babies." [...] Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play [...] "Sky Babies" [...] at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.|$|E
