50|$|Pro-republican {{elements}} were in part historically {{linked to the}} older nineteenth century Yee <b>Hings,</b> or the Hung League of secret societies (triads) dedicated to {{the overthrow of the}} Manchus.

The movement went public in 1908, setting up offices in Surry Hills, and in 1912 it adopted the Anglo name of Chinese Masonic Society when it moved to new premises in Mary Street, Surry Hills. This building became the national headquarters for all Yee <b>Hings,</b> and this address remains the headquarters of the society today. Its early leaders Moy Sing and J.A.
