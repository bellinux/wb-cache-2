5|$|Air Hong Kong {{was founded}} in November 1986 by three local {{businessmen}} and commenced charter services with a Boeing 707-320C freighter on 4 February 1988. In June 1994, Hong Kong's largest carrier, Cathay Pacific acquired 75% holdings of the airline; and acquired the remaining 25% in February 2002. In October, Cathay Pacific entered into {{a joint venture with}} DHL Worldwide Express (DHL), eventually saw DHL took a 40% stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> airline, while Cathay Pacific retained the other 60% holdings.|$|E

40|$|Air cargo {{parties are}} {{becoming}} increasingly {{aware of the importance}} of IT and, increasingly, they understand the value that IOS could provide for the total value chain performance. However, whereas in other sectors IOS has scored big successes, there are only fragmented examples of successful global systems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> community and <b>the</b> penetration of IT <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> industry is by no means pervasive. This paper describes the genesis and evolution of global IOS <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> community. It draws on extensive fieldwork in Europe and in Hong Kong SAR, in addition to reviews of relevant trade and academic literature. The paper provides interesting data on <b>the</b> IT-related dynamics <b>in</b> this specific business network. The objective of this research study is to describe <b>the</b> situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> community <b>in</b> such a manner that from this the underlying causes for IT systems 'failures' or `success' can be extracted. By providing an insight into the existing information systems and <b>the</b> evolving dynamics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air <b>cargo</b> community, we present a number of determinants of IT initiatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> global air <b>cargo</b> industry. <b>The</b> paper explores the determinants from a theoretical perspective as well as on the basis of empirical data. It concludes with suggestions for further research...|$|R

5|$|After {{witnessing}} California-based gang boss Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes {{to death}} in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> hold {{in an attempt to}} bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> hold of a ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent on helping her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is in the country illegally.|$|E
5|$|The airline's parent, Cathay Pacific, {{acquired}} the remaining 25 {{percent of the}} airline's shares in February 2002 and became a wholly owned subsidiary. An operational restructure followed on 1 July, where Air Hong Kong ceased services to Brussels, Dubai and Manchester to focus on services in Asia. In October 2002, Cathay Pacific entered into a joint venture agreement with DHL Worldwide Express (DHL) by selling a 30 percent stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo</b> airline in exchange for funds to purchase medium-size freighters to operate DHL's network in the Asia-Pacific region from Hong Kong. The airline set aside $300million to purchase five freighters by 2004 and another $100million towards at least three more freighters by 2010. In March 2003, Cathay Pacific sold another 10 percent stake to DHL and retained 60 percent of the airline.|$|E

Yuri and his sons, {{possessing}} tickets, are brought to the arks and the Curtis family, Tamara and Gordon are left behind. On Ark 4, the American ark, Adrian is contacted by Satnam, who tells that he is stuck on the Nampan Plateau with his entire family as the airlift meant for them never came, with a massive tsunami coming from the east, killing Satnam himself, his entire family and all the evacuees around them. Enraged, Adrian estimates that the wave will hit the arks in 28 minutes. The remaining group consisting of Jackson, Tamara, Noah, Lilly, Gordon and Kate, gets picked up by Nima and brought to the arks with his grandparents. With Tenzin's help they stow away on Ark 4. Due to the lack of time, Carl wants to leave immediately, but Adrian manages to use Satnam's death to convince the world leaders to let the people outside in.|$|E
