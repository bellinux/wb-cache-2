Many of the girls at Molly's school have a crush on him, and even Molly herself after she turned 12, but not as strong as Margie Lussman who hates seeing him with Molly. Tyler <b>hates</b> <b>it</b> when Molly comes up with plans involving Zoey since they all usually end with him getting punished along with Molly, but despite this he's still a major help in most of them.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} edition of The Hobbit, Gollum willingly bets his magic ring on the outcome of the riddle-game, and he and Bilbo part amicably. In the second edition edits, to reflect the new concept of the ring and its corrupting abilities, Tolkien made Gollum more {{aggressive}} towards Bilbo and distraught at losing the ring. The encounter ends with Gollum's curse, [...] "Thief! Thief, Thief, Baggins! We <b>hates</b> <b>it,</b> we <b>hates</b> <b>it,</b> we <b>hates</b> <b>it</b> forever!" [...] This presages Gollum's portrayal in The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

[...] He has dirty blond hair that is spattered with lighter striations of gray which is swept {{back in a ponytail}} to cover a bald spot. He has a liking for cigarettes, but keeps trying to quit. A few years after going freelance, Liberty remained the same in physical appearance, apart from an abundance of facial hair ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} quickly {{recorded}} in Los Angeles {{over the course}} of two weeks. In an interview with The Guardian, when asked about the expectations of the album, Tyler replied [...] "I don't know. I have my doubts. Everybody's going on it and I just think, fuck, everybody might hate this shit. Everybody might go: 'What the fuck is this? We wanted this, we wanted that.' There we go. We made an album we wanted to make. If everybody <b>hates</b> <b>it,</b> OK. We have an album we like." [...] The track [...] "Forest Green" [...] was released over a year before the release of the album but was featured on the project with remastered production.|$|E
500|$|The Second Life {{scenes in}} [...] "Local Ad" [...] were {{produced}} by Clear Ink of Berkeley, CA, using existing locations within Second Life {{as well as}} virtual sets created for the episode. In a study made by IAG Research, the appearance of Second Life in [...] "Local Ad" [...] was rated eighth in the top ten most effective product placements of 2007. The Office was the only non-reality show to make the list, and Second Life was the only product on the list that did not pay for its placement. In a deleted scene, Toby has an idea for the ad: film it in slow-motion {{so that it will}} stand out when the viewer uses his TiVo or other DVR to speed past it. The staff loves the idea, but Michael <b>hates</b> <b>it</b> and won't consider it, even though Toby reveals he formerly worked in advertising for three years.|$|E

500|$|In Utero {{received}} acclaim from critics, {{although some}} reviews were mixed. Times Christopher John Farley stated {{in his review}} of the album, [...] "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke said that the album is [...] "a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne commented [...] "Kurt Cobain <b>hates</b> <b>it</b> all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, [...] "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." [...] NME magazine's John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, [...] "As a document of a mind in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable {{to come to terms}} with sanity – Kurt [...] should be proud of [...] As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, [...] "In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, [...] "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." [...] Q magazine felt that the album showcases Cobain's songwriting abilities and wrote, [...] "If this is how Cobain is going to develop, the future is lighthouse-bright". Several critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Bilbo Baggins {{stumbled}} upon Gollum's lair, having found Gollum's {{ring in the}} network of goblin tunnels leading down to the lake. At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a riddle game with Gollum on the chance of being shown {{the way out of}} the mountains. [...] In the first edition of The Hobbit, Gollum was characterized as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo {{the way out of the}} mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of The Lord of the Rings, [...] Tolkien revised later editions of The Hobbit: the version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the Dwarves and Gandalf. In the new version Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realized the answer to Bilbo's last riddle— [...] "What have I got in my pocket?"— and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, [...] "Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We <b>hates</b> <b>it,</b> we <b>hates</b> <b>it,</b> we <b>hates</b> <b>it</b> forever!" ...|$|E

"He hateth putting away": This {{is another}} reason against divorce: God <b>hates</b> <b>it.</b> It is {{contrary}} to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see Deuteronomy 24:1, etc.; Matthew 19:3-9). Septuagint, [...] "If thou hate her and dismiss her," [...] etc.; Vulgate, [...] "If thou hate her, put her away," [...] which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept.

2500|$|John Paul [...] "J.P." [...] Reynolds Abernathy IV: Formerly {{known as}} [...] "The Guy Who <b>Hates</b> <b>It</b> When They Put Corn In the Chili," [...] J.P. meets Mia via the school musical written by Grandmère. Mia asks {{him to sit}} {{with the rest of}} her friends in [...] "Party Princess." [...] Surprisingly cute and talented, he becomes one of Mia's friends. In the seventh book, Lilly and J.P. become a couple. J.P. is first {{described}} as having [...] "broad shoulders, floppy brown hair, and surprisingly blue eyes," [...] though the eighth and ninth novels state that Mia and J.P. look good together because they are both so [...] "tall and blond." [...] J.P. is Mia's chemistry partner in book eight. In book nine, J.P and Mia go to watch Beauty and the Beast on Broadway after the fateful events of the previous few days, and they both promise to forget both of the Moscovitzes, at least {{for the duration of the}} musical. They go to the musical as friends but that soon changes when J.P. eventually confesses his love for Mia and they become a couple. They break up in the last book when Mia finds out about the lies he had told her and the true reason he went out with her, but they attempt to remain friends, even though J.P. is revealed as a jerk. Also, Mia realized that she still has feelings for Michael despite her dating J.P. Right after they break up J.P. decides to go out with another girl named Stacey Cheeseman, when Mia tells him she thinks Stacey has a crush on J.P.|$|E
