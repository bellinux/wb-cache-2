40|$|Gas coning is the {{tendency}} of the gas to drive oil downward in an inverse cone due to the downward movement of gas into the perforations of a producing well thereby reducing oil production and the overall recovery efficiency of the oil reservoir. This work addresses gas coning issues in a naturally fractured reservoir via a numerical simulation approach on a single-well radial cross-section using the ECLIPSE 100 reservoir simulator. Matrix and fracture properties are modelled. Critical rate, breakthrough time and GOR after breakthrough is determined {{which is used to}} investigate the effect of matrix and fracture properties on gas coning effective reservoir parameters such as oil flow rate, matrix and fracture porosity, vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>matrix</b> and fracture permeability, matrix block size, etc. Results show that reservoir parameters that affect coning include oil flow rate, matrix and fracture porosity, matrix and vertical permeability, anisotropy ratio, perforated interval thickness, density difference and mobility ratio. While matrix block size and fracture spacing have no significant effect on gas coning. </p...|$|E
40|$|My {{purpose for}} this {{qualitative}} {{study was to}} investigate teachers' participation in a collaborative staff development program designed to facilitate reflections about literacy related beliefs and practices. It involved three teachers and a researcher in a four-month Reflective Staff Development Program (RSDP). The RSDP inquiry illustrates the shifts that occur in teachers' reflective language and practice. Three case studies were developed, requiring sorting through the teacher participants' literacy-related beliefs and practices in three research phases: (1) Asking the question: What are the teacher-participants' beliefs and practices in relation to their literacy instruction before, during, and after the RSDP? (2) Conducting the fieldwork using a constant comparative analysis within the RSDP. (3) Analyzing and interpreting the data to find answers to the question. During the RSDP, the teacher-participants revealed literacy-related beliefs and practices within four activities: autobiographies, interviews, group reflective sessions, and literacy lessons. These activities are the data sources, which were analyzed and resulted {{in the creation of a}} matrix for each teacher. The matrices showed that, throughout the RSDP, the teachers expressed language or behaviors with new perspectives, termed as "moments of realization. " The <b>horizontal</b> <b>matrix</b> dimension is a picture of two extreme perspectives in the teacher-participants' beliefs and practices, the skills, and constructivist models. The perpendicular dimension depicts the teachers' discourse as questioning or not questioning. The plots illustrate their shifts in beliefs and practices. Further analysis of the teachers' interactive discourse demonstrated that their group discussions exhibited common characteristics, which contributed to their shifts: (1) The teacher-participants demonstrated moments of realization that included four types of verbal interactions: discussion of a literacy-related belief and/or practice, discomfort about the belief and/or practice, the moment of realization, and discussions justifying the changed perspective. (2) The teacher-participants' RSDP process demonstrated three periods: "introductory," "breakthrough," and "empowerment. " (3) The teacher-participants' shifts moved in a non-linear direction after observing the videotaped literacy lessons. The findings suggest that this inquiry contributed to the teacher-participants' consideration of alternative perspectives and implementation of revised reading instructional practices. These results support the idea that school leaders should implement in-services, such as the RSDP, to improve communication to enhance instructional practice...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Quasi Cyclic Low Density Parity Check code (QC-LDPC) {{is proposed}} {{to reduce the}} complexity of the Low Density Parity Check code (LDPC) while obtaining the similar performance. The proposed QC-LDPC presents an improved construction at high SNR with circulant sub-matrices. The proposed construction yields a performance gain of about 1 dB at a 0. 0003 bit error rate (BER) and it is tested on 4 different decoding algorithms. Proposed QC-LDPC is compared with the existing QC-LDPC and the simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing one at high SNR. Simulations are also performed varying the number of <b>horizontal</b> sub <b>matrices</b> and the results show that the parity check <b>matrix</b> with smaller <b>horizontal</b> concatenation shows better performance...|$|R
40|$|When {{utilizing}} the p-y curve {{to simulate the}} nonlinear characteristics of soil surrounding pile in layered foundations, due to having not taken into account the soil mass’s longitudinal continuity, the calculation deviation of horizontal displacement increases {{with the growth of}} a load. This paper adopted the layered elasticity system theory to consider the soil mass’s longitudinal continuity, as well as {{utilizing the}} research method for layered isotropic bodies, assuming that the horizontal resistance is evenly distributed {{around the perimeter of the}} pile's cross-section. Then an appropriate transfer <b>matrix</b> method of <b>horizontal</b> displacement coefficient for the soil surrounding pile in layered foundations was established. According to the calculation principle of finite element equivalent load, the <b>horizontal</b> displacement coefficient <b>matrix</b> was deduced as well as providing a corrected formula for the horizontal displacement of soil surrounding pile through the p-y curve method when the external load was increased. Following the established model, a program was created which was used for calculating and analyzing the <b>horizontal</b> displacement coefficient <b>matrix</b> of three-layered soil in order to verify this method’s validity and rationale. Where there is a relatively large discrepancy in the soil layers’ properties, this paper’s method is able to reflect the influence on the layered soil’s actual distributional difference as well as the nearby soil layers’ interaction...|$|R
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the plasticity of extrinsic thalamocortical inputs in cortical layer IV may be guided or instructed by earlier plasticity events in the intrinsic, horizontal connections within the extragranular cortical layers. We analyse a rate-based model of the plasticity of a set of extrinsic afferents {{in the presence of a}} pre-existing (and fixed) plexus of intrinsic, overall excitatory horizontal connections between a set of target neurons. We determine conditions under which afferent synaptic pattern formation respects this pre-existing lateral structure. We find three broad regimes under which extrinsic afferent plasticity may violate this structure: the initial pattern of extrinsic afferent innervation of the target cells is far from balanced; the gain of the extrinsic afferents greatly exceeds the overall scale of the strength of lateral excitation; the target cell <b>horizontal</b> coupling <b>matrix</b> is sparse. If none of these conditions is satisfied, then extrinsic afferent plasticity respects the pre-existing lateral connectivity, so that afferent synaptic pattern formation conforms to the pattern of lateral excitation...|$|R
40|$|VennPainter is {{a program}} for {{depicting}} unique and shared sets of genes lists and generating Venn diagrams, by using the Qt C++ framework. The software produces Classic Venn, Edwards' Venn and Nested Venn diagrams and allows for eight sets in a graph mode and 31 sets in data processing mode only. In comparison, previous programs produce Classic Venn and Edwards' Venn diagrams and allow for a maximum of six sets. The software incorporates user-friendly features and works in Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Its graphical interface {{does not require a}} user to have programing skills. Users can modify diagram content for up to eight datasets because of the Scalable Vector Graphics output. VennPainter can provide output results in vertical, <b>horizontal</b> and <b>matrix</b> formats, which facilitates sharing datasets as required for further identification of candidate genes. Users can obtain gene lists from shared sets by clicking the numbers on the diagram. Thus, VennPainter is an easy-to-use, highly efficient, cross-platform and powerful program that provides a more comprehensive tool for identifying candidate genes and visualizing the relationships among genes or gene families in comparative analysis...|$|R
40|$|Sequences {{of three}} gene {{fragments}} (flaA, flaB, and vacA) from Helicobacter pylori strains isolated from patients in Germany, Canada, and South Africa were analyzed for diversity and for linkage equilibrium {{by using the}} Homoplasy Test and compatibility <b>matrices.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> genetic exchange in H. pylori is so frequent that different loci and polymorphisms within each locus are all at linkage equilibrium. These results indicate that H. pylori is panmictic. Comparisons with sequences from Escherichia coli, Neisseria meningitidis, and Drosophila melanogaster showed that recombination in H. pylori was much more frequent than in other species. In contrast, when multiple family members infected with H. pylori were investigated, some strains were indistinguishable at all three loci. Thus, H. pylori is clonal over short time periods after natural transmission...|$|R
40|$|In {{the rocky}} shores of Mar del Plata (38 °W 04 ’S), {{intertidal}} mussels monopolize the macrofauna communities developing beds {{dominated by the}} small mytilid Brachidontes rodriguezii. This species covers 45 % to 65 % of the mid and upper mid intertidal substrate forming stratified beds. Vertical protected substrates of the midlittoral show the highest densities of B. rodriguezii, up to 175, 000 indiv. m- 2 representing a dry biomass of 1, 670 g. m- 2; upper horizontal substrates {{at the same level}} show lower densities (80, 000 indiv. m- 2; 592 g. m- 2). The <b>horizontal</b> bed <b>matrix</b> accumulates more sand than vertical beds (19. 1 kg. m- 2 and 5. 1 kg. m- 2, respectively). Twenty-six taxa and 14 animal species were recorded within the B. rodriguezii intertidal matrix while a total of 9 algae species were found living on the mussel bed. The pulmonate limpet Siphonaria lessoni is the main intertidal herbivore. The invasive barnacle species, Balanus glandula, was first detected in Mar del Plata in 1974 and today creates an upper midlittoral fringe at densities up to 5, 000 indiv. m- 2. This review of the Mar del Plata rocky shore community summarizes the existing information as we prepare to sample this area with the NaGISA protocols. The uniqueness of the rocky intertidal of Mar del Plata is the absolute dominance of a single mussel species Brachidontes rodriguezii in the midlittoral, the presence of a sole species of Gastropoda, the grazer pulmonate Siphonaria lessoni and the absence, until the mid sixties, of a barnacle belt...|$|R
40|$|Using a Monte Carlo method, we have {{directly}} {{extracted from}} the available measurements, the hierarchies among the different elements of the quark mass matrices. To do that, we have first introduced a model independent parameterization for two generic class of models: those based on Abelian symmetries and those inspired by a U(2) <b>horizontal</b> symmetry. So, <b>matrix</b> entries are proportional to some epsilon^t, with epsilon 1 and the t's are different free exponents that we determine from the data through a statistically well defined procedure. We {{have found that the}} experimental data poorly constrain the Abelian scenarios. Instead, in non Abelian scenarios, these t-exponents are strongly constrained by the present data. We have found that contrary to a naive U(2) horizontal symmetry expectation, quark mass matrices turn out to be not symmetric. Two solutions emerge: one with M_{ 32 }^{{down}} M_{ 23 }^{down}} and M_{ 21 }^{up} M_{ 12 }^{{up}}; and a second one with slight asymmetries only in the light quark sector, namely M_{ 21 }^{up} M_{ 12 }^{up} and M_{ 21 }^{down} M_{ 12 }^{down}...|$|R
40|$|Group {{purchasing}} cooperation can {{be beneficial}} for all parties involved. The gains are, however, not always fairly distributed amongst the participants. This puts a strain on the relationships within some forms of cooperation. Schotanus and Telgen (2005) have developed a classification model, the highway matrix, which makes a distinction between five forms of <b>horizontal</b> cooperations. This <b>matrix</b> distinguishes two factors to classify these cooperations, namely: the intensiveness for the members and number of different activities for the initiative. This matrix has been taken, {{because it is the}} most extensive classification tool that covers all possible forms of horizontal cooperations. This paper extends the highway matrix to incorporate the relationships between the parties involved, by adding a ‘symbiosis dimension’. This new classification tool, the extended highway matrix, assists purchasing cooperations, in the way how they should manage their relationship. More specifically, it provides information about the necessity for an allocation mechanism for gain distribution. It does not, however, provide information about the real distribution of gains. For more information about gain distribution the reader is referred to literature of Heijboer (2003) or Schotanus et al. (2006). This paper shows a re-analysis of 51 previously published case studies of group purchasing, which provides initial support for the new symbiosis dimension in the ‘extended highway matrix’. Based on the analyzed cases it can be concluded that some forms of group purchasing have no need for a special allocation mechanism for gain distribution, whereas others do in order to run the group successfully...|$|R
40|$|Limb {{remote sensing}} from space {{provides}} atmospheric composition measurements at high vertical resolution while {{the information is}} smeared in the horizontal domain. The horizontal components of two-dimensional (altitude and along-track coordinate) averaging kernels of a limb retrieval constrained to horizontal homogeneity {{can be used to}} estimate the horizontal resolution of limb retrievals. This is useful for comparisons of measured data with modeled data, to construct horizontal observation operators in data assimilation applications or when measurements of different horizontal resolution are intercompared. We present these averaging kernels for retrievals of temperature, H 2 O, O 3, CH 4, N 2 O, HNO 3 and NO 2 from MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) high-resolution limb emission spectra. The horizontal smearing of a MIPAS retrieval in terms of full width at half maximum of the rows of the <b>horizontal</b> averaging kernel <b>matrix</b> varies typically between about 200 and 350 km for most species, altitudes and atmospheric conditions. The range where 95 % of the information originates from varies from about 260 to 440 km for these cases. This information spread is smaller than the MIPAS horizontal sampling, i. e. MIPAS data are horizontally undersampled, and the effective horizontal resolution is driven by the sampling rather than the smearing. The point where the majority of the information originates from is displaced from the tangent point towards the satellite by typically less than 10 km for trace gas profiles and about 50 to 100 km for temperature, with a few exceptions for uppermost altitudes. The geolocation of a MIPAS profile is defined as the tangent point of the middle line of sight in a MIPAS limb scan. The majority of the information displacement with respect to this nominal geolocation of the measurement is caused by the satellite movement and the geometrical displacement of the actual tangent point {{as a function of the}} elevation angle...|$|R
