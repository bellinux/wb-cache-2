5|$|Development {{work on the}} CFM56 began before CFMI was {{formally}} created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core {{was built in the}} U.S., then shipped to the SNECMA plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of SNECMA was not allowed. The SNECMA components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{does not}} {{explicitly}} give judicial review to the Court, and Jefferson {{was very angry}} with Marshall's position, for he wanted the President to decide whether his acts were constitutional or not. Historians mostly agree that {{the framers of the}} Constitution did plan for the Supreme Court {{to have some sort of}} judicial review; Marshall made their goals operational. Judicial review was not new and Marshall himself mentioned it in the Virginia ratifying convention of 1788. Marshall's opinion expressed and fixed in the American tradition and legal system a more basic theory—government under law. That is, judicial review means a government in which no person (not <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>President)</b> and no institution (not even Congress or the Supreme Court itself), nor even a majority of voters, may freely work their will in violation of the written Constitution. Marshall himself never declared another law of Congress or act of a president unconstitutional.|$|E

500|$|With {{his victory}} in the 1952 {{president}}ial race, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican party also held {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that [...] "Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal.... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'" ...|$|E

Described by Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as a [...] "grim masterpiece," [...] the song features some of Dylan's most memorable lyrical images. Among the well-known lines sung in the song are [...] "He not busy being born is busy dying," [...] "Money doesn't talk, it swears," [...] "Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools" [...] and [...] "But <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked." [...] The lyrics express Dylan's anger at what he sees as the hypocrisy, commercialism, consumerism, and war mentality inherent in contemporary American culture. [...] Dylan's preoccupations in the lyrics, nevertheless, extend beyond the socio-political, expressing existential concerns, touching on urgent matters of personal experience.|$|E

500|$|The {{political}} {{debate in the}} U.S. over {{the nature of the}} revolution exacerbated pre-existing political divisions and resulted in the alignment of the political elite along pro-French and pro-British lines. Thomas Jefferson became the leader of the pro-French faction that celebrated the revolution's republican ideals. Alexander Hamilton led the faction which viewed the revolution with skepticism and sought to preserve existing commercial ties with Great Britain. When news reached America that France had declared war on the British, people were divided on whether the U.S. should enter the war on the side of France. Jefferson and his faction wanted to aid the French, while Hamilton and his followers supported neutrality in the conflict. Jeffersonians denounced Hamilton, Vice President Adams, and <b>even</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> as friends of Britain, monarchists, and enemies of the republican values that all true Americans cherish. Hamiltonians warned that Jefferson's Republicans would replicate the terrors of the French revolution in America"crowd rule" [...] akin to anarchy, and the destruction of [...] "all order and rank in society and government." ...|$|E
