25|$|Anaconda {{refitted}} at Halifax and Westphal {{received a}} crew of 60 men, {{most of whom were}} the dregs of the fleet, offered by their captains when Admiral John Borlase Warren asked for drafts. Her first task was to escort a convoy of twelve merchant vessels from there to the West Indies. While doing so she fought off an attack by two large American privateers. One of the privateers surrendered after losing her <b>jib-boom</b> and fore-top-mast but then escaped when Anaconda lost her own fore-top-mast chasing after the second privateer. Warren then transferred Anaconda to the Jamaica station.|$|E
25|$|She was {{commissioned}} in March 1809, under commander Booty Harvey, for service in home waters. On 10 December 1810, she engaged two French privateers in the English Channel. To avoid being captured, Harvey ran alongside {{one of the}} luggers, which he boarded and captured. This was the lugger Mamelouck of 16 guns, {{under the command of}} Norbez Lawrence. The other lugger engaged Rosario on the starboard side but then was able to outrun Rosario, which had lost her <b>jib-boom</b> during the boarding, and escape. Mamelouck had seven of her crew of 45 men wounded. Rosario had five men wounded, two severely. Mamelouck was only nine hours out of Boulogne and had not had captured anything.|$|E
25|$|In March 1806 John Sheriff {{took over}} as captain of Curieux. On 3 December 1807, off Barbados, Curieux, now armed with eight 6-pounders and ten 18-pounder carronades, engaged the 25-gun {{privateer}} Revanche, commanded by Captain Vidal. Revanche, which had been the slaver British Tar, was the more heavily armed (chiefly English 9-pounders, and one long French 18-pounder upon a traversing carriage on the forecastle) and had a crew of 200 men. Revanche nearly disabled Curieux, while killing Sheriff. Lieutenant Thomas Muir wanted to board Revanche, but too few crewmen were willing to follow him. The two vessels broke off the action and Revanche escaped. Curieux, whose shrouds and back-stays were shot away, and whose two topmasts and <b>jib-boom</b> had been damaged, was unable to pursue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{quite as}} bad as that, Sir Gervaise, though he did expend two <b>jib-booms</b> and three top-gallant yards, for me. Captain Blewet has a fast ship, and he wishes people to know it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, he's {{a fearful}} fellow with spars, that Tom Blewet. I never felt certain of finding all the sticks in their places, on turning {{out of a}} morning, {{when he was with}} you as a lieutenant, Greenly. How many <b>jib-booms</b> and top-gallant yards did he cost us, in that cruise off the Cape of Good Hope? By George, {{it must have been a}} dozen, at least!" ...|$|R
25|$|Before dawn on 18 October 1806 Tobago left Dominica {{where she}} had been {{replenishing}} her water supplies. Soon after, Salmon sighted a brig, joined by a schooner and a sloop, that all made towards Tobago. Tobago prepared for action, while attempting to steer away from the probably hostile squadron. The enemy closed by 8:30, with the schooner and sloop exchanging fire with Tobago. The French attempted to board, but Tobago repulsed the attempt. She was not able to escape though, and the French schooner was able to get her <b>jib-boom</b> over Tobagos taffrail and rake her with small arms fire. Salmon received a shot in the head and his men took him below decks. Sub-Lieutenant Nichols Gould assumed command and continued the fight for another half-hour but then, with Tobago having lost one man killed and 15 wounded (including Salmon), was forced to strike. Her captor was the French privateer General Ernouf, of 16 guns. Général Ernouf (1805 - 1808), was a Danish 16-gun brig, originally under the command of the notable French privateer captain Alexis Grassin.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the {{opportunity}} {{he had been}} striving for—not a moment too soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis’ <b>jib-boom</b> caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard’s mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together as strongly as they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis {{came to an abrupt}} halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones’ men had been very efficient, so what actually happened was that Bonhomme Richard’s motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other’s hull planks. Better still for Jones, Serapis’ spare anchor caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard’s stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson’s crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard’s hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun-decks. For Jones’s boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis’ deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson’s men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis’ main-mast.|$|E
500|$|Pallas {{returned}} on 12 May with [...] and a 16-gun ship-sloop, [...] Allemande despatched {{two large}} frigates and three corvettes; facing unfavourable winds, the British withdrew. Two days later, Pallas and Kingfisher {{came back and}} Allemande again ordered Minerve, Lynx, Sylphe, and Palinure to chase Cochrane off. As a precaution, he also had two other large frigates, [...] and , cleared for action and ready to go. Collett ordered his ships to set all sail {{in the hope of}} catching Pallas before she could escape, but Cochrane was in no hurry to leave and even attempted to draw the French on by backing his topsails and slowing down. Once in range, Pallas opened fire, bringing down the topsail yard of one of the smaller vessels and then retreating into nearby shoals with Minerve in pursuit. By 13:00 Minerve had come up on the leeward side of Pallas, whereupon Pallas fired into her and closed with the intention of boarding. Just at that moment, Minerve hit a sandbank and Pallas crashed into her. The force of the collision, great enough to jolt Pallass guns from their positions, did not prevent her from unleashing a devastating broadside. Both ships were damaged but Pallass shallower draught prevented her grounding. Her crew were able to disengage and get back under way, having seen the two 40-gun French frigates, Armide and Infatigable, drawing near. The crew of Kingfisher sailed in to take Pallas in tow; the latter had lost her fore topmast, <b>jib-boom,</b> spritsail, stunsail, and main topsail yards. Minerve was only lightly damaged; she was re-floated and taken to Rochefort for repair. The engagement cost the lives of seven seamen aboard Minerve, with a further fourteen injured. There were a further one dead and five wounded aboard Pallas.|$|E
500|$|After departing North Carolina, the {{hurricane}} tracked through southern Virginia, {{where it was}} described as [...] "a severe gale which continued for three days changed the climate here entirely..." [...] Thanks to a subsiding tide, damage along the coastline of Virginia {{was not nearly as}} severe as the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane, although winds were said to have been just as intense. Still, fodder was rendered useless, and many corn crops were damaged. A two-story building on Talbot Street in Norfolk had its second floor carried downwind, numerous cattle were swept away, and a mill dam was completely destroyed, with the bridge above it removed in the process. In Nansemond County, fruit trees were severely damaged. Along the James River, the low-grounds were completely submerged; crops along the waterway were also ruined. A brick building was destroyed, a team boat was sunk at its wharf, and some ships at the Navy Yard were ripped from their fasts but otherwise sustained no damage. The schooner Albion was gravely injured when nearly all of its sails were blown away, when it lost its main, <b>jib-boom,</b> and fore-top mast, and when all objects were swept off the ship's deck, including the caboose. Two crew members sustained injuries. Around Hampton, the pilot boats James Barron, Virginia and Mary Ann were both run aground. In Gloucester County, corn crops were damaged. The sloop Flag was capsized on the Middle Ground of the Chesapeake River with no survivors. The brig Liberty from Boston ran aground {{on the south side of}} Portsmouth, while the schooner Mulberry sustained severe damage; passengers overthrew cargo to prevent the ship from sinking. As far north as Baltimore, it is said [...] "considerable mischief" [...] was inflicted by {{the hurricane}}. In New York City, two vessels were pushed ashore while two pleasure boats were overturned along the East River. Heavy rainfall and gale-force winds were recorded throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod.|$|E
2500|$|After Le Griffon was launched, she was rigged with sails and {{provisioned}} {{with seven}} cannon of which two were brass. [...] The French flag flew above the cabin placed {{on top of}} the main deck that was elevated above the hull. She had the figure of a griffin mounted on her <b>jib-boom</b> and an eagle flying above.|$|E
2500|$|Prince of Wales raised {{anchor and}} {{returned}} to sea, sailing aimlessly north and east {{in the hope of}} finding a more hospitable village from which to seek a guide. Shortly after midnight on 22 January she collided with a Chinese ship, striking the Chinese vessel amidships and crushing her under Prince of Wales bow. The English vessel suffered damage to her hull and the loss of her <b>jib-boom,</b> which fell over the side into the Chinese vessel. The smaller Chinese craft was more heavily damaged and began to sink, her crew scrambling overboard to avoid being dragged down with her. Several Chinese sailors sought to climb aboard Prince of Wales, panicking Milner's crew. Paine recorded in his journal that [...] "the Alarm caused me to jump from my cot and run to the arms chest, but such was the call for cutlasses that {{it was not until the}} third or fourth attempt I could reach the deck, being accosted each time in the companionway with [...] "O give me that cutlass sir, and get another for they are coming on board." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then on 8 February 1805, Curieux {{chased the}} French {{privateer}} Dame Ernouf (or Madame Ernouf) for twelve hours before she {{able to bring}} her to action. After forty minutes of hard fighting Dame Ernouf, which had a crew almost double in size relative to that of Curieux, maneuvered to attempt a boarding. Bettesworth anticipated this and put his helm a-starboard, catching his opponent's <b>jib-boom</b> {{so that he could}} rake the French vessel. Unable to fight back, the Dame Ernouff struck. The action cost Curieux five men killed and four wounded, including Bettesworth, who took a hit in his head from a musket ball. Dame Ernouf had 30 men killed and 41 wounded. She carried 16 French long 6-pounder guns and had a crew of 120. This was the same armament as Curieux carried, but in a smaller vessel. Bettesworth opined that she had fought so gallantly because her captain was also a part-owner. She was 20 days out of Guadeloupe and had taken one brig, which, however, [...] had recaptured. The British took Dame Ernouf into service as , but she capsized and foundered in a gale on 30 September 1805. There were only two survivors.|$|E
2500|$|On 11January 1873, a court-martial {{was held}} at Portsmouth on board [...] of an able seaman from Endymion who was charged with {{desertion}} and attempting to obtain money by fraudulent means. He pleaded guilty {{and was sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment at Winchester Gaol. The first seven days in each month to be kept in solitary confinement {{and the rest of the}} time to be kept at hard labour. At the termination of his imprisonment he was to be dismissed with disgrace. On 19January, Endymion was undergoing trials in the Channel when she was caught in a storm. A rating was lost overboard and she lost her <b>jib-boom</b> and two boats. Her new foremast was damaged. Following repairs at Portsmouth, she sailed on 22January for Vigo, her arrival being reported in The Times of 4February. Endymion departed from Vigo on 6 February in company of , [...] and [...] She was bound for Barbados. Vigo was reached in early February, with the squadron sailing on 6February. Endymion sailed to Martinique whilst the rest of the squadron sailed to Saint Vincent. The squadron regrouped at Guadaloupe on 3April and then sailed to Martinique, arriving at Saint Pierre on 5April. The squadron then sailed to Port Royal, Jamaica, arriving on 14May. The squadron then sailed to Gibraltar, where they had arrived by the end of August. On 18September, Henry Hickley took command of Endymion. In September, Endymion was one of several ships ordered to lay off Valencia, Spain where there was an insurgency. Ironclads owned by the Canton of Murcia were crewed by convicts. Questions were asked about whether or not this deprived them of any protection under the laws of war. She was lying off Barcelona by the end of October, departing on 27October, and arriving at Valencia on 5November. Endymion arrived at Gibraltar on 2 December. She departed on 13 December for Málaga, Spain, where she was to relieve Doris.|$|E
60|$|She swung {{sideways}} on a roller, and gesticulated {{with her}} <b>jib-boom</b> from port to starboard.|$|E
60|$|That {{night it}} again fell calm; but next morning, though {{the wind was}} {{somewhat}} against us, we set sail for the Narrows; and making short tacks, at last ran through, almost bringing our <b>jib-boom</b> {{over one of the}} forts.|$|E
60|$|We floated a wreck. With every pitch we lifted our {{dangling}} <b>jib-boom</b> {{into the}} air; and beating against the side, were the shattered {{fragments of the}} masts. From these we made all haste to be free, by cutting the rigging that held them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I make no insinuations," [...] said Bax, {{after a short}} pause; [...] "I do {{but state}} facts. If the `Nancy' had been fitted with a new tops'l-yard and <b>jib-boom,</b> as I advised last summer, I would have carried her safe into the Downs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Taller!" [...] grunted Disko, {{peering through}} the fog as it smoked over the bows. There {{was nothing to be}} seen ten feet beyond the surging <b>jib-boom,</b> while {{alongside}} rolled the endless procession of solemn, pale waves whispering and upping one to the other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tumble after here, and no words!" [...] {{cried the}} mate; {{and in a}} moment the main-yard swung round, when, with her <b>jib-boom</b> {{pointing}} out to sea, the Julia lay as quiet as a duck. We all looked blank--what was to come next? ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} more, I caught my breath, as I heard a snap and a crash, like {{the fall of}} a tree, and suddenly, one of our flying-jib guys jerked out the bolt near the cat-head; and presently, we heard our <b>jib-boom</b> thumping against our bows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] {{answered}} the steersman. At that moment a violent gust snapped the topsail-yard, and the sail was instantly blown to ribbons. The dashing of this spar about carried away the foretop-mast, {{and almost as}} a necessary consequence, the jib with the <b>jib-boom</b> went along with it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I deny neither, Greenly, most {{particularly}} the first. I know very well, were I to signal Morganic, {{to run into}} Brest, he'd do it; but whether he would go in, ring-tail-boom, or <b>jib-boom</b> first, I couldn't tell till I saw it. Now you are a youngish man yourself. Greenly--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'June 4th, Auckland.--We reached harbour a {{week ago}} in a violent squall of wind and rain at 8.45 P.M. Anxious night after the anchor was dropped, lest the vessel should drag. Nine days coming from Norfolk Island, very heavy weather--no accident, but <b>jib-boom</b> pitched away while lying to in a south-easter....|$|E
6000|$|At this, Gillie's {{expectations}} were realised, and his joy consummated. With mischievous glee sparkling in his eyes, he hastened {{down to the}} Court to exhibit his sixpence to his mother, and to announce to all whom it might concern, that [...] "the sea-capp'n had run his <b>jib-boom</b> slap through the old 'ooman's cabin-door." ...|$|E
60|$|The long, anxious {{night at}} last {{came to an}} end, and, with the first peep of day, the {{look-out}} on the <b>jib-boom</b> was hailed; but nothing was in sight. At last it was broad day; yet still not a bow was {{to be seen in}} our rear, nor a stern in our van.|$|E
60|$|Meantime, {{the strange}} ship, {{scraping}} by us thus, shot {{off into the}} darkness, and we saw her no more. But she, also, must have been injured; for when it grew light, we found pieces of strange rigging mixed with ours. We repaired the damage, and replaced the broken spar with another <b>jib-boom</b> we had; for all ships carry spare spars against emergencies.|$|E
60|$|At {{last they}} drew {{near to the}} shores of Old England, and then there burst upon them a nor-wester, so violent that within the first hour the close-reefed topsails were blown to ribbons, and the foretopmast, with the <b>jib-boom,</b> was carried away. Of course this was a {{comparatively}} small matter in a steamer, {{but when it was}} afterwards discovered that the vessel had sprung a leak, things began to look more serious.|$|E
60|$|But {{the little}} vessel faced the tempest nobly, and rose like a sea-mew {{on the white}} crest of each wave, while the steersmen--for there were two lashed to the wheel--kept her to the wind. Suddenly the sheet of the fore trysail parted, the ship {{came up to the}} wind, and a billow at that moment broke over her, pouring tons of water on her deck, and {{carrying}} away the foremast, main-top-masts, and the <b>jib-boom.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No, old salt, I couldn't; but you {{may come}} up here if you like. You'll be the better of {{a rise in the}} world, won't you? The gangway lays just round the corner; but mind your sky-scraper for the port's low. There's a seat in the winder here. Go ahead; {{starboard}} your helm, straight up, then 'ard-a-port, steady, mind your <b>jib-boom,</b> splice the main-brace, heave the main-deck overboard, and cast anchor 'longside o' me!" ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{would the}} mate's voice repeat {{the thought of}} the master, both gazing ahead, while under their feet the ship rushes at some twelve knots in the {{direction}} of the lee shore; and only a couple of miles in front of her swinging and dripping <b>jib-boom,</b> carried naked with an upward slant like a spear, a gray horizon closes the view with a multitude of waves surging upwards violently as if to strike at the stooping clouds.|$|E
60|$|And {{that was}} all. Nothing happened. The galley-stove smoked three times, {{advertising}} the cooking of three meals. Shorty made faces {{at me as}} usual across {{the rim of the}} for'ard-house. The Maltese Cockney caught an albatross. There was some excitement when Tony the Greek hooked a shark off the <b>jib-boom,</b> so big that half a dozen tailed on to the line and failed to land it. But I caught no glimpse of Mr. Pike nor of the renegade Sidney Waltham.|$|E
60|$|Bunks, who {{had never}} once quitted his post, began to yawn, and {{suggested}} to Jim that he might take a spell at the helm now, when {{the progress of the}} schooner was suddenly arrested with a shock so violent that those on board were hurled prostrate on the deck, the fore-topmast snapped and went over the side, carrying the main-topmast and the <b>jib-boom</b> along with it, and the sea made a clean breach over the stern, completely sweeping the deck.|$|E
6000|$|We [...] "hove" [...] our deep-sea-line by night, and the {{operation}} was very interesting, at least to me. In the first place, the vessel's heading was stopt; then, coiled away in a tub, like a whale-rope, the line was placed toward the after part of the quarter-deck; {{and one of the}} sailors carried the lead outside of the ship, away along {{to the end of the}} <b>jib-boom,</b> and at the word of command, far ahead and overboard it went, with a plunge; scraping by the side, till it came to the stern, when the line ran out of the tub like light.|$|E
60|$|And then, of a sudden, I {{began to}} comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce {{time to act}} and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the {{schooner}} came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang {{to my feet and}} leaped, stamping the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the <b>jib-boom,</b> while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.|$|E
60|$|But finding at {{last that}} the {{superior}} managableness of the enemy's ship {{enabled him to}} get the better of the clumsy old Indiaman, the Richard, in taking position, Paul, with his wonted resolution, at once sought to neutralize this, by hugging him close. But the attempt to lay the Richard right across the head of the Serapis ended quite otherwise, in sending the enemy's <b>jib-boom</b> just over the Richard's great tower of Pisa, where Israel was stationed; who, catching it eagerly, stood for an instant holding to the slack of the sail, like one grasping a horse by the mane prior to vaulting into the saddle.|$|E
60|$|But {{the good}} ship held on nobly. Although not a fast sailer {{she was an}} {{excellent}} sea-boat, and danced on the billows like a sea-mew. The squall, however, was not over. Before the topsails had been set many minutes it burst on them again with redoubled fury, and the main-topsail was instantly blown into ribbons. Glynn and his comrades were once more ordered aloft to furl the remaining sails, but before this could be done the foretopmast was carried away, and in falling it tore away the <b>jib-boom</b> also. At the same moment a tremendous sea came rolling on astern; in the uncertain light {{it looked like a}} dark moving mountain that was about to fall on them.|$|E
