40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} of the <b>Joule</b> heating <b>effect</b> on electrokinetic flow focusing In electrokinetically driven microfluidic systems, the driving voltage applied during operation tends to induce a <b>Joule</b> heating <b>effect</b> in the buffer solution. This heat source alters the solution’s characteristics and changes both the electrical potential {{field and the}} velocity field during the transport process. This study performs a series of numer-ical simulations to investigate the <b>Joule</b> heating <b>effect</b> and analyzes its influence on the electrokinetic focusing performance. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>Joule</b> heating <b>effect</b> causes the diffusion coefficient of the sample to increase, the potential distribution to change, and the flow velocity field to adopt a nonuniform profile. These variations are particularly pronounced under tighter focusing conditions and at higher applied elec-trical intensities. In numerical investigations, it is found that the focused bandwidth broadens because thermal diffusion effect is enhanced by Joule heating. The variation in the potential distribution induces a nonuniform flow field and causes the focused bandwidth to tighten and broaden alternately {{as a result of the}} convex and concave velocity flow profiles, respectively.

The difference in the two time constants can be explained considering the thermal resistance and capacitance of the thin film.
