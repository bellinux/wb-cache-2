Echo {{made it possible to}} predict the radar signature of an aircraft made with flat panels, called facets. In 1975, engineers at Lockheed Skunk Works found that an aircraft made with faceted surfaces could have a very low radar signature because the surfaces would radiate almost all of the radar energy away from the receiver. Lockheed built a model called [...] "the Hopeless Diamond", a reference to the famous Hope Diamond and the design's predicted instability. Because advanced computers were available to control the flight of even a <b>Hopeless</b> <b>Diamond,</b> for the first time designers realized that {{it might be possible to}} make an aircraft that was virtually invisible to radar.|$|R

Using the {{molecular dynamics simulation}} technique both the global and the local organization of glycerolmonoolein molecules inside the diamond cubic phase are studied. Multinanosecond simulations reveal that {{the center of the}} cubic bilayer remains close to the infinite periodic minimal surface that describes the <b>diamond</b> <b>geometry.</b> We further show that the equilibrium structure of the surfactant molecules inside the cubic phase is very similar to their structure inside a simulated lamellar bilayer. The small differences arise from the packing constraints of the surfactants within the cubic phase which has an area per surfactant that increases toward the bilayer center. ...|$|R

As a paradigm we consider a frustrated diamond chain, where for ideal <b>diamond</b> <b>geometry</b> the lowest one-electron band is flat, but the ground state remains paramagnetic for arbitrary on-site repulsion U. We focus on half filling of the flat band. By using numerical and analytical arguments we present the ground-state phase diagram for a distorted diamond chain, i. e., the former flat band becomes dispersive. Driven by the interplay of dispersion and interaction the ground state is ferromagnetic if the interaction exceeds a critical value U_c. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

We show that, depending on the phases and the decay characteristic, the system can exhibit a variety of behaviors, including population inversion and complete depletion of an atomic state. We explain the phenomena in terms of multi-photon interference. We compare our results with the phase-dependent phenomena in the double-Λ scheme, as studied in [Korsunsky and Kosachiov, Phys.

Preliminary results concerning the response of these samples to 6 keV X-ray radiation are discussed. Effects of the substrate on the detector response have also been observed and reported.

40|$|Electronic {{screening}} renormalizes {{the linear}} bands of graphene {{and in the}} vicinity of the Dirac point, creates a diamond shaped structure in the quasiparticle spectral density. This is a result of electron-plasmon scattering processes which produce a finite momentum feature referred to as the `plasmaron ring'. In this work we explore the effects of uniaxial strain on these spectral features with the aim of understanding how strain modifies correlations. We derive and calculate the spectral density to the G$_ 0 $W-RPA level which allows us to identify the dispersive behaviour of the <b>diamond</b> <b>geometry,</b> and thus electron-plasmon scattering, for variation in electron-electron coupling strength and magnitude of applied strain. We find that the application of strain changes the geometry (in momentum) of the electron-plasmon scattering and that renormalizations beyond simple geometrical scalings further enhance this effect. These results suggest that the properties of the plasmaron ring can be tuned through the application of uniaxial strain, effectively producing a larger fine structure constant without the need to change the sample substrate.

In the present work a recently presented experimental technique, based on the use of Thermochromic Liquid Crystals (TLCs) and digital image analysis, has been employed in order to assess temperature polarization phenomena. The local heat transfer coefficient distribution on the membrane surface in a MD spacer-filled channel was thus assessed.

After hundreds of years of investigation, in the 20 th century, we have achieved this goal. Now, in the 21 st century, making the space accessible is the new challenge which we have proposed. There are different ways {{in order to achieve}} this goal: reusable rockets, pico-satellites or hypersonic vehicles. The idea of using vehicles that are able of going from a runway to space is the base of this project. For this reason, I have decided to study a hypersonic intake <b>geometry</b> and a <b>diamond</b> shaped airfoil using commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD). One of the objectives of this project is to study a ramjet engine intake, this engine which is used by vehicles that fly at supersonic-hypersonic regimes. In this project, the geometry of a hypersonic intake in a supersonic regime at a number of Mach of 2 is analyzed. However, it has been impossible to achieve a full converged solution {{due to the lack of}} time and resources. Though, the obtained results are presented. Moreover, the aerodynamic performance of a diamond shaped airfoil is studied. Concretely, a <b>diamond</b> <b>geometry</b> in different angles of attack, at different velocities and different thickness to chord ratios is analyzed. Also, in this section, I experienced problems in order to obtain converged solutions, but this fact has not avoided me to obtain good results and analyze its aerodynamic behaviour. Finally, a review of all the project is made and the obtained conclusions are presented. Along with this project several simulations have been made, some of them have not converged, but all of them have helped to improve the knowledge about computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and how Nektar++ software works and, finally, obtain the aerodynamic characterization of the diamond airfoil. However, it is needed a deeper study of the aerodynamic performance in more situations in order to validate it as a real solution. Besides, future studies are proposed in order to continue the aerodynamic study of supersonic vehicles...|$|R

Some of these materials are PA 66 (Poly-Amide), PEEK (Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone) and PTFE (Poly-Tetra-Fluoro-Ethylene) or Teflon. Former studies are shown as PEEK and PA 66 have a good machinability, but they are materials that suffer delamination. Moreover, the effect of the tool is decisive in the surface final quality. These considerations can be extended to PTFE. Therefore, the objective is to analyze the delamination during the drilling process of these materials, and to determine adequate cutting conditions.

40|$|In this paper, a {{framework}} of surface generation model in the fast tool servo (FTS) machining of optical microstructures will be described. The integrated model is totally composed of a tool path generator (TPG), a surface topography model (STM) and an optimization model (OM). To develop the tool path generator, two parts should be involved. The first part is the tool path generated based on cutting conditions such as the feed rate and spindle speed, the geometry of optical microstructures, and <b>diamond</b> tool <b>geometry.</b> Another part is the synchronized motion generated by the tool actuation of the FTS at a bandwidth higher than the rotational frequency of the spindle. The surface topography model will be generated based on the TPG and used to predict the technological aspects of FTS machining. It takes into the account the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the cutting process. The former includes the tool path generated by the tool path generator. The later includes the relative vibration between the tool and the workpiece caused by the axial error motion of the spindle {{as well as the}} synchronized motion of the FTS system. The optimization model will be undertaken by an iterative algorithm, which will be developed based on the TPG and STM. The OM will be expected to output the verified tool path, the suggested optimum cutting conditions, and the diagrams with predicted cutting performance characteristic and process parameters being investigated.

40|$|The use {{of carbon}} fibre {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) and metal matrix composites (MMC) is steadily increasing {{as an alternative to}} traditional metallic materials in various industrial sectors. The overall aim of the project is to assess the machinability when drilling epoxy based CFRP and Al/SiCp MMC composites and understand its effects on feature quality and workpiece integrity. Specific objectives of the project relate to establishing preferred / optimum operating parameters (cutting speed, feed rate and drill strategies) and investigating the influence of cutting environment (dry, chilled air, high pressure internal / external supplied coolant and low pressure flood) for drilling specific composite material systems. Key response measures include tool wear / life, thrust force / torque, hole size and geometrical accuracy, hole edge quality (delamination, uncut fibres and burrs) as well as workpiece surface integrity (surface roughness, microhardness, fibre / particle pullout, subsurface damage, etc.).

40|$|The realtime {{display of}} huge {{geometry}} and imagery databases involves view-dependent approximations, typically {{through the use}} of precomputed hierarchies that are selectively refined at runtime. A classic motivating problem is terrain visualization, in which planetary databases involving billions of elevation and color values are displayed on PC graphics hardware at high frame rates. This paper introduces a new diamond data structure for the basic selective-refinement processing, which is a streamlined method of representing the well-known hierarchies of right triangles that have enjoyed much success in realtime, view-dependent terrain display. Regular-grid tiles are proposed as the payload data per <b>diamond</b> for both <b>geometry</b> and texture. The use of 4 - 8 grid refinement and coarsening schemes allows level-of-detail transitions that are twice as gradual as traditional quadtree-based hierarchies, as well as very high-quality low-pass filtering compared to subsampling-based hierarchies. An out-ofcore storage organization is introduced based on Sierpinski indices per diamond, along with a tile preprocessing framework based on fine-to-coarse, same-level, and coarseto-fine gathering operations. To attain optimal frame-toframe coherence and processing-order priorities, dual split and merge queues are developed similar to the Realtime Optimally Adapting Meshes (ROAM) Algorithm, as well as an adaptation of the ROAM frustum culling technique.

40|$|The {{advantages}} and utility of chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond as an industrial ceramic {{can only be}} realized if the price and quality are right. Until recently, this technology was of interest only to the academic and basic research community.

Thus, CVD diamond applications and business are an industrial reality. At present, CVD diamond is produced in the form of coatings or wafers. CVD diamond film technology offers a broader technological potential than do natural and high-pressure synthetic <b>diamonds</b> because size, <b>geometry,</b> and eventually cost will not be as limiting.

40|$|Solid-state quantum sensors are {{attracting}} wide {{interest because}} of their exceptional sensitivity at room temperature. In particular, the spin properties of individual nitrogen vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond make it an outstanding nanoscale sensor of magnetic fields, electric fields, and temperature, under ambient conditions. Recent work on ensemble NV-based magnetometers, inertial sensors, and clocks have employed N unentangled color centers to realize a factor of up to √(N) improvement in sensitivity. However, to realize fully this signal enhancement, {{new techniques are required}} to excite efficiently and to collect fluorescence from large NV ensembles. Here, we introduce a light-trapping <b>diamond</b> waveguide (LTDW) <b>geometry</b> that enables both high fluorescence collection (∼ 20 %) and efficient pump absorption achieving an effective path length exceeding 1 meter in a millimeter-sized device. The LTDW enables in excess of 2 % conversion efficiency of pump photons into optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) fluorescence, a three orders of magnitude improvement over previous single-pass geometries. This dramatic enhancement of ODMR signal enables broadband measurements of magnetic field and temperature at less than 1 Hz, a frequency range inaccessible by dynamical decoupling techniques. We demonstrate ∼ 1 nT/√(Hz) magnetic field sensitivity for 0. 1 Hz to 10 Hz and a thermal sensitivity of ∼ 400 μK/√(Hz) and estimate a spin projection limit at ∼ 0. 36 fT/√(Hz) and ∼ 139 pK/√(Hz), respectively.

40|$|Diamond {{has since}} many years been applied in {{electronic}} fields {{due to its}} extraordinary properties. Substitutional dopants and surface functionalization have also been introduced {{in order to improve}} the electrochemical properties. However, the basic mechanism at an atomic level, regarding the effects of dopants and terminations, is still under debate. In addition, theoretical modelling has during the last decades been widely used for the interpretation of experimental results, prediction of material properties, and for the guidance of future materials. Therefore, the purpose of this research project has been to theoretically investigate the influence of dopants and adsorbates on electronic and geometrical structures by using density functional theory (DFT) under periodic boundary conditions. Both the global and local effects of dopants (boron and phosphorous) and terminations have been studied. The models have included H-, OH-, F-, Oontop-, Obridge- and NH 2 -terminations on the diamond surfaces. For all terminating species studied, both boron and phosphorous have been found to show a local impact, instead of a global one, on <b>diamond</b> structural <b>geometry</b> and electronic properties. Therefore, the terminating species only affect the DOS of the surface carbon layers. In addition, Oontop-terminated (111) diamond surfaces present reactive surface properties and display metallic conductivity. Moreover, the conductivity of the diamond surface can be dramatically increased by the introduction of a phosphorous dopant in the lattice. The work function of a diamond surface has also been found to be influenced to a large extent by the various adsorbates and the dopant levels. Diamond can also be used as a promising substrate for an epitaxial graphene adlayer. The effects of dopants and terminations on the graphene and diamond (111) interfacial systems have been investigated theoretically in great detail. The interfacial interaction is of the Van der Waal type with an interfacial distance around 3 Å. The interactions between graphene and a terminated diamond substrate were found to be relatively weaker than those for a non-terminated diamond substrate (even with dopants). For all interface systems between graphene and diamond, a diamond-supported graphene adlayer without induced defects can still keep its intrinsic high carrier mobility. A minor charge transfer was observed to take place from the graphene adlayer to a non-terminated diamond substrate (with or without dopants) and to Oontop-, OH- or Obridge-terminated diamond substrates. However, for the situation with an H-terminated diamond surface, the electron transfer took place from the diamond surface to graphene. On the contrary, an interfacial system with a non-terminated diamond surface offers a more pronounced charge transfer than that of the terminated diamond substrates. A small finite band gap at the Dirac point was also observed for the Oontop-terminated diamond-supporting graphene adlayer. ...|$|R
40|$|Interest and {{utilisation}} of polycrystalline boron-doped diamond (pBDD) as an electrode {{material has}} rapidly grown {{over the last}} decade, due to its unique properties and advantages over other available electrode materials. The possibility of lower detection limits and an increased range of detectable analytes has seen pBDD flourish in electroanalysis. Due to its stability at high temperatures, pressures and acidity, pBDD also {{has the potential to}} perform electrochemistry in extreme conditions. These unique properties, however, make the material difficult to manipulate in order to produce well defined and reproducible electrodes. Deviations in electrical and electrochemical responses can also arise from sample to sample, due to differing synthesis conditions and experimental set-ups. This thesis aims to characterise pBDD available from a commercial source and through fabrication of electrodes of various designs, best utilise the material in the electroanalysis of several species. Characterisation is performed using high resolution microscopic and spectroscopic techniques which show a heterogeneous material with negligible levels of non-diamond like carbon and boron concentrations of at least 1 x 1020 atoms cm- 3 throughout. Disc electrodes, fabricated using laser machining, are electrochemically characterised showing low background currents, wide solvent windows and close to reversible behaviour for Ru(NH 3) 6 3 +/ 2 +, IrCl 6 2 -/ 3 - and Fe(CN) 6 3 -/ 4. Functionalisation of these pBDD disc electrodes with nanoparticles enables the detection of dissolved oxygen and glucose to detection limits of ppb.
