5|$|As little {{opposition}} was <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> Morotai, Allied planners decided {{to land the}} invasion force close to the airfield sites on the Doroeba Plain. Two beaches in the south-west coast of the island were selected as suitable landing sites, and were designated Red Beach and White Beach. The Allied plan called for all three infantry regiments of the 31st Division to be landed across these beaches on 15 September and swiftly drive inland to secure the plain. As Morotai's interior had no military value, the Allies {{did not intend to}} advance beyond a perimeter needed to defend the airfields. Planning for the construction of airfields and other base installations was also conducted prior to the landing, and tentative locations for these facilities had been selected by 15 September.|$|E
5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of the species that lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E

A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by more than four goals would have won the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering the game with a 2–3–1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled to be the final game of the tournament as organizers <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> least one of the teams would be playing for the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|King George V {{had four}} sets of Parsons geared {{turbines}}. Two main turbines were arranged in series and drove a shaft through double helical gears. An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine. A speed of 28.5 knots was <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> standard displacement and 27.5 knots at full-load displacement on normal output; corresponding speeds at overload condition were 29.25 and 28.25 knots respectively. The turbine unit was a low-speed type (2,257 rpm) coupled to a single reduction gear which produced 236 rpm at the propeller shaft.|$|E

Residents of coastal towns were warned to expect dangerous storm tides– local emergency officials said an 8metre (26ft) high tide was <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> that night. Tourists in the area were warned not to try to reach Broome. Chevron Australia said a tanker due to arrive on 18 April was asked to delay its arrival till 22 April because of the cyclone.

5|$|The French {{squadron}} under Renaud {{had used}} the retreat of Mitchell's force to also withdraw into the Indian Ocean via Bencoolen, reaching the British trading post on 9 February. There Pigot was still undergoing repairs and was taken by surprise and captured. As the merchant ship was manoeuvred out of the bay, Renaud demanded the surrender of the small Fort Marlborough nearby and was informed that the fort was well armed and that the arrival of Mitchell's squadron was <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> any moment. Unwilling to continue the engagement with Mitchell, Renaud withdrew immediately without assaulting the fort. The French squadron subsequently returned to Île de France where, in the Action of 22 October 1794, they drew away two British warships that blockaded the island.|$|E

5|$|The first attack upon Kobe was by one B-25 bomber {{as a part}} of the Dolittle Raid on 18 April 1942.

5|$|The loss to Virginia brought Virginia Tech to an 83 regular-season record, {{something}} Tech coach Frank Beamer {{said was}} better than he <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> the season's start. Despite that sentiment, most fans and supporters pointed {{to the fact that}} in all of Virginia Tech's losses, the deciding points came late in the fourth quarter and {{near the end of the}} game. Only three plays separated Tech from an undefeated 110 record. Tech's bowl destination was unclear immediately after the Virginia loss. The Music City Bowl seemed likely, but the Micron PC Bowl, Insight.com Bowl, and Sun Bowl also were possibilities. Virginia Tech officials preferred the Music City Bowl because of its proximity to Virginia, and bowl officials selected the Hokies on November 30.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} in {{the last}} week of August had disclosed to Eighth Army a large amount of North Korean activity behind the lines opposite the US 2nd and 25th Divisions {{in the southern part of}} the Pusan Perimeter. The North Koreans had built three new underwater bridges across the Nam River in front of the 35th Infantry in the 25th Division sector. Aerial bombing only temporarily and partially destroyed these bridges, and they were repaired overnight. Eighth Army intelligence credited the North Koreans with having moved one or two new divisions and about 20 tanks to the Hyopch'on area on the west side of the Naktong River opposite the US 2nd Division. However, the US intelligence overestimated the strength of these divisions. On August 28 the Eighth Army intelligence officer warned that a general offensive may be <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> any time along the 2nd Division and 25th Division front aimed at severing the Taegu-Pusan railroad and highway and capturing Masan.|$|E

5|$|In June 2009, {{the club}} broke its own {{record for the}} highest {{transfer}} fee ever paid {{in the history of}} football by agreeing to pay Manchester United €96million (£80million) for the services of Cristiano Ronaldo. The fee of €77.5million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pound sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67m (£65million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> around €100 million. In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418. The club's sale record came on 26 August 2014, when Manchester United signed Ángel Di María for €75million.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} he wanted to go, on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
5|$|On the 21st of May Generals George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau, {{respectively}} the commanders of the Continental Army and the Expédition Particulière, met to discuss potential operations against the British and Loyalists. They considered either an assault or siege on the principal British base at New York City, or operations against the British forces in Virginia. Since {{either of these}} options would require {{the assistance of the}} French fleet, then in the West Indies, a ship was dispatched to meet with French Rear Admiral François Joseph Paul, comte de Grasse who was <b>expected</b> <b>at</b> Cap-Français (now known as Cap-Haïtien, Haiti), outlining the possibilities and requesting his assistance. Rochambeau, in a private note to de Grasse, indicated that his preference was for an operation against Virginia. The two generals then moved their forces to White Plains, New York, to study New York's defenses and await news from de Grasse.|$|E
