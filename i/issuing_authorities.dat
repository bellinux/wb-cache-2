25|$|The {{number of}} {{independent}} nations has grown rapidly since World War II, {{and so has}} the number of coin <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities.</b> Countries {{of the third world}} generally have a very small domestic demand for collector coins, hence the non-circulating commemoratives issued are oriented towards the international market for collector items. Circulating commemoratives are found in the third World as well as in western nations. India has been issuing circulating commemoratives frequently since the 1960s. Almost every nation in the world have issued commemorative coins.|$|E
25|$|However, these {{advantages}} held {{within them}} disadvantages. First, since a note has no intrinsic value, {{there was nothing}} to stop <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> from printing more of it than they had specie to back it with. Second, because it increased the money supply, it increased inflationary pressures, a fact observed by David Hume in the 18th century. The result is that paper money would often lead to an inflationary bubble, which could collapse if people began demanding hard money, causing the demand for paper notes to fall to zero. The printing of paper money was also associated with wars, and financing of wars, and therefore regarded as part of maintaining a standing army. For these reasons, paper currency was held in suspicion and hostility in Europe and America. It was also addictive, since the speculative profits of trade and capital creation were quite large. Major nations established mints to print money and mint coins, and branches of their treasury to collect taxes and hold gold and silver stock.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} actual gold coins {{circulating}} {{in the west}} {{that would have been}} termed mancuses is difficult to calculate. Because of their high value such coins were less likely than other pieces to be lost, whilst the rarity of gold and its close relationship to bullion meant that coins were often melted down for re-use. Indeed, many gold coins minted in the west between the eighth and thirteenth centuries were struck in small numbers with a specific purpose in mind, and probably did not circulate commercially in quite the same way as silver coins. In many cases they had strong associations with specific <b>issuing</b> <b>authorities</b> such as a king (e.g., Coenwulf of Mercia), emperor (like Louis the Pious) or archbishop (e.g., Wigmund of York). On the other hand, they might not reference any king at all, and may relate to the issuing city (e.g., Chartres) or moneyer (like Pendred and Ciolhard at London under Offa). Some gold pieces were simply struck from regular silver dies. In addition to these gold pieces with meaningful inscriptions issued in the west, there circulated some genuine Arabic dinars and imitations of them. Curiously, several of these imitative dinars—including the famous example bearing the name of Offa of Mercia—are based on originals struck in the year 157 AH (773 or 774 AD). The precise significance of this remains uncertain: it may be that careful copies of a coin of this year circulated widely, or that particularly many dinars of this year entered the west for some reason.|$|E
