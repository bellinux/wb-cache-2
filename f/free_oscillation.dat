Using support vector machine (SVM), [33] proposed a method that can classify two different types of oscillations based on feature extraction. Basically, increasing amplitude of <b>free</b> <b>oscillations</b> is used to distinguish it from forced oscillations. In this case, algorithm accuracy has direct relationship with envelope size. Thus, there is a question of whether this algorithm can work in real-time scenarios. Reference [34] proposed unique mathematical models for forced and <b>free</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In addition, they showed that the responses of the system to forced oscillations differs from those of <b>free</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Based on noise response and harmonic nature of oscillations, the authors proposed a method to distinguish forced <b>oscillations</b> from <b>free</b> <b>oscillations.</b> However, there is question of how to separate the pure sinusoid from noise in both cases (<b>free</b> and forced <b>oscillations)</b> and the effects of this separation on algorithm accuracy should be considered. In addition, it is important to evaluate the performance of proposed method when forced oscillations exist at a system’s mode frequency.|$|R

At the turn of 19 th century Geophysicists presented the theory of the <b>free</b> <b>oscillations</b> for a self-gravitating, isotropic and compressible sphere. Assuming a steel structure for an Earth size sphere, they predicted a period of oscillation of about 1 hour. About 50 years later, the <b>free</b> <b>oscillations</b> of stars was studied by Cowling and others.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{developed}} for the passage through resonance of a dynamic tide with a <b>free</b> <b>oscillation</b> mode of a rapidly evolving star. The orbital motion of the companion {{is assumed to be}} Keplerian and to remain unchanged during the passage through resonance. Tides are treated as forced, linear, isentropic oscillations of a non-rotating star. A multiple-variable perturbation method is applied for the derivation of asymptotic expansions for the components of the tidal displacement before, during, and after the passage through resonance. As the small expansion parameter epsilon, the ratio of the orbital period to the time scale of the star's evolution is used. The amplitude of the tide is of the order epsilon- 1 / 2 during the passage through resonance and remains of that order afterwards. At time of resonance, the tidal displacement displays a phase delay of 3 pi/ 4 or pi/ 4 with respect to the tide-generating potential according as the frequency of the <b>free</b> <b>oscillation</b> mode increases or decreases due to the star's evolution.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{framework for the}} determination of tidally induced radial-velocity variations in a component of a close binary is presented. Both the free and the forced oscillations of the component are treated as linear, isentropic perturbations of a spherically symmetric star. Resonances between dynamic tides and <b>free</b> <b>oscillation</b> modes {{are taken into account}} by means of the formalism developed by Smeyers et al. (1998). The amplitude of the tidally induced radial-velocity variations seen by the observer depends on the orbital eccentricity and on the orbital inclination. The amplitude increases with increasing orbital eccentricity and is most sensitive to the value of the orbital inclination when 20 < i < 70. In the case of a 5 solar mass ZAMS star with a 1. 4 solar mass compact companion, it is shown that resonant dynamic tides can lead to radial-velocity variations with amplitudes large enough to be detected in observations.

Abstract: Deformations and changes of the gravitational potential of prestressed selfgravitating elastic bodies caused by <b>free</b> <b>oscillations</b> are described {{by means of the}} momentum and Poisson equations and the constitutive relation. For spheri- cally symmetric bodies we transform the equations and boundary conditions into ordinary differential equations of the second order by the spherical harmonic de- composition and further discretize the equations by highly accurate pseudospectral difference schemes on Chebyshev grids. We thus receive a series of matrix eigenvalue problems for eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the <b>free</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Since elas- tic parameters are frequency dependent, we solve the problem for several fiducial frequencies and interpolate the results.
