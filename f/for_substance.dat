5|$|A {{population-based}} study {{completed by}} the National Alcohol Research Center {{found that women who}} identify as lesbian or bisexual are less likely to abstain from alcohol. Lesbians and bisexual women have a higher likelihood of reporting problems with alcohol, as well as not being satisfied with treatment <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> abuse programs. Many lesbian communities are centered in bars, and drinking is an activity that correlates to community participation for lesbians and bisexual women.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} psychosocial {{interventions}} {{may be useful}} in the treatment of schizophrenia including: family therapy, assertive community treatment, supported employment, cognitive remediation, skills training, token economic interventions, and psychosocial interventions <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> use and weight management. Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal. Evidence for metacognitive training is mixed with one 2016 review finding benefit and another not. Art or drama therapy have not been well-researched.|$|E
5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E

5|$|The book {{contains}} {{content from}} twenty-nine contributors, including psychologists, counselors, {{teachers and school}} therapists. It also includes content from Brown and Logan. General topics discussed in the work include family, alcohol abuse, relationships, self-esteem, sex and gender, and personality. Specific topics {{in the field of}} psychology include clinical psychology, cognition, abnormal psychology, evolutionary psychology, gambling addiction, Pavlovian conditioning and family therapy. Contributor Denis M. McCarthy, assistant {{professor of psychology at the}} University of Missouri, analyzes risk factors for alcoholism presented in The Simpsons. McCarthy cites Bart's passive-avoidance learning as a risk factor, and notes that Maggie is at a high risk <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> abuse due to violent tendencies.|$|E

25|$|Research {{instruments}} are also often insufficiently sensitive {{to discriminate between}} independent, true dual pathology, and substance-induced symptoms. Structured instruments, as Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Short Screener-GAIN-SS and Psychiatric Research Interview <b>for</b> <b>Substance</b> and Mental Disorders for DSM-IV-PRISM, {{have been developed to}} increase the diagnostic validity. While structured instruments can help organize diagnostic information, clinicians must still make judgments on the origin of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{frequency}} of American Indian alcoholism, a stereotype {{has been applied to}} all American Indians. As with most groups, the incidence of substance abuse is related to issues of poverty and mental distress, both of which may be, in part, the result of racial stereotyping and discrimination. Treatment <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> abuse by Native Americans is more effective when it is community-based, and addresses the issues of cultural identification.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-1980s, {{a number}} of {{initiatives}} began to combine mental health and substance abuse services {{in an attempt to}} meet this need. These programs worked to shift the method of treatment <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> abuse from a confrontational approach to a supportive one. They also introduced new methods to motivate clients and worked with them to develop long-term goals for their care. Although the studies conducted by these initiatives did not have control groups, their results were promising and became the basis for more rigorous efforts to study and develop models of integrated treatment.|$|E

Modifying a technique invented by a National Cancer Institute colleague, Nakanishi has applied cell ablation to the study of neuroscience. In Nakanishi's version of cell ablation, he is able to eliminate specific nerve cell types one at a time, which aids in the study of brain function, dysfunction and compensation.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from {{four weeks of}} rehabilitation in Malibu, California <b>for</b> <b>substance</b> abuse, Cousins was offered an amended contract by West Coast, rumoured to contain strict conditions such as repaying the cost of rehab and undertaking regular drug tests. On 29 June 2007, Cousins was given clearance by the AFL to resume training with the West Coast Eagles, which he did the following Monday. However, he injured a hamstring in training, delaying his comeback until West Coast's home game against Sydney on 21 July at Subiaco Oval. He gained 38 disposals and six marks in the game, inspiring West Coast's win.|$|E

He was caught on camera apparently snorting class A drugs, lines of cocaine, in a Manchester hotel room. Doctors said they were more worried about his depression and alcohol abuse than drug use. Hatton sought medical help two weeks prior after news emerged about a night out where he drank 11 pints of Guinness, vodka and sambuca during the night out with Emma Bowe, 29, the Irish national senior women's boxing champion.|$|E

Indeed <b>for</b> such <b>substances,</b> it may be technically difficult or not feasible (i) to conduct a bioconcentration fish test since aqueous exposure via gill uptake is reduced and no longer accounts for the dominant exposure pathway, and/or (ii) to analyse the concentration in water. Instead, a dietary fish test has been developed to determine uptake by ingestion, yielding a biomagnification factor (BMF) [33].|$|R
40|$|Kateřina Janská Evaluation of the {{kinetics}} of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors {{in vitro}} Diploma thesis Charles University in Prag, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové Pharmacy Department of Biological and Medical Sciences Supervisor: Doc. MUDr. Josef Herink, DrSc. Consultant: PharmDr. Vendula Šepsová The {{aim of the}} thesis {{was to determine the}} type of an inhibition of newly synthesized AChEI and to find out if AChEI structure changes influence the type of an inhibition. Altogether 12 substances (7 tacrine hybrides and 5 7 -methoxy- donepezil hybrids) were investigated. The inhibition potential of the tested substances was studied in vitro on the human recombinant AChE. Spectrophotometric Ellman method was utilized as the measurement tool. The noncompetitive type of an inhibition <b>for</b> <b>substances</b> EN 1 - 5, PC- 25 and PC- 33, mixed type of an inhibition <b>for</b> <b>substances</b> PC- 48 and PC- 49, uncompetitive type of an inhibition <b>for</b> <b>substances</b> EN- 6, EN- 7 and competitive type of an inhibition <b>for</b> the <b>substance</b> PC- 37 was determined. The greatest inhibition potential according to Ki values were found <b>for</b> <b>substances</b> EN- 7 and PC- 37. Substances PC- 37 and PC- 48 were determined as substances with the biggest affinity to the AChE. The type of an inhibition has been influenced by a substituent position in PC substances and by [...] ...|$|R
