25|$|In 1962 Macpherson {{first became}} {{involved}} in land use planning after the national farm press began publishing articles on the topic. Around the country residential housing was beginning to encroach upon established farm land, driving up land values and making agricultural production uneconomic. In California an alternative had been conceived {{in the form of}} special farm zones, which would protect farmers from this escalating problem. Macpherson could <b>foresee</b> <b>a</b> similar situation developing in his own area and was interested by the idea, which he was able to promote through his chairmanship of an advisory committee to the Oregon State University Extension Service.|$|E

Despite having warned of the difficulty of provisioning for a long war, he was blamed for the shortage of shells in the spring of 1915– one of the events leading to the formation of a coalition government– and stripped of his control over munitions and strategy.|$|E

25|$|It {{was decided}} to focus on bombing Britain's {{industrial}} cities, in daylight to begin with. The main focus was London. The first major raid took place on 7 September. On 15 September, on a date known as Battle of Britain Day, a large-scale raid was launched in daylight, but suffered significant loss for no lasting gain. Although {{there were a few}} large air battles fought in daylight later in the month and into October, the Luftwaffe switched its main effort to night attacks. This became official policy on 7 October. The air campaign soon got under way against London and other British cities. However, the Luftwaffe faced limitations. Its aircraft—Dornier Do 17, Junkers Ju 88, and Heinkel He 111s—were capable of carrying out strategic missions but were incapable of doing greater damage because of their small bomb-loads. The Luftwaffes decision in the interwar period to concentrate on medium bombers can be attributed to several reasons: Hitler did not intend or <b>foresee</b> <b>a</b> war with Britain in 1939; OKL believed a medium bomber could carry out strategic missions just as well as a heavy bomber force; and Germany did not possess the resources or technical ability to produce four-engined bombers before the war.|$|E

500|$|Among leading musical figures at {{the premiere}} were Jules Massenet, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, {{suffering}} from an abscess {{in her right}} eye, was unable to be present. The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight. Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: [...] "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish". Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue. Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as [...] "the very incarnation of vice". Others complained {{of a lack of}} melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of Auber and Boieldieu. Léon Escudier in L'Art Musical called the music [...] "dull and obscure... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes". There was, however, praise from the poet Théodore de Banville, who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique [...] "puppets". The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: [...] "I <b>foresee</b> <b>a</b> definite and hopeless flop".|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} Rensselaer Plan, the Institute {{recently}} completed a major project to improve its athletic facilities with the East Campus Athletic Village. The plan included {{construction of a new}} and much larger 4,842‑seat football stadium, a basketball arena with seating for 1,200, a new 50-meter pool, an indoor track and field complex, new tennis courts, new weight rooms and a new sports medicine center. The Institute broke ground on August 26, 2007, and construction of the first phase is expected to last two years. The estimated cost of the project is $78million for phase one and $35–$45million for phase two. Since the completion of the new stadium, the bleachers on the Class of '86 football field on the central campus have been removed and the field has become an open space.

2500|$|Much of Jeremiah's prophetic preaching {{is based}} on the theme of the {{covenant}} between God and Israel (God would protect the people in return for their exclusive worship of him): Jeremiah insists that the covenant is conditional, and can be broken by Israel's apostasy (worship of gods other than Yahweh, the God of Israel). The people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness makes judgement inevitable. Interspersed with this are references to repentance and renewal, although it is unclear whether Jeremiah thought that repentance could ward off judgement or whether it would have to follow judgement. The theme of restoration is strongest in chapter 31:32, which looks to a future in which a new covenant made with Israel and Judah, one which will not be broken. This is the theme of the [...] "new covenant" [...] passage at chapter 31:31–34, drawing on Israel's past relationship with God through the covenant at Sinai to <b>foresee</b> <b>a</b> new future in which Israel will be obedient to God.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009 Hau {{and team}} laser-cooled clouds of one million {{rubidium}} atoms {{to just a}} fraction of a degree above absolute zero. They then launched this millimeter-long atomic cloud towards a suspended carbon nanotube, located some two centimeters away and charged to hundreds of volts. The results were published in 2010, heralding new interactions between cold atoms and nanoscale systems. They observed that most atoms passed by, but approximately 10 per million were inescapably attracted, causing them to dramatically accelerate both movement and temperature. [...] "At this point, the speeding atoms separate into an electron and an ion rotating in parallel around the nanowire, completing each orbit in just a few trillionths of a second. The electron eventually gets sucked into the nanotube via quantum tunneling, causing its companion ion to shoot away – repelled by the strong charge of the 300-volt nanotube – at a speed of roughly 26kilometers per second, or 59,000miles per hour." [...] Atoms can rapidly disintegrate, without having to collide with each other in this experiment. The team is quick to note that this effect is not produced by gravity, as calculated in blackholes that exist in space, but by the high electrical charge in the nanotube. The experiment combines nanotechnology with cold atoms to demonstrate a new type of high-resolution, single-atom, chip-integrated detector that may ultimately be able to resolve fringes from the interference of matter waves. The scientists also <b>foresee</b> <b>a</b> range of single-atom, fundamental studies made possible by their setup.|$|E

2500|$|Although Maus' {{first two}} {{official}} albums Songs (2006) and Love Is Real (2007) generally drew negative reviews upon release, a cult following gradually formed. In the late 2000s, {{he was awarded}} a scholarship to study political philosophy at the University of Hawaii, where he had a day job as a professor. In the evenings, he continued working on music from his office. By 2009, Maus relocated from Hawaii to a secluded cabin in Minnesota, where he struggled to write material for a third album. He said that he eventually gave up, and instead began [...] "doing lots of chemistry projects and chromatography experiments. I set myself on fire a few times heating inflammable solvents." [...] Meanwhile, he continued his studies at the European Graduate School in Saas Fee, Switzerland and earned his master's degree. He did not live in Switzerland, [...] "but would go {{out there in the}} summers. It's like that Black Mountain thing that they did over here years ago, where they bring out all of the heavy hitters and you can study with them yourself." [...] One of his professors was the French philosopher Alain Badiou, who would originate the title of his third album We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves (2011). After the positive response to Pitiless Censors, Maus grew more widely accepted as an outsider artist, and there was a critical reevaluation of his earlier work. In 2012, the album was followed with the compilation A Collection of Rarities and Previously Unreleased Material. Spanning recordings from 1999 to 2010, the collection selects outtakes from his previous three albums in addition to tracks which had appeared on other compilations.
