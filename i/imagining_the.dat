5|$|In Eastern Europe, Milica Bakić–Hayden {{developed}} {{the concept of}} Nesting Orientalisms (1992), derived from {{the ideas of the}} historian Larry Wolff (Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment, 1994) and Said's ideas in Orientalism (1978). The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (<b>Imagining</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E

5|$|<b>Imagining</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of an artistic community at Upton, Morris helped develop plans for a second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved {{with his family to}} No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the episode {{developed}} from writer Jon Vitti {{coming up with}} a long list of bad things Bart would do for attention <b>imagining</b> <b>the</b> potential consequences. The only idea that developed into an interesting episode concept was Bart cheating on an IQ test. This idea was based on an incident from Vitti's childhood when a number of his classmates did not take an intelligence test seriously and suffered poor academic treatment because of it. Because Bart was already obviously unintelligent, Vitti reversed the problem for his episode. Vitti used all his memories of elementary school behavior to produce a draft script of 71 pages, substantially above the required length of about 45 pages.|$|E

25|$|The prohibition, or in {{some cases}} delay, of the giver/receiver {{interaction}} creates a myriad of situations. The dehumanization of organs and the removal of all possible donor characteristics do not prevent receivers from <b>imagining</b> <b>the</b> lives of the individuals who provided the organs. Studies have shed light on cases where organ receivers feel the essence of the organ donors inside them after transplantation. The close kin of donors who have died also maintain the idea that the person in their family who has died continues to live in the body of someone else.|$|E

25|$|There are no {{comparable}} La Tène style hollow torcs {{known from}} Ireland, although somewhat similar examples {{such as the}} Snettisham Torc are known from Britain in this period. The design on the torc can be studied easily by <b>imagining</b> <b>the</b> hollow tube as straightened and flattened. This {{was done in the}} first study of the hoard by Arthur Evans and his drawing can be seen here. The design matches other Irish pieces, and may have been a remodelling of a plainer British or Rhineland torc (the Rhineland is one possible source of the gold).|$|E
25|$|Under English law {{effective}} {{during the}} {{ratification of the}} U.S. Constitution, including the Treason Act 1351, there were essentially five species of treason. Of the five, the Constitution adopted only two: levying war and adhering to enemies. Omitted were species of treason involving encompassing (or <b>imagining)</b> <b>the</b> death of the king, certain types of counterfeiting, and finally fornication with women in the royal family of the sort which could {{call into question the}} parentage of royal successors. James Wilson wrote the original draft of this section, and he was involved as a defense attorney for some accused of treason against the Patriot cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{several of}} Plato's dialogues, Socrates promulgates {{the idea that}} {{knowledge}} {{is a matter of}} recollection, and not of learning, observation, or study. He maintains this view somewhat at his own expense, because in many dialogues, Socrates complains of his forgetfulness. Socrates is often found arguing that knowledge is not empirical, and that it comes from divine insight. In many middle period dialogues, such as the Phaedo, Republic and Phaedrus Plato advocates a belief in the immortality of the soul, and several dialogues end with long speeches <b>imagining</b> <b>the</b> afterlife. More than one dialogue contrasts knowledge and opinion, perception and reality, nature and custom, and body and soul.|$|E
