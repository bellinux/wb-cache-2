50|$|In 1952, {{the firm}} made {{headlines}} when its managing partner, Harold L. Stuart, {{testified before the}} U.S. Supreme Court for the government's antitrust case against Morgan Stanley and 16 other major investment banks. The fact that Halsey, Stuart was a significant Wall Street player (responsible for the most IPOs in 1951) led some observers to suspect that they had provoked the government's antitrust suit. This claim that Halsey was a major IPO player is factually incorrect, Halsey Stuart {{was not involved in}} significant equity trades or IPO's.

This firm was a fixed income underwriter and trader, municipal bonds, railroad <b>equipment</b> <b>trusts</b> certificates and utility bonds. The hearings in question came about because Halsey was excluded from industrial bond underwriting by the 16 noted above in retaliation for the firm's helping to foster legislation causing public utilities to sell their bond offering at public auction - industrial underwriting were negotiated sales involving the big 16 but not Halsey. There is a book by Forrest McDonald - The Phaeton Ride; the Crisis of American Success, published in the 1960s, which speaks to the connections among the Insull Affair, Halsey Stuart and these hearings.|$|R

Methods The experiment was carried out with 10 experienced subjects and 32 naive subjects on an EEG-BCI system. There were 3 experiments: The experienced homogeneous experiment, the naive homogeneous experiment and the naive heterogeneous experiment. Each experiment was compared {{in terms of the}} six audio-visual cue combinations and consisted of 50 trials. The EEG data was classified using the least square linear classifier in case of the naive subjects through the common spatial pattern filter. The accuracy was calculated using the training and test data set. The p -value of the accuracy was obtained through the statistical significance test. Results In the case in which a naive subject was trained by a heterogeneous combined cue and tested by a visual cue, the result was not only the highest accuracy (p Conclusions We propose the use of this measuring methodology of a heterogeneous combined cue for training data and a visual cue for test data by the typical EEG-BCI algorithm on the EEG-BCI system to achieve effectiveness in terms of consistence, stability, cost, time, and resources management without the need for a trial and error process. </p...|$|R
40|$|PublishedThis is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Nature Publishing Group via the DOI in this record. Uncontrolled self-association is a major challenge in the exploitation of proteins as therapeutics. Here we describe {{the development of a}} structural proteomics approach to identify the amino acids responsible for aberrant self-association of monoclonal antibodies and the design of a variant with reduced aggregation and increased serum persistence in vivo. We show that the human monoclonal antibody, MEDI 1912, selected against nerve growth factor binds with picomolar affinity, but undergoes reversible self-association and has a poor pharmacokinetic profile in both rat and cynomolgus monkeys. Using hydrogen/deuterium exchange and cross-linking-mass spectrometry we map the residues responsible for self-association of MEDI 1912 and show that disruption of the self-interaction interface by three mutations enhances its biophysical properties and serum persistence, whilst maintaining high affinity and potency. Immunohistochemistry suggests that this is achieved via reduction of non-specific tissue binding. The strategy developed represents a powerful and generic approach to improve the properties of therapeutic proteins.

40|$|Acoustic {{communication}} requires filter {{mechanisms to}} process and recognize key {{features of the}} perceived signals. We analysed such a filter mechanism in field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), which communicate with species-specific repetitive patterns of sound pulses and chirps. A delay-line and coincidence-detection mechanism, in which each sound pulse {{has an impact on}} the processing of the following pulse, is implicated to underlie the recognition of the species-specific pulse pattern. Based on this concept, we hypothesized that altering the duration of a single pulse or inter-pulse interval in three-pulse chirps will lead to different behavioural responses. Phonotaxis was tested in female crickets walking on a trackball exposed to different sound paradigms. Changing the duration of either the first, second or third pulse of the chirps led to three different characteristic tuning curves. Long first pulses decreased the phonotactic response whereas phonotaxis remained strong when the third pulse was long. Chirps with three pulses of increasing duration of 5, 20 and 50 ms elicited phonotaxis, but the chirps were not attractive when played in reverse order. This demonstrates specific, pulse duration-dependent effects while sequences of pulses are processed. The data are in agreement with a mechanism in which processing of a sound pulse has an effect on the processing of the subsequent pulse, as outlined in the flow of activity in a delay-line and coincidence-detector circuit. Additionally our data reveal a substantial increase in the gain of phonotaxis, when the number of pulses of a chirp is increased from two to three. E. J.

40|$|Development, cancer, {{neurodegenerative}} and demyelinating diseases, injury, {{and stem}} cell manipulations are characterised by alterations in cell number. Research into development, disease, {{and the effects}} of drugs require cell number counts. These are generally indirect estimates, because counting cells in an animal or organ is paradoxically difficult, as well as being tedious and unmanageable. Drosophila is a powerful model organism used to investigate the genetic bases of development and disease. There are Drosophila models for multiple neurodegenerative diseases, characterised by an increase in cell death. However, a fast, reliable, and accurate way to count the number of dying cells in vivo is not available. Here, we present a method based on image filtering and mathematical morphology techniques, to count automatically the number of dying cells in intact fruit-fly embryos. We call the resulting programme DeadEasy Caspase. It has been validated for Drosophila and we present examples of its power to address biological questions. Quantification is automatic, accurate, objective, and very fast. DeadEasy Caspase will be freely available as an ImageJ plug-in, and it can be modified for use in other sample types. It is of interest to the Drosophila and wider biomedical communities. DeadEasy Caspase is a powerful tool for the analysis of cell survival and cell death in development and in disease, such as neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. Combined with the power of Drosophila genetics, DeadEasy expands the tools that enable the use of Drosophila to analyse gene function, model disease and test drugs in the intact nervous system and whole animal.

40|$|Drug-induced phospholipidosis (DIPL) is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} the phospholipid content of the cell and the accumulation of drugs and lipids inside the lysosomes of affected tissues, including in the liver. Although of uncertain pathological significance for patients, the condition remains a major impediment for the clinical development of new drugs. Human Sandhoff disease (SD) is caused by inherited defects of the β subunit of lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (Hex) A and B, leading to a large array of symptoms, including neurodegeneration and ultimately death by the age of 4 in its most common form. The substrates of Hex A and B, gangliosides GM 2 and GA 2, accumulate inside the lysosomes of the CNS and in peripheral organs. Given that both DIPL and SD are associated with lysosomes and lipid metabolism in general, we measured the hepatic lipid profiles in rodent models of these two conditions using untargeted LC/MS to examine potential commonalities. Both model systems shared a number of perturbed lipid pathways, notably those involving metabolism of cholesteryl esters, lysophosphatidylcholines, bis(monoacylglycero) phosphates, and ceramides. We report here profound alterations in lipid metabolism in the SD liver. In addition, DIPL induced a wide range of lipid changes not previously observed in the liver, highlighting similarities with those detected in the model of SD and raising concerns that these lipid changes may be associated with underlying pathology associated with lysosomal storage disorders.

40|$|Vehicles {{of today}} have become {{increasingly}} dependent on software to handle their functionalities. Updating and maintaining the software in vehicles has therefore become a costly process for the automotive industry. By introducing wireless communications to vehicles, vehicular maintenance can greatly be improved and many other new applications can also {{be brought to the}} vehicles. However, the vehicle was not designed with security in mind. Since the vehicle is safety-critical, it is vital that such new remote services do not violate the safety and security requirements of the vehicle. Thus, this thesis presents a general approach to securing the connected car and the usefulness of the approach is demonstrated in a vehicular diagnostics scenario. The thesis comes in two main parts. In the first part, we address security mechanisms for the connected car. First, a survey of current mechanisms to secure the in-vehicle networks is made. Then, a description of possible communication methods with vehicles is given and a taxonomy of current entities involved in such communication is presented. The taxonomy is organised in actors, vehicle-to-X communications, network paths, and dependability and security attributes. The usefulness of the taxonomy is demonstrated by two examples. In the second part, we address security with respect to vehicular diagnostics. First, an overall security analysis of the interaction between the connected car and the repair shop is conducted. We find that the most imminent risk in the repair shop is the loss of authentication keys. The loss of such keys allows masquerading attacks against vehicles. To address this problem, we propose a Kerberos-inspired protocol for authentication and authorisation of the diagnostics <b>equipment</b> and a <b>trusted</b> third party is introduced. To conclude, this thesis shows the value of adopting a structured approach to securing the connected car. The approach {{has been shown to be}} useful for identifying threats and countermeasures and thus help improving security. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Non-invasive {{positive}} pressure ventilation (NIPPV) {{has been}} shown to be beneficial in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicated by respiratory failure. A survey was undertaken to assess the availability of NIPPV for the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD and to determine how NIPPV is delivered in hospitals in the UK.  METHODS—A questionnaire was sent to consultants with an interest in respiratory medicine from 268 of the hospitals found in the BTS directory. The questionnaire enquired about the hospital as well as the availability of NIPPV in the hospital. If NIPPV was available in the hospital, details of implementation, staffing and funding were determined.  RESULTS—Replies to the questionnaire were received from 98. 5 % of consultants. NIPPV was available in 48 % of hospitals, these hospitals tending to serve larger populations and to have more respiratory physicians than the hospitals where NIPPV was not available. There was considerable regional variation in the availability of NIPPV. In hospitals where NIPPV was not available the reason(s) were lack of consultant training in 53 %, lack of other staff training in 63 %, financial in 63 %, and doubt about the benefit of NIPPV in 15 % of cases. In those hospitals where NIPPV was available, clinical practice varied greatly: 68 % of centres treated fewer than 20 patients a year with this form of treatment and 9 % treated more than 60 patients a year. Although NIPPV was paid for completely from the <b>trust</b> <b>equipment</b> budget in 46 hospitals (41 %), other money such as research or charitable funds were used at least partially in the other hospitals and NIPPV was financed solely from research or charitable funds in 41 hospitals (37 %).  CONCLUSIONS—Equipment for NIPPV is available in less than half of the acute hospitals in the UK. In those in which it is available it is generally underused. Lack of training and problems with funding are generally given for the failure to introduce NIPPV. ...|$|R
