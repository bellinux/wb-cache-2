5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American working class and politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option.</b> While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E

She cited her {{daughter}} as her source of motivation: [...] "I had {{the most important person}} in my world, my daughter, to make proud each day and to remind me what I was working towards.

5|$|A {{ketogenic}} diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein) {{appears to}} decrease the number of seizures and eliminate seizures in some, however further research is necessary. It is a reasonable option in those who have epilepsy that is not improved with medications and for whom surgery <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option.</b> About 10% stay on the diet {{for a few years}} due to issues of effectiveness and tolerability. Side effects include stomach and intestinal problems in 30%, and there are long-term concerns about heart disease. Less radical diets are easier to tolerate and may be effective. It is unclear why this diet works. Exercise has been proposed as possibly useful for preventing seizures with some data to support this claim.|$|E
5|$|When {{the player}} {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> in battles against trainers). Pokémon have hit points (HP), which is displayed during combat; when a Pokémon's HP {{is reduced to}} zero, it faints and cannot battle unless taken to a Pokémon Center or healed or revived with a Pokémon skill or item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, or when certain conditions are met (commonly, how much a Pokémon statistically 'likes' its trainer).|$|E
5|$|Early {{during the}} {{development}} of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (The New York Times reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least The Winds of Winter before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> for them as the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published {{before the start of the}} sixth season of the HBO series.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{mechanics}} of Ruby and Sapphire are largely {{the same as}} their predecessors'. As with all Pokémon games for hand-held consoles, gameplay is in third-person, overhead perspective and consists of three basic screens: a field map, in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures their party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon, and can capture more using Poké Balls. The player can also use their Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch their active Pokémon, or flee (the last <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> in battles against trainers). All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle until it is revived. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it may level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} six months, {{as chair of the}} Co-operative Commission, I have been hearing {{evidence}} from organisations and individuals {{with a wide range of}} views on the direction that the movement should take. My colleagues and I have been impressed by many things: first and foremost, the goodwill towards the co-operative movement that is to be found in many, many places. There is also a willingness to embrace change and an awareness that no change <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{countermeasure}} {{is intended}} {{as an alternative}} to the more effective target/citywide emergency evacuation when the latter would no longer be viable due to time constraints. Maneuvers similar, but not identical, to Duck and Cover also find use during the event of a sudden earthquake or tornado when preventive emergency evacuation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option,</b> again, due to time constraints. In these cases, Drop, Cover and Hold on can likewise prevent injury or death which may otherwise occur if no other safety measures are taken.|$|E
25|$|Researchers in China who {{published}} their {{findings in the}} People's Political Consultative Daily in 2001, pointed out that this incident led to the transformation of women's rights after the Song dynasty. Since {{the members of the}} imperial family who were captured were sold as slaves or concubines, Chinese rulers after the Song dynasty emphasised the importance of sexual norms, especially a woman's chastity and loyalty towards her husband. Chinese rulers of later dynasties instructed that when a woman is confronted between the choice of survival or the honour of chastity, survival <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option.</b>|$|E

25|$|Completely clear {{filtrate}} {{cannot be}} obtained using belt press filters except in rare circumstances.

If recycling or reuse <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> the filtrate should be discharged subject to legislation and license requirements. Further treatment of clarified water (filtration or chemical treatment) may be required before discharge.|$|E
25|$|Saredon Mill {{bridge is}} in good condition, after Trust volunteers rebuilt the parapets.

Cross bridge has again been lowered, but carries sufficient traffic that a lift bridge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option.</b> The channel is in water, and is almost navigable here. Cats Bridge was replaced by a culvert, after it suffered from subsidence. An accommodation bridge beyond it was demolished by the Trust, as it had cracked and sunk as a result of subsidence. It is unlikely to be replaced, since it no longer served a useful purpose.|$|E
25|$|Each {{receiver}} must {{be connected}} to an external antenna, which is included with the receiver. Antenna placement is crucial to receiving a clear signal. In some locations users have experienced difficulty receiving the Sirius programming because the signal is not consistently strong. For best reception, antennas should be placed such {{that they have an}} unobstructed view of the sky (preferably on rooftops without overhanging eaves or trees). If this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>an</b> <b>option,</b> the antenna should be placed on an exterior wall. When placing on an exterior wall, the antenna should be mounted to a wall which faces the center of the continental United States in order to minimize the likelihood of the building itself blocking the signal.|$|E
