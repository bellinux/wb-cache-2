5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to write from right to left.|$|E
5|$|As the Emperor's {{personal}} taster, Halotus would accompany Claudius {{to every}} banquet and dinner and as chief steward, {{he would have}} been with Claudius and his family {{for the majority of the}} time. Thus he could have formed a relationship with Agrippina the Younger, suggesting the possibility of their collaboration in poisoning Claudius. It also meant that {{he would have been}} aware of details such as the Emperor's food preferences, his meal times and his schedule, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to commit the murder.|$|E
5|$|Law {{first came}} to Yonkers due to him {{marketing}} {{the products of the}} Alexander Smith & Sons Carpet Company in Yonkers for the manufacture of moquette carpets. Walter Law increased the business of Sloane's wholesale department by securing their account; he eventually became a stockholder and member of the Yonkers company's board of directors. Law and his wife moved to Hillcrest, at 354 Palisade Avenue in Yonkers, making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to service the Smith account. He later became a vice president of W. & J. Sloane, and also joined its Board of Directors.|$|E

5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but only wanted to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him {{not to make a}} decision until after this was over.|$|E
25|$|With the {{addition}} of the Saturday Night Football game on ABC in 2006, GameDay has increasingly aired from that game. This could be done for many reasons including the fact Kirk Herbstreit is on both programs, thus making it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Another reason could be to give the Saturday Night Football game added exposure.|$|E
25|$|Reinhart played minor hockey in West Vancouver, British Columbia, {{where his}} father Paul, a former National Hockey League (NHL) player, settled {{following}} his career. Max viewed his father as the greatest influence on his development as a player, and found that being {{the son of a}} former NHL player made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to be noticed by scouts. He was drafted into the Western Hockey League (WHL) by the Kootenay Ice with their fourth round selection, 86th overall, at the 2007 WHL Bantam Draft.|$|E

25|$|During these {{sessions}} the Federalist Party {{was so small}} and weak that partisan divisions mattered {{much less than the}} personal relationships that developed among the members. McLane quickly became a friend and admirer of William H. Crawford and Martin Van Buren, {{and at the same time}} became an opponent of Henry Clay and John Quincy Adams. These friendships were based more on personality than policy agreement, and were so important that McLane was one of Crawford’s strongest proponents in the presidential election of 1824. Once Crawford returned to Georgia, McLane, Van Buren, and the other Crawford supporters fell into the party of Andrew Jackson. This was all the <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> given his existing friendship with Martin Van Buren, who became his mentor and advocate.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control is because he determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control is because he is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
500|$|Back at his {{halfway house}} Dickerson is wearing the missing badge, as the house's trustee Connor scolds him for {{breaking}} curfew—and threatens not {{to cover up}} for him any more. After Connor leaves, James finds an obituary in the newspaper and circles it. Elsewhere, Black finds the name [...] "Ray Bell" [...] in the same newspaper as the victim's son's obituary, and deduces that the killer may have been frequenting funerals before, probably taking souvenirs like the badge. He believes that the victim is his first, but that killing will become <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|He {{was born}} in Lambeth, south London. Myrie-Williams and {{his family moved to}} Bristol at the age of 14 {{in order to make it}} <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to play at Bristol City's Academy. He states that the biggest {{influence}} in his life is his mother, as well as saying that former Bristol City manager Gary Johnson [...] "really looked after him" [...] during his time at the club. He has always wanted to play professional football, and stated that he never considered any other career path. He supports Manchester United, and [...] "loves watching the way they play", in particular the club's treble winning team during the 1998–99 campaign. He has a daughter, born in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Simon the Sorcerer, was {{released}} on floppy disk in 1993 for the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles. It was re-released in 1994 for the Amiga CD32, featuring an enhanced soundtrack. It was also released on PC CD-ROM, featuring Chris Barrie {{as the voice of}} Simon. Simon Woodroffe stated that he had Barrie in mind when writing the scripts, and that it was <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to do so when thinking of an actor he knew speaking the lines. It cost around £3000 per day to hire Barrie. Woodroffe said that there was [...] "no hesitation" [...] in doing a talkie version, and that it was [...] "the next big thing". Simon the Sorcerer used the visual and interface designs from LucasArts' games, and Woodroffe stated that this was because they had set a standard, and that Adventure Soft's focus was humour and story-telling.|$|E
500|$|Kogen {{commented that}} Lisa and Marge episodes [...] "tend {{to be the}} better episodes", {{because they are more}} {{thought-out}} and have more emotional depth to them. However, they are harder to write than other episodes because they are [...] "less jokey." [...] The writers therefore made the decision to replace Marge's role with Homer, who tends to be funnier than Marge. Jean commented that because he has a daughter, Homer–Lisa episodes are <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to write and he [...] "always want to work on them." [...] Moore said they are his favorite episodes to direct, because [...] "the two most opposite characters in the cast finding some kind of common ground [...] That was always interesting." [...] In one scene, Homer makes Lisa sit {{on the end of the}} sofa so that she will not interrupt the game. Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa, recalls that many people at the table-read thought Homer was [...] "too harsh" [...] in the scene, but it ended up being included in the episode anyway.|$|E

500|$|Roberts joined Yeovil Town on loan, {{initially}} for {{a four-month}} spell, in August 2008. After impressing during his loan spell at Huish Park, Roberts completed a permanent transfer to Yeovil for a nominal fee on 31 October 2008, with the deal officially going through on 1 January 2009. Roberts played 34 games for Yeovil during the 2008–09 season, scoring two goals. In his final game for Yeovil against Cheltenham Town he was sent-off. His girlfriend {{left him in}} May 2009, and Roberts was forced to move back in with his parents in Chester. On 5 August 2009, Roberts was suspended by Yeovil Town for a breach of club discipline and was released by mutual consent after reported drink and gambling problems, the final straw coming when he [...] "turned up at a club-organised family fun day with the stench of alcohol on his breath". He later admitted his heart {{was not at the}} club, and that being alone in a hotel room away from his girlfriend and young son made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to turn to alcohol.|$|E
500|$|Ripken {{was drafted}} by the Baltimore Orioles {{in the second round}} of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft 48th overall. Despite a story written by SABR, Ripken was {{selected}} with the Orioles' predetermined draft pick, not through a forfeited pick from the Boston Red Sox after the Sox selected Dick Drago in the 1977 re-entry draft. The Orioles would select catcher Cecil Whitehead with the pick they received from Boston two picks after Ripken. On deciding to go straight from high school to the professional level, he said, [...] "When the colleges started coming around, Dad and I talked about mostly whether I was going to pursue a career in baseball. If I had the ability, the feeling was to get on with it, and if it didn't work out, start over again in college at 25 or 26." [...] Ripken played both pitcher and shortstop in high school; in fact, the Orioles were the only team not just interested in his pitching ability. The Orioles decided to start him playing shortstop in the minor leagues, deciding it would be <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to transition back to pitching if necessary than it would be for him to start hitting again.|$|E
500|$|That same year, he {{fell out}} of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him {{effectively}} ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as [...] "a fortunate event" [...] and cited it {{as a factor in}} making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure {{he was going to be}} promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to get into college.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{story and}} script {{were written by}} Sakurai. With video game stories, Sakurai {{believes}} that developers lack an ability to balance story-based gameplay hindrances with the prerequisite of victory over enemies. To this end, he was obsessed with striking that balance with Uprising, and so wrote the entire story script himself. He did this so he could write a story that [...] "jibed" [...] with the flow and style of gameplay. The characters' roles and personalities were shaped by their roles {{in the game and}} the game structure itself. He also wanted the dialogue to mesh perfectly with the story and music: by writing the script himself, Sakurai was able to sidestep the necessity of explaining to another writer all the time. This also made fine tuning much <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> While retaining the first game's Greek mythic influences, the mythology itself had no direct influence on the story of Uprising. Sakurai also {{wanted to make sure that}} the game's Greek influence did not stray in the same direction as the God of War series. For the main story, Sakurai avoided portraying a simple good versus evil situation; instead, he had the various factions coming into conflict due to clashing views rather than openly malicious intentions, with their overlapping conflicts creating escalating levels of chaos for players to experience. Rather than relying on stand-alone cutscenes, the majority of story dialogue was incorporated into gameplay. What cutscenes there were made as short as possible. Events after Chapter 6 were deliberately kept secret during the run-up to release so players would be taken by surprise by what they experienced. The character of Palutena, a damsel in distress in the original game, was reworked as Pit's partner and support. The original idea was for Pit to have a mascot character as his support, but it was abandoned in favor of Palutena. Pit and Palutena's dialogue was influenced by the traditions of Japanese double acts. Dark Pit was written as a mirror image of Pit rather than an evil twin. A key element was retaining the humorous elements from the first game, such as anachronistic elements and silly enemy designs. This attitude, as observed by Sakurai, contrasted sharply with the weighty or grim character stories present in the greater majority of video games. The story was originally three chapters longer than the final version, but these additional parts needed to be cut during early development.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} written that Leonardo [...] "may be the most universally {{recognized}} left-handed artist of all time", a fact documented by numerous Renaissance authors, and manifested conspicuously in his drawing and handwriting. In his notebooks, he wrote in mirror image because of his left handedness (it was <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him),</b> and he was falsely {{accused of trying to}} protect his work. Early Italian connoisseurs were divided as to whether Leonardo also drew with his right hand. [...] More recently, Anglo-American art historians have for the most part discounted suggestions of ambidexterity.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was first}} {{reported}} in December 2010 that Anderson wanted to adapt Inherent Vice; at the time, {{he had been}} writing a treatment and started on a script after The Master had been shelved indefinitely months prior. Anderson originally adapted the entire 384-page novel sentence by sentence which made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> to cut down the script than the novel. By February 2011, Anderson had written a first draft and was more than halfway done with a second draft. The first draft was written without a narrator but the character of Sortilège was later turned into {{the voice of the}} narrator. In September 2012, Anderson stated that he was still writing the script but was hoping he could get [...] Inherent Vice into production and have a few years of being more productive.|$|E
