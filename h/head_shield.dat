The modern Nautilus lacks any calcitic plate for closing its shell, and only one extinct nautiloid genus {{is known to have}} borne anything similar. Nautilus does, however, have a leathery <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> (the hood) which it uses to cover the opening when it retreats inside.|$|E
25|$|It is {{inferred}} {{that the}} gills of Bothriolepis {{are of the}} primitive type, though their structure is still not well understood. Laterally, they are enclosed by an opercular fold and {{are found in the}} space beneath the lateral part of the <b>head</b> <b>shield,</b> extending medially underneath the neurocranium. Compared to the gills of normally-shaped fish, the gill region of Bothriolepis is considered to be placed more dorsally, is anteriorly more crowded and, in general, is relatively short and broad.|$|E
25|$|The canopy stayed {{essentially}} {{the same as that of}} the E-4, although the handbook for the 'F' stipulated that the forward, lower triangular panel to starboard was to be replaced by a metal panel with a port for firing signal flares. Many F-1s and F-2s kept this section glazed. A two-piece, all-metal armour plate <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> was added, as on the E-4, to the hinged portion of the canopy, although some lacked the curved top section. A bullet-resistant windscreen could be fitted as an option. The fuel tank was self-sealing, and around 1942 Bf 109Fs were retrofitted with additional armour made from layered light-alloy plate just aft of the pilot and fuel tank. The fuselage aft of the canopy remained essentially unchanged in its externals.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> {{overlaps}} a tapering {{series of}} 12–17 trunk tergites, which lead into {{a set of}} limb-bearing segments comprising the thorax. [...] The limbs are simple in form, consisting of a smooth oval exopod and a stout, annulated endopod. [...] There is no one-to-one correspondence between the thoracic tergites and the limbs, but, rather, {{there appear to be}} two or three limbs per tergite.|$|E
2500|$|Complete Fuxianhuia {{specimens}} {{are approximately}} 4 centimetres long. [...] The anterior of Fuxianhuia [...] is encased in an oval sclerite, from which two stalked eyes emerge. [...] Inserting directly behind this sclerite, on the <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> proper, are two stout antennae. [...] When {{the head of}} Fuxianhuia was originally described, two additional head appendages, the [...] "sub-chelate" [...] pair were also described. [...] These are geniculate, backward-pointing appendages that lie in a highly stereotypical position (i.e., their position does not vary much from one specimen to another). Partly because of this, {{and partly because of}} their rather indistinct morphology, their status as appendages has been questioned. [...] Indeed, on the grounds that these structures seem to lie between two cuticular layers, Waloszek and colleagues have suggested that they are not appendages at all, but rather gut diverticula; a reassignment that has however not been universally accepted. Ventrally, a large plate has been interpreted as a hypostome.|$|E

6000|$|That corslets {{are usually}} {{taken for granted}} as present by the poet, {{even when they are}} not {{explicitly}} named, seems certain. He constantly represents the heroes as [...] "stripping the pieces of mail" [...] [Greek: teuchea], when they have time and opportunity, from fallen foes. If only the shield is taken, if there is nothing else in the way of bronze body armour to take, why have we the plural, [Greek: teuchea]? The corslet, as well as the shield, must be intended. The stripping is usually [...] "from the shoulders," [...] and it is [...] "from his shoulders" [...] that Hector hopes to strip the corslet of Diomede (Iliad, VIII. 195) in a passage, to be sure, which the critics think interpolated. However this may be, the stripping of the (same Greek characters), cannot be the mere seizure of the shield, but must refer to other pieces of armour: [...] "all the pieces of armour." [...] So other pieces of defensive armour besides the shield are throughout taken for granted. If they were not there they could not be stripped. It is the chitons that Agamemnon does something to, in the case of two fallen foes (Iliad, XI. 100), and Aristarchus thought that these chitons were corslets. But the passage is obscure. In Iliad, XI. 373, when Diomede strips helmet from <b>head,</b> <b>shield</b> from shoulder, corslet from breast of Agastrophus, Reichel was for excising the corslet, because it was not mentioned when the hero was struck on the hip joint. I do not see that an inefficient corslet would protect the hip joint. To do that, in our eighteenth century cavalry armour, was the business of a zoster, as may be seen in a portrait of the Chevalier de St. George in youth. It is a thick ribbed zoster that protects the hip joints of the king.|$|E
5000|$|Furca is {{characterized}} by a broad <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> with three pairs of prominent spines: front (anterolateral), side (mediolateral) and rear (posterolateral). The <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> of Furca ranged from 21-31 mm long and 18-29 mm at maximum width. The mediolateral spines are long and strongly curved. The outline of the <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> possess a fringe of small, gently curving secondary spines, between 1.5-7 mm long. Appendages are unknown from fossils.|$|E
5000|$|Specimens of Yohoia have a <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> {{which is}} {{followed}} by 13 trunk tergites, or plates. On both sides, the bottom side of the first 10 of these ended in backward-pointing, triangular points or projections. The last three plates were complete tubes, circling the entire trunk. At {{the end of the}} trunk was a paddle-like tail. There were also a pair of large extensions {{at the front of the}} <b>head</b> <b>shield.</b> They had a pronounced [...] "elbow" [...] and ended in four long spines, looking rather like fingers. There were three appendages on the bottom of the <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> on each side, and these are assumed to have supported the creature on the sandy or silty sea bottom. There were also single appendages hanging down under the body plates which were flap-like and fringed with setae, probably used for swimming and respiration. Specimens also show some bulbous formations at the front of the <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> that may have served as eyes.|$|E

A rootsucker moves through the sand using its broad feet like paddles and its <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> as a shovel to reach the roots of succulents on which it feeds, gnawing them {{with the edge of}} its <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> and lower incisors.

5000|$|As {{in other}} heraldic traditions, {{a coat of}} arms may be {{depicted}} with or without supporters, and many achievements of arms do not include supporters.

According to Volborth, [...] "as a sign of favor, the emperor granted certain princes of the empire {{the right to use}} the imperial eagle as supporter," [...] in which cases the imperial eagle was depicted singly, circumscribing the <b>head</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cephalaspidomorphi were, {{like most}} {{contemporary}} fishes, very well armoured. The <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> was particularly well developed, protecting the head, gills and the anterior {{section of the}} viscera. The body was in most forms well armoured as well. The <b>head</b> <b>shield</b> {{had a series of}} grooves over the whole surface, forming an extensive lateral line organ. The eyes were rather small and placed {{on the top of the}} head.
