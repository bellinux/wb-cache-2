2500|$|In July 2008, Davis's lawyers filed a {{petition}} for a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking {{review of the}} Georgia Supreme Court decision and arguing that the Eighth Amendment creates a substantive right of the innocent not to be executed. However, an execution date was scheduled for September 23, 2008, before the United States Supreme Court decided whether to take up Davis's case. The Georgia Supreme Court refused to grant a stay of execution and the Board of Pardons and Paroles denied clemency. [...] Amnesty International condemned the decision to deny clemency, and former President (and Georgia Governor) Jimmy Carter released a public letter in which he stated [...] "Executing Troy Davis without a real examination of potentially <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence</b> risks taking {{the life of an}} innocent man and would be a grave miscarriage of justice." [...] Reverend Al Sharpton also called for clemency after he met and prayed with Davis on death row. A stay of execution was also supported by the NAACP; the president of the Georgia state conference said [...] "This is a modern-day lynching if it's allowed to go forward." [...] Former Republican Congressman and Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr wrote that he is [...] "a strong believer in the death penalty as an appropriate and just punishment," [...] but that the proper level of fairness and accuracy required for the ultimate punishment has not been met in Davis's case.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1998, a {{young woman}} {{standing}} at a Los Angeles bus stop was taken at knife point to a deserted parking lot and raped by an unknown assailant. A bagel shop manager, Luis Vargas, {{was arrested and charged}} with this crime and with assaults on two other young women. Despite the fact that coworkers at the bagel shop placed him there at the time of the rape (which occurred 20 miles away), based upon ambiguous and contradictory identifications made by the three women, and upon a prior conviction for raping a former girlfriend, Vargas was convicted of the crimes. Vargas stated at the time of his sentencing to 55 years to life in prison on December 7, 1999, [...] "As far as I’m concerned, [...] individual [...] really did these crimes might really be raping someone out there, might really be killing someone out there." [...] Vargas' prophecy proved correct, as rapes and other assaults on women with a similar modus operandi continued to take place, not only after Vargas was sentenced, but even during the time between his arrest and conviction. The CIP became interested in Vargas' case in 2011, when Vargas sent the organization press clippings about recent assaults similar to those of 1998, which were attributed to a serial attacker known as the [...] "Teardrop Rapist." [...] The CIP requested that the clothes of the 1998 rape victim be examined for DNA, using technology not available at the time. The DNA samples did not match Vargas' DNA... but did match DNA taken from recent victims whose attacker matched the profile of the Teardrop Rapist. In September 2015, Vargas was exonerated of the crimes for which he had served nearly 16 years in prison. It was the CIP's third DNA exoneration and its 20th overall. Vargas is currently engaged in a civil suit against the Los Angeles Police Department, prosecutors and others, claiming that <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence</b> was withheld at his original trial. Vargas' case was noted in an article citing the record number of exonerations that occurred in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|When police {{confiscate}} {{and destroy}} a citizen's photographs or recordings of officers' misconduct, the police's act of destroying the evidence may be prosecuted {{as an act}} of evidence tampering, if the recordings being destroyed are potential evidence in a criminal or regulatory investigation of the officers themselves. [...] In a notable case in Nebraska, officers were charged with the felony charge of evidence tampering, as well as misdemeanor obstruction and theft, when they committed brutality and forcibly stole and destroyed the recordings, which was exposed due to a third party's recording. [...] On the other hand, when police departments lose <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence</b> that would create reasonable doubt for defendants in the cases they prosecute, such as dashboard-camera footage from patrol cars, it may be regarded as spoliation of evidence, potentially justifying motions to dismiss and/or mistrials. Police's loss of evidence such as footage may be considered as both spoliation and tampering, if it both exonerates the defendant and proves police misconduct. Spoliation of <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence</b> in criminal cases may also constitute prosecutorial misconduct if the prosecutor is complicit in doing so.|$|E

50|$|Leschi {{was taken}} into custody in early November 1856, and his brother Quiemuth turned himself in shortly thereafter. Quiemuth was murdered on November 18, 1856, by an unknown assailant, in Governor Stevens' office in Olympia, where he was being held for the night {{on his way to the}} jail at Fort Steilacoom, now in Lakewood, Washington. Leschi himself was put on trial on November 17, 1856 for the murder of Colonel Moses, which he denied having committed. His first trial {{resulted}} in a hung jury because of the judge's instruction that killing of combatants during wartime did not constitute murder. The second trial began in March 18, 1857 in which this instruction was not given and his lawyers, Frank Clark and William Wallace, were not allowed to introduce potentially <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence.</b> He was convicted and sentenced to death, to be hanged June 10th, 1857.|$|E

Evidence of Johnson's mental illness was withheld from the defense for three years and, when provided, was in the form of sanitized reports that excluded Johnson's statements, at the order of the prosecution. One of the original prosecutors, Glenn Stevens, left the case and stated that other prosecutors had withheld evidence from the defense, including the information that Johnson's son did not actually identify Ray Buckey in a series of photographs.

One day, he gets into a physical altercation with the police commissioner, who has just purchased the last Sailor Moon backpack for his daughter, a gift Yong-go was saving up to buy for Ye-seung. Soon after, the police commissioner's daughter dies in a freak accident, in which she slips on ice and suffers a fatal blow {{to the back of her}} head while she is taking Yong-go to another store that sells the same backpack.

5000|$|A September 2012 {{report by}} {{researchers}} from Stanford University and New York University criticized the drone campaign, stating {{that it was}} killing {{a high number of}} civilians and turning the Pakistani public against the United States. The report, compiled by interviewing witnesses, drone-attack survivors, and others in Pakistan provided by a Pakistani human rights organization, Foundation for Fundamental Rights, concluded that only 2% of drone strike victims are [...] "high-level" [...] militant leaders. The report's authors did not estimate the numbers of total civilian casualties, but suggested that the February 2012 Bureau of Investigative Journalism report was more accurate than the Long War Journal report (both detailed above) on civilian casualties. The report also opined that the drone attacks were violations of international law, because the US government had not shown that the targets were direct threats to the US. The report further noted the US policy of considering all military-age males in a strike zone as militants following the air strike unless <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence</b> proves otherwise. Media outlets were also urged to cease using the term [...] "militant" [...] when reporting on drone attacks without further explanation.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the exculpatory value of alibi evidence when presented together with various types of incriminating evidence. Previous research has reported that alibi evidence could weaken the effects of DNA evidence and eyewitness identification. The present study assessed the effectiveness of alibi evidence in counteracting defendant 2 ̆ 7 s confession (experiment 1) and eyewitness evidence (experiment 2). In experiment 1, three levels of alibi evidence (none, weak, strong) were combined with three levels of confession evidence (voluntary, elicited under low pressure, elicited under high pressure). Results indicated significant main effects of confession and alibi and an alibi by confession interaction. Of participants exposed to high-pressure confession, those in the strong alibi condition rendered lower guilt estimates {{than those in the}} no alibi condition. In experiment 2, three levels of alibi were combined with two levels of eyewitness evidence (bad view, good view). A main effect of alibi was obtained, but no interaction between alibi and eyewitness evidence. ^ An explanation of this pattern is based in part on the Story Model (Pennington 2 ̆ 6 Hastie, 1992) and a novel “culpability threshold” model of juror decision-making. The Story Model suggests that jurors generate verdict stories (interpretations of events consistent with a guilty or not guilty verdict) based on trial evidence. If the evidence in favor of guilt exceeds jurors 2 ̆ 7 threshold for perceiving culpability, jurors will fail to properly consider <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence.</b> However, when the strength of incriminating evidence does not exceed the jurors 2 ̆ 7 threshold, they are likely to give appropriate consideration to exculpatory evidence in their decisions. ^ Presentation of a reliable confession in Experiment 1 exceeded jurors 2 ̆ 7 culpability threshold and rendered alibi largely irrelevant. In contrast, presentation of a high-pressure confession failed to exceed jurors 2 ̆ 7 culpability threshold, so jurors turned to alibi evidence in their decisions. Similarly, in the second experiment, eyewitness evidence (in general) was not strong enough to surpass the culpability threshold, and thus jurors incorporated alibi evidence in their decisions. A third study is planned to further test this “culpability threshold” model, further explore various types of alibi evidence, and clarify when exculpatory evidence will sufficiently weaken the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s “story. ”...|$|E

40|$|Thursday, August 24, 2000 WRITER: Kathy R. Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Ron Carlson, (706) 542 - 5186 (O); (706) / 548 - 6771 (H) UPCOMING RAMSEY INTERVIEWS COULD JUMPSTART INVESTIGATION, SAYS UGA LAW PROF ATHENS, Ga. [...] Monday 2 ̆ 7 s {{scheduled}} {{interviews with}} John and Patsy Ramsey {{could provide the}} jumpstart that the stalled investigation of their daughter Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s brutal murder needs, says UGA trial and criminal law expert Ron Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 These interviews are a positive sign, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 They signal {{to the public that}} the case remains under active investigation. Second, they bring the Ramseys together with the people responsible for solving this crime - the Boulder police. Such cooperation is virtually always helpful to law enforcement. Finally, while participation in these interviews may not conclusively establish the innocence of the Ramseys, the willingness of John and Patsy to sit for interrogation - which they are not required to do - does impress many people as conduct which is inconsistent with guilt. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson has previously criticized some Colorado police and prosecutors for their refusal to discuss certain aspects of the case, saying that the Ramseys had been 2 ̆ 2 so pilloried, so horribly tried in the media, that in fairness, some of the <b>exonerating</b> <b>evidence</b> should be disclosed. 2 ̆ 2 For example, he cites last fall 2 ̆ 7 s disclosures published by Newsweek magazine: 2 ̆ 2 Newsweek reported that DNA from tissue found under Jon-Benet 2 ̆ 7 s fingernails has not been matched to anyone in the family, 2 ̆ 2 said Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Particularly when citizens have been subjected to trial by tabloid, careful and measured release of some of the investigative information which is helpful to the individual is in the public interest. 2 ̆ 2 The Monday interviews in Atlanta will be the first major sit-down by the Ramseys with the Boulder police in two years. It has been reported that a substantial delegation of authorities will arrive in Atlanta and that the Boulder police chief apparently has new questions and information - prospects Carlson views as encouraging. 2 ̆ 2 The interview potentially promises to be a pivotal step, 2 ̆ 2 he said. Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in evidence, trial practice and criminal procedure, has litigated many cases and has argued twice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials. For further comment, contact Prof. Carlson at his office, (706) 542 - 5186 or at home, (706) 548 - 6771. #...|$|E
