Uniaxial compression generates important shear effects in this kind of sample. We have determined the evolution of the system fractal dimension, pore size distribu- tion and apparent specific surface area with applied pressure which together allow us to describe the meso and macro pore structure evolution. Under pressure, the irreversible col- lapse and splitting of larger pores into smaller size ones which is characteristic of out-of- plane uniaxial compression [1], is accompanied, in the presence of shear stress compo- nents, by an in-plane slipping mechanism giving rise to cracks and consequently to inter- face formation...|$|E
