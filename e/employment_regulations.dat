25|$|In most {{corporate}} insolvencies, it {{is likely}} {{that a large number of}} people's jobs rely on continued business. Accordingly, UK labour law touches corporate insolvencies in three main ways. First, employment contracts cannot be changed except when there are good economic, technical or organisational reasons under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of <b>Employment)</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2006. This matters particularly in the case of a sale of a business' assets. Second, special provisions concern the adoption of employees' contracts by an administrator or other insolvency practitioner, but apparently with various limits on the obligations that survive. Third, employees and their pensions have preferential claims above other creditors' rights, and if this is exhausted may claim money from the National Insurance Fund or the Pension Protection Fund.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as having}} rights for fair treatment, the Equality Act 2010 {{requires}} {{that people are}} treated equally, {{unless there is a}} good justification, based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, beliefs and age. To combat social exclusion, employers must positively accommodate the needs of disabled people. Part-time staff, agency workers, and people on fixed-term contracts are treated generally equally compared to full-time or permanent staff. To tackle unemployment, all employees are entitled to reasonable notice before dismissal after a qualifying period of a month, after two years they can only be dismissed for a fair reason, and are entitled to a redundancy payment if their job was no longer economically necessary. If an enterprise is bought or outsourced, the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of <b>Employment)</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2006 require that employees' terms cannot be worsened without a good economic, technical or organisational reason. The purpose of these rights is to ensure people have dignified living standards, whether or not they have the relative bargaining power to get good terms and conditions in their contract.|$|E

According to INSEAD's Global Innovation Index, Iceland is the 11th most {{innovative}} country in the world. Unlike most Western European countries, Iceland has a flat tax system: the main personal income tax rate is a flat 22.75%, and combined with municipal taxes, the total tax rate equals no more than 35.7%, not including the many deductions that are available. The corporate tax rate is a flat 18%, {{one of the lowest}} in the world. There is also a value added tax, whereas a net wealth tax was eliminated in 2006. <b>Employment</b> <b>regulations</b> are relatively flexible and the labour market is one of the freest in the world.

25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable notice, dismissal only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of <b>Employment)</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|E

40|$|The North American {{model of}} {{workplace}} law is broken, characterized by declining frequency of collective bargaining, {{high levels of}} non-compliance with <b>employment</b> <b>regulation,</b> and political deadlock. This paper explores whether the theory of “decentred regulation” offers useful insights into the challenge of improving compliance with employment standards laws. It argues that the dominant political perspective on workplace regulation today is managerialist. Politicians with a managerialist orientation reject both the pluralist idea that collective bargaining is always preferred and the neoclassical view that it never is. Managerialists accept a role for <b>employment</b> <b>regulation</b> and unions, particularly in dealing with recalcitrant employers who mistreat their employees. The fact that managerialists and pluralists agree on this latter point creates a space for potential movement on workplace law reform. A law that encourages “high road” employment practices, while fast-tracking access to collective bargaining for “low road” employers could encourage greater compliance with <b>employment</b> <b>regulation,</b> while also facilitating collective bargaining at high-risk workplaces. This article examines lessons from scholarship on decentred regulation {{for the design of}} a legal model capable of achieving these results. In particular, it develops and assesses a dual regulatory stream model that restricts existing rights of employers to resist their employees’ efforts to unionize once they have been found in violation of targeted <b>employment</b> <b>regulation...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Another {{context in}} which the common law left workers {{particularly}} vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another. In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a personal right, and akin to a property right in their jobs. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted, the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the [...] "Acquired Rights Directive"), required that a business transferee would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers' contracts. This means that the new employer who is a transferee of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company's shares: contractual variations require the employees' consent and dismissal rights remain {{as if it were the}} old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of <b>Employment)</b> <b>Regulations</b> 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in Litster v Forth Dry Dock. The House of Lords held that a purposive interpretation is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would still be there in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law's normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance. The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the transferee employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clause or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.|$|E

30|$|There are 17 {{countries}} in our data where the minimum age of employment {{is the same}} as the age at which schooling is no longer compulsory. In four of these countries we observe increases in paid employment at the minimum age but also observe increases in household based employment (inconsistent with binding minimum age of <b>employment</b> <b>regulation).</b> It is possible that these findings are driven by a combination of minimum age of <b>employment</b> <b>regulation</b> and compulsory schooling laws (although the change in schooling is not significant in any of the four). In fact, we find that the changes in paid employment are 9 times larger in magnitude in the pooled data in the selected group of countries where minimum age of employment and compulsory schooling regulations coincide compared to countries where schooling is not compulsory at the minimum age of employment. Hence, while overall, we find little to suggest a role for minimum age of <b>employment</b> <b>regulation,</b> as enforced, in combating child labor, there may be some benefit to coordinating <b>employment</b> and schooling <b>regulation.</b> That said, given the importance of household-level, child-invariant characteristics in child labor, it is not obvious that age-based regulation, as currently implemented and enforced, merits its current place at the center of anti-child labor policy.|$|R
