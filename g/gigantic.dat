5|$|The Russian Imperial Conspiracy, 1892-1914: The Most <b>Gigantic</b> Intrigue of all Time. First edition, 1926, privately printed. Second edition, 1927, {{published}} by Albert and Charles Boni, New York.|$|E
5|$|Clotho– The final Sister {{who was the}} <b>gigantic</b> and {{grotesque}} {{keeper of}} the loom from which the threads of all life are spun. The character was voiced by Susan Silo in God of War II, and Marina Gordon in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to <b>gigantic</b> storms that cover the entire planet. They tend to occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} {{increase}} the global temperature.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes feature {{prominently}} in the folklore and mythology of human cultures {{with which they are}} sympatric. In Greek mythology, the Teumessian fox or Cadmean vixen, was a <b>gigantic</b> fox that was destined never to be caught. The fox was one of the children of Echidna.|$|E
5|$|Symbolically, the sea {{has long}} been {{perceived}} as a hostile and dangerous environment populated by fantastic creatures: the <b>gigantic</b> Leviathan of the Bible, the shark-like Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the ship-swallowing Kraken of late Norse mythology.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the {{pictograms}} {{was inspired by the}} museum’s architecture, and particularly by the abstract shapes created by the rain of light filtering through the <b>gigantic</b> dome's mashrabiyas. Each pictogram is a combination of several of these shapes, creating silhouettes and objects.|$|E
5|$|According to Renaissance accounts, <b>gigantic,</b> {{triangular}} fossil teeth {{often found}} embedded in rocky formations were once {{believed to be}} the petrified tongues, or glossopetrae, of dragons and snakes. This interpretation was corrected in 1667 by Danish naturalist Nicolas Steno, who recognized them as shark teeth, and famously produced a depiction of a shark's head bearing such teeth. He described his findings in the book The Head of a Shark Dissected, which also contained an illustration of a megalodon tooth.|$|E
5|$|After {{repelling}} a Covenant counterattack on the Forerunner facility, the Spirit of Fire {{travels to}} Arcadia, where the Covenant has begun raiding local cities and slaughtering civilians. Forge contacts the local Spartan special forces and assists with the evacuation process. The Covenant builds a giant energy shield {{to hide the}} construction of a <b>gigantic</b> Scarab super-weapon, but the UNSC forces use experimental equipment to break through. The Scarab is destroyed, but the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and escapes the planet.|$|E
5|$|Group G {{lies just}} south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and {{consists}} of palace-type structures {{and is one of the}} largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a <b>gigantic</b> mask.|$|E
5|$|His 1815 Polish {{translation}} of Homer's Iliad {{met with a}} negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume Works (Dzieła). Volumes 7–9 comprised his Humankind: A Didactic Poem (Ród Ludzki. Poema Dydaktyczne), a <b>gigantic</b> philosophical essay and poem that is regarded as {{an important contribution to}} the history of Polish philosophy. However, the work ran afoul of the new censorship law and was not distributed, much of the edition eventually being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|His notable {{compositions}} {{include the}} series of nineteen Klavierstücke (Piano Pieces), Kontra-Punkte for ten instruments, the electronic/musique-concrète Gesang der Jünglinge, Gruppen for three orchestras, the percussion solo Zyklus, Kontakte, the cantata Momente, the live-electronic Mikrophonie I, Hymnen, Stimmung for six vocalists, Aus den sieben Tagen, Mantra for two pianos and electronics, Tierkreis, Inori for soloists and orchestra, and the <b>gigantic</b> opera cycle Licht.|$|E
5|$|In December 1961, Disney Studios {{released}} Babes in Toyland, a {{film version}} of Victor Herbert's 1903 operetta starring teen heartthrobs Annette Funicello and Tommy Sands. Though new songs with jazzy tempi were incorporated into the film and one critic was delighted with the film's colorful numbers, Babes in Toyland was neither a success nor a complete box office flop. Its <b>gigantic</b> toy soldiers became members of the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Christmas Parades.|$|E
5|$|In Giants: Citizen Kabuto, players take on {{the roles}} of three {{humanoid}} races: gun-toting Meccaryns, magic-wielding Sea Reapers, and the <b>gigantic</b> Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, Planet Moon Studios, created this design to encourage players {{to focus on the}} action and not to be burdened with micromanagement. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.|$|E
5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a <b>gigantic</b> bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|Katy Perry {{chose to}} release her own {{signature}} fragrance, Purr, {{to add a}} personal touch and compete with other celebrities' perfumes; she cited Beyoncé and Kim Kardashian as examples. Having teamed up with <b>Gigantic</b> Parfums, she was {{actively involved in the}} development of her fragrance. She mentioned in an interview that she created the product because she loves cats.|$|E
5|$|Many {{obstacles}} were in {{the course}} rotation, often based on body parts, food, and enlarged items found in daily life. Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum Drop, a <b>gigantic</b> gumball machine replica filled with plastic balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologist Peter Mackovicky {{commented on}} the Manning team's study, stating that small, {{primitive}} dromaeosaurids (such as Microraptor) were {{likely to have been}} tree-climbers, but that climbing did not explain why later, <b>gigantic</b> dromaeosaurids such as Achillobator retained highly curved claws when they were too large to have climbed trees. Mackovicky speculated that giant dromaeosaurids may have adapted the claw to be used exclusively for latching on to prey.|$|E
5|$|Small {{ships are}} {{built in a}} ship yard while the larger ships require a space dock for construction. Ships range from the small Scoutship (used to {{discover}} new asteroids), to the <b>gigantic</b> Command Cruiser (which is used for transporting combat fleets over vast distances that they would otherwise be unable to travel without refueling).|$|E
5|$|The Grand Palace has twelve gates (ประตู, Pratu, {{literally}} a door), three along {{each of the}} four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a Prang style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with <b>gigantic</b> red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of an ala is diversely and often vaguely described in folklore. A given ala {{may look like}} a black wind, a <b>gigantic</b> creature of indistinct form, a huge-mouthed, humanlike, or snakelike monster, a female dragon, or a raven. An ala may also assume various human or animal shapes, and can even possess a person's body. It is believed that the diversity of appearances described is due to the ala's being a synthesis of a Slavic demon of bad weather and a similar demon of the central Balkans pre-Slavic population. In folk tales with a humanlike ala, her personality {{is similar to that of}} the Russian Baba Yaga. Ale are said to live in the clouds, or in a lake, spring, hidden remote place, forest, inhospitable mountain, cave, or <b>gigantic</b> tree. While ale are usually hostile towards humans, they do have other powerful enemies that can defeat them, like dragons. In Christianized tales, St. Elijah takes the dragons' role, but in some cases the saint and the dragons fight ale together. Eagles are also regarded as defenders against ale, chasing them away from fields and thus preventing them from bringing hail clouds overhead.|$|E
5|$|The stoor worm, or Mester Stoor Worm, was a <b>gigantic</b> evil sea serpent of Orcadian folklore, {{capable of}} contaminating plants and {{destroying}} {{animals and humans}} with its putrid breath. It is probably an Orkney variant of the Norse Jörmungandr, {{also known as the}} Midgard Serpent, or world serpent, and {{has been described as a}} sea dragon.|$|E
5|$|There is no perspectival {{order in}} the foreground; instead it {{comprises}} {{a series of small}} motifs wherein proportion and terrestrial logic are abandoned. Bosch presents the viewer with <b>gigantic</b> ducks playing with tiny humans under the cover of oversized fruit; fish walking on land while birds dwell in the water; a passionate couple encased in an amniotic fluid bubble; and a man inside of a red fruit staring at a mouse in a transparent cylinder.|$|E
5|$|This genus {{of dinosaurs}} lived {{in what is}} now mid-western North America {{at the end of the}} Jurassic period. Diplodocus is one of the more common dinosaur fossils found in the middle to upper Morrison Formation, between about 154 and 152 million years ago, during the late Kimmeridgian age. The Morrison Formation records an {{environment}} and time dominated by <b>gigantic</b> sauropod dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Camarasaurus.|$|E
5|$|We want a {{national}} literature commensurate with our mountains and rivers... We want {{a national}} epic that shall {{correspond to the}} size of the country... We want a national drama in which scope shall be given to our <b>gigantic</b> ideas and to the unparalleled activity of our people... In a word, we want a national literature altogether shaggy and unshorn, that shall shake the earth, like a herd of buffaloes thundering over the prairies.|$|E
5|$|With David Arquette, Johansson {{appeared}} in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002), which {{tells the story of}} a collection of spiders that are exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow to <b>gigantic</b> proportions and begin killing and harvesting. After graduating from PCS that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but decided to focus on her film career when she was rejected.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} {{advertisement for}} Late Registration was directed and animated by Maggie Rogers, Abby Johnson and Paul Tuersley of Mr & Mrs Smith Design Ltd. It featured a <b>gigantic</b> version of West's teddy bear mascot Dropout Bear roaming {{through the streets}} of London. The advert received an award from British music magazine Music Week for Best Music TV Commercial. On the day of the album's release, West made an in-store appearance at New York's Lincoln Center Tower Records to autograph copies for fans. That same day, Late Registration was released in its entirety for online streaming on AOL Music.|$|E
5|$|Although the Philippines lacks large {{mammalian}} predators, it {{does have}} some very large reptiles such as pythons and cobras, together with <b>gigantic</b> saltwater crocodiles. The largest crocodile in captivity, known locally as Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb). The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a <b>gigantic</b> scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1405, the Yongle Emperor {{entrusted}} his favored eunuch commander Zheng He (1371–1433) as {{the admiral}} for a <b>gigantic</b> new fleet of ships designated for international tributary missions. The Chinese had sent diplomatic missions over land since the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE) {{and engaged in}} private overseas trade, but these missions were unprecedented in grandeur and scale. To service seven different tributary voyages, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, including treasure ships measuring 112m (370ft) to 134m (440ft) in length and 45m (150ft) to 54m (180ft) in width.|$|E
5|$|Charles Lyell eagerly met Darwin for {{the first}} time on 29 October and soon {{introduced}} him to the up-and-coming anatomist Richard Owen, who had the facilities of the Royal College of Surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by Darwin. Owen's surprising results included other <b>gigantic</b> extinct ground sloths as well as the Megatherium, a near complete skeleton of the unknown Scelidotherium and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named Toxodon resembling a giant capybara. The armour fragments were actually from Glyptodon, a huge armadillo-like creature as Darwin had initially thought. These extinct creatures were related to living species in South America.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of <b>gigantic</b> fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed and provided the basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Data and Picard {{discover}} a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a <b>gigantic</b> holodeck {{set up to}} recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the Enterprise to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the Prime Directive. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.|$|E
5|$|Elliot and Carla {{worry about}} the {{difficult}} conversations {{they have to have}} with J.D. and Turk, respectively ("Options"). In the Act One finale ("When the Truth Comes Out"), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a <b>gigantic</b> aneurysm in her temporal lobe. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling a curtain for privacy that also signals the end of the act.|$|E
5|$|Extant {{documentation}} {{makes it}} possible to follow the competition more clearly than {{in the case of the}} shrine dei Miracoli, and the delivered works, their dates and respective payments lend themselves to interesting analyses. By Tamagnino's arrival in 1499, Cairano already had delivered at least five different Caesars and other stone material, but only a payment for a single bust is documented, because his attention was completely taken up with two <b>gigantic</b> angular trophies that he had recently begun. In November 1499, Tamagnino delivered four Caesars and three leonine busts, which showcased his calibre and scale of production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gigantic</b> and {{visually}} impressive, the Megalosaurus {{became one of}} the park's three 'mascot dinosaurs' along with the Iguanodon and (less so) the Ichthyosaurs. Working from fragmentary evidence from Jurassic fossils found in England, consisting mainly of a hip and femur (thigh bone), with a rib and a few vertebrae, Owen conjectured the animal was quadrupedal; palaeontologists now believe it to have been bipedal (standing like Tyrannosaurus rex). The first suggestion that some dinosaurs might have been bipedal came in 1858, just too late to influence the model.|$|E
