40|$|As {{a result}} of {{interaction}} with the surrounding environment, shipping {{has become one of}} the vectors of bio-invasion across the globe. Ballast water is one of the means of bio-invasion from shipping through which microorganisms break through natural barriers and establish in a new location. Shipboard treatment systems are predominately considered as mitigating measures for bio-invasion via a ballast water system. Currently shipboard performance monitoring <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> water treatment systems, and thus assessment <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> water as required by the Convention, depends on off-line laboratory assays with long delay analysis. Lack of online measurement sensors to assess the viability of microorganisms after treatment has made monitoring and thus control <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> water treatment systems difficult. In this study, a methodology was developed, through a mathematical algorithm, to provide an inferential model-based measurement system in order to monitor and thus control non-observable ballast water systems. In the developed inferential measurement the primary output of the treatment system is inferred by using easy to measure secondary output variables and a model relating these two outputs. Data-driven modeling techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were used to develop an estimator for the small scale UV treatment system based on the data obtained from conducted experiments. The results from ANN showed more accuracy in term of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Linear Correlation Coefficient (LCC) when compared to the other techniques. The same methodology was implemented to a larger scale treatment system comprising micro-filter and UV reactor. A software-based inferential measurement for online monitoring of the treatment system was then developed. Following monitoring, inferential control of the treatment setup was also accomplished using direct inverse control strategy. A software-based “Decision Making Tool” consisted of two intelligent inverse models, which were used to control treatment flow rate and maintain the effective average UV dose.

The GSI is capable of performing testing fully consistent {{with the requirements of}} the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) International Convention for the Control and Management <b>of</b> Ships <b>Ballast</b> Water and Sediments (IMO, 2004) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA’s) Environmental Technology Verification Program (ETV; NSF International, 2010). GSI procedures, methods, materials and findings are also publicly accessible on the GSI website (www. greatshipsinitiative. org). In July 2010, GSI conducted a land-based performance evaluation test of a proposed BWTS developed by researchers from the U. S. Geological Survey’s Leetown Science Center in Kearneysville, West Virginia. The proposed system involved application of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, in the same formulation used for lye or caustic soda) to ballast water to raise pH, followed by application of carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a neutralization step prior to <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ballast</b> water to the receiving system. The purpose of the land-based test of this system, consisting of four trials, was status testing for research and development. As such, the testing was based on, though not strictly consistent with, the IMO’s G 8 Guidelines for Approval <b>of</b> <b>Ballast</b> Water Management Systems (IMO, 2008 a), the IMO’s G 9 Guidelines for Approval <b>of</b> <b>Ballast</b> Water Management Systems that make use of Active Substances (IMO, 2008 b), and the USEPA’s ETV Program Generic Protocol for the Verification <b>of</b> <b>Ballast</b> Water Treatment Technology, v. 5. 1 (NSF International, 2010). During the test, the NaOH BWTS was evaluated for its ability to: (a) successfully treat ballast water without interruption, (b) successfully neutralize treated ballast water to achieve Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WIDNR) permitting levels for harbor discharge (i. e., pH 6 - 9), (c) meet discharge target values for water chemistry/quality and biology that are approximately consistent with the IMO Convention’s Annex D- 2 discharge standards, and (d) discharge water after two- or three-day retention periods that is environmentally benign (i. e., no residual toxicity) pursuant to USEPA water quality criteria. The NaOH BWTS performed very well operationally and well enough biologically to warrant additional testing at the bench, land and ship-based scales. The system successfully treated ballast water without interruption, and successfully neutralized treated ballast water to achieve WIDNR permitting levels for harbor discharge (i. e., pH 6 - 9). The BWTS also significantly reduced live organism densities in treated discharge relative to control discharge in all size classes of organisms. Finally, in these tests, the BWTS performance met discharge target values that were approximately consistent with the IMO Convention’s Annex D- 2 discharge standards, though precision in this estimate was not possible given the research and development testing parameters. The only possible problem that this testing revealed was that the water discharged after two- or three-day retention periods was not entirely environmentally benign (i. e., with no residual toxicity at the 100 % effluent dilution), though the level of residual toxicity in 100 % effluent evident from these tests may not be of regulatory concern...|$|R

Although, the amount of oil released into the ocean by the offshore platforms using this procedure on one-time basis is derisory, if compared with the massive spill event in case of platform accidents like the Montara and Deepwater Horizon, the long term damages on the flora and fauna are severe. As the North Sea is characterized by fairly shallow water bathymetry, it has been extensively exploited in the past years for oil extraction and production. By now, it hosts a significant number of offshore installations and therefore the probability of minor leaks is quite high. A large number of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are being acquired and processed operationally over North Sea platform installations for potential oil pollution using the TerraSAR-X satellite [1]. The ScanSAR and WideScanSAR mode in VV polarization imagery have been preferred due to large coverage and higher oil-water contrast. Among the dataset collected, a constant leakage from the platforms belonging to the Forties oil field has been observed. Thanks the low TerraSAR-X orbit altitude and relatively high latitude location of the Forties oil field, leaks from the same platforms have been observed with temporal interval of less than 13 h. While most previous studies on tracking oil spills assume that the observed slicks by consecutively acquired SAR images are the same and spatial displaced by the drift effect [2], a completely different situation is outlined by the analysis in [3]. By model simulation it is shown that leaks were not start-stop but continuous with only part of the old oil being drifted...|$|R
40|$|Vessels {{carrying}} {{passengers and}} cargoes {{all around the}} world facilitate also the transfer of harmful and pathogen organisms, especially via <b>ballast</b> water. <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> these in a new environment may result in a change of biodiversity, alteration of ecosystems, negative impacts on human health and economic loss, in some cases with irreversible consequences. One of the critical issues is a need to understand and evaluate the dimension and process of species introductions. In the efforts to prevent the transfer of invasive aquatic species, risk assessment plays a crucial role. This actually enables management process to identify appropriate management measures. The quantity <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> water <b>discharged</b> is one <b>of</b> the basic elements of such evaluation. During the national research projects ¿Harmful Introductions and Ballast Water Management in the Slovenian Sea¿ and ¿Decision Model and Control <b>of</b> <b>Ballast</b> Water Management in the Slovenian Sea¿, conducted by the Faculty of Maritime Studies and Transport (University of Ljubljana) from July 2004 were conducted between July 2001 and June 2007, a new Ballast Water Discharge Assessment Model (BWDAM) was developed. The BWDAM is based on foreseen cargo operation, type of cargo, and vessel type and dimensions. The model was tested on vessel traffic data for the Port of Koper, and various vessels were boarded. Results show high confidence for an overall estimation <b>of</b> <b>ballast</b> water <b>discharges</b> in a port. This paper presents the BWDAM and application results for the Port of KoperJRC.
