[...] While he viewed the track overall as [...] "a beautiful, compelling song", and the first three minutes as [...] "absolutely sensational", Johnson rued the long coda's [...] "vocal improvisations on the basically repetitive four-bar chorus". Time magazine described the coda as [...] "a <b>fadeout</b> that engagingly spoofs the <b>fadeout</b> as a gimmick for ending pop records". The same reviewer contrasted [...] "Hey Jude" [...] with its B-side, [...] "Revolution", saying that [...] "The {{other side of the}} new disk urges activism of a different sort", due to McCartney [...] "liltingly exhort a friend to overcome his fears and commit himself in love". Rolling Stone also attributed the song's meaning as a message from McCartney to Lennon to end his negative relationships with women: [...] "to break the old pattern; to really go through with love".

40|$|Although {{vaccination}} {{has almost}} eliminated measles {{in parts of}} the world, the disease remains a major killer in some high birth rate countries of the Sahel. On the basis of measles dynamics for industrialized countries, high birth rate regions should experience regular annual epidemics.

Models demonstrate that this variability arises from powerful seasonality in transmission-generating high amplitude epidemics-within the chaotic domain of deterministic dynamics. In practice, this leads to frequent stochastic <b>fadeouts,</b> interspersed with irregular, large epidemics. A metapopulation model illustrates how increased vaccine coverage, but still below the local elimination threshold, could lead to increasingly variable major outbreaks in highly seasonally forced contexts. Such erratic dynamics emphasize the importance both of control strategies that address build-up of susceptible individuals and efforts to mitigate the impact of large outbreaks when they occur...|$|R
30|$|The first {{recorded}} {{observation of the}} white light solar flare and simultaneous disturbances in geomagnetic field (crochet) were independently reported by Carrington (1859) and Hodgson (1859).

McNish (1937) examined the effects of above mentioned three events in 1936 on the magnetic recordings at 18 stations in Western Europe, America and southern Pacific areas. He concluded that the solar flare effect (SFE) is an augmentation of the normal daily variation over the sunlit hemisphere both in direction and magnitude supposedly due to increased atmospheric ionization by ultra violet light from the solar eruption. Richmond and Venkateswaran (1971) suggested that crochets are composite of a fast component presumably produced by solar UV radiation (100 - 1000 Å and a slow component produced by soft X rays (1 – 100 Å).|$|R

30|$|In this paper, sudden ionospheric {{disturbances}} (SIDs) {{owing to}} rapid enhancement of solar EUV and X-ray fluxes during solar flares are investigated. The paper {{is based on}} experimental measurements of EUV and X-ray flux by satellites and on monitoring of SIDs by continuous Doppler sounding, together with measurements by ionosondes and riometer. It partly builds on previous works, mainly on those by Mitra (1974) and Liu et al. (1996). Contrary to previous studies, the data are presented with much better time resolution (several seconds) and sudden frequency deviations observed by continuous Doppler sounding are investigated together with signal absorption. The signal absorption occurs {{as a consequence of}} collisions between neutral particles and electrons owing to enhanced electron density in the lower ionosphere, especially in the D layer. The flare-enhanced ionization in the D layer can also be observed as cosmic noise absorption at frequencies of several tens of MHz measured by riometers, as amplitude and phase changes of signals from VLF transmitters propagating in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide or as sudden wave <b>fadeouts</b> (SWFs) at frequencies of units of MHz (Laštovička 2009; Silber and Price 2016). Atmospherics (low frequency electromagnetic signals generated by lightning) have also been used to probe the response of D layer to solar flares (Han and Cummer 2010). Han and Cummer (2010) found that the reflection height of atmospherics decreased by about 6  km if the X-ray flux measured in the spectral range 0.1 – 0.8  nm increased ten times. Their results are in agreement with previous studies based on narrow band measurements of signals from VLF transmitters (McRae and Thomson 2004). We will use this estimate of the decrease in electron density profile in D layer in our study. Solar flares can also cause decrease in echo power or short-wave <b>fadeouts</b> of SuperDARN HF radar signals (Watanabe and Nishitani 2013; Chakraborty et al. 2018; Fiori et al. 2018). The paper is organized as follows: Second section describes measurements and discusses data analysis. Third section analyzes the observations in the Czech Republic, Taiwan and Argentina. Fourth section discusses the obtained results. The last section provides a brief summary.|$|R
40|$|Throughout the African {{meningitis}} belt, {{meningococcal meningitis}} outbreaks occur {{only during the}} dry season. Measles in Niger exhibits similar seasonality, where increased population density {{during the dry season}} probably escalates measles transmission. Because meningococcal meningitis and measles are both directly transmitted, we propose that host aggregation also impacts the transmission of meningococcal meningitis. Although climate affects broad meningococcal meningitis seasonality, we focus on the less examined role of human density at a finer spatial scale. By analysing spatial patterns of suspected cases of meningococcal meningitis, we show fewer absences of suspected cases in districts along primary roads, similar to measles <b>fadeouts</b> in the same Nigerien metapopulation. We further show that, following periods during no suspected cases, districts with high reappearance rates of meningococcal meningitis also have high measles reintroduction rates. Despite many biological and epidemiological differences, similar seasonal and spatial patterns emerge from the dynamics of both diseases. This analysis enhances our understanding of spatial patterns and disease transmission and suggests hotspots for infection and potential target areas for meningococcal meningitis surveillance and interventio...|$|R

30|$|The {{attenuation}} of Doppler {{signal was}} investigated {{in the present study}} and compared with theoretical expectations. Most of the attenuation occurs in the lower ionosphere in the D and lower E region. The attenuation of Doppler signal was also compared with the attenuations measured by the nearby riometer in Tucumán. To the best of our knowledge, it was {{for the first time that}} attenuations measured by riometer and CDSS were compared. It should be noted that short-wave <b>fadeouts</b> of SuperDARN HF radar signals and their correlation with riometer measurements were recently discussed by Fiori et al. (2018). Systematic investigation and comparison of attenuations measured by different instruments operating at different frequencies during solar flares might potentially provide interesting information about the dynamics of electron densities at the heights of D and lower E layer. Differences in measurements at various frequencies may result from different electron density changes at different heights in the lower ionosphere and thus reduce the uncertainties in the D layer profile and its evolution during solar flares. As the riometer was installed in Tucumán in 2016 at the decreasing phase of the current solar cycle (SC 24), it is expected that such a database will be obtained in the next solar cycle. In addition, construction of a riometer at the location of CDSS in the Czech Republic is underway. An update of CDSS is also considered to measure the received power in ordinary (L-O) and extraordinary (R-X) mode separately, which will enable a more exact calculation of the expected attenuation for the modeled profiles of electron densities and comparison with experiment.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Emerging {{infectious}} diseases are increasing globally {{and are a}} threat to human, wildlife, and ecosystem health. The emerging fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), or amphibian chytrid fungus, is associated with worldwide amphibian population declines and extinctions. Bd has been found on every continent where amphibians exist and has been documented to infect hundreds of species. As with other multi-host pathogens, the outcome of infection with Bd appears to vary among individuals, species, and populations. Variation in host responses to infection can lead {{to changes in the}} structure and composition of amphibian assemblages and can affect disease dynamics including pathogen persistence or <b>fadeouts</b> in ecological communities. Understanding the feedback between hosts and pathogens requires disentangling the influence of multiple interacting biotic and abiotic factors, yet fundamentally depends on characterizing intrinsic host responses to infection. This thesis broadly examines variation in species-specific susceptibility to the chytrid fungus among amphibians. I have characterized patterns of mortality, quantitative infection load, feeding behavior, and pathogen avoidance behavior of twenty different amphibian species exposed to the fungus or control conditions (Chapter 2). We found a high degree of variation in pathogen-induced responses to chytrid fungus, ranging from zero mortality to 100 % mortality after only six days of pathogen exposure. Variation in infection load was also significant at the species level and there was not always a direct relationship between infection load and mortality. Behavior of pathogen exposed animals was significantly different from that of control animals, and reduced feeding behavior of pathogen-exposed animals is likely {{to be related to the}} decline in health of pathogen-exposed animals. In Chapter 3, I examined a special case of amphibian susceptibility to chytrid fungus in the American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus). Bullfrogs are widely reported to be a tolerant host and a carrier of Bd that spreads the pathogen to less tolerant hosts. However, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested using an experimental approach. In Chapter 3, co-authors and I tested whether bullfrogs raised from eggs to metamorphosis in outdoor mesocosms were susceptible to two different strains of Bd (one strain isolated from a "non susceptible" species, the American bullfrog; the second strain isolated from a highly susceptible species, the Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas)). Bullfrogs were susceptible to strain JEL 274, and this is the first documented case of susceptibility to chytrid fungus in this species. Bullfrogs were not susceptible to strain JEL 630, indicating variation in virulence among chytrid fungus strains and important context dependency when considering the effect of infection non individuals, species, and populations of amphibians. In Chapter 4, I examined fine- scale variation in responses of three key amphibian hosts, and examine the evidence for tolerance (the ability to maintain health as infection severity increases) or resistance (the ability to reduce pathogen infection load) of larval and post-metamorphic animals to Bd. I saw pronounced variation in responses to chytrid fungus among species, between life history stages, over time, and found that responses to the fungal inoculate were not dose dependent in two out of the three species examined. In the final data chapter, Chapter 5, I investigated immunological responses that underlie variation in species-specific responses to Bd. I looked at temporal patterns of functional immune responses during a time-course of early and later stage exposure to Bd, spanning 24 hours after experimental inoculation to 15 days post-inoculation. I uncovered patterns in immune responses that were distinctly associated with susceptibility and temporal patterns in infection load associated with susceptibility and immune response. This thesis provides critical information about variation in host responses to a conservation relevant pathogen. Differences in how host hosts acquire, transmit, and persist with infection have important implications for spatiotemporal disease dynamics. Further, understanding host sensitivity to infection allows for predictive risk management of imperiled species...|$|R
