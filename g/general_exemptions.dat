40|$|General and {{individual}} exemptions {{in the provision}} of state aid under European law This diploma thesis refers to the European regulation of the provision of state aid by member states. Because of the fact that under certain circumstances state aid can affect the economic competition among concurrents both within a member state and within the internal market of the EU and thus have a significant bad influence on it, art. 107 subsection 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states a general interdiction of providing state aid by the memeber states. It defines state aid as financial aid in any form (direct grant, soft loan, tax allowance, interest subsidy etc.), payed out of financial ressources belonging to the state ("state" defined in a large sense as both the central state sphere and local government sphere), which give preferential treatment to certain companies or certain production sectors and thereby affects or may affect competition, and lastly which have an influence on business between the member states (have an effect on the internal market). Of course there have to be exemptions from this general interdiction. The exemptions are regulated in art. 107 subsection 2 TFEU (<b>general</b> <b>exemptions)</b> and 3 TFEU (individual exemptions).

40|$|Congress {{enacted the}} Wilderness Act in 1964. This Act created the National Wilderness Preservation System, {{reserved}} to Congress {{the authority to}} designate wilderness areas, and directed the Secretaries of Agriculture and of the Interior to review certain lands for their wilderness potential. The Act also designated 54 wilderness areas with 9 million acres of federal land. Congress began expanding the Wilderness System in 1968, and today, there are 708 wilderness areas, totaling more than 107 million acres, in 44 states. Numerous bills to designate additional areas and to expand existing ones are introduced and considered in every Congress. The Wilderness Act defined wilderness as an area of generally undisturbed federal land, but did not establish criteria or standards to determine whether an area should be designated, because of differing perceptions of wilderness {{and because of the}} varying purposes of wilderness. In general, wilderness areas are undeveloped, and commercial activities, motorized access, and roads, structures, and facilities are generally prohibited in wilderness areas. However, in response to conflicting demands, Congress has granted both <b>general</b> <b>exemptions</b> and specific exceptions to the general standards and prohibitions. The federal government owns about 29 % of the land in the United States, although the proportion in each state varies widely. Four federal agencies — the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the Interior and the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture — manage most of the federal lands. These agencies manage the 107 million acres of designated wilderness, as well as many other lands. They are also protecting lands as possible additions to the Wilderness System, and are reviewing the wilderness potential of additional lands. In total, more than 17 % of all federal land, and nearly 5 % of all land in the United States, has been designated as wilderness. Alaska, because of its size and relatively pristine condition, dominates wilderness statistics — more than 53 % of designated wilderness is in Alaska. In total, nearly 16 % of all land (federal, state, private, and other) in Alaska has been designated as wilderness. In contrast, 3 % of all land in the United States outside Alaska has been designated as wilderness...|$|E
40|$|ARMED AND DANGEROUS. ” Imagine {{those words}} {{flashing}} on a Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) agent’s computer screen as you attempt to reenter your {{country of birth}} from a relaxing vacation. Reacting to the computerized warning, the CBP agents detain and question you for several hours before you are released from custody—without an explanation—and allowed to continue on your trip home {{as if nothing had}} happened. This hypothetical scenario became very real for Julia Shearson and her four-year old daughter in January 2006, and marked the beginning of her quest for answers. Why was she flagged as “ARMED AND DANGEROUS?” What actions had she taken that led the government to classify her in this way? Could she obtain documents held by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and CBP that might indicate why she was detained? What recourse does she have to clear her name? In addition to Shearson’s concern about being misclassified, her situation also raises several national policy questions. What effect would mandatory disclosure requirements of an agency’s inner operations have on its ability to protect the United States from threats to national security? Under what circumstances should a federal agency that possesses sensitive information relating to national security be allowed to exempt itself from the disclosure requirements? These questions highlight the broader issue of establishing equilibrium between personal privacy and national security in the twenty-first century. The notion that people needed to sacrifice some individual freedoms in return for the protection provided by organized society was developed early on in political philosophy. But striking the appropriate societal balance between personal liberties and security has proven to be extremely difficult, and supporters for each have even taken to social media sites to advocate for their position. Congress attempted to weigh these two competing considerations in its passage of the Privacy Act of 1974 (“Privacy Act”), which regulated the type of information a federal agency could maintain on an individual, but provided agencies with exemptions from the disclosure requirements for law enforcement activities. The United States has changed dramatically since the Privacy Act’s passage though, and several authors have noted that society now tends to give security more weight than personal liberties, especially after the events of September 11, 2001. This Article argues that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals improperly held that Shearson may compel DHS and CBP—a law enforcement branch of the DHS—to disclose documents relating to her detainment under the Privacy Act, and asserts that congressional action is required. Part II provides a general overview of the Privacy Act and the factual background of Shearson’s case. Part III surveys other circuit court cases that have wrestled with interpreting the extent of the permissible exemptions under the Privacy Act’s <b>general</b> <b>exemptions</b> provision. Part IV of this Article details both parties’ positions and summarizes why Shearson’s argument persuaded the Sixth Circuit. Part V critically analyzes the Sixth Circuit’s reasoning and suggests that the court’s holding was improper in light of the Privacy Act’s plain language and the likely effects of its decision on national security. Part VI explores the potential implications of the Sixth Circuit’s ruling on the future of personal privacy and the national security of the United States...|$|E

40|$|The Government is {{committed}} to the efficient and effective regulation of the energy sector. As part of this commitment, the Government is conducting a review of the <b>General</b> <b>Exemption</b> Order (GEO) in the interests of energy consumers. The GEO provides for exemptions from the requirement to hold an electricity licence for certain activities. The GEO has not been substantially updated since 2002 and numerous changes have occurred in the energy market since this time. The GEO review examines protections for consumers in 2 ̆ 7 embedded networks 2 ̆ 7, typically found in apartment buildings, caravan parks and retirement villages.   The review explores matters such as customer choice, pricing, enforcement and dispute resolution, as well as clarity of the exemptions framework.   It also aims to establish a flexible yet robust authorising framework for alternative energy business models such as solar power purchase agreements and community energy projects. More broadly, the review seeks to ensure that the framework provides certainty for consumers as well as industry.   An Issues Paper was released in June 2015 and 35 submissions were received in response. The <b>General</b> <b>Exemption</b> Order - Draft Position Paper has been prepared having regard to these submissions.   The Paper sets out a draft approach to the regulation of electricity licence exemptions going forward. It seeks feedback from Victorian energy consumers and industry on this approach and how to better enable innovative new technologies whilst safeguarding consumer rights in a rapidly evolving energy market...|$|R

40|$|When {{we started}} {{the work on the}} EU {{directives}} and their impact on Cultural heritage, we had a very simple solution in mind. This solution had the working title “The Directive of <b>general</b> <b>exemption</b> for cultural heritage”. As we started unravelling the extent of the problem and the legal basis for the EU directives we found that such a directive was not feasible. The cultural sector is subject to the principle of subsidiarity. The question of subsidiarity is the question of what decisions belong at EU level and which decisions belong at the national level. In short this subsidiarity defines culture and cultural heritage laws and regulations as a national prerogative; not part of the EU competencies or legislative system. This fact is elaborated in the article in “ 2. 1. Some elements of the EU treaty whith relevance to cultural heritage and EU Directives”. Cultural policies and therefore cultural heritage {{is not part of the}} EU Treaty and cannot, therefore, be regulated through a Directive. Therefore a Directive of <b>general</b> <b>exemption</b> for cultural heritage would have no legal basis in the EU Treaty. The conflicts ensuing from the implementation of the EU Directives, on one hand, and sound heritage conservation practice, on the other hand, takes place at national, rather than at EU or international level. The conflict stems from EU Directives from policy areas that are within the EU competencies; such as international trade competition, personal and public health, safety, and conservation of the natural environment. This is in itself an interesting constellation, but it does not make the task of finding a solution easier...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors of}} this paper compare various {{structural}} aspects of {{the capital gains tax}} systems in Canada and four selected countries: (i) Australia, (ii) New Zealand, (iii) the United Kingdom, and (iv) the United States. The principal focus is on the lifetime capital gains exemption in Canada and the availability of comparable exemptions, preferences and reliefs for capital gains in these other countries. Despite the common legal and taxation traditions in the selected countries, the review reveals a surprising number of differences in the approaches to the taxation of capital gains. These differences are found in all of the usual structural aspects of a capital gains tax system. One of the more striking features of the systems in the four other countries is the lack of any <b>general</b> <b>exemption</b> comparable to the lifetime gains exemption in Canada. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanics}} of protecting Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers occurs, in part, through the Inspector General Act passed in 1978.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} women, religion and the Australian state via an examination of federal anti-discrimination law. Much of the social research into religion-state relations over the last ten years, particularly {{with the rise of}} neo-liberalism, demonstrates that religious groups and ideas are actively involved in public debate, policy formation and implementation. While this has been examined by some scholars in social policy, particularly education, there has been little research on the relationship between women's rights and post-secular politics. This essay will address this gap by firstly locating women's rights in the context of global forms of neo-liberalism and specifically by examining Australian federal anti-discrimination legislation, which seeks to protect religious freedom by allowing religious groups <b>general</b> <b>exemption</b> from adhering to non-discriminatory employment and training protocols. It is argued via evidence, that such exemptions are premised on the treatment of women as other to masculine norms...|$|R
