5|$|Hispanic {{women are}} now more highly {{represented}} among enlisted women in the Marine Corps than the other services. Hispanic women are reaching the top echelons of the Marine Corps both in the enlistment and officer ranks. On August 13, 2004, MGySgt. Abigail D. Olmos became the first female Master Gunnery Sergeant {{in the history of}} the Marine Corps. and on August 2, 2006, Brigadier General Angela Salinas, made history when she became the first Hispanic female to obtain a general rank in the Marines. To date servicewomen are still restricted from serving in the following positions: Infantry regiments, artillery battalions, all armored units, combat engineer battalions, reconnaissance units, riverine assault craft units, low altitude air defense units, and fleet anti-terrorism security teams. In Operation Iraqi Freedom female Marines have played a prominent role guarding checkpoints and searching Iraqi women and children. This in turn has exposed many of them to dangerous situations which in some cases could cost them their lives. Two Hispanic female Marines died in said conflict: Lance Corporal Juana Navarro, assigned to 9th Engineer Support Battalion, 3rd Marine Logistics <b>Group,</b> <b>III</b> Marine Expeditionary Force, and Corporal Ramona M.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} caffeic acid on ectonucleotidase activities such as NTPDase (nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase), Ecto-NPP (nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase), 5 ′-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) in platelets and lymphocytes of rats, {{as well as in}} the profile of platelet aggregation. Animals were divided into five groups: I (control); II (oil); III (caffeic acid 10 mg/kg); IV (caffeic acid 50 mg/kg); and V (caffeic acid 100 mg/kg). Animals were treated with caffeic acid diluted in oil for 30 days. In platelets, caffeic acid decreased the ATP hydrolysis and increased ADP hydrolysis in <b>groups</b> <b>III,</b> IV and V when compared to control (P< 0. 05). The 5 ′-nucleotidase activity was decreased, while E-NPP and ADA activities were increased in platelets of rats of <b>groups</b> <b>III,</b> IV and V (P< 0. 05). Caffeic acid reduced significantly the platelet aggregation in the animals of <b>groups</b> <b>III,</b> IV and V in relation to group I (P< 0. 05). In lymphocytes, the NTPDase and ADA activities were increased in all groups treated with caffeic acid when compared to control (P< 0. 05). These findings demonstrated that the enzymes were altered in tissues by caffeic acid and this compound decreased the platelet aggregation suggesting that caffeic acid should be considered a potentially therapeutic agent in disorders related to the purinergic system...|$|R

40|$|Effect {{of single}} and {{repeated}} doses of tramadol on hepatic and renal functions and on pentobarbitone anesthesia was evaluated in dogs. Twenty five dogs were randomly distributed into five equal groups viz groups I and II received 3 mg kg - 1 of tramadol by subcutaneous and intravenous injections, respectively during premedication alone. <b>Groups</b> <b>III</b> and IV received similar doses of tramadol during premedication which was repeated 2 h {{after the initial}} dose thorough subcutaneous and intravenous injections, respectively. Group V served as negative control. Blood samples (2 mL) were taken at 0, 2 and 4 h after tramadol’s administration while liver and kidney biopsies were taken before the surgery ended. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) levels were significantly lowered in groups II-IV {{when compared to the}} group V at 4 h. Significant increase in AST was observed in <b>groups</b> I, <b>III</b> and V at 2 h and at 4 h in groups I and V. No significant change in kidney profile. Histopathological changes in the liver and kidney biopsies are mainly congestion, edema and cellular infiltration which occurred less frequently in <b>groups</b> <b>III</b> and IV. The volume of pentobarbitone was significantly lowered in <b>groups</b> <b>III</b> and IV. It is concluded that repeated administrations of tramadol at 3 mg kg - 1, IV or SC is safe at a frequency of 2 h interval during surgery without causing irreversible hepatic and renal damage and reduced the required dose of pentobarbitone needed to maintain anaesthesia in healthy dogs...|$|R
