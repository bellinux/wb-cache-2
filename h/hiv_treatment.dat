25|$|If <b>HIV</b> <b>treatment</b> has to {{be started}} while a patient is still on TB treatment, then {{the advice of a}} {{specialist}} HIV pharmacist should be sought. In general, there is no significant interactions with the NRTI's. Nevirapine should not be used with rifampicin. Efavirenz may be used, but dose used depends on the patient's weight (600nbsp&mg daily if weight less than 50nbsp&kg; 800nbsp&mg daily if weight greater than 50nbsp&kg). Efavirenz levels should be checked early after starting treatment (unfortunately, this is not a service routinely offered in the US, but is readily available in the UK). The protease inhibitors should be avoided if at all possible: patients on rifamycins and protease inhibitors have an increased risk of treatment failure or relapse.|$|E

Only in health expenses, caused by depression, suicide, and <b>HIV</b> <b>treatment,</b> India would have spent additional 23,100 million dollars due to homophobia. On top, there would be costs caused by violence, workplace loss, rejection of the family, and bullying at school, that would result in a lower education level, lower productivity, lower wages, worse health, and a lower life expectancy among the LGBT population. In total, she estimated for 2014 in India a loss of up to 30,800 million dollars, or 1,7 % of the Indian GDP.|$|E

25|$|Stigma {{has been}} {{associated}} with HIV in Jamaica {{since the beginning of the}} epidemic, partly because of its association with male homosexuality. Jamaican men, in particular, are so concerned about being associated with homosexuality that they are hesitant to seek <b>HIV</b> <b>treatment</b> and prevention services. Poor men living with HIV are assumed to have participated in same-sex sexual acts, and poor men who participate in those acts are assumed to be HIV positive. Some people in Jamaica become suicidal when they first receive their HIV diagnosis, rooted in the fear of isolation and discrimination that will result from others finding out and not from the potential of death associated with it. HIV is a reportable disease, resulting in a visit by a contact investigator who asks for the names of sexual partners.|$|E

General asthenia occurs in many chronic wasting diseases (such as tuberculosis and cancer), sleep disorders or chronic disorders of the heart, lungs or kidneys, and is probably most marked in diseases of the adrenal gland. Asthenia may be limited to certain organs or systems of organs, as in asthenopia, characterized by ready fatiguability. Asthenia is also a side effect of some medications and treatments, such as Ritonavir (a protease inhibitor used in <b>HIV</b> <b>treatment),</b> vaccines such as the HPV vaccine Gardasil and fentanyl patches (an opioid used to treat pain).|$|E

40|$|Summary This {{paper was}} {{originally}} written as {{a contribution to}} discussions about <b>HIV</b> <b>treatments</b> media occurring between the Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations (AFAO) and the National Association of People Living with HIV and AIDS (NAPWA). The Executive of NAPWA tabled the paper at the HIV subcommittee of the Australian National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases. The paper was based on research undertaken by the <b>HIV</b> <b>Treatments</b> Education Project of the Researchers in Residence Program. The implications of this research for how community–based HIV/AIDS media are best understood are more extensive than the original motivation for the paper allowed, {{consequently it has been}} somewhat revised for wider circulation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to extend the conceptual frameworks used to understand HIV/AIDS media. In particular, it queries notions of these media that see them solely as distribution mechanisms for treatments information and introduces the notion of cultures of care in which the HIV media play a key role...|$|R

Medical professionals and researchers have shown how the encoding of genes which influence the production of this particular type of antibody could help {{in the treatment of}} infections which attack the immune system. Professionals in the field have used <b>HIV</b> <b>treatment</b> as an example of infections these antibodies can treat. Recently, potent and broadly neutralizing human antibodies against influenza (such as CR6261), HIV and hepatitis C have been reported, and have suggested possible strategies to generate an improved vaccine that would confer long-lasting immunity.
