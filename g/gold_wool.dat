40|$|Significant {{opportunities}} {{exist in}} both the scientific and industrial sectors {{for the development of}} novel multi-functional materials that combine the inherent properties of all precursor components in a synergistic manner, thereby providing new products and opportunities. Processes that add value to natural materials in a facile and refined manner are particularly sought after. Thus this research combines useable substrates, notably natural protein fibres and minerals with gold or silver nanoparticles, producing high value, multi-functional materials that display the strength, softness and shine (of the protein fibres), or high surface area and dispersibility (of the minerals) with the high value and wealth associated with the noble metal nanoparticles, their broad spectrum of intense colours, anti-microbial, insecticide and anti-static properties. This adds significant worth to the substrates, transforming them from commodities to valuable materials. Silk, merino wool and crossbred wool were the natural fibres employed kaolinite and halloysite clays the minerals. They were combined with gold and silver nanoparticles of various sizes and shapes (and hence colours) producing the following composite materials: • <b>Gold</b> nanoparticle-merino <b>wool</b> composites • <b>Gold</b> nanoparticle-crossbred <b>wool</b> composites • <b>Gold</b> nanoparticle-silk composites • Silver nanoparticle-kaolinite composites • Silver nanoparticle-halloysite composites The most successful method for producing silver nanoparticle-clay composites involved the external preparation of silver nanoparticles and their subsequent attachment to the clay substrates by means of a layer-by-layer deposition approach, which capitalised on electrostatic interactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes capping the nanoparticles and bound to the clay surfaces. Three general approaches were employed in the production of the gold nanoparticle-natural fibre composite materials. The nanoparticles were either synthesised ex-situ and subsequently attached to the fibres, or the natural fibres were utilised as redox active biotemplates in which the wool or silk absorbed and subsequently reduced Au³⁺ to nanoparticulate Au⁰ on and within the fibres. Thirdly, a seed mediated growth approach was employed in which additional Au³⁺ was reduced to nanoparticulate Au⁰ on the surface of gold nanoparticles already bound to the fibres.

40|$|Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is {{important}} in influencing the formation of aerosols in the troposphere over {{large areas of the}} world's oceans. Understanding the dynamics of aerosols {{is important}} to understanding the earth's radiation balance. In evaluating the factors controlling DMS in the troposphere it is vital to understand the dynamics of DMS in the surface ocean. The biogeochemical processes controlling DMS concentration in seawater are myriad; modeling and theoretical estimation are problematic. At the beginning of this project we believed that we {{were on the verge of}} simplifying the ship-track measurement of DMS, and we proposed to deploy such a system to develop a database relating high frequency DMS measurements to biological and physicochemical and optical properties of surface water that can be quantified by remote sensing techniques. We designed a system to measure DMS concomitantly with other basic chemical and biological data in a flow-through system. The project was collaborative between Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and Bermuda Biological Station for Research (BBSR). The project on which we are reporting was budgeted for only one year with a one year no-cost extension. At WHOI our effort was directed towards designing traps which would be used to concentrate DMS from seawater and allow storage for subsequent analysis. At that time, GC systems were too large for easy long-term deployment on a research vessel like R/V Weatherbird, so we focused on simplifying the shipboard sampling procedure. Initial studies of sample recovery with high levels of DMS suggested that Carboxen 1000, a relatively new carbon molecular sieve, could be used as a stable storage medium. The affinity of Carboxen for DMS is several orders of magnitude higher than <b>gold</b> <b>wool</b> (another adsorbent used for DMS collection) on a weight or volume basis. Furthermore, Carboxen's affinity for DMS is also far less susceptible to humidity than <b>gold</b> <b>wool.</b> Unfortunately, further experiments with low level DMS indicated that recovery of DMS after storage was not quantitative. The material has proven to be completely acceptable for short term storage and has been incorporated into a micro-GC system. Since working on this project, we have collaborated with RVM Scientific in Santa Barbara in the design and construction of small portable micro-GC's that will make feasible at-sea measurement in moving ships, making rapid gas analysis and quantification feasible in a ship-track mode. Throughout this period at both WHOI and BBSR, we continued to analyze field data to understand that patterns of time and space variability in DMS and the processes that govern it. These insights will be crucial to determining the specifications for our automated sampling program. The data from this, the longest continuous sampling program for ocean DMS, provided insights into year to year and short-term variability...|$|E
40|$|Airborne {{measurements}} of DMS and H 2 S were made off {{the east coast}} of the United States and over the tropical Atlantic off Brazil. Samples were collected through a fluorinated ethylene propylene Teflon inlet manifold. Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) was preconcentrated onto <b>gold</b> <b>wool</b> and analyzed by gas chromatography/flame photometric detection. H 2 S was collected on AgNO 3 -impregnated filters and determined by fluorescence quenching. Use of a new scrubber material (cotton) to remove negative interference on DMS measurements was investigated. Comparison with a Na 2 CO 3 /Anakrom scrubber gave good overall agreement. Only under extreme conditions, e. g., on flight 9 (continental air mass, low humidity, high O 3, and low DMS values) did Na 2 CO 3 show noticeable loss of DMS compared to cotton. On most flights, especially in marine air masses with high humidity and relatively low O 3, the results from both scrubbers agreed well {{with each other and with}} other instruments used during the intercalibration. Off the U. S. East Coast, DMS levels showed strong dependence on air mass origin with high values (up to 83 ppt) in marine tropical air masses and low values (10 - 20 ppt) in continental and polar air. Over the tropical Atlantic, DMS ranged over 20 - 100 ppt in the mixed layer. Nighttime values were a factor of 1. 6 - 2. 3 higher than daytime levels. DMS decreased with altitude to less than 1 ppt at 4000 m. H 2 S in the mixed layer off the U. S. East Coast ranged from 10 to 200 ppt. Significant influence from terrestrial and pollution sources was evident. H 2 S in air masses originating over the eastern seaboard was much higher than in continental polar air or over the remote tropical continents. In contrast, over the tropical Atlantic, concentrations were very low (5 - 10 ppt), typical of truly marine air. Night/day ratios were about 1. 4. No significant geographical variability was seen in H 2 S levels over the tropical Atlantic. The correlation of atmospheric Rn- 222 and H 2 S was significant, with both being higher off the U. S.

Ostrich feathers were then the only commercial product of that activity and fifty years later still held fourth place {{on the list of}} exports from South Africa - after <b>gold,</b> diamonds and <b>wool</b> (Smit, 1963). However during the world depression of 1914 - 1945 the appeal of ostrich feathers vanished and the industry collapsed. Today commercial farming with domesticated ostriches (Struthi 0 camelus var. domesticus), originating from a cross (Duerden, 1910; Smit, 1963, 1984) between the South African (Struthio camelus australis) and the North African ostriches (Struthio camelus camel us), is again a rapidly expanding activity in South Africa's Little Karoo. This is the only region in the world where farming with ostriches is still encountered at a commercial scale, and although relatively small in the general stock-farming scenario, it provides a livelihood for about 400 farmers who run some 150 000 ostriches. Feathers, together with ostrich leather and meat are all prominent export products that account for foreign exchange earnings of more than R 30 million. In terms of monetary value the ostrich industry has grown by more than 300 % over the past decade and by al most 100 % in the 1 ast 5 years. This high growth rate is primarily due to the steady development of the slaughter bird industry in which leather, meat and feathers account for more than 80 % of the entire industry's turnover. Ostrich products, however, are primarily exclusive fashion products, of which more than 90 % is exported. Because the world market is relatively small, expansion prospects for the industry are limited and sensitive to supply and demand. To ensure the industry's continued economic well-being, ostrich research pays particular attention to production techniques that will help to improve efficiency and result in better product quality and profitability. For the purpose of increased ostrich chick production, ostrich eggs are presently being incubated in large quantities (ca 200 000 eggs per annum). However, hatching success of ostrich eggs in incubators is considerably below that of natural nests, and Burger & Bertram (1981) suggested that it may be due to high humidities (63 % relative humidity) commonly used in ostrich incubators. Investigations were undertaken to measure incubation temperatures and humidities during the complete course of 41 days of natural incubation in 6 ostrich nests. In addition, the water vapor conductance of the eggs was measured, as well as the incubation water loss which in other species averages 15 % of the initial egg mass and has been proposed as an optimal condition for hatching success (Ar & Rahn, 1978; Rahn 1984). The natural incubation parameters measured during these experiments were adapted and applied to conditions of artificial incubation. This improved the realized hatchability from 50 to 75 %. Furthermore the intensive production and finishing of slaughter birds on complete dry meal diets under feedlot conditions is a new development which contains exceptional possibilities for the industry (Swart & Kemm, 1985). Economically and biologically, efficient diet formulation has accordingly become essential for profitable slaughter bird production. The nutritional value of feed constituents for ostriches is, however, still unknown and without it effective least cost diet formulation and programming is not possible. Present growth and finishing diets for ostriches are based on energy values of the dietary components which have been derived from poultry (Blair, Daghir, Morimoto, Peter & Taylor, 1983; Du Preez, Duckitt & Paulse, 1986) and pig values (Kemm & Ras, 1981; NRC, 1973; IAFMM, 1985). This approach may, however, result in unreal estimation of the actual nutritional value of feed constituents for ostriches, so that quantification of their nutritional value has consequently become necessary. During 1985 a multi-disciplinary research programme on ostriches was initiated, the objective being to investigate the energy metabolism and the efficiency of energy utilization in growing farm ostriches. For the purpose of these experiments all ostrich chicks were incubated in an ostrich egg incubator, maintained at a dry bulb temperature of 36 °C and a wet bulb temperature of 24, 0 ± 1, 0 °C. These temperature settings were extrapolated from the natural incubation parameters measured in the six naturally incubated nests (Swart, Rahn & De Kock, 1987; Swart & Rahn, 1987). An important aspect of the studies on energy metabolism was {{to determine the extent to}} which plant fibre is digested in various segments of the gastrointestinal tract of growing ostriches and whether these birds utilize the end products of fibre digestion, namely volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid, efficiently. The possible use of metabolizable energy to evaluate feedstuffs for ostriches was an initial aim of this study. Subsequently the effect of crude fibre or energy concentration on the digestibility of gross energy, energy loss as methane, heat expenditure, and the effect on the efficiency of ME utilization were investigated. Finally accretion patterns and the partition of metabolizable energy during growth were studied in the young ostrich chick. The findings of the studies on incubation aspects (Section 1) are presented in Chapter 2 and 3 and that of the metabolism studies (Section 2) are presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of this dissertation...|$|R
