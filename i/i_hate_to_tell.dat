[...] "Young man," [...] he said, [...] "when you have seen a little of the world, and especially beyond the bounds of this narrow island, you will find much more art and dexterity necessary in conducting these businesses to an issue, than occurs to a blind John Bull, or a raw Scotchman. You will be then no stranger to the policy of life, which deals in mining and countermining,--now in making feints, now in thrusting with forthright passes. I look upon you, Mr. Mowbray, as a young man spoiled by staying at home, and keeping bad company; and will make it my business, if you submit yourself to my guidance, to inform your understanding, so as to retrieve your estate.--Don't--Don't answer me, sir! because I know too well, by experience, how young men answer on these subjects--they are conceited, sir, as conceited {{as if they had been}} in all the four quarters of the world. <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> <b>to</b> be answered, sir, <b>I</b> <b>hate</b> it. And, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you the truth, it is because Tyrrel has a fancy of answering me, that I rather make you my confidant on this occasion, than him. I would have had him throw himself into my arms, and under my directions; but he hesitated--he hesitated, Mr. Mowbray--and I despise hesitation. If he thinks he has wit enough to manage his own matters, let him try it--let him try it. Not but I will do all I can for him, in fitting time and place; but I will let him dwell in his perplexities and uncertainties for a little while longer. And so, Mr. Mowbray, you see what sort of an odd fellow I am, and you can satisfy me at once whether you mean to come into my measures--only speak out at once, sir, for I abhor hesitation." ...|$|R
