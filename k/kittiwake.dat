40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1985 Contrary to {{expected}} results, black-legged and red-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> on St. George Island exhibited {{more variability}} in annual breeding performance than black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> at Cape Peirce. Thick-billed and common murres at St. George also showed more annual variability than common murres at Cape Peirce. <b>Kittiwakes</b> at St. George exhibited improved breeding performance during years with colder water temperatures and lower summer wind speeds. Correlations between breeding performance in <b>kittiwakes</b> and murres and environmental conditions at Cape Peirce were inconclusive. A general {{decline in the}} annual breeding success of <b>kittiwakes</b> and murres at St. George between 1976 and 1984 coincided with reduced abundance of juvenile walleye pollock. Consistently low breeding success of <b>kittiwakes</b> and murres at Cape Peirce varied little among six years observed between 1970 and 1984. These results challenge previous considerations of pelagic food webs on the outer shelf as being more stable {{than those in the}} coastal domain...|$|R
40|$|Life-history {{strategies}} {{describe that}} ‘slow’- {{in contrast to}} ‘fast’-living species allocate resources cautiously towards reproduction to enhance survival. Recent evidence suggests that variation in strategies exists not only among species but also among populations of the same species. Here, we examined the effect of experimentally induced stress on resource allocation of breeding seabirds in two populations with contrasting life-history strategies: slow-living Pacific and fast-living Atlantic black-legged <b>kittiwakes.</b> We tested the hypothesis that reproductive responses in <b>kittiwakes</b> under stress reflect their life-history strategies. We predicted that in response to stress, Pacific <b>kittiwakes</b> reduce investment in reproduction compared with Atlantic <b>kittiwakes.</b> We exposed chick-rearing <b>kittiwakes</b> to a short-term (3 -day) period of increased exogenous corticosterone (CORT), a hormone that is released during food shortages. We examined changes in baseline CORT levels, parental care and effects on offspring. We found that <b>kittiwakes</b> from the two populations invested differently in offspring when facing stress. In response to elevated CORT, Pacific <b>kittiwakes</b> reduced nest attendance and deserted offspring more readily than Atlantic <b>kittiwakes.</b> We observed lower chick growth, a higher stress response in offspring and lower reproductive success in response to CORT implantation in Pacific <b>kittiwakes,</b> whereas the opposite occurred in the Atlantic. Our findings {{support the hypothesis that}} life-history strategies predict short-term responses of individuals to stress within a species. We conclude that behaviour and physiology under stress are consistent with trade-off priorities as predicted by life-history theory. We encourage future studies to consider the pivotal role of life-history strategies when interpreting inter-population differences of animal responses to stressful environmental events...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{maintenance}} {{of an effective}} immune system may entail physiological costs only affordable by individuals in good condition. Some species, like Black-legged <b>Kittiwakes</b> () in the high arctic, experience important physiological changes during breeding in order to fulfil their reproductive goals. We studied the effects of breeding effort on the cell-mediated immunity (CMI) of adult breeding <b>Kittiwakes.</b> Parent <b>Kittiwakes</b> showed {{a significant decrease in}} CMI from hatching to 15  days into the chick-rearing period, when both parents are known to experience a drastic increase in energy expenditure together with important physiological adjustments.

As a scientific illustrator and photographer, he also wrote three other books: Zoological photography in practice (1956); Uganda {{in black and white}} (1959); and Looking at animals: a zoologist in Africa (1975). He became interested in the relationship of bird colours with their role as warning colours, an idea that arose when he observed hornets attracted to some birds being skinned while ignoring others. This led him to study the palatability of birds and their eggs. Among his papers were several studies on the relative palatibility of the eggs based initially on the preferences of ferrets, rats and hedgehogs and later on the use of a panel of expert egg tasters. In one study he found that of 123 species of bird, the <b>kittiwake</b> eggs scored highly with 8.2 out of 10.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kittiwakes</b> are coastal {{breeding}} birds ranging in the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. They form large, dense, noisy colonies {{during the summer}} reproductive period, often sharing habitat with murres. They are the only gull species that are exclusively cliff-nesting. A colony of <b>kittiwakes</b> living in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead in the north east of England has made homes on both the Tyne Bridge and Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art.

40|$|We used a supplemental-feeding experiment, the doubly labeled water technique, and a model-selection {{approach}} {{based upon}} the Akaike Information Criterion to examine effects of food availability on energy expenditure rates of Black-legged <b>Kittiwakes</b> (Rissa tridactyla) raising young. Energy expenditure rates of supplementally fed females (n = 14) and males (n = 16) were 34 and 20 % {{lower than those of}} control females (n = 14) and males (n = 18), respectively. Energy expenditure rates of females were more responsive to fluctuations in food availability than those of males. Fed males likely expended more energy while off the nest than fed females, possibly because of nest defense. Energy expenditure rates of fed <b>kittiwakes</b> were similar to values reported for <b>kittiwakes</b> that were either not raising young or not foraging. Parent <b>kittiwakes,</b> therefore, adjusted parental effort in response to variation in breeding conditions due to changes in food availability. Adjustments in reproductive effort in response to variable foraging conditions may have significant effects on the survival and productivity of individuals, and thus provide substantial fitness benefits for long-lived seabirds such as Black-legged <b>Kittiwakes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl {{substances}} (PFASs) {{are being}} transported into the Arctic {{where they are}} frequently detected in wildlife. These compounds are suspected thyroid hormone (TH) disruptors due to their structural similarity to triiodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4), {{in addition to their}} propensity to bind to proteins. Therefore, PFASs may affect THs by competitive binding to the thyroid binding proteins in the blood. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the concentrations of PFASs and THs, and examine effects of PFASs on THs, body condition, and body mass in black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> (Rissa tridactyla) and arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus). Blood was collected from breeding black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> and arctic skuas. Black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> (hereafter <b>kittiwakes)</b> were sampled in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard in 2013 and 2014. Arctic skuas were sampled on Brensholmen, Norway and in Kongsfjorden in 2014. The blood was analyzed for perfluorohexanoate (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUnDA), perfluorododecanoate (PFDoDA), perfluorotridecanoate (PFTrDA), perfluorotetradecanoate (PFTeDA), perfluorohexane sulfonate anion (PFHxS), branched and linear perfluorooctane sulfonate anion (brPFOS and linPFOS), perfluorodecane sulfonate anion (PFDS), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA). The analyses were performed on plasma samples for the black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> and on whole blood samples for the arctic skuas. PFHxA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFDS, and PFHxS were not detected in either bird species. Furthermore, total THs (TT 3 and TT 4) were quantified from plasma samples in both species. The resulting data was analyzed statistically to examine if there were associations between PFASs, THs, body condition (BC), and body mass. The dominant PFASs in both <b>kittiwakes</b> and arctic skuas were linPFOS and PFUnDA. In both species, males generally had significantly higher concentrations of PFASs than the females. Furthermore, positive correlations between PFASs and THs were identified in both <b>kittiwakes</b> and arctic skuas. Male <b>kittiwakes</b> with high levels of PFDoDA, PFTrDA, and PFTeDA were in a better body condition than males with lower levels. Conversely, in female <b>kittiwakes</b> and male arctic skuas PFASs were negatively correlated to BC and body mass. The results indicate that PFASs affect the thyroid system, BC, and body mass in the two seabird species...|$|R

40|$|Black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> (Rissa tridactyla) {{breeding}} in the Arctic, {{are exposed}} to annual fluctuating environmental conditions. The impact of inter-year variations in environmental conditions on the blood concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was examined in black-legged <b>kittiwakes</b> breeding in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard. In addition, it was examined if inter-year variations in concentration of POPs were affecting circulating thyroid hormone (TH) levels. Blood samples were collected from breeding <b>kittiwakes</b> during the incubation period in 2008 (n= 46) and 2009 (n= 31), two different years in respect of environmental conditions. The whole blood samples were analyzed for POPs: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs; PCB- 28, - 52, - 99, - 118, - 101, - 138, - 153, 180, - 183, - 187, - 194), hexachlorobezene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexan (HCH), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p -DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p -DDE) oxychlordane, cis-chlordane, trans-chlordane, cis-nonachlor, trans-nonachlor, heptachlor, heptachloroepoxid, and mirex, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Plasma was analysed for concentrations of total triiodothyronine (T 3), using radioimmunoassay. Associations between variables of POPs and T 3 were analysed using univariate statistics. Biometric measurements of the kittiwakes; body mass, skull length, and wing length where included in the statistical analysis, together with calculated BC (BC; body mass controlled for body size). Associations between the variables were analysed using multivariate statistics. The PCBs were the dominant contaminants in both 2008 and 2009. The three major constituents in the <b>kittiwakes</b> were PCB- 153, followed by PCB- 138 and PCB- 180. Even though the body condition of the <b>kittiwakes</b> was significant poorer in 2009 compared to 2008, the concentrations of PCBs and DDE did not differ between 2008 and 2009. The concentration (ng/g wet weight [w. w. ]) of HCB and oxychlordane were significant higher in 2009 compared to 2008. There was a strong negative association between HCB and body condition of the <b>kittiwakes.</b> Also the concentration of oxychlordane was negative correlated to body condition. Thus, <b>kittiwakes</b> with poor body condition had higher levels of HCB and oxychlordane. Additionally, HCB, oxychlordane and PCB- 183 were positively associated with egg-laying date, while body condition was negatively correlated to egg-laying date. The results showed that <b>kittiwakes</b> with a poor body condition and thus, high levels of HCB and oxychlordane, were associated with late breeding. The low body condition in 2009 indicated poor food availability and unfavourable conditions for the <b>kittiwakes</b> that year...|$|R

Declines at the west coast of the North Sea were attributed to a lower abundance and lower quality of the key prey, sandeels. We hypothesised that <b>kittiwakes</b> at Helgoland do not rely as heavily on sandeels as their conspecifics. We analysed stomach contents of nestlings and adults of 2001, 2002, 2004 and 2006. In concordance with earlier studies of the 1980 s and 1990 s, young whiting was the most important prey species in 2001, 2002 and 2004. Clupeids and sandeels were consumed in lower proportions. While earlier studies suggested whiting to originate from fisheries discards, evidence now supports that <b>kittiwakes</b> prey upon whiting in areas of hydrographic fronts. No whiting was recovered in samples of 2006 and the proportion of fish prey was low. Main prey items were polychaete worms (Nereidae), which were presumably consumed as swarming Heteronereis stages. An observed strong rise in water temperature in summer 2006 might have influenced food availability of <b>kittiwakes</b> by inducing swarming of Nereidae.
