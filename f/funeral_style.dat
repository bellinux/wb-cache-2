50|$|Later, he {{receives}} {{a report from}} the CDC about infected transfusions and blood products and finds one of his pediatric patients had received blood from a donor who later developed the disease, much to the anger of the patient's family. TV reporters appear in the hospital wearing disposable latex gloves, surgical clothes and masks, afraid of becoming infected by being in the same room or building with Oleske. Another of his patients, an adult female former prostitute and drug user, is informed by him that her child has the disease, indicating that its virus was passed to her child through her blood while she was pregnant, meaning that she was infected before she gave up drugs and prostitution. After her child dies, she returns to her former lifestyle. The publicity of Oleske's work on AIDS also causes problems with his family in his private life, as his school age children are subjected to ridicule from their peers about this. In 1984, a young foster child dies and is buried in a Gospel music <b>style</b> <b>funeral</b> and Oleske finally receives approval of his work from the CDC and promises to continue his work among his patients, even though they will eventually die young.|$|R
