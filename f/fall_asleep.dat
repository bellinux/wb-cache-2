40|$|Driver {{surveys are}} {{indispensable}} {{sources of information}} when estimating the role of sleepiness in crash causation. The {{purpose of the study}} was to (1) identify the prevalence of driving while sleepy among Finnish drivers, (2) determine the circumstances of such instances, and (3) identify risk factors and risk groups. Survey data were collected from a representative sample of active Finnish drivers (N = 1121). One-fifth of the drivers (19. 5 %) reported having <b>fallen</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel during their driving career, with 15. 9 % reporting having been close to <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> or having difficulty staying awake when driving during the previous twelve months. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were found to be associated with both types of sleepiness-related driving instances, while sleep quality was associated only with the latter. Compared to women, men more often reported <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel; the differences were somewhat smaller with respect to fighting sleep while driving during the previous twelve months. The reported discrepancy in sleepiness-related instances (high prevalence of fighting sleep while driving during the previous twelve months and lower proportion of actually <b>falling</b> <b>asleep)</b> identifies young men (⩽ 25 years) as one of the main target groups for safety campaigns. Approximately three-quarters of drivers who had <b>fallen</b> <b>asleep</b> while driving reported taking action against <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> before it actually happened. Furthermore, almost all drivers who had <b>fallen</b> <b>asleep</b> while driving offered at least one logical reason that could have contributed to their <b>falling</b> <b>asleep.</b> These data indicate some degree of awareness about driving while sleepy and of the potential pre-trip factors that could lead to sleepiness while driving, and supports the notion that <b>falling</b> <b>asleep</b> at the wheel does not come as a (complete) surprise to the driver...|$|R

5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} may occur along with {{low back pain}}. Chronic low back pain is associated with sleep problems, including a greater amount of time needed to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> disturbances during sleep, a shorter duration of sleep, and less satisfaction with sleep. In addition, a majority of those with chronic low back pain show symptoms of depression or anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by her brother-in-law), and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b> In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her <b>fall</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
5|$|The badnjak {{should not}} be jumped over or trodden upon, and blowing on its fire is avoided. It {{should not be}} moved when about to burn through, lest the log break at the place most {{consumed}} by the fire, which is usually strongest {{at the center of}} the fireplace; the separation of the log should be a result of the fire only. None of the family members should <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> before the log splits, otherwise some of them may die in the coming year, without warning.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E

5|$|In The Flopsy Bunnies, Benjamin Bunny and {{his cousin}} Flopsy are the parents of six young rabbits called simply The Flopsy Bunnies.

5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} out of bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E

5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the highest bidder. Waiting until the other occupants <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E
5|$|As {{the taping}} time, 6 pm, is fast approaching, Tracy begins acting strangely. Liz and Pete {{discover}} {{that he has}} not been taking his medication correctly.

5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request hoping he would <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to <b>fall</b> <b>asleep</b> in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|Prophet Elijah {{was also}} {{regarded}} as a protector from the ale. As soon as he spotted an ala consuming the fertility of fields, he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot. They then together attacked the demon, shooting fiery arrows at her. Instead of the dragons, the prophet could summon dragon men. They would then <b>fall</b> <b>asleep,</b> and their souls would rush to the thundering clouds to assist the prophet against the ale. A legend {{in the region of}} Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by Prophet Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons. In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, Prophet Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun.|$|E
