2500|$|Research {{to develop}} a Straticharge Continuous Fuel-Injection (SCFI) system (an early <b>gasoline</b> <b>direct</b> <b>injection</b> (GDI) design) was {{conducted}} {{with the backing of}} AMC. The Hornet's conventional spark ignited internal combustion straight-6-cylinder engine was a modified with a redesigned cylinder head, and road testing performed using a 1973 AMC Hornet. This SCFI system was a mechanical device that automatically responded to the engine's airflow and loading conditions with two separate fuel-control pressures supplied to two sets of continuous-flow injectors. It was [...] "a dual-chamber, three-valve, fuel-injected, stratified-charge" [...] engine. Flexibility was designed into the SCFI system for trimming it to a particular engine.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} controlled <b>direct</b> <b>gasoline</b> fuel <b>injection</b> (DGI) {{system has been}} modeled, programmed and constructed for a four-stroke SI engine.

All the old model vehicle were equipped with carburetor for air fuel mixing and later on electronic fuel injection system has been introduced for maintaining better air fuel ratio and mixing in many late model vehicles. Later on Japan introduced <b>direct</b> <b>gasoline</b> fuel <b>injection</b> system in their SI engine but it is not yet commercialized in many under developed countries. <b>Direct</b> <b>gasoline</b> fuel <b>injection</b> (DGI) system has the advantage of fulfilling proper air fuel ratio in various operating conditions and loads providing minimum air pollution. In four stroke engine, fuel needs to be supplied once in every two revolution. A logic control and program is necessary to control and supply fuel supply once in the cylinder at every two revolution. A program has been made to control the system. Fuel injection period was maintained by opto-isolator sensor in this model. But fuel injection period need to be varied depending on operating condition and loads. Further research is necessary to develop this model and program depending upon engine loads. The designed DGI system is found to work properly with the designed constant speed of 3000 rpm. The development of this model with variable speed and load is necessary for improvement of vehicle performances and emission control. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} of high efficiency and lower pollutant emissions {{is pushing the}} automotive industry to develop <b>Gasoline</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Injections</b> engines, which offer the possibility of burning an average lean stratified charge, allowing lower pumping loses and higher thermodynamic efficiency. But the very short time available to prepare the correct burning mixture requires a deep knowledge of the air-fuel mixing phenomena to attain the desired results and to withstand the pollution limits. In the present work a hollow-cone iso-octane spray produced by a GDI injector was injected into ambient air and was characterised by means of high speed photography and Laser Doppler Velocimetry. Two different fuel temperatures, respectively 293 K and 393 K, were used to study {{the effect of the}} fuel evaporation on the spray structure and of its interaction with the surrounding air. At ambient temperature the structure of the spray, when quasi-steady conditions are reached, is hollow-cone shaped in the proximity of the injector. At further distance the spray collapses because of the air entrainment flow: the spray angle becomes narrower and the hollow cone structure is lost. At the same time a toroidal vortex structure is induced in the air surrounding the spray. At high fuel temperature, the spray is initially more expanded because of the fuel flash boiling, but then the enhanced air entrainment collapses the spray at much closer distance from the injector than at ambient conditions. The resulting fuel-air mixture is richer, but also mor...|$|R
