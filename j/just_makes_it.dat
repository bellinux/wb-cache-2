500|$|According to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, Sparrow is a trickster {{who uses}} wit and deceit to attain his goals, preferring to end {{disputes}} verbally instead of by force. He walks {{with a slightly}} drunken swagger and has slurred speech and flailing hand gestures. Sparrow is shrewd, calculating, and eccentric. He fools Norrington and his crew to set sail on the royal ship Interceptor, which compels the admiration of Lieutenant Groves as he concedes: [...] "That's {{got to be the}} best pirate I have ever seen". Norrington himself acquiesces to this praise: [...] "So it would seem", in sharp contrast to what he had previously proclaimed: [...] "You are without doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of". In the third film, while he leaves Beckett's ship stranded and makes off, Lieutenant Groves asks him: [...] "Do you think he plans it all out, or <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> up as he goes along?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series is}} {{written by a}} team of writers led by Armando Iannucci, who also directs the series, with Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, Roger Drew, Sean Gray, Ian Martin, Will Smith and Tony Roche. [...] Some of the {{dialogue}} is improvised rather than scripted (with the cast credited as providing [...] "additional material"), and includes some very strong language. Peter Capaldi said [...] "Fundamentally 80% of the final cut is the script that we started with. The improvisation <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> feel more real and not written." [...] Prior to rehearsals, the scripts are sent to a [...] "swearing consultant" [...] in Lancaster called Ian Martin, who adds some of the more colourful language. The programme's producer is Adam Tandy, who has produced all of Iannucci's television projects since 2000. The programme is shot with hand-held cameras to give it a sense of vérité or fly-on-the-wall documentary. The documentary style is furthered by the absence of any incidental music or laughter track.|$|E

2500|$|Newhart {{discontinued}} {{the series}} in 1978 after six seasons and 142 episodes. Wallace said of its ending, [...] "It was much crying and sobbing. It was so sad. We really did get along. We really had great times together." [...] Of Newhart's other long-running sitcom, Newhart, Wallace said, [...] "But {{some of the}} other great comedic talents who had a brilliant show, when they tried to do it twice, it didn't always work. And that's what... but like Bob, as far as I'm concerned, Bob is like the Fred Astaire of comics. He <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> look so easy, and he's not as in-your-face as some might be. And so, you just kind of take it for granted, how extraordinarily funny and how he wears well." [...] She was later reunited with Newhart twice, once in a reprise of her role as Carol on Murphy Brown in 1994, and on an episode of Newhart's short-lived sitcom, George & Leo, in 1997.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{can explain}} to the young lady," [...] said Dr. Cyrus Pym. [...] "This {{criminal}} or maniac Smith is a very genius of evil, and has a method of his own, a method of the most daring ingenuity. He is popular wherever he goes, for he invades every house as an uproarious child. People are getting suspicious of all the respectable disguises for a scoundrel; so he always uses the disguise of--what shall I say--the Bohemian, the blameless Bohemian. He always carries people off their feet. People are used to the mask of conventional good conduct. He goes in for eccentric good-nature. You expect a Don Juan to dress up as a solemn and solid Spanish merchant; but you're not prepared when he dresses up as Don Quixote. You expect a humbug to behave like Sir Charles Grandison; because (with all respect, Miss Hunt, for the deep, tear-moving tenderness of Samuel Richardson) Sir Charles Grandison so often behaved like a humbug. But no real red-blooded citizen is quite ready for a humbug that models himself not on Sir Charles Grandison but on Sir Roger de Coverly. Setting {{up to be a}} good man a little cracked is a new criminal incognito, Miss Hunt. It's been a great notion, and uncommonly successful; but its success <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> mighty cruel. I can forgive Dick Turpin if he impersonates Dr. Busby; I can't forgive him when he impersonates Dr. Johnson. The saint with a tile loose is a bit too sacred, I guess, to be parodied." ...|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film a mixed review, {{awarding}} it two-and-a-half stars out of four. While praising the characterization and {{the performances of}} Robert Mitchum and Ken Takakura, he criticized the plot as being somewhat difficult to follow and expressed concern over the level of violence: [...] "it's for audiences that have grown accustomed {{over the last few}} years to buckets of blood, disembowelments and severed hands flying through the air. It's very violent, and the fact that the violence has been choreographed by a skilled director (Sidney Pollack, who made They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> all the more extreme." ...|$|E

These two characters getting together {{at the end of}} the series throws both characters into a new, not favorable light." [...] said a critic on Rotten Tomatoes.

5000|$|Ayers Rock put a {{proposal}} to Gudinski that they could record the album live-in-the-studio in two days. This was attractive to Gudinski because at that moment his company, Mushroom Records, was critically short of funds. The sessions at Armstrong's (21—22 September 1974) were described as [...] "having a party before an audience with lights, drinks and food". Doyle told Margaret MacIntyre of Rolling Stone: [...] "We depend a lot on audience response ... and when an audience is really into it, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> so much better and easier to play". The invited audience were friends of the band, and special guests from the music industry. The album, Big Red Rock, was released in Australia and New Zealand in November 1974.|$|E
50|$|In {{simulation}} experiment, {{the goal}} is to evaluate the effect of different values of input variables on a system, which is called running simulation experiments. However the interest is sometimes in finding the optimal value for input variables in terms of the system outcomes. One way could be running simulation experiments for all possible input variables. However this approach is not always practical due to several possible situations and it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> intractable to run experiment for each scenario. For example, there might be so many possible values for input variables, or simulation model might be so complicated and expensive to run for suboptimal input variable values. In these cases, {{the goal is}} to find optimal values for input variables rather than trying all possible values. This process is called simulation optimization.|$|E

5000|$|According to Matt Carter, [...] "It’s {{not often}} that we {{write an article}} on 'The Voice' that is about a {{contestant}} being triple-montaged, mostly because {{it is such a}} rare phenomenon, but here we are with it happening to Katherine Ho.When it a triple-montage does happen, it <b>just</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> all the more frustrating since it eliminates the purpose of the show. We know that {{there is no guarantee that}} you are going to get airtime when you audition for the show, but we do think for the most part you should get a little more attention than Katherine Ho got over the course of the competition. Her Battle Round performance of Caroline Burns was not really shown, and this puts her in a similar camp with Rebekah Samarin back in season 7 of the show. They made it far enough on the show that they cannot audition again, and yet they don’t really get a lot of publicity - it’s pretty unfair.|$|E
