5|$|The Patterson Post Office {{underwent}} several re-locations {{throughout the}} years. After the Lloyd Lumber Company {{moved to a}} larger building along NY311, the post office occupied the smaller structure; both were situated {{on the east side}} of the New York Central tracks. Residents complained that the new location was inadequate, claiming that parking was insufficient at nearby companies, and that walking along a busy road to reach the post office was dangerous. After a bidding process to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> location, the office was again moved to a former car service station along Front Street.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> {{use of the}} pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Imperial Japan {{attacked}} Indochina and wrested {{control from}} France, {{but when they}} were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum resulted. The communist-dominated Vietminh of Ho Chi Minh fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted {{to regain control of}} their colony by creating the French Union-allied State of Vietnam. Up until 1954, the First Indochina War raged. In 1954, the French lost the Battle of Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference was held to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of French Indochina. The Vietminh were given control of North Vietnam, while the State of Vietnam controlled the territory south of the 17th parallel. The Geneva agreements, which the State of Vietnam did not sign, called for reunification elections to be held in 1956. The State of Vietnam received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War, which saw it as a partner in a fight against the spread of communism.|$|E
5|$|The NHC {{noted that}} a trough ahead of Christine would <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the storm. This trough would either merge with the storm and allow {{significant}} intensification, or remain separate and cause Christine to dissipate. By September3, the low-level circulation had been displaced from all convective activity and Christine weakened to a tropical depression. Several hours after weakening, the depression passed over Antigua with winds of 35mph (55km/h). The following day, the system degenerated into a tropical wave near the northeastern coast of the Dominican Republic. The remnants of Christine were monitored by the NHC for several days before dissipating near the trough on September6.|$|E

Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as his Prime Minister, hoping Diệm would be able to attract American aid as the French withdrew from Southeast Asia. Diệm returned to Vietnam in June 1954 and took up the post on July 7, 1954. After a series of disagreements, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum on October 23, 1955, and declared himself president of the newly-proclaimed Republic of Vietnam three days later. Diệm received support from the US and other anti-communist countries {{in the midst of the}} Cold War. He refused to hold national reunification elections scheduled in 1956, and asserted that Ho would rig the ballots in the north, although he had done so himself in deposing Bảo Đại. In the meantime, Diệm continued to consolidate his rule and stabilize his new nation.|$|E

25|$|Tensions between Carranza and Pancho Villa grew {{throughout}} 1914, as Villa {{created a}} number of diplomatic incidents that Carranza was worried would invite outside intervention in the Mexican Revolution.

However, Carranza disliked Villa's insubordination {{so much that he}} refused to let Villa march into Mexico City in August. In September, Villa and Carranza formally split, and during this time Obregón paid a visit to Villa that nearly resulted in Villa's having Obregón shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} the grapes at the winery is to separate {{the components of the}} wort that are needed from the unwanted parts. The process followed at this stage will largely <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> quality of the wine. For this, the clusters are generally shaken then trampled. The practice of moderate trampling allows the grains to burst, releasing the juice and pulp (it cannot be used for white wine from black grapes as the premature bursting of the berries would cause a coloured must). The practice of shaking or stalking has the advantage of separating the stems from the cluster of grapes and avoids giving the wine a herbaceous taste at pressing. The skin is not macerated and the transparent yellow colour is retained.|$|E
25|$|In South Vietnam, a {{referendum}} {{was scheduled for}} 23 October 1955 to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> direction of the south, in which the people would decide to choose Diệm or Bảo Đại {{as the leader of}} South Vietnam. During the election, Diệm's brother Ngô Đình Nhu and the Cần Lao Party supplied Diệm's electoral base in organizing and supervising the elections, especially the propaganda campaign far destroying Bảo Đại's reputation. Supporters of Bảo Đại were not allowed to campaign. Official results showed 98.2 percent of voters favoured a republic—an implausibly high result that was condemned as fraudulent. The total number of votes far exceeded the number of registered voters by over 380,000—further evidence that the referendum was heavily rigged. For example, only 450,000 voters were registered in Saigon, but 605,025 were said to have voted for a republic.|$|E

25|$|The Kashmir Conflict {{arose from}} the Partition of British India in 1947 into modern India and Pakistan. Both {{countries}} subsequently made claims to Kashmir, based on the history and religious affiliations of the Kashmiri people. The princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, which lies strategically in the north-west of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan and China, was formerly ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh under the paramountcy of British India. In geographical and legal terms, the Maharaja could have joined {{either of the two}} new countries. Although urged by the Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of his state before the transfer of power took place, Singh demurred. In October 1947, incursions by Pakistan took place leading to a war, as a result of which the state of Jammu and Kashmir remains divided between India and Pakistan.|$|E

As {{part of the first}} phase of this advance Lawrence and Feisal's force was undertaking the siege of Ma'an, but due to the delay in the advance northwards German and Ottoman units from Amman were in a position to threaten Feisal's Hejaz Arabs from Aba el Lissan back to Aqaba, while Allenby was threatening German and Ottoman forces to the east of the Jordan River with the capture of Es Salt. Allenby offered technical equipment to strengthen the precarious position of Lawrence and Feisal's position on the plateau. With the break up of the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade Allenby gave Feisal's force 2,200 riding-camels, and 1,300 transport camels.|$|E
25|$|After {{protracted}} negotiations {{a cease-fire}} was {{agreed to by}} both countries, which came into effect.

This required Pakistan to withdraw its forces, both regular and irregular, while allowing India to maintain minimum strength of its forces in the state to preserve law and order. On compliance of these conditions a plebiscite was to be held to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> of the territory. Indian losses were 1,104 killed and 3,154 wounded, whereas Pakistani losses were 6,000 killed and 14,000 wounded. India gained control of the two-thirds Kashmir whereas, Pakistan gained roughly one-third of Kashmir.
