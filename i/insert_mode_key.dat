5000|$|... vi is a modal editor: it {{operates}} in either <b>insert</b> <b>mode</b> (where typed text {{becomes part of}} the document) or normal mode (where keystrokes are interpreted as commands that control the edit session). For example, typing [...] while in normal mode switches the editor to <b>insert</b> <b>mode,</b> but typing [...] again at this point places an [...] "i" [...] character in the document. From <b>insert</b> <b>mode,</b> pressing [...] switches the editor back to normal mode. A perceived advantage of vi's separation of text entry and command modes is that both text editing and command operations can be performed without requiring the removal of the user's hands from the home row. As non-modal editors usually have to reserve all keys with letters and symbols for the printing of characters, any special commands for actions other than adding text to the buffer must be assigned to keys that do not produce characters, such as function keys, or combinations of modifier keys such as , and [...] with regular keys. Vi has the property that most ordinary keys are connected to some kind of command for positioning, altering text, searching and so forth, either singly or in key combinations.

40|$|Abstract. The {{automatic}} scheduling is {{not suitable}} for manufacture in most case, because it cannot fully utilize {{the experience of the}} operator and effectively response the disturbance events from the production progress. In order to solve these problems the manual scheduling technology using the pattern of human-computer collaborative is proposed. The graphical scheduling block has been discrete through applying the kernel methods including the combination of multi-layer displaying of Gantt-Chart, the model of machine calendar, mouse selected mechanism and auxiliary function for manual scheduling. By building multi-layer normative modular manual scheduling operations, we divide the manual scheduling operation into three steps: the selection of manual scheduling process, the selection of the inserting base, and the <b>inserting</b> <b>mode.</b> At the same time constrains transferring mode provoked by the three kinds of <b>inserting</b> <b>mode</b> is analyzed. By controlling constrains in the progress of the manual adjustment makes sure that the manual scheduling result meets the demand of job shop production.

40|$|Abstract. Control {{panels of}} {{computer}} and other modern instruments are often equipped with so-called <b>mode</b> <b>keys,</b> the pressing of which changes {{the function of}} other control elements. Thus user keys have different functions depending on the current mode of the instrument. The question is, however, whether it is more userfriendly to have a panel with parallel arranged keys for each function (thus with almost direct possibility to intervene), or to have serial equipment {{with only a few}} user keys, where the different functions are only available if the user calls up the relevant machine mode (e. g. displayed on a monitor that operates with different switchable screens). In this case there exist only serial access possibilities. Two experiments compared perfor-mances with three types of user interfaces with and without <b>mode</b> <b>keys</b> on the basis of selection times and errors. Although <b>mode</b> <b>keys</b> apparently reduce the complexity of the user interface, our results show that they lead to slower and more often incorrect usage. However, the amount of practice was a moderator variable. As a consequence, for occasional users it is worth considering a less complex interface, that is, with <b>mode</b> <b>keys,</b> but for expert users an interface where each function has its own key should be preferred. 1...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{different}} kinds of feedback in preventing mode errors was investigated. Two experiments examined the frequency of mode errors in a text editing task where a mode error was defined as an attempt to issue navigation commands while in <b>insert</b> <b>mode,</b> or an attempt to insert text while in command mode. In Experiment 1 the effectiveness of kinesthetic versus visual feedback was compared in four different conditions: the use of keyboard versus foot pedal for changing mode (kinesthetic feedback), crossed with {{the presence or absence of}} visual feedback to indicate mode. The results showed both kinesthetic and visual feedback to be effective in reducing mode errors. However, kinesthetic was more effective than visual feedback both in terms of reducing errors and in terms of reducing the cognitive load associated with mode changes. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis that the superiority of this kinesthetic feedback was due to the fact that the foot pedal required subjects actively to maintain <b>insert</b> <b>mode.</b> The results confirmed that the use of a non-latching foot pedal for switching modes provided a more salient source of information on mode state than the use of a latching pedal. On the basis of these results we argue that user-maintained mode states prevent mode errors more effectively than system-maintained mode states. 1...|$|R
