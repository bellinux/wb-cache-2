5|$|Burke {{was arrested}} and tried for {{manslaughter}} but was acquitted. Following the death in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, also known as Brighton Bill, the London Prize Ring Rules were introduced to more clearly define the rules of prize fighting and to introduce certain safety measures, rules that still <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E

5|$|Commutative algebra makes great use of {{rings of}} polynomials {{in one or}} several variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both commutative and associative. These rings and their quotients <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of algebraic geometry, because they are rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|The Moon's regular phases {{make it a}} very {{convenient}} timepiece, and {{the periods}} of its waxing and waning <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> {{of many of the}} oldest calendars. Tally sticks, notched bones dating as far back as 20–30,000 years ago, are believed by some to mark the phases of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Black Elk (Lakota) was a {{medicine}} man and heyokha, whose life spanned {{the transition to}} reservations. His accounts of the 19th-century Indian Wars and Ghost Dance movement, and his deep thoughts on personal visions and Native American religion, <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the book Black Elk Speaks, first published in 1932. (Among several editions, a premier annotated edition was published in 2008.) Paul Goble, an award-winning children's book author and illustrator, has been based in the Black Hills since 1977.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{traditional}} Daoist {{ideas were}} retained in Lingbao cosmology, {{such as the}} idea that the world originated from a type of primordial qi known as yuanqi, and then was divided into heaven and earth. Furthermore, the yuanqi is subdivided into three types of qi that correspond to three deities: the lords of the Celestial Treasure, of the Sacred Treasure and of the Divine Treasure. These three deities later introduced the teachings of the Dongzhen (Perfect Grotto), the Dongxuan (Mysterious Grotto), and of the Dongshen (Divine Grotto). These three teachings <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for the later classification of texts in the Daozang.|$|E
5|$|In 1481 {{two local}} men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships {{looking for the}} mythical island of Hy-Brasil. There {{was no mention of}} the island being {{discovered}} but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he should not have engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> for a variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.|$|E
5|$|In October 1864, delegates for {{confederation}} met in Quebec City for the Quebec Conference, {{where the}} Seventy-Two Resolutions were agreed to—they would <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of Canada's government. The Great Coalition was endangered by Taché's 1865 death: Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown {{felt that he}} had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, the Belgian, the Netherlands and Luxembourgish {{governments in}} exile began formulating an {{agreement}} over {{the creation of}} a Benelux Customs Union. The agreement was signed in the London Customs Convention on 5 September 1944, just days before the Belgian government returned to Brussels after the liberation. The Benelux Customs Union was a major extension of a pre-war union between Belgium and Luxembourg, and would later <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the Benelux Economic Union after 1958.|$|E
5|$|In the Republic of Ireland, {{counties}} <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of {{the system}} of local government. Counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Tipperary have been broken up into smaller administrative areas. However, they are still treated as counties for cultural and some official purposes, for example postal addresses and by the Ordnance Survey Ireland. Counties in Northern Ireland are no longer used for local governmental purposes, but, as in the Republic, their traditional boundaries are still used for informal purposes such as sports leagues and in cultural or tourism contexts.|$|E
5|$|Objects {{connected}} with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> {{of much of}} current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and its art, which once competed with the culture of ancient Rome, but was eventually absorbed into it. The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave.|$|E

5|$|On 5 May 2011, The Guardian {{reported}} that Mills {{had met with}} officers from the London Metropolitan Police who showed her evidence, seized from private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, which could <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of a claim against the News of the World for breach of privacy over alleged phone hacking. Mills's name and private mobile phone number were listed in Mulcaire's notes {{along with those of}} her friends and associates. Mills later alleged that a journalist working for the Mirror Group had admitted to her in 2001 that he had hacked her phone.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} features of Golden Sun is the collection and manipulation of creatures called Djinn. The Djinn are scattered in hiding throughout the game; once found, they can be allocated to each character. They <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of the game's statistic enhancement, {{as well as the}} system that dictates the character's Psynergy capabilities. Attaching different Djinn to different characters modifies that character's character class, subsequently modifying hit points, Psynergy points, and other statistics, as well as determining what Psynergy the character is able to perform.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the North American Union exists only as a {{proposal}} contained in one of a thousand academic and/or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. Some of these papers, however, become touchstones for the conspiracy-minded and <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> {{of all kinds of}} unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantines {{took care}} to codify, {{preserve}} and pass on the lessons of warfare at land and sea from past experience, {{through the use of}} military manuals. Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts <b>form</b> <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> of our knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} {{of quantum mechanics}} to physical objects such as the electromagnetic field, which are extended in space and time, is known as quantum field theory.

Quantum field theories are also used throughout condensed matter physics to model particle-like objects called quasiparticles.|$|E
