40|$|Tax {{relief for}} child care expenses, {{encompassing}} the Child Care Tax Credit and Dependent Care Assistance Plans, is the largest federal government program in the United States aimed at helping families with child care. We examine the distributional effects of these policies among families with children using both the National Child Care Survey and tax return data. Among families that use tax relief, the benefits average 1. 24 percent of <b>family</b> <b>income.</b> <b>Benefits</b> {{as a percentage of}} income vary systematically over the income distribution. Despite being regressive at low income levels (mainly due to the credit being non-refundable), tax relief is progressively distributed over most of the income distribution with the ratio of benefits to income falling above the bottom quintile of the income distribution. The benefits of tax relief also vary among families with the same income depending on a family's structure and its labor market and child care choices. ...|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} whether {{money has}} a causal impact on children’s outcomes. There is abundant evidence that children {{growing up in}} lower income households do less well than their peers {{on a range of}} wider outcomes, including measures of health and education. But is money important in itself, or do these associations simply reflect other differences between richer and poorer households, such as levels of parental education or attitudes towards parenting? Children in low-income households do less well than their better-off peers on many outcomes in life, such as education or health, simply because they are poorer. While a parent's level of education, attitude towards bringing up children and other parental factors also have a bearing, research shows that having more money directly improves the development and level of achievement of children. Increases in <b>family</b> <b>income</b> substantially reduce differences in schooling outcomes and improve wider aspects of a child’s well-being. Cognitive development and school achievement were most improved by having more money.

The study gathered 163 addicts in treatment in a Psychosocial Care Center - Alcohol and other Drugs.

The data set employed (the Christchurch Health and Development Survey) includes a number of variables, from birth to age 18, not commonly available in economic data sets. The analysis uses binary choice models to {{examine the effect of}} ability factors and household economic constraints on the choice to remain at secondary school beyond post-compulsory levels at age 16. The study further uses binary and multinomial choice models to examine the determinants of participation in tertiary education, as opposed to engaging in labour supply, or unemployment at age 18. The study finally examines the determinants of the type of tertiary institution attended. The results show that participation in tertiary education depends on a combination of family resources, ability and prior achievement.

What is the nature of a fiscal incidence index on a budgetary basis versus a theoretically more satisfactory index that is welfare-based? Can we find budgetary based measures that will serve as a proxy for incidence in welfare terms? Does the structure of the family including the altruism of children affect incidence indexes? How should fiscal shifting of the subsidy for home care paid to the parents be defined, in budgetary or in welfare terms, and what does simulation tell us about the distribution of benefits between the generations? We address these issues analytically and with simulation (using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey) in this contribution to the study of fiscal incidence. The definition of welfare incidence, the comparison of welfare-based incidence with budgetary incidence for non-cooperative and cooperative families, and the calculation of the shifting of program benefits between family members, some of whom may be altruistic, are key issues in the analysis.
