25|$|In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 {{believed}} {{the answer to}} be no, 9 {{believed the}} answer <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> and 22 were unsure; 8 believed the question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.|$|E

25|$|Can {{this list}} be made shorter yet? Again the answer <b>is</b> <b>yes.</b> To begin with, {{some of the}} above laws are implied {{by some of the}} others. A {{sufficient}} subset of the above laws consists of the pairs of associativity, commutativity, and absorption laws, distributivity of ∧ over ∨ (or the other distributivity law—one suffices), and the two complement laws. In fact this is the traditional axiomatization of Boolean algebra as a complemented distributive lattice.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, 10 years later, {{the same}} poll was repeated. The number of {{researchers}} who answered was 151: 126 (83%) believed the answer to be no, 12 (9%) believed the answer <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> 5 (3%) believed the question may be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove, 8 (5%) said either don't know or don't care or don't want the answer to be yes nor the problem to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether P equals NP {{is one of the}} most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution. If the answer <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems. The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.|$|E

25|$|Decision {{problems}} {{are one of}} the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no, or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem {{can be viewed as a}} formal language, where the members of the language are instances whose output <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an algorithm, whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes, the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.|$|E
25|$|On August 15, 2016, Canadian Blood Services' new {{eligibility}} criteria for transgender people came into effect. This criteria states that transgender donors {{who have not}} had sex reassignment surgery will be asked questions based on their sex assigned at birth. They will be eligible to donate or be deferred based on these criteria. For example, trans women will be asked if they have had {{had sex with a}} man in the last 12 months. If the response <b>is</b> <b>yes,</b> they will be deferred for one year after their last sexual contact with a man. And donors who have had sex reassignment surgery will be deferred from donating blood for one year after their surgery. After that year, these donors will be screened in their affirmed gender.|$|E

The Super Bowl, the annual championship {{game of the}} National Football League, has been in recent years played on either the last Sunday of January or the first one of February. It is accompanied by heavy media attention and frequent gatherings {{all over the country}} to watch the game on television, accompanied with food and beverages purchased with money that might otherwise be spent on movie tickets. [...] "Does the Super Bowl affect ticket sales?" [...] asks Scott Gwin at Cinemablend.

[...] In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie.

500|$|Complaints {{about her}} role as fashion {{eminence}} grise are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. [...] "She's honest. She tells you what she thinks.

[...] "She lets you know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." [...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time.

Paul Rees from Q {{magazine}} complemented the track as a [...] "conventional rock song, filled with drama, darkness and surprises". USA Todays Edna Gunderson said that the [...] "funkified" [...] synth-pop of [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] attests to Madonna's [...] "undiminished" [...] skills as a shrewd pop composer. Yahoo! Music's Dan Genoe commented that Madonna has a personality crisis in the song. Jessica Winter from The Village Voice gave the song a mixed review, writing: [...] "It mutes slightly the slaphappy beats of Mirwais's own club hit [...] "Disco Science" [...] to make vague digs at the press and defensively vow self-improvement. Madonna's voice is mixed and diced into baby gurgles, {{which might have been}} cute if it weren't so redundant." [...] John Payne from LA Weekly deduced that even within the synth sounds of the song, he could see [...] "real feeling deeply ingrained in this particular icon. 'Why should I care what the world thinks of me?' That <b>is,</b> <b>yes,</b> she does care what the world thinks of her. She says she’ll just withdraw from the public eye, ’cause who needs this, huh?" [...] Conversely, Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, gave a negative review saying that [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] might be the silliest track that Madonna had ever recorded.|$|E
