40|$|Abstract- Odour, a {{perceptive}} term, can {{be looked}} at as information bound to molecules as information carriers. The quality of odour (as such) is therefore not accessible to the methodologies of natural science. The problematic nature of describing odours is mentioned. Based {{on the assumption that}} the pattern of activated brain neurons does not represent perception, one can conclude that everything we smell, touch, hear or see is but a human concept of what is there. Science activities connected to <b>fragrances</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> often lead to a question, the answer to which lies at the basis of any research made in this field: WHAT IS ODOUR? According to Webster's Dictionary odour is "that characteristic of a substance, which makes it perceptible to the sense of smell". Assuming that our human senses have the functions of information receivers- odour can therefore be looked upon as information received through our sense of smell. Since in our scientific world information is bound to information-carriers, the aroma-chemicals can be looked upon as odour information carriers. What we deal with- if we chemically transform or synthesize aroma chemicals- are th...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Plant {{essential}} oils {{are widely used}} as <b>fragrances</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours.</b> Therefore, the {{essential oils}} from the leaves of Cinnamomum pubescens Kochummen (CP) and the whole plant of Etlingera elatior (EE) were investigated for their antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical properties. RESULTS: CP and EE were found to contain appreciable levels of total phenolic contents (50. 6 and 33. 41 g kg− 1 as gallic acid equivalent) and total flavonoid contents (205. 6 and 244. 8 g kg− 1 as rutin equivalent), respectively. DPPH free radical scavenging activity of CP is superior to EE (P < 0. 05) showing IC 50 of 77. 2 and 995. 1 μgmL− 1, respectively. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcusaureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis,PseudomonasaeruginosaandSalmonellacholeraesuiswere tested againstCPand EE. Only MRSA was the most susceptible bacteria to CP. GC/MS studies resulted {{in the identification of}} 79 and 73 compounds in CP and EE, respectively. The most abundant components of EE included β-pinene (24. 92 %) and 1 -dodecene (24. 31 %). While the major compoundin CPwere 1, 6 -octadien- 3 -ol, 3, 7 -dimethyl (11. 55 %), cinnamaldehyde (56. 15 %) and 1 -phenyl-propane- 2, 2 -diol diethanoate (11. 38 %). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the essential oils from Cinnamomum pubescens Kochummen and Etlingera elatior could be potentially used as a new source of natural antioxidant and antibacterial in the food and pharmaceutical industries. c 2010 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{senses of}} {{taste and smell}} are the two least well understood of our senses. Recent advances {{in our understanding of}} the genetic and molecular mechanisms have led to increasing interest in olfaction and gustation. Amongst the practical applications of <b>fragrances</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavours</b> are commercial consumer products. The primary source for inspiration for these is nature and the work discussed in this thesis addresses methods for isolating selected aroma and taste molecules from natural sources, for use as new ingredients in food and fragrance applications. The methods are designed to deal with the challenges of isolating and identifying species present at very low concentrations (as low as parts per trillion), of unstable nature and with the desire to target specific functional groups. Carbonyl and thiol compounds have been selected for trapping due to their interesting fragrance and flavour characteristics respectively. A portable reactive trap has been designed, built, and tested to isolate aldehyde (or ketone) compounds from the headspace of living plants. The trap uses the derivatising reagent, 0 -(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride coated on to a solid sorbent, Tenax TA'-"'. Reagents with immobilised reactive groups capable of selective reacting with thiol compounds have been investigated and the proof of principle has been illustrated for three different methods. The nature identical status of the cooling compound, L-monomenthyl succinate, has been demonstrated by using highly sensitive and selective analytical techniques to identify this compound in the berries and leaves of plant Lycium barbarum. A preparative liquid chromatography system was used to simplify plant extracts which were subsequently analysed using nano liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-ESI-MS/MS). This system could be applied to the analysis of other natural source extracts. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceImperial Chemical Industries PLCGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|Tea {{leaves are}} {{harvested}} {{in the early}} spring and stored until the late summer when fresh jasmine flowers are in bloom. Jasmine flowers are picked early in the day when the small petals are tightly closed. The flowers are kept cool until nightfall. During the night jasmine flowers open, <b>and</b> release their <b>fragrance,</b> <b>and</b> this is when the tea scenting takes place. There are two main methods used to scent the tea with the jasmine. In one method the tea and flowers are placed in alternating layers; in the other, the tea is blended with jasmine flowers and stored overnight. It takes over four hours for the tea to absorb the <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> of the jasmine blossoms. The scenting process may be repeated as many as six or seven times for top grades such as Yin Hao. The tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers so it must be dried again to prevent spoilage.|$|R

The flowers are put in machines that control temperature and humidity. It takes about four hours for the tea to absorb the <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> of the jasmine blossoms. For the highest grades of jasmine tea, this process may be repeated up to seven times. As the tea absorbs moisture from the fresh Jasmine flowers, it must be refired to prevent spoilage.

Chemical processes allow continuous synthesis of so-called artificial or nature identical aroma compounds. Moreover biotechnology offers the possibility of the production of natural aroma compounds by enzymatic synthesis in systems free of additional organic solvents. Esters are a large group of flavours. They result from a reaction of an alcohol and an organic acid which can be enzymatically catalyzed by lipases. Here an integrated process of enzymatic esterification and pervaporation was developed. The reaction takes place in an excess of the reactant alcohol, used simultaneously as a solvent for the reaction. By means of pervaporation the produced water is separated from the mixture to shift the equilibrium reaction towards higher conversions. ...|$|R

30|$|Geranium (Pelargonium graveolens L.) is an {{aromatic}} crop, {{the shoot}} biomass of which, on steam distillation, yields an essential oil which {{is widely used}} in <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> industries. It is a vegetatively propagated (through rooted cutting) crop and is initially slow growing. The wide uncovered interspaces between the rows of geranium harbour {{a large number of}} weeds in the initial stage of crop growth resulting in suboptimal utilization of natural resources and inputs leading to yield losses and increased cost of cultivation (Rajeswara Rao et al. 1993). Crop diversification, following intercropping and agroforestry, has been reported to be a potential alternative for enhancing per capita (unit area and time) productivity in the context of shrinking land holding and increasing human and livestock population (Swaminathan 2001). Crop diversification increases resource use, reduces production cost, and improves or maintains soil quality in intensive agriculture systems (Andersen et al. 2004). Geranium cultivation provides income only once a year and the cultivation of some winter crops is sacrificed due to a long duration of this crop. In this context, inclusion of short duration, high value, and midseason income generating intercrops could be highly remunerative. Earlier studies on geranium-based intercropping indicated that the systems, besides being remunerative, maintain the soil quality (Verma et al. 2009).|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} survive in the environment, plants have adapted a number of {{strategies}} {{and one of them is}} the production of secondary metabolites (Zhao et al. 2005). The major active compounds in agarwood are phenylethyl chromones and sesquiterpenes, which are known to have analgesic and sedative effects (Okugawa et al. 2000; Ueda et al. 2006). Agarwood extracts are rich with numerous types of sesquiterpenes such as guaiene, eudesmane, agarospiral and jinkoh-eremol (Yagura et al. 2003; Naef 2011). Guaienes are a series of closely related natural chemical compounds that have been isolated from a variety of plant sources. α-Guaiene is the most common and was first isolated from guaiac wood oil from Bulnesia sarmienti Lorentz ex Griseb. (Bates and Slagel 1962). The guaienes are used in the <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavouring</b> industries to impart earthy, spicy aromas and tastes. In Aquilaria, guaiene synthesis has been shown to follow the general terpene synthesis pathway established in higher plants, i.e. the cytosolic mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway (Xu et al. 2003). From the building precursor isoprenoid, subsequent enzymatic reactions take place, converting the precursor into several intermediates. At the end of the downstream process, highly specialised enzymes categorised as terpene synthases (TPSs) transform the intermediates into various structural types of terpenoids. Several important terpenoids in modern medicines are also synthesised via similar pathway such as the antimalarial agent artemisin in Artemisia annua L. and the Indian ginseng withanolides in Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal (Rasool and Mohamed 2015).|$|R
40|$|<b>Fragrances</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavouring</b> {{substances}} {{are defined}} by their action on the human sense. The flavouring effect of a substance is determined by its impact on membrane receptors of the human gustatory and olfactory systems. The partial or complete saturation of these receptors provides the physiologic response to a flavouring agent. Fragrances may be natural, such as balsams, essential oil, concretes or absolutes, and synthetic. Because of {{the widespread use of}} the fragrances in a large variety of consumer products, ranging from foods to perfumes to cosmetics to skin products, it is important to examine the effects for humans due to exposure to these materials. Among the potential risks of the fragrances exposure, the genotoxic effect is of particular interest, considering that DNA-damage, at gene or chromosomal levels, can result in adverse effects, such as cancer and germ cell alteration. Also, the potential protective properties of the fragrances are of interest because of their widespread exposure and the easy availability. In our previous studies, the mutagenic (to define the safety profile) and antimutagenic, (to investigate the protective properties) activity of two natural <b>fragrances,</b> β-caryophyllene <b>and</b> β-caryophyllene oxide, and a synthetic one, α-hexyl cinnamaldheyde, has been investigated. All substances showed to possess interesting antimutagenic activity in our experiments, carried out by the Ames test. Preliminary study demonstrated that β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene oxide and α-hexyl cinnamaldheyde reduce the mutagenic effect of CSC (condensate smoke cigarettes). Moreover, β-caryophyllene was able to inhibit ethyl methanesulfonate-induced clastogenicity in cultured human lymphocytes (Micronucleus assay). Moreover, a previous published paper (Legault and Pichette, 2010. Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, 59 : 1643 – 1647) indicated that β-caryophyllene potentiated the anticancer activity of paclitaxel on MCF- 7, DLD- 1 and L- 929 cell lines. Furthemore, β-caryophyllene oxide has shown to induce the apoptosis in PC- 3 and MCF- 7 cells (Park et al., 2011. Cancer Letters 312 : 178 – 188). In line with these data, the aim of this research project is to study the potential anticancer activity of β-caryophyllene, β-caryophyllene oxide and α-hexyl cinnamaldheyde against different tumor cells. Also, the combination of these substances with anticancer agents will be investigated because they could work as synergist. Finally, the potential mechanism of action of these compounds will be examined...|$|R

40|$|Citrus {{essential}} oils (EO) are potential antimicrobials, first described as such in 1949 by Piacentini. Due to their acceptability {{in terms of}} <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> characteristics, they lend themselves to use both in food and in clinical practice. Lemon (Citrus limon) or sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) or bergamot (Citrus bergamia) {{essential oils}} and their components (limonene, linalool, citral, hersipidin and neoericitrin) and vapours at different temperatures and pHs were tested for their anti-microbial activity against vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis. Lemon essential oil alone or blended and orange EO alone were not as effective as citral or linalool alone or bergamot blends with inhibition diameters of > 9 cm. The ranges established for differences in inhibition of growth were; 5 - 15 °C, 20 - 25 °C, 30 - 45 °C and 50 °C (p ≤ 0. 005) and pHs 4. 5 - 6. 5, pH 7. 5, and pHs 8. 5 — 10. 5 (p ≤ 0. 001). A blend of 1 : 1 (v/v) orange/bergamot EO was the most effective with MICs at 25 °C and pH 5. 5 of 0. 25 % - 0. 5 % (v/v) and an MID of 50 mg/i at 50 °C at pH 7. 5, under these conditions viable counts were reduced by 5. 5 - 10 log 10 cfu/ml (p ≤ 0. 001). The mechanisms by which a blend of orange/bergamot EO and its vapour bring about their antimicrobial effect were assessed. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images established morphological changes as well as suggesting EO blend uptake into the cell. The permeability of the cell increased by x 2 after being subjected to the EO and by x 40 after exposure to the vapour. There were decreases of 1. 5 in intracellular pH, 20 a. u. in membrane potential and 18 pmol/mg protein of intracellular ATP. The application of the EO blend impregnated into wipes reduced surface microbial load of vancomycin resistant and vancomycin susceptible E. faecium and E. faecalis by up to 4 log 10 compared with control wipes (p ≤ 0. 00 1). The use of the EO blend vapour on surfaces resulted in a 2. 5 log 10 reduction over 24 hours, whilst the vapours (15 mg/L air) showed a microbial reduction of up to 4 log 10 on cucumber skin and lettuce leaf after 45 seconds exposure via a heat diffuser at 25 °C (p ≤ 0. 001).

In alcoholic beverages these compounds are produced by yeast during fermentation. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is one of the}} most extensively used species, other species of the Saccharomyces genus have become common in fermentation processes.

The global volatile compound analysis revealed that S. kudriavzevii produced large amounts of higher alcohols, whereas S. uvarum excelled in the production of acetate esters. Particularly from phenylalanine, S. uvarum produced the largest amounts of 2 -phenylethyl acetate, while S. kudriavzevii obtained the greatest 2 -phenylethanol formation from this precursor.

To trigger an immune response a compound (hapten) {{must be able to}} penetrate the skin, where it needs to be reactive enough to bind to proteins and form immunogenic complexes that are recognised as foreign. Electrophilicity has been identified as an important characteristic, which enables haptens to react with nucleophilic amino acids in proteins. In this thesis, a specific type of electrophiles, epoxides, have been investigated. Skin sensitising potencies related to physicochemical parameters have been investigated using structure-activity relationship (SAR) data. Studies on the formation of epoxides by abiotic (air oxidation) and biotic (metabolically in skin) activation from unsaturated compounds and the impact on the sensitising potency of such compounds were also performed. Cinnamic alcohol, a <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavouring</b> compound, is a well-known contact allergen. However, it lacks the necessary structural alerts to function as a hapten and must be activated to be able to act as a sensitiser. In this thesis, cinnamic alcohol was used to study the formation of allergenic oxidation products (i. e. epoxides) by air exposure and metabolically. The autoxidation study was performed to gain knowledge regarding stability of cinnamic alcohol upon air exposure, oxidation products and sensitising potencies. The sensitising potency (as examined by the murine local lymph node assay) of cinnamic alcohol after two weeks of air exposure was enhanced about four-fold. Two strongly sensitising compounds, epoxy cinnamic alcohol and cinnamic aldehyde, were detected in the formed oxidation mixture. Thus, for the first time, it was shown that cinnamic alcohol acts as a prehapten. The bioactivation of cinnamic alcohol, using human liver microsomes, resulted in the same oxidation products although the mechanism for their formation is completely different. In addition, epoxy cinnamic aldehyde was detected. Most likely, the two epoxides and cinnamic aldehyde are all contributing to the sensitising potency of cinnamic alcohol whether they are formed outside the skin or in the skin. Up to now, the contact allergenic effect seen from cinnamic alcohol has only been associated with cinnamic aldehyde formed as a metabolite from cinnamic alcohol. The present findings shed new light on the mechanism behind the allergenic effect of cinnamic alcohol and offer explanations to the many clinical cases of contact allergy to cinnamic alcohol not reacting to the aldehyde. Terminal epoxides are known contact sensitisers present in compounds used in epoxy resin systems (ERS). The most commonly used epoxy resin monomer (ERM), diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), is causing high rates of occupational contact allergy. Thus, it would be highly advantageous to replace this strongly sensitising compound with less hazardous alternatives, since even a single accidental exposure may induce primary sensitisation to ERM. In this thesis, specially-designed analogues of phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) and DGEBA, with terminal epoxides intact, were investigated. The results reveal that the design of series of well-defined compounds can give important insights into the SARs thereof and increased knowledge about the structural basis for sensitisation potential. It has been demonstrated, for the first time, how the chemical reactivity and the sensitising potency of terminal epoxides vary with the overall structure of the compound. Using this knowledge regarding SARs of terminal epoxides novel epoxy resin monomers with reduced sensitising potency were achieved for the first time without compromising the technical properties. By modifying the intrinsic reactivity of ERMs, the fundamental and underlying causes of contact allergy to ERS have been addressed. Using these modified analogues with reduced sensitising potency, in addition to regulations and protective clothing, would reduce occupational contact allergy in the future...|$|R
40|$|Different {{methods for}} quality {{assessment}} of separated andcommingled plastics from household and electronic waste havebeen developed. Especial {{attention has been}} given tospectroscopic methods since they are non-destructive andrequire little or no sample preparation at all. A wide variety of low molecular weight compounds have beenidentified in recycled polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylenefrom hard packaging waste by gas chromatography- massspectroscopy (GC-MS) after microwave assisted extraction (MAE). Low molecular weight substances such as alcohols, esters,ketones <b>and</b> <b>fragrance</b> <b>and</b> <b>flavour</b> compounds were detected inthe recycled resins. The major category of compounds identifiedin the virgin resins is conformed by aliphatic hydrocarbonssuch as alkanes and alkenes. It was found that theconcentration of aromatic hydrocarbons without functionalgroups, e. g. ethylbenzene and xylenes in recycled HDPE wasapprox. 5 times higher and equal to 120 and 35 ppb,respectively. The potential of near infrared (NIR) and Fourier transformRaman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy in combination with multivariateanalysis as a rapid, non-destructive and accurate analyticalmethod has been studied and the feasibility of these methodsfor at/in line characterisation of several properties ofrecyclates has also been explored. NIR in diffuse reflectance mode has been successfully usedfor quantification of antioxidants in polyethylene, thestandard error of prediction is almost comparable to the errorof wet methods, i. e., extraction plus liquid chromatography. The error of prediction of this method is 35 ppm for Irganox 1010 and 68 ppm for Irgafos 168. The inaccuracy in thequantification of Irgafos 168 {{is due to the fact}} that thisantioxidant degrades during polymer processing. NIR and Mid-infrared (Mid-IR) worked well for fastdetermination of molecular weight and crystallinity of therecycled HDPE and acceptable errors of prediction, comparableto that of the reference methods, i. e. size exclusionchromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) have been obtained. The present thesis also shows that NIR and Raman are goodcandidates for in/on line compositional analysis of mixedpolymer fractions from recycled plastic waste. Diffusereflectance NIR allows a rapid and reliable measurement ofpellets and requires no previous sample preparation. Thecomposition of binary blends can be determined with highaccuracy. The PP content in the PP/HDPE blends was predictedwith a RMSEP equal to 0. 46 %w in the 0 - 15 %wt region and theRMSEP for PP in the PP/ABS blends was 0. 3 %wt. The thermal and thermoxidative stability of recycled PP,HDPE and a 20 / 80 PP/HDPE blend subjected to multiple extrusionhave been studied by DSC, thermal analysis (TGA) andchemiluminiscence (CL). A decrease in Toxand OIT was observed after each extrusion step. The drop in OIT was sharper after the first two extrusions. TheOIT values produced by DSC and CL were in good agreement. However, CL provided more information about the oxidationprocess taking place in the blends. The moisture content in recycled polyamide 6, 6 was readilydetermined by NIR in transmission mode and it could bepredicted with a RMSEP = 0. 05 %wt. The accuracy of the methodappeared to be as good as that of the more time consumingthermal methods such as TGA, DSC and loss on dry (LOD), whichwere used as reference methods. The influence of differentamounts of water on the viscoelastic properties of nylon hasbeen investigated.
