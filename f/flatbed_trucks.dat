25|$|After {{outlying}} villages fell to precision {{air strikes}} on key {{command and control}} centers, approximately 5,000-12,000 Taliban combatants as well as members of al-Qaeda and other foreign fighters began to withdraw towards Kunduz to regroup, travelling in pickup trucks, SUVs and <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> fitted with ZU-23-2's (anti-aircraft guns modified for ground combat). By sunset, the Taliban forces had retreated {{to the north and}} east. Some feared that they were massing for a counter-offensive. It was later estimated that 400-600 people died in the battle, although {{it was not possible to}} separate civilian and combatant deaths. Approximately 1,500 Taliban were captured or defected.|$|E
500|$|While the Bonfires of the 1960s were {{constructed}} in {{five to ten}} days, working primarily in daylight, by the late 1970s, changes in the school led to a more elaborate and lengthy construction schedule. Construction began in late October with [...] "Cut", obtaining wood by cutting down trees with axes, which took several weekends. After Cut, students brought the logs to campus during [...] "Load", a {{process by which the}} logs were loaded by hand onto <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> and brought to campus. In early November, crews began [...] "Stack", a three-week period in which the logs were wired together and Bonfire took shape. Near the end of stack, known as [...] "Push", students worked around the clock in rotating shifts. The first four of the six stacks were built with the efforts of all safety-trained participants. The day before Bonfire was scheduled to burn, junior redpots would build the fifth stack, and then senior redpots would build the sixth.|$|E

In {{preparation for the}} opening, Hirshhorn curators and staff spend several months scrupulously planning the locations of artworks, both indoors and outdoors. Lightweight foam-core [...] "dummy" [...] sculptures are used to resolve the final placement of works in the garden. The originals, many {{of which had been}} airlifted from Hirshhorn's Connecticut estate onto <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> for transport, are put into place in the weeks before the opening.|$|E

2500|$|The railway was {{required}} because {{the core of}} the Caban-coch, Pen-y-garreg and Craig-goch dams were built from large irregular stone blocks ("plums") embedded in concrete. The rock was mined locally from Cigfran and Craig-cnwch quarries by the Elan River and the Aberdeuddwr quarry on Cerrig Gwynion, just to the south of Rhayader. The shaped stones were hauled by locomotive to the dam sites on <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks.</b> They were then lowered into place by steam crane. The central cores of the dams were encased with a [...] concrete lining. The outside walls were faced with cut stone brought from quarries at Llanelwedd near Builth Wells and Pontypridd. The cement, which was made near Chatham in Kent, was sent by sea to Aberystwyth and brought by railway to the Elan Valley.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, as the U.S. forces {{wanted to}} {{question}} the captured foreign fighters about possible links with the al-Qaeda international jihadist network, the Afghans decided to transfer such prisoners to Qala-i-Jangi ("the war fortress" [...] in Persian), a 19th-century fortress near Mazar-i-Sharif that Dostum had previously used as his headquarters and ammunition depot. On November 24, between 300 and 500 foreign suspects were transported on <b>flatbed</b> <b>trucks</b> to the fortress, now turned into a prison. The prisoners had not been searched, and some had concealed weapons during the surrender. On {{the day of the}} surrender, two prisoners committed suicide with grenades and killed one of Dostum's commanders and some others in two separate incidents at the makeshift prison. Despite the deaths, the National Islamic Movement militia did not reinforce security at the prison. John Kerry's report for the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations later alleged it was a pre-planned [...] "Trojan Horse" [...] style operation, a gambit that would allow a die-hard force of foreign fighters to take over a strategically important fortified position at Qala-i-Jangi and capture a massive munitions stockpile.|$|E
