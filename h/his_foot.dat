5|$|A {{handful of}} days before the Sugar Bowl, Tech wide {{receiver}} Ricky Hall broke a bone in <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> during practice and was considered unlikely to play. Hall was Tech's second-leading receiver, having caught 25passes for 398yards and three touchdowns. In addition, Hall was the Hokies' starting punt returner, and had returned 40kicks for 510yards and one touchdown, setting a school record for punt return yardage.|$|E
5|$|Australia had injury {{concerns}} to key players {{ahead of the}} tour. Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack, and he only made the trip after a 3–2 vote by a medical panel, despite {{being one of the}} first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon. In addition, <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action. The injury was worked on ahead of the tour, while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action. The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled, and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied. Bradman's counsel was effective, as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour.|$|E

5000|$|Groberg {{really did}} have rats eat the soles of <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> while he slept. When he awoke that morning, they split open, {{and the members of}} his branch helped treat <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> He spent time outside with <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> pointed up at the sun in order to sear the soles of <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> with the heat from the sun. Later in life, he was {{diagnosed}} with skin cancer on the soles of <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> due to exposure to the sun. His doctor was puzzled about how he could have exposed the soles of <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> to the sun. Groberg responded to his doctor, [...] "Have I got a story to tell you..." ...|$|R

Shogun Yoshiie is left with now wanting the head of Iehira.|$|R
5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> gets {{caught in a}} rope that lifts {{him up to the}} fly space above the stage. When <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will be crushed, uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, 2014, the Toronto Maple Leafs signed Booth to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} worth $1.1 million.

Booth would break <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> shortly afterwards and miss the opening few months of the season.|$|E

5|$|After he {{announced}} {{the building of}} the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got off to a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to <b>his</b> <b>foot,</b> when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|As James and Scamper {{entered the}} arena that night, Scamper caught his bridle {{on the side}} of the gate, dislodging the Chicago screws. With no screws, the headstall broke loose from the bridle after she made the turn around the first barrel. When she strove for the second barrel, the bridle was hanging from the horse's mouth to down under <b>his</b> <b>foot.</b> Meanwhile, she is trying to hold that bit in his mouth. But coming to the third barrel, she has to turn his head loose.|$|E

The lobby card for this cartoon also doesn't have the paw pads on <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{the final}} {{was held in}} England, at Wembley, Liverpool were clear favourites to retain the European Cup. Brugge were without {{a number of key}} players, such as Raoul Lambert, whose {{inclusion}} in the Brugge squad was rumoured before the final but never materialised. Liverpool were also without a few players. Tommy Smith, who had scored in the previous season's final, was out after dropping a pick-axe on <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> and breaking a toe. Striker David Johnson was also absent. He had strained knee ligaments during a match against Leicester City, an injury that ruled him out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Barton {{stayed on}} with Newcastle United {{after they were}} relegated to the Championship, playing six out of Newcastle's opening eight league matches, but {{suffered}} an injury to <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> in a 3–1 win against Plymouth Argyle on 19 September. He returned in April for Newcastle, playing all nine of Newcastle's remaining league fixtures and scoring his only goal of the campaign from a free kick in a win over Peterborough United. Due to the form of Danny Guthrie and Kevin Nolan, Barton had to play left wing when he returned.|$|E
5|$|California Chrome {{returned}} to Los Alamitos, where Sherman's crew treated the wound for about 10 days. After that, they sent California Chrome to Harris Farms {{where he was}} turned out on pasture. By early July, <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> was fully healed, he had gained weight, and Sherman was pleased enough with his recovery that he brought the colt back to Los Alamitos to resume training on July 17, two weeks earlier than anticipated.|$|E

Fleeing from the attacking Aliens, Christie is injured and <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> is snagged by an Alien. He saves Vriess by detaching himself, allowing Christie to fall into the water below, sacrificing himself.|$|E
5|$|Considered the top {{high school}} player in the country, Bradley {{initially}} chose to attend Duke University {{in the fall of}} 1961. However, after breaking <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> in the summer of 1961 during a baseball game and thinking about his college decision outside of basketball, Bradley decided to enroll at Princeton due to its record in preparing students for government or United States Foreign Service work. He had been awarded a scholarship at Duke, but not at Princeton; the Ivy League does not allow its members to award athletic scholarships, and Bradley's family's wealth disqualified him from receiving financial aid.|$|E
5|$|During summer 1797, Coleridge {{spent time}} with many of his friends, {{including}} John Thelwall, William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Charles Lamb, Thomas Poole, and his wife Sara Fricker.

As a result, he was left alone at Poole's property underneath a lime tree, while Lamb, the Wordsworths and his wife went on a journey across the Quantocks.|$|E

5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million. The deal {{was considered to be}} worth less than he could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on <b>his</b> <b>foot</b> while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E
5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans.
