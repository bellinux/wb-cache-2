5|$|Delta Squad {{kills the}} Riftworm {{before it can}} sink Jacinto {{and returns to the}} surface. They are ordered to {{investigate}} a nearby abandoned COG outpost where they encounter experimented creatures of unknown origin and learn of a back door entrance to the Hollow in the nearby Kadar Mountains. They find prisoner cages and Dom convinces Marcus that Maria (Dom's wife) must be <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of them. They manage to find her, but the Locust imprisonment and torture has left her severely disfigured and traumatized, unable to communicate. Faced with the nigh-vegetative state Maria is in, Dom tearfully chooses to euthanize her. Marcus and Dom then charge into the Locust stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Improvements to {{artillery}} technology necessitated {{significant changes}} to the fort's structure {{towards the end of}} the 19th century and the start of the 20th. Closely packed casemates of the type built at Coalhouse Fort were vulnerable to new and more powerful types of explosive shells. To alleviate this threat, massive concrete traverses were constructed in the 1880s to isolate each casemate, preventing a shell bursting <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> casemate from affecting its neighbours and causing a cumulative explosion. The construction of concrete gun emplacements on the fort's roof necessitated the installation of circular concrete pillars within the casemates to support the extra weight on the roof. The ammunition lifts were also extended to serve the new roof-mounted guns.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were shot in a cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside {{the house in the}} same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E
5|$|Regarding {{the aerial}} imagery that the U.S. report said {{suggested}} a lower death toll, the South Korean investigators, drawing on accounts from survivors and area residents, {{said that at}} least 62 bodies had been taken away by relatives, or buried in soldiers' abandoned foxholes, {{in the first days}} after the killings, and others remained <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> underpass tunnel, under thin layers of dirt, out of sight of airborne cameras, and awaiting later burial in mass graves. In addition, South Korean military specialists questioned the U.S. reconnaissance photos, pointing out irregularities, including the fact that the No Gun Ri frames had been spliced into the roll of film, raising the possibility that they were not, as claimed, from August 6, 1950, eight days after the killings.|$|E
5|$|The America's Response Monument, a life-and-a-half scale bronze statue {{commemorating the}} actions of U.S. Special Operations Forces {{in the first few}} weeks of the War in Afghanistan, was {{unveiled}} to the public during the Veteran's Day Parade in New York City on November 11, 2011. The statue was displayed on a float, which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan. It was temporarily located in the West Street Lobby <b>inside</b> <b>One</b> World Financial Center in New York City opposite Ground Zero.|$|E

Quatermass joins Broadhead on an official tour of the complex, which he is told has been built to manufacture artificial food. Slipping away from the visiting party, Broadhead attempts to get <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the large domes that dominate the skyline. Quatermass later finds him dying, covered in a poisonous black slime.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy {{conducted}} two inquiries {{into the}} reasons for the ship's quick demise. The first, held soon after the ship's loss, concluded that Hoods aft magazine had exploded after one of Bismarcks shells penetrated the ship's armour. A second inquiry was held after complaints that the first board had failed to consider alternative explanations, such as an explosion of the ship's torpedoes. It was more thorough than the first board and concurred with the first board's conclusion. Despite the official explanation, some historians continued to believe that the torpedoes caused the ship's loss, while others proposed an accidental explosion <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the ship's gun turrets that reached down into the magazine. Other historians have concentrated on the cause of the magazine explosion. The discovery of the ship's wreck in 2001 confirmed the conclusion of both boards, although the exact reason the magazines detonated is likely to remain unknown since that area of the ship was destroyed in the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{reception}} to Galaxy Game, Pitts and Tuck started work on an expanded prototype. For the second machine, they built a full blue fiberglass casing for the consoles, improved the quality of the joysticks {{with the help of a}} machine shop, and modified the computer with a newer display processor to support up to four games at once on different monitors—either multiple simultaneous separate games or up to four players playing the same game on two screens. They also placed the PDP-11 <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the consoles rather than in a separate location. While the original plan had been to work on driving down the development costs after the initial prototype, the popularity of the game convinced the pair to instead focus on making a better machine that could run multiple games to recoup the upfront investment. The new version was installed in a cafe in the student union building in June 1972, though with only two monitors due to space restrictions. The original Galaxy Game prototype was displayed at several locations around the area, but was not as successful as it had been at the student union building. By the time the second prototype was completed the pair had spent US$65,000 on the project and had no feasible way of making up the cost with the machine or commercial prospects for a wider release. Pitts later explained that he and Tuck had been focused on the engineering and technical challenges of producing a faithful coin-operated Spacewar game and paid little attention to the business side of the project; he felt that Computer Space had been more commercially successful because Bushnell had focused more on the business side of his idea than the technical.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2008 at Survivor Series, Edge {{returned}} to WWE after an introduction by SmackDown General Manager and his on-screen wife Vickie Guerrero, replacing Jeff Hardy in the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship involving champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov. He pinned Triple H to become the WWE Champion {{for the third time}} in his career. The following month, Edge lost the title to Hardy at Armageddon in a Triple Threat match, which also featured Triple H. At the Royal Rumble, however, Edge regained the title in a no disqualification match, following Matt Hardy's interference. At the February event No Way Out, Edge lost the WWE title in an Elimination Chamber after being pinned by Jeff Hardy, being the first to be eliminated, with the title eventually being won by Triple H. Later that night, Edge inserted himself into the World Championship Elimination Chamber match after attacking Kofi Kingston and barricading himself <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the Chamber's pods, proceeding to win his eighth World Championship, last eliminating Rey Mysterio and taking the title over to SmackDown. At WrestleMania XXV in April, Edge lost the championship to John Cena in a Triple Threat match, which also included The Big Show. Three weeks later he regained the championship at Backlash, when he defeated Cena in a Last Man Standing match, after interference by The Big Show. After a successful defense against Jeff Hardy at Judgment Day, he lost the title to Hardy at Extreme Rules in a ladder match, and afterwards said some disparaging things to his on-screen wife, Vickie Guerrero. While Hardy was celebrating, CM Punk cashed in his money in the bank and defeated Hardy to win the World Heavyweight Championship. The following night, Guerrero resigned as the Raw General Manager due to being humiliated, and Edge came out to apologize. Instead, however, he claimed he married Guerrero because she had authoritative powers as the General Manager, and sought a divorce.|$|E
5|$|R.C. MacLeod listed another tradition, {{somewhat}} {{similar to the}} one that appeared in c.1800 manuscript. According to this version, a MacLeod joined a Crusading army, and went to the Holy Land. While in the desert-wilderness, he came across a witch, from whom he managed to escape. He then came upon a river, and proceeded to cross it at a ford. However, a fairy maiden appeared from the water and blocked his passage. After a struggle, MacLeod overcame the fairy and passed over the river. He then became friends with her. Before they parted, the fairy maiden gave him a box of scented wood; this box, she told him, held several other smaller boxes, which fitted <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> another. She told him that the innermost box contained a magic banner, which when waved would bring forth a host of armed men to aid its owner. The fairy warned the MacLeod, that if he were to open the box within a year and a day from then, that no crops would grow on his land, no livestock would be born, as well as no children. When the MacLeod returned home he gave the box to the chief's wife. The wife, however, ignored the MacLeod's warning, and opened the box. Immediately a host of armed men appeared and that year, no children were born. The tradition concluded that ever since that time, the flag had been preserved for a time when such an army might mean salvation for the clan.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} Jason Wade in the driver's {{seat of a}} car, with {{the other members of}} Lifehouse in the car with him. The traffic is at a stand still in a tunnel, as a swarm of people have {{abandoned}} their vehicles and are walking through. Wade and the band members get out of the car, and begin walking in the opposite direction of the crowd {{to the other side of}} the tunnel. Wade pushes through the people, who are in a rush to get to the entrance of the tunnel and is constantly focused on his destination to get to the end. When he reaches the tunnel's end, he sees the wreckage of a car crash with firefighters and paramedics cleaning up the mess. Wade then sees a girl observing what appears to be herself, dead <b>inside</b> <b>one</b> of the crashed car. He then looks to the left, and sees an old man observing himself, dead on the ground. As Wade looks into the other car, he sees himself, also seemingly dead. Upon this, Wade frantically runs back into the tunnel towards his car. Then he sees himself in the car with the band members, however everyone seems to be frozen as he bangs on the windows. Suddenly Wade is inside the car again, and a police officer comes to the window, motioning him to continue driving, since he is stopped in the middle of the tunnel for no apparent reason.|$|E
