40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> {{and the blood}} proteinogram of ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), vaccinated against Newcastle disease, during breeding season. Eighty adult birds (52 to 60 week-old) were distributed into four different groups: G 1 - vaccinated with NDV Ulster 2 C strain, G 2 - vaccinated with NDV B 1 strain, G 3 - vaccinated with NDV LaSota strain and G 4 -not vaccinated (control). The <b>immune</b> <b>response</b> was evaluated by the HI test. The blood proteingram of these birds also determined.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{investigated}} {{the interplay between}} complement and antibodies upon priming with single-cycle replicating viral vectors (SCIV) encoding SIV antigens combined with Adeno 5 -SIV or SCIV pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus envelope boosting strategies.

Results Independent of the application regimen or route, viral loads were significantly reduced after challenge with SIVmac 239 (p Conclusion The heterologous prime-boost strategy with replication-deficient viral vectors administered exclusively via the tonsils did not induce any neutralizing antibodies before challenge.

40|$|Understanding the {{regulation}} of antibody production and B-cell memory formation and function is core to finding new treatments for B-cell-derived cancers, antibody-mediated autoimmune disorders and immunodeficiencies. Progression from {{a small number of}} antigen-specific B-cells to the production {{of a large number of}} antibody-secreting cells is tightly regulated. Although much progress has been made in revealing the transcriptional regulation of B-cell differentiation that occurs during <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> there are still many questions that remain unanswered. Recent work on the expression and roles of histone modifiers in lymphocytes has begun to shed light on this additional level of regulation.

40|$|We {{tested the}} concept of {{combining}} DNA with protein to improve anti-HIV Env systemic and mucosal <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses.</b> Rhesus macaques were vaccinated with DNA, DNA&protein co-immunization or DNA prime followed by protein boost, and the magnitude and mucosal dissemination of the antibody responses were monitored in both plasma and mucosal secretions. We achieved induction of robust humoral responses by optimized DNA vaccination delivered by in vivo electroporation. These responses were greatly increased upon administration of a protein boost. Importantly, a co-immunization regimen of DNA&protein injected in the same muscle {{at the same time}} induced the highest systemic binding and neutralizing antibodies to homologous or heterologous Env as well as the highest Env-specific IgG in saliva. Inclusion of protein in the vaccine resulted in more immunized animals with Env-specific IgG in rectal fluids. Inclusion of DNA in the vaccine significantly increased the longevity of systemic <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses,</b> whereas protein immunization, either as the only vaccine component or as boost after DNA prime, was followed by a great decline of <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> overtime.

40|$|Chronic nasal {{carriage}} of {{the bacterium}} Staphylococcus aureus {{in patients with}} the autoimmune disease granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is {{a risk factor for}} disease relapse. To date, it was neither known whether GPA patients show similar <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to S. aureus as healthy carriers, nor whether specific S. aureus types are associated with GPA. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> of GPA patients against S. aureus antigens in relation to the genetic diversity of their nasal S. aureus isolates. A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 85 GPA patients and 18 healthy controls (HC). <b>Humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> against S. aureus were investigated by determining serum IgG levels against 59 S. aureus antigens. Unexpectedly, patient sera contained lower anti-staphylococcal IgG levels than sera from HC, regardless of the patients' treatment, while total IgG levels were similar or higher. Furthermore, 210 S. aureus isolates obtained from GPA patients were characterized by different typing approaches. This showed that the S. aureus population of GPA patients is highly diverse and mirrors the general S. aureus population. Our combined findings imply that GPA patients are less capable of mounting a potentially protective antibody response to S. aureus than healthy individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a successful vaccine against HIV is likely to require the induction of strong and long-lasting <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> at the mucosal portal of virus entry. Hence, {{the design of a}} vaccine strategy able to induce mucosal antibodies and in particular specific IgA, may be crucial to providing immune protection. Nasal immunisation is known to induce specific IgG and IgA responses in the cervicovaginal mucosa; however, there is an urgent need for the {{development of}} safe, effective and accessible mucosal adjuvants for nasal application in humans. To reduce the potential for adverse events associated with some nasal adjuvants, we have assessed whether the B-cell-activating cytokines APRIL, BAFF and TSLP enhance <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> to HIV- 1 gp 140. Following intranasal immunisation, TSLP but not APRIL or BAFF induced strong humoral responses both in serum and mucosa. The adjuvant effect of TSLP on humoral responses was similar to that of cholera toxin (CT). The use of TSLP as an adjuvant skewed both the cellular and <b>humoral</b> <b>immune</b> <b>responses</b> towards Th 2 cells.

50|$|The antibody-dependent cell-mediated {{cytotoxicity}} (ADCC), {{also referred}} to as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies.
