5|$|On 20 September, German General Otto Liman von Sanders, the {{commander}} of the Yildirim Army Group, ordered Samakh's German and Ottoman garrison to prepare a strong rearguard defence of the town. By dawn on 25 September, when a regiment and two squadrons of the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade attacked Samakh, the rearguard was strongly entrenched. The assault, which began with a mounted cavalry charge, ended two hours later after close quarter fighting in the village and the railway station. After fierce fighting with bayonets and swords, <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room in the railway buildings, the town was captured. This victory, which captured the centre of the rearguard line, concluded the Battle of Sharon section of the Battle of Megiddo and opened the way for the cavalry pursuit to Damascus, which was captured on 1 October. By the time the Armistice of Mudros between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire was signed at the end of October, Aleppo had been captured and fighting was in progress further north.|$|E

In the first floor living room space, these patterns echo in art glass doors of the bookcase, built into the prow. Above the mantel-less fireplace, a mural by illustrator Charles Livingston Bull depicts Louisiana herons flying before a lake scene. A wood decoration of semicircular design, decorated with art glass and sawed wood decoration, partially frames the painted scene.|$|E

Its cause is unknown, but its spread is blamed on de Montferrand. The architect was being hurried by the Tsar for an early completion, so he used wooden materials where stone would have been better. Additionally, between the hurriedly built wooden partition walls disused fireplaces were concealed; their chimneys, coupled with the narrow ventilation shafts, acted as flues for the fire, allowing it to spread undetected between the walls <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room {{until it was too}} late to extinguish.|$|E

Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, they laughed in astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr!

[...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers.

500|$|... "Don't Rush" [...] is {{a country}} song written by Blu Sanders, Natalie Hemby and Lindsay Dawn Chapman, and {{produced}} by Dann Huff. It features American country singer-songwriter Vince Gill. The song {{is set in a}} [...] "drowsy, take-it-easy beat" [...] which is composed of a layer of Clarkson's and Gill's soulful harmonies. The song begins with a breezy soft-rock tune. In the first verse, Clarkson sings [...] "I see the way you’re looking at me / Baby know I’m feeling it too / We can just light up every candle / Move <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room" [...] which was ensued by the sound of Gill's guitar. As the song launches into the chorus, both Clarkson and Gill are heard singing [...] "Stopping every minute just because you're in it/Wishing everyday was Sunday, you're right next to me/It's how it's supposed to be", a vocal chorus deemed as [...] "slightly awkward" [...] by Will Hermes of Rolling Stone.

500|$|West, who had {{previously}} recorded at Avex for 808s & Heartbreak, block-booked the studio's three session rooms simultaneously for 24 {{hours a day to}} work on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. According to Noah Callahan-Bever, who visited West during the recording sessions, [...] "when he hits a creative wall... he heads to another studio room to make progress on another song". West never slept a full night at the [...] "glass-enclosed mansion" [...] house he had rented, opting instead to take power naps in a studio chair or couch 90 minutes at a time. Engineers worked around the clock, as West bounced <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room. This assiduous work ethic led to West employing two private chefs, one for hot food, and one for cold food.Before recording in the afternoon, West and most of his crew played games of 21 against locals at the Honolulu YMCA for leisure. Kid Cudi smoked marijuana in preparation and worked out on a treadmill, while RZA worked out in the weight room. West held breakfast each morning at his Diamond Head residence for his crew.|$|E
500|$|Grohl and Jones {{produced}} the record across {{a period of}} one week in October 1994, with Grohl on vocals and all instruments. Both would arrive {{in the morning at}} Robert Lang Studios, start production by noon and do four songs a day. According to Grohl, during the recording process he would run <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room, [...] "still sweating and shaking from playing drums and [...] pick up the guitar and put down a track, do the bass, maybe another guitar part, have a sip of coffee and then go in and do the next song". The only performance by an outsider was a guitar part on [...] "X-Static" [...] provided by Greg Dulli of The Afghan Whigs, who was watching Grohl record the songs. Grohl eventually asked him if he wanted to play and handed him a guitar. Each song took about 45 minutes to be completed, and the compositions were recorded in the same order that became the album's track listing. The only song that required two run-throughs before completion was [...] "I'll Stick Around". Grohl was insecure about his singing, and added effects to his voice in [...] "Floaty", and tried to enhance the performance through double track – [...] "You know how people double their vocals to make them stronger? That album the vocals are quadrupled." ...|$|E
500|$|Whedon used {{a variety}} of cinematographic {{techniques}} to achieve the dreamlike quality of [...] "Restless". He used tracking shots with a Steadicam to follow the characters from place to place, creating a flow in the way of real dreams, where there are no logical connections between places and things. In Giles' dream, he walks from a carnival grounds into Spike's crypt, then through a corridor and straight into The Bronze, three locations not related to one another. Whedon was able to do this by simply having actor Anthony Stewart Head walk through the sets as they were built; this effortlessly created a sense of dreamlike dislocation. Another example of this occurs when, in Xander's dream, he walks {{from the front of the}} moving ice cream van towards the back, crawls up and over some boxes, through a window, and drops into his basement. In the theater scene during Willow's dream, a Frazier lens was used to provide a large depth of field, allowing both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same time, while in Xander's dream, as he moves <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room in Buffy's house to the university dorm rooms, Whedon used a 17mm lens to give a sense of motion as the camera passes by walls. Whedon also used unusual framing for shots, often leaving much of the frame empty, with a character being placed near the bottom or off to the side. The scenes in Spike's crypt, part of Giles' dream, were shot in black-and-white to emphasize that Spike is seen as [...] "an old 30s movie villain".|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{scored the}} game 7.2 out of 10.

[...] He was also critical of the creature design, which he felt was [...] "largely recycled from last year's game, which is disappointing. The way the monsters in the last game were based on various methods of execution was interesting, but retrofitting them to fit Baltimore street crime seems cheap." [...] He concluded [...] "The Suffering: Ties That Bind has its moments, {{but most of these}} moments are the same sorts of moments that you saw in last year's game. If you're a fan of the previous game and you're looking for more of the same, Ties That Bind fits the bill, but more expansion on the themes of the first game would have made for a much more interesting final product." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{continuing}} to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly {{at the turn}} of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows. The result could be seen, as one reviewer said, [...] "as a thoughtful meditation on the nature of occupancy within a domestic environment, exactingly rendered in multiple paint layers." ...|$|E

Most of these recordings remain unreleased and unheard by the public. Some of the material {{has been described as}} [...] "schizophrenia on tape," [...] and [...] "intensely personal songs of gentle humanism and strange experimentation, which reflected on his then-fragile emotional state." [...] Beach Boys archivist Alan Boyd observed: [...] "A lot of the music that Brian was creating during this period was full of syncopated exercises and counterpoints piled on top of jittery eighth-note clusters and loping shuffle grooves. You get hints of it earlier in things like the tags to 'California Girls,' 'Wouldn't It Be Nice' and all throughout Smile, but it takes on an almost manic edge in the '70s." [...] Brian's daughter Wendy remembers, [...] "Where other people might take a run to release some stress, he would go to the piano and write a 5-minute song."

2500|$|In 1838, Njegoš hosted Saxon King Frederick Augustus II, a keen naturalist who {{had come}} to Montenegro to study the country's diverse flora. The king was housed at the Cetinje Monastery, and Njegoš was forced to move <b>from</b> <b>room</b> <b>to</b> room to {{accommodate}} him. Displeased by this state of affairs, and irritated by German press reports that described Montenegro as [...] "primitive", Njegoš ordered the construction of a secular dwelling that was to serve as both a royal palace and seat of government. Designed by Ozeretskovsky, the residence was a long, two-storied stone building with twenty-five rooms nestled behind a fortified wall and flanked by defensive towers at all four corners. Located just northeast of the Cetinje Monastery, and facing east towards Constantinople, it was soon dubbed the Biljarda, after the central room on the second floor which contained a billiard table that Njegoš had ordered transported to Montenegro from the Adriatic coast. The residence was within view of an unfinished stone watchtower intended to protect the monastery from cannon fire and whose construction had begun five years earlier, in 1833. When Njegoš realized that its location was unsuitable for a fortress, he ordered that its construction be abandoned, and it was converted into a tower where the heads of decapitated Turkish warriors were impaled on spears and left exposed to the elements. Turkish heads had previously been impaled beside the monastery walls. Dubbed the Tablja, the tower was meant to rival Ali Pasha's citadel in Mostar, where the severed heads of four to five Serbs were displayed at any given time. John Gardner Wilkinson, an English traveler and Egyptologist, saw the Tablja while visiting Cetinje in 1844. He noted the [...] "acrid stench" [...] that the structure exuded and recalled how dogs would tear pieces of flesh and bone away from the rotting heads and drag them across Cetinje. Wilkinson met with both Njegoš and Ali Pasha on separate occasions {{over the course of his}} travels and attempted to persuade them to cease beheading their prisoners. Njegoš agreed in principle, but maintained that ceasing to sever the heads of Turkish warriors would be perceived as [...] "weakness" [...] and serve only to invite attack. Ali Pasha objected along similar lines and said that he doubted the good faith of the Montenegrins, whom he claimed were known for their [...] "wanton cruelty".|$|E
