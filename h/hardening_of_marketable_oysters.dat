40|$|Three {{experiments}} (E 1, E 2, and E 3) {{were carried}} out in Mossoró, Brazil, to evaluate baby corn yield, green ear yield, and grain yield, respectively, of two corn hybrids (AG 1051 and BRS 2020), in response to detasseling (with or without tassel). A randomized split-plot block design (with hybrids defined as plots) and ten replicates was used. The three experiments were planted {{on the same day}} and in neighboring areas. In the three experiments, the hybrids did not differ from each other on the dry matter mass and number of tassel branches. In E 1 (baby corn production at 180 thousand plants ha- 1), for both hybrids, the following effects were observed due to detasseling: a) an increase in ear total number, in ear total weight, in marketable unhusked ears number and in marketable unhusked ears weight; b) no change was observed in the number and weight <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> husked ears. Hybrid AG 1051 was superior to BRS 2020 for weight <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> husked ears, but the two hybrids did not differ in other traits utilized to evaluate baby corn yield. In E 2 (green ear yield at 50 thousand plants ha- 1), detasseling did not change the following traits in both hybrids: total number and weight of ears; number and weight <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> unhusked ears and marketable husked ear weight. Detasseling reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> husked ears in cultivar AG 1051, but not in BRS 2020.

The experimental design was randomized blocks, and the irrigation was managed using an automatic irrigation device. The following variables were evaluated: plant heights, numbers of leaves, bunches, flowers and fruits, total mass of fruits, mass <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> fruits, mass <b>of</b> fruits with blossom-end rot, total diameter of fruits, and diameter <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> fruits.

40|$|In corn, {{when the}} first female {{inflorescence}} is removed, the plant often produces new female inflorescences. This allows the first ear to be harvested as baby corn (BC) and the second as green corn (GC) or dry corn (DC), that is, mature corn. The flexibility provided {{by a variety of}} harvested products allows the grower to compete with better conditions in the markets. We evaluated BC, GC, and DC yields in corn cultivars AG 1051, AG 2060, and BRS 2020, after the first ear was harvested as BC. A random block design with ten replicates was utilized. The yields of MM, MV and MS were higher when these products were individually harvested than when they were harvested in combination with baby corn (BC + GC and BC + DC). Cultivar BRS 2020 was the best for producing BC exclusively, considering the number and weight <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> unhusked ears and the number (NH) <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> husked ears. Considering weight (WH) <b>of</b> BC <b>marketable</b> husked ears, cultivar AG 1051 was the best. Cultivars did not differ in baby corn yield when this product was harvested in combination with MS or MV, except with regard to NH and WH, with AG 1051 being superior.

However, cultivars AG 1051 and AG 2060 were the best with respect to marketable unhusked green ears and number and weight <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> husked green ears.

Considering the lack of agronomic information on already available cultivars as well as on the varieties under development by breeding programs for organic systems, the objectives of this work were determine the yield components of 14 tomato cultivars in the organic system, through univariate and multivariate analysis. The experimental design was randomized blocks with six replications and five plants per plot. Evaluations consisted <b>of</b> total, <b>marketable</b> and non-marketable yield and number <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> fruits per plant, in 2010. We carried out analysis of variance, using test F 5 %. The effect of cultivar was fixed and the block effect was random. Then, means were ranked according to Scott-Knott 5 %. Differences among cultivars were significant for total yield, number <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> fruits per plant and marketable yield. The mean for total yield among cultivars was 51 t/ha and for marketable yield was 41 t/ha. Cultivars IAC 1 and Santa Clara were the least dissimilar (0. 38). On the other hand, cultivars HTV 0601 and IAC 3 were the most dissimilar (10. 63). The score dispersion graph showed two distinct groups. The second group contained cultivars HTV 0601, Granadero, Bari and Netuno, which stood out in the evaluation for the organic production system, presenting the highest total yield, marketable yield and number <b>of</b> <b>marketable</b> fruits per plant.
