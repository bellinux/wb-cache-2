5|$|Birth {{control is}} also being {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} hunting as a means of controlling overpopulation <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> animals.

5|$|Cucurbitacin is a plant steroid present <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> Cucurbita and in {{each member}} of the family Cucurbitaceae. Poisonous to mammals, it is found in {{quantities}} sufficient to discourage herbivores. It makes wild Cucurbita and most ornamental gourds, with the exception of an occasional C.fraterna and C.sororia, bitter to taste. Ingesting too much cucurbitacin can cause stomach cramps, diarrhea and even collapse. This bitterness is especially prevalent <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> Cucurbita; in parts of Mexico the flesh of the fruits is rubbed on a woman's breast to wean children. While the process of domestication has largely removed the bitterness from cultivated varieties, there are occasional reports of cucurbitacin causing illness in humans. Cucurbitacin is also used as a lure in insect traps.|$|E
5|$|Disease. Increased disease <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> populations often follows {{weakening}} {{from other}} environmental stressors, such as habitat loss.

5|$|Fish are an {{important}} resource for humans worldwide, especially as food. Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> fisheries (see fishing) or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have {{had a role in}} culture through the ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art, books and movies.|$|E

5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most animals, {{porpoises}} are conscious breathers. All mammals sleep, but porpoises cannot {{afford to}} become unconscious for long {{because they may}} drown. While knowledge of sleep <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> cetaceans is limited, porpoises in captivity have been recorded to sleep with one side of their brain at a time, {{so that they may}} swim, breathe consciously, and avoid both predators and social contact during their period of rest.|$|E

5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains of genetically modified animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans are the greatest threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then there is the practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present <b>in</b> <b>wild</b> bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
