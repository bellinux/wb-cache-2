In 1997or 1998Chip Harrison, the park supervisor, noticed a man looking through a telescope at the park at about 1AM. When Harrison asked why the man had come there, the astronomer said he had noticed an isolated black patch over north central Pennsylvania on nighttime satellite photos.

5|$|To be {{eligible}} to vote at a contested election in any constituency, a voter's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency.

For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors, information stated on a voter's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements, unless the facts are shown to be otherwise.|$|E

25|$|Markov {{chains and}} continuous-time Markov {{processes}} {{are useful in}} chemistry when physical systems closely approximate the Markov property. For example, imagine a large number n of molecules in solution in state A, each of which can undergo a chemical reaction to state B with a certain average rate. Perhaps the molecule is an enzyme, and the states refer to how it is folded. The state of any single enzyme follows a Markov chain, and since the molecules are essentially independent of each other, the number of molecules in state A or B at a time is n times the probability a given molecule <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> state.|$|E

Mormons believe that since that time, revelation through prophets and apostles has continued unbroken until the present day, God having promised that revelation will not be taken again from the earth before the Second Coming of Christ.|$|E

25|$|The ship-burial, {{probably}} {{dating from}} the early 7th century and excavated in 1939, {{is one of the}} most magnificent archaeological finds in England for its size and completeness, far-reaching connections, the quality and beauty of its contents, and the profound interest of the burial ritual itself. The initial excavation was privately sponsored by the landowner. When the significance of the find became apparent, national experts took over. Subsequent archaeological campaigns, particularly in the late 1960s and late 1980s, have explored the wider site and many other individual burials. The most significant artefacts from the ship-burial, displayed in the British Museum, are those found in the burial chamber, including a suite of metalwork dress fittings in gold and gems, a ceremonial helmet, shield and sword, a lyre, and many pieces of silver plate from Byzantium. The ship-burial has, from the time of its discovery, prompted comparisons with the world described in the heroic Old English poem Beowulf, which is set in southern Sweden. It <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> region, especially at Vendel, that close archaeological parallels to the ship burial are found, both in its general form and in details of the military equipment contained in the burial.|$|E
25|$|Although {{two other}} London Underground lines operate fully underground, the Northern line {{is unusual in}} that it is a deep-level tube line that serves the outer suburbs of South London yet there is only one station above ground (Morden tube station) while the rest of this part of the line is deep below ground. The short section to Morden depot is also above ground. This is partly because its {{southern}} extension into the outer suburbs was not done by taking over an existing surface line as was generally the case with routes like the Central, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines. Apart from the core central underground tunnels, part of the section between Hendon and Colindale is also underground. As bicycles are not allowed in tunnel sections (even if no station <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> section) as they would hinder evacuation, they are limited to High Barnet – East Finchley, the Mill Hill East branch, Edgware – Colindale and Hendon Central – Golders Green. There are also time-based restrictions for the sections where bicycles are allowed.|$|E

[...] A music video to accompany the release of [...] "Titanium" [...] was first released onto YouTube on June 12, 2013 at a total length of three minutes and fifty-four seconds.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a {{regional}} sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the lathe of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary {{for the purposes of the}} law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): [...] "northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> of West Kent". This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men, which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be Men of Kent.|$|E
