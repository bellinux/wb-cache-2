40|$|A {{major part}} of our {{everyday}} environmental perception is mediated via smell. Especially {{for the evaluation of}} foodstuffs, drinks and tobacco the olfactory perception (lat. olfactere = to smell) plays a predominant role. To meet with this special function, the nose is anatomically located right above the mouth and thus inspects any <b>incoming</b> <b>good.</b> Hence, the sense of smell also controls the individual food preferences. With more than 400 olfactory receptors being subject to high genetic dynamics, it is expected that no two persons exist with the identical olfactory perception. This complexity is yet being increased by the number of potential odorants and moreover, their occurrence in mixtures such as food. To understand the impact of single food odorants, a deep understanding of the molecular fundamentals of smell, the interaction of odorants with olfactory receptors, the respective physiology and molecular biology of olfaction is required...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{aspiration}} for a capacity of 11,000 goods wagons per day, Maschen was equipped from the beginning with the most modern shunting technology available in the 1970s. The composition of <b>incoming</b> <b>goods</b> trains was transmitted to Maschen before they arrived, so that the hitherto usual practice of handing over the trains in the reception sidings could be done away with. Using the data, train-splitting lists were created, these formed the working basis for the sequence control unit (Ablaufsteuerrechner or ASR). The ASR controls the shunters on the hump yards by radio, giving them the shunting speeds, setting the points for the rolling goods wagons and regulating their speed with retarders, 26 bar-type (Balkengleisbremsen) and 112 rubber retarders being available. 112 wagon transporters (Beidr√ºckanlagen) move the loose wagons onwards within the sidings.|$|E
50|$|Normanton, gazetted as {{a town in}} 1868, was {{originally}} settled to provide port facilities {{as an alternative to}} the Burketown port. The port facilities, situated sixty kilometres upstream from the Gulf of Carpentaria provided access for <b>incoming</b> <b>goods</b> as well as allowing for a more efficient trade route to Brisbane from the Carpentaria region. The site for Normanton is located on an ironstone ridge, protecting it from the topographic changes that occur during the wet season. Although the region had been opened up as a pastoral district during the 1860s for cattle, it was the discovery of gold at Croydon in 1885, that saw the township boom. The Normanton-Croydon railway opened in 1891 and road links to the Cloncurry copper fields saw Normanton port become a gateway for the north-western region of Queensland.|$|E

5000|$|In accounting, {{the concept}} of a freight expense or freight spend account can be {{generalized}} as a payment for sending out a product to a customer. It falls under the umbrella category of expenses and is treated like other expense accounts in relation to the accounting equation, however, under generally accepted accounting rules, if the freight is considered part of the cost of an asset it is recorded as part {{of the value of the}} asset on the balance sheet as laid down cost. Freight expense has a normal debit balance. Increases are recorded as debits while decreases are recorded as credits. In relation to other accounts, the Freight Expense account is similar to the [...] "Cost of Sales-Freight" [...] account, but are two totally different entities. While the Freight Expense account is increased for payments towards outgoing goods, the Cost of Sales-Freight account is increased for payments towards <b>incoming</b> <b>goods.</b>|$|E
5000|$|However, this boom {{began to}} falter due to {{building}} construction delays and overload on the transport system {{caused by an}} excess of bulky building materials. On January 10, 1926 the Prinz Valdemar, an old Danish warship {{on its way to}} becoming a floating hotel, ran aground and blocked Miami Harbor for nearly a month. Already overloaded, the three major railway companies soon declared an embargo on all <b>incoming</b> <b>goods</b> except food. The cost of living had skyrocketed and finding an affordable place to live was nearly impossible. This economic bubble was already collapsing when the catastrophic Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 swept through, ending whatever was left of the boom. The Category 4 storm was the 12th most costly and 12th most deadly to strike the United States during the 20th century. According to the Red Cross, there were 373 fatalities, but other estimates vary, due to the large number of people listed as [...] "missing". Between 25,000 and 50,000 people were left homeless in the Miami area. The Great Depression followed, causing more than sixteen thousand people in Miami to become unemployed. As a result, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was opened in the area.|$|E

It {{is located in}} the north-eastern end of the Gaza Strip and was opened in 1994 after the signing of the Oslo Accords, in order to allow Palestinian merchants to export and import goods. This was done as a 'back-to-back' transfer, meaning that Palestinian products meant for export are removed from a Palestinian truck and placed in an Israeli truck, or vice versa for <b>incoming</b> <b>goods.</b> The Karni Crossing was also used by the residents of Netzarim since the Karni road was the only route to that isolated Israeli settlement on which Jewish travel was allowed after the 1994 implementation of the Oslo Accords. Unlike the Erez Crossing, which is managed by the Israel Defense Forces, Karni is managed by the Israel Airports Authority. According to the management, the crossing is named after Joseph Karni, an Israeli who had set up a modern packing warehouse in the Gaza Strip near the present-day {{cargo terminal}} shortly after Israel captured the strip in 1967. The Palestinians call it ‚ÄúAl-Montar‚Äù, after the nearby Ali Montar hill. In the end of March, 2011, Karni crossing was permanently shut down by Israeli authorities.|$|E

50|$|Once in San Francisco {{the crews}} often deserted the ships. The ship owners found little cargo {{of value to}} ship back to the East Coast out of California and the ships often went back in ballast with a cargo of useless rocks. Since many of the ships were older and {{required}} expensive maintenance and crews were {{very hard to find}} and/or very expensive many hundreds of vessels were simply abandoned or sold at very low cost in Yerba Buena Cove. Others were converted into store ships or floating warehouses, stores, hotels, prisons, etc.. Some abandoned ships were bought cheap, filled with ballast and sunk on the mud flats at high tide to enlarge the available wharves and docks. The ships were typically stripped of her upper works and all usable fittings by one of San Francisco's many marine salvage firms of Gold Rush days and then covered with debris and sand as developers filled in the mud flats on the bay and built wharves out to deeper water to accommodate docking ships. By 1857 nearly all abandoned shipping in the Yerba Buena Cove that had not been re-used was sent to a marine salvage or ship breaking firms where all usable fixtures, anchors, etc. were removed, the copper bottom (about 8000 lb of copper) salvaged and the timbers were removed and set aside for other uses. The rapidly expanding city of San Francisco needed room to store all of the <b>incoming</b> <b>goods</b> and much larger dockside facilities‚Äîthere were none when California was annexed. There initially was not time to build adequate warehouses, wharves, docks on the water front. In early September 2001, the General Harrison, was discovered at the northwest corner of Battery and Clay streets during construction. She was built in 1840 in Newburyport, Massachusetts and abandoned sometime before 1850 and turned into a store ship (warehouse). She was 126.1 ft long, 26.5 ft wide, 13.25 ft in depth and displaced 409 tons. She was burned to the water line in one of San Francisco's early fires. The remains, including some of the stores on board, were filled with sand and built over.|$|E

30|$|The {{increase}} of congestion in transport system requires innovative approaches {{to face the}} need for sustainable mobility. In this context, limiting the impact of freight transport on road congestion is specifically important. In fact, the European freight road transport {{is expected to increase}} by 55 % by 2020 [1]. The traditional measures to accommodate this growth, such as the expansion of the existing transport networks, cannot be pursued, at least in urban areas. The rationalization of the freight flows in the urban areas is therefore necessary and this need is addressed by City Logistics [2, 3]. One of the basic concepts of city logistics is the use of intermodal terminals. Here, <b>goods</b> <b>incoming</b> from different transport modes (rail, maritime, large trucks) are stored and small vehicles are used for the distribution of freights towards the urban area. Terminals are often located in the city neighborhoods, as near as possible to the city center to reduce the distances for truck collection and distribution [4].|$|R
