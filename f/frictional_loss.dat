50|$|When {{compared}} to a V6 or V8, an inline four will generally have somewhat lower frictional losses at a comparable engine speed due to having fewer pistons, connecting rods and bearings, although the lower <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> is offset in practice by the inline four's need to operate at a higher RPM {{compared to}} a larger engine {{in order to produce}} equivalent power.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory {{investigations}} of the stability of multiple-machine systems were constrained {{by the use of}} direct-operated indicating instruments (voltmeters, ammeters, and wattmeters). To ensure that the instruments negligibly loaded the model system, the machine power level used was substantial. Some workers in the 1920s used three-phase model generators rated up to 600 kVA and 2300 volts to represent a power system. General Electric developed model systems using generators rated at 3.75 kVA. It was difficult to keep multiple generators in synchronism, and the size and cost of the units was a constraint. While transmission lines and loads could be accurately scaled down to laboratory representations, rotating machines could not be accurately miniaturized and keep the same dynamic characteristics as full-sized prototypes; the ratio of machine inertia to machine <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> did not scale.|$|E

50|$|Compared to a {{conventional}} bicycle, a tandem has double the pedalling power, without necessarily doubling the speed, {{and with only}} slightly more <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> in the drivetrain. It has about the same wind resistance as {{a conventional}} bicycle. High-performance tandems may weigh less {{than twice as much}} as a single bike, so the power-to-weight ratio may be slightly better than that of a single bike and rider. On flat terrain and downhill, most of the power produced by cyclists is used to overcome wind resistance, so tandems can reach higher speeds than the same riders on single bicycles. They are not necessarily slower on climbs, but are perceived as such, in part due to the need for a high level of coordination between the riders, especially if the physical abilities of the two riders are very different, requiring a compromise on cadence.|$|E
50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to how}} much power the twin balance shafts cost the engine. The basic figure given is usually around 15 hp (11 kW), but this may be {{excessive}} for pure friction losses. It is possible that this is a miscalculation derived from the common use of an inertial dynamometer, which calculates power from angular acceleration rather than actual measurement of steady state torque. The 15 hp (11 kW), then, includes both the actual <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> as well as the increase in angular inertia of the rapidly rotating shafts, which would not be a factor at steady speed. Nevertheless, some owners modify their engines by removing the balance shafts, both to reclaim some of this power and to reduce complexity and potential areas of breakage for high-performance and racing use, as it is commonly (but falsely) believed that the smoothness provided by the balance shafts can be attained after their removal by careful balancing of the reciprocating components of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{hydraulic}} fracture {{is formed}} by pumping fracturing fluid into a wellbore {{at a rate}} sufficient to increase pressure at the target depth (determined by {{the location of the}} well casing perforations), to exceed that of the fracture gradient (pressure gradient) of the rock. The fracture gradient is defined as pressure increase per unit of depth relative to density, and is usually measured in pounds per square inch, per square foot, or bars. The rock cracks, and the fracture fluid permeates the rock extending the crack further, and further, and so on. Fractures are localized as pressure drops off with the rate of <b>frictional</b> <b>loss,</b> which is relevant to the distance from the well. Operators typically try to maintain [...] "fracture width", or slow its decline following treatment, by introducing a proppant into the injected fluida material such as grains of sand, ceramic, or other particulate, thus preventing the fractures from closing when injection is stopped and pressure removed. Consideration of proppant strength and prevention of proppant failure becomes more important at greater depths where pressure and stresses on fractures are higher. The propped fracture is permeable enough to allow the flow of gas, oil, salt water and hydraulic fracturing fluids to the well.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} parameter in {{the reduction}} of fuel consumption of heavy-duty diesel engines is the Power Cylinder Unit (PCU); the PCU is the single largest contributor to engine <b>frictional</b> <b>losses.</b> Much attention, from both academia and industry, {{has been paid to}} reducing the <b>frictional</b> <b>losses</b> of the PCU in the boundary and mixed lubrication regime. However, previous studies have shown that a large portion of <b>frictional</b> <b>losses</b> in the PCU occur in the hydrodynamic lubrication regime. A novel texturing design with large types of surface features was experimentally analyzed using a tribometer setup. The experimental result shows a significant reduction of friction loss for the textured surfaces. Additionally, the textured surface did not exhibit wear. On the contrary, it was shown that the textured surfaces exhibited a smaller amount of abrasive scratches on the plateaus (compared to the reference plateau honed surface) due to entrapment of wear particles within the textures. The decrease in hydrodynamic friction for the textured surfaces relates to the relative increase of oil film thickness within the textures.

40|$|Just {{as there}} are <b>frictional</b> <b>losses</b> {{associated}} with moving masses on a surface, what if there were <b>frictional</b> <b>losses</b> associated with moving information on a substrate? Indeed, many methods of communication suffer from such <b>frictional</b> <b>losses.</b> We propose to model these losses as proportional to “bit-meters, ” i. e., the product of mass of information (i. e., the number of bits) and the distance of information transport. We use this “information-friction” model to understand fundamental energy requirements on encoding and decoding in communication circuitry. First, for communication across a binary input AWGN channel, we arrive at limits on bit-meters (and thus energy consumption) for decoding implementations that have a predetermined input-independent lengths of messages. For encoding, we relax the fixed-length assumption and derive bounds for flexible-message-length implementations. Using these lower bounds we show that the total (transmit + encoding + decoding) energy-per-bit must diverge to infinity as the target error probability is lowered. Further, the closer the communication rate is maintained to the channel capacity (as the target error-probability is lowered to zero), the faster the required decoding energy diverges to infinity.

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a fixed scroll and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the fixed scroll by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the <b>frictional</b> <b>loss</b> of the tip seal simultaneously is developed.
