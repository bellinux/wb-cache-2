500|$|Cher {{signed with}} Liberty Records' Imperial imprint {{in the end}} of 1964, and Sonny became her producer. The single [...] "Dream Baby", {{released}} under the name [...] "Cherilyn", received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by Imperial, Cher worked with Sonny on her second solo single on the label, a cover version of Bob Dylan's [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do", which peaked at number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in 1965. Meanwhile, the Byrds had released their own version of the same song. When competition on the singles charts started between Cher and the Byrds, the group's record label began to promote the B-side of the Byrds' single. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds commented, [...] "We loved the Cher version... We didn't want the hassle. So we just turned our record over." [...] Cher's debut album, All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do (1965), reached number 16 on the Billboard 200; it was later described by AllMusic's Tim Sendra as [...] "one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era".|$|E

500|$|The Byrds' next single was [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do", another {{interpretation}} of a Dylan song. [...] Despite the success of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man", the Byrds were reluctant to release another Dylan-penned single, feeling {{that it was too}} formulaic, but Columbia Records were insistent, believing that another Dylan cover would result in an instant hit for the group. [...] The Byrds' rendition of [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do" [...] is noticeably different in structure to Dylan's original: it features an ascending melody progression in the chorus and utilizes a completely new melody for one of the song's verses, in order {{to turn it into a}} Beatlesque, minor-key bridge. [...] Issued on June 14, 1965, while [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] was still climbing the U.S. charts, the single was rush-released by Columbia in an attempt to bury a rival cover version that Cher had released simultaneously on Imperial Records. [...] A chart battle ensued, but the Byrds' rendition stalled at number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, while Cher's version reached number 15. [...] The reverse was true in the UK, however, where the Byrds' version reached number 4, while Cher's peaked at number 9.|$|E

However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season.

500|$|The role of Holly {{was created}} by series co-creator Ryan Murphy {{specifically}} for Paltrow, a personal friend. Murphy suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong, in which Paltrow plays a country singer. Murphy said of Paltrow, [...] "Gwyneth is a great singer. She's done {{it a little bit}} but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> show it off and show everyone how great she is."

500|$|The Byrds {{initially}} {{planned to}} release [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] in 1965, as {{a follow-up to}} their previous hit Bob Dylan covers, [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do". The band's first attempt at recording the song was on June 28, 1965: resulting in an irreverent, garage rock style take on the song. This version was deemed unsatisfactory and remained unreleased for 22 years, until its inclusion on the Never Before album in 1987. The June 28, 1965 recording can also be heard on the 1996 expanded reissue of Turn! Turn! Turn! {{as well as on}} The Byrds and There Is a Season box sets.|$|E

It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> communicate my feelings directly and because I was so careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing {{in time to the}} music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E

Them's version, released in 1966 influenced garage bands during the mid-60's and Beck later sampled it for his 1996 single [...] "Jack-Ass". The Byrds recorded the song twice in 1965 as a possible follow up single to [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do", but neither recording was released in that form. The Byrds did release a 1969 recording of the song on their Ballad of Easy Rider album (see 1969 in music).|$|E

Villa began 2009 with a goal against England in a 2–0 friendly, with this goal, he broke another record and became the first Spanish international to have scored in six consecutive games, seeing off records set by Telmo Zarra and László Kubala.

500|$|Black Flag's {{change in}} musical style and {{appearance}} alienated {{many of their}} original fans, who focused their displeasure on Rollins by punching him in the mouth, stabbing him with pens, or scratching him with their nails, among other methods. He often fought back, dragging audience members on stage and assaulting them. During a Black Flag concert, Rollins repeatedly punched a fan in the face who had continuously reached for his microphone. Rollins became increasingly alienated from the audience; in his tour diary, Rollins wrote [...] "When they spit at me, when they grab at me, they aren't hurting me. When I push out and mangle the flesh of another, it's falling so short of what <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do to them." [...] During the Unicorn legal dispute, Rollins had started a weight-lifting program, and by their 1984 tours, he had become visibly well-built; journalist Michael Azerrad later commented that [...] "his powerful physique was {{a metaphor for the}} impregnable emotional shield he was developing around himself." [...] Rollins has since replied that [...] "no, the training was just basically a way to push myself." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{initially}} suggested as a suitable {{vehicle for the}} band by their manager Jim Dickson. Lead guitarist Jim McGuinn felt {{that it would make}} an effective cover version, but David Crosby, the band's rhythm guitarist, felt that covering another Dylan song was formulaic. The Byrds had already released a total of six Dylan covers on their first two albums, Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn! Turn! Turn!, enjoying particular success with their recordings of [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] and [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do". In spite of Crosby's objections, the band recorded [...] "My Back Pages" [...] between December 5 and December 8, 1966, during the recording sessions for their fourth album. Upon its release, this cover was received well by the critics and is today regarded as one of The Byrds' strongest Dylan interpretations. Following its release on Younger Than Yesterday, the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds' live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. On December 4, 1968, a later line-up of The Byrds re-recorded an excerpt of [...] "My Back Pages" [...] as part of a medley that was included on their 1969 album, Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde. The song was also performed live by a reformed line-up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989.|$|E
500|$|The studio {{recordings}} {{featured on}} (Untitled) mostly consisted of newly written, self-penned material, including {{a number of}} songs that had been composed by McGuinn and Broadway theatre impresario Jacques Levy for a planned country rock musical titled Gene Tryp that the pair were developing. [...] Plans for the musical had fallen through and as a result, McGuinn decided to record some of the material originally intended for the production with the Byrds. [...] Among the Gene Tryp songs included on (Untitled) was [...] "Chestnut Mare", which had originally been written for {{a scene in which}} the musical's eponymous hero attempts to catch and tame a wild horse. [...] The song was excerpted from the album and issued as a single in the U.S. on October 23, 1970, but it only managed to climb to number 121 on the Billboard chart. Nonetheless, the song {{went on to become a}} staple of FM radio programming in America during the 1970s. [...] "Chestnut Mare" [...] did much better in the UK, however, when it was released as a single on January 1, 1971, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and giving the Byrds their first UK Top 20 hit since their cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "All <b>I</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Do" [...] had peaked at number 4 in September 1965.|$|E
500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had said {{publicly}} that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably {{going to do it}}, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs that <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sing live, that I really enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable if it turns out to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E
