40|$|Hungary’s {{share of}} {{renewable}} energy in 2010 was 7. 9 %, and their renewable energy goal for 2020 is 14. 65 %. Geothermal energy is one option that could help to achieve the goal, since Hungary has favorable bedrock, the temperature gradient is above average and thepermeability is high. Today Hungary is importing just over half of its primary energy supply. Because of political conflicts between nations Hungary wants to expand its own production of energy. One of the major investments implemented was to build the largest geothermal heating plant in central Europe, located in Miskolc.

40|$|The project goal is {{to develop}} the world's best <b>grain</b> <b>dryer,</b> where best is {{defined in terms of}} energy efficiency, grain quality protection, and minimal {{environmental}} impact. A technique was developed to recapture enthalpy from a continuous flow drying system and to carry that energy back into the grain kernels.

Maximum kernel temperatures are tightly controlled by the design and can be selected through the system controls.

40|$|Early season maize is {{harvested}} {{with high}} moisture content {{that makes it}} impossible to store. The sale of early season maize in green form is uneconomical to the farmer.

To minimize grain losses and thereby increase value and the profit margin of the farmer, a <b>grain</b> <b>dryer</b> is necessary for wet grains. Therefore, this paper presents the design and development of a batch in-bin maize <b>grain</b> <b>dryer.</b> Some properties of maize such as moisture content and bulk density were determined to get information required for design of the dryer.

A maize dryer was developed with a batch size of 100 kg of threshed wet maize. The dryer can be used in laboratory for experimental purpose {{as well as on the}} farm for commercial purposes. The dryer can be used to measure drying rates of maize at different initial moisture contents, drying air temperatures, drying air velocities and grain beds.

50|$|Hundreds of {{millions}} of tonnes of wheat, corn, soybean, rice and other grains as sorghum, sunflower seeds, rapeseed/canola, barley, oats, etc., are dried in <b>grain</b> <b>dryers.</b> In the main agricultural countries, drying comprises the reduction of moisture from about 17-30%w/w to values between 8 and 15%w/w, depending on the grain. The final moisture content for drying must be adequate for storage. The more oil the grain has, the lower its storage moisture content will be (though its initial moisture for drying will also be lower). Cereals are often dried to 14% w/w, while oilseeds, to 12.5% (soybeans), 8% (sunflower) and 9% (peanuts). Drying is carried out as a requisite for safe storage, in order to inhibit microbial growth. However, low temperatures in storage are also highly recommended to avoid degradative reactions and, especially, the growth of insects and mites. A good maximum storage temperature is about 18 °C.|$|R
