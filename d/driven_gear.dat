25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a <b>driven</b> <b>gear,</b> and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E

2500|$|Golden Green is a hamlet within Hadlow parish. A mill {{may have}} been on this site since Domesday. This Grade II listed mill is the only mill on the Bourne to retain most of its milling machinery. The {{internal}} waterwheel is of iron, and is breast shot. It is [...] diameter and [...] wide. on a cast iron axle. The pit wheel is [...] diameter and has 120 cogs, driving a [...] diameter wallower with 35 teeth on a [...] diameter wooden upright shaft. The Great Spur Wheel is [...] diameter and has 92 cogs. The date 1848 is on a plinth {{at the bottom of}} the Upright shaft, and may indicate the date of the existing waterwheel and machinery. The crown wheel was used latterly to drive the electricity generator, with one of the stone nuts being adapted as the <b>driven</b> <b>gear.</b> The mill had two pairs of millstones and last ground corn c.1920. The sack hoist does not survive. In the early-mid 20th century, the mill was used to generate electricity, but the apparatus has now been removed. The mill was also known as Bourneside Mill and Victoria Mill (Victoria Road is downstream of the mill). The outbuildings around the mill have been converted into holiday cottages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The severe {{global climate}} changes result in {{consecutive}} torrential rains in rainy season, and causes water loss and soil erosion. For an effective water and soil conservation, geotextiles {{are commonly used}} in geotechnical engineering. Geotextiles should able to isolate soil, filter water, and reinforce the soil; therefore, the material for geotextiles should be acid-resistant and alkali-resistant, such as polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PET). This study uses PP fibers as the skin and PET plied yarns as the core to form PP/PET composite tubular knits on a cord knitting machine. The PET plied yarn is fed with a specified tensile strength, and only the tooth number of the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> varies. Mechanical property test results show that a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth increases the tensile strength of the resulting tubular knits; however, with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 35 teeth, the tensile strength decreases. An optimal core coverage occurs with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth...|$|R
40|$|Three {{lead screws}} are {{provided}} for adjusting {{the position of}} a traversing plate. Each of the three lead screws is threaded through a collar that is press fitted through the center of one of three pinion gears. A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a <b>drive</b> <b>gear.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> meshes with the sun <b>gear</b> and is <b>driven</b> by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the <b>drive</b> <b>gear,</b> the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three lead screws and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|R

50|$|If {{a simple}} gear train has three gears, {{such that the}} input gear GA meshes with an {{intermediate}} gear GI which in turn meshes with the output gear GB, then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this gear ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the gears GA and GB engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an idler gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and <b>driven</b> <b>gear.</b> If the driver gear moves in the clockwise direction, then the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} idler gear.|$|E
50|$|In a gear train, {{backlash}} is cumulative. When a gear-train {{is reversed}} the driving gear is turned a short distance, {{equal to the}} total of all the backlashes, before the final <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> begins to rotate. At low power outputs, backlash results in inaccurate calculation from the small errors introduced at each change of direction; at large power outputs backlash sends shocks through the whole system and can damage teeth and other components.|$|E
50|$|In the photo, {{assuming}} the smallest gear {{is connected to}} the motor, it is called the drive gear or input gear. The somewhat larger gear in the middle is called an idler gear. It is not connected directly to either the motor or the output shaft and only transmits power between the input and output gears. There is a third gear in the upper-right corner of the photo. Assuming that gear {{is connected to the}} machine's output shaft, it is the output or <b>driven</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

50|$|Epicyclic gearing {{was used}} in the Antikythera Mechanism, circa 80 BCE, to adjust the {{displayed}} position of the moon for the ellipticity of its orbit, and even for the apsidal precession of its orbit. Two facing gears were rotated around slightly different centers, and one drove the other not with meshed teeth but with a pin inserted into a slot on the second. As the slot drove the second gear, the radius of driving would change, thus invoking a speeding up and slowing down of the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> in each revolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} freewheel device {{consists of}} two saw-toothed, spring-loaded discs pressing against each other with the toothed sides together, somewhat like a ratchet. Rotating in one direction, the saw teeth of the drive disc lock with {{the teeth of the}} driven disc, making it rotate at the same speed. If the drive disc slows down or stops rotating, the teeth of the driven disc slip over the drive disc teeth and continue rotating, producing a characteristic clicking sound proportionate to the speed difference of the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> relative to that of the (slower) driving gear.|$|E
50|$|Where {{large numbers}} of gear ratios, six or more, are to be {{provided}} then these will require a third or more gear clusters on the layshaft. To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar. The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the multiple clutch gearbox, used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.|$|E
