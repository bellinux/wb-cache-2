5|$|The opening {{stage left}} Porto-Vecchio {{and ended in}} Bastia, with next two stages ending in Ajaccio and Calvi respectively. The race then moved to {{mainland}} France at Nice. Stages five to eight formed a four-stage journey that navigated westwards finishing at the Ax 3 <b>Domaines</b> ski resort in the Pyrenees. Stage nine took place between Saint-Girons to Bagnères-de-Bigorre, before a long transfer moved the race to the north-west of the country. Stage ten finished in {{the port city of}} Saint-Malo, with the next finishing at the Mont Saint-Michel island commune in Normandy. The following four stages, 11 to 15, crossed the center of the country back to the south-east finishing atop Mont Ventoux. The next five stages took place in and around the Alps, before a second long transfer took the Tour to the finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Later in the race, {{there was}} one more time trial, on the {{penultimate}} day. Also, there were just three uphill finishes (Courchevel, Ax-3 <b>Domaines</b> and Pla d'Adet), a lower number than in previous years. The finish line of the last stage was, as has been since 1975, on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E
25|$|However {{despite the}} lack of an {{official}} ranking, many wine writers and critics have over the years came up with their own personal classifications that have been cited by other sources.

25|$|In 2000, Burgundy had a {{total of}} 3 200 wine <b>domaines</b> (compared to 50 in the early 19th century), of which 520 were in the {{department}} of Yonne, 1 100 in Côte-d'Or and 1 570 in Saône-et-Loir. Generally, the small growers sell their grapes to larger producers, merchants called négociants, who blend and bottle the wine. The roughly 115 négociants who produce the majority of the wine only control around 8% of the area. Individual growers have around 67% of the area, but produce and market only around 25% of the wine. Some small wineries produce only 100-200 cases/year, while many producers make a few thousand cases/year.|$|E
25|$|Froome {{followed}} up with overall wins at the Tour de Romandie in April and Critérium du Dauphiné in June. Boasson Hagen retained his Tour of Norway title, winning the points classification and stage four of the race in the process.

Froome was narrowly beaten to the King of the Mountains prize by s Colombian climber and runner up, Nairo Quintana.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the only}} {{permitted}} grape in Corton-Charlemagne is Chardonnay. However, its {{presence on the}} hill is a relatively recent occurrence. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century, Aligoté was the main grape variety with Pinot Beurot (Pinot gris) and Pinot blanc also being widely planted at one point. In fact, Master of Wine Remington Norman noted in his book The Great <b>Domaines</b> of Burgundy that when the white wines of Corton and Montrachet were receiving widespread recognition in the 8th century, during the period of Charlemagne, that it was likely from wine that was made from field blends of indigenous grape varieties rather than the single grape of Chardonnay that both regions are known for today.|$|E

Since the 2014 vintage, le Chardonnay de Baron'arques is <b>Domaine</b> de Baronarques - White wine.

50|$|In 1981, Jean-Marie's son, Laurent Ponsot, {{began working}} at the <b>domaine.</b> This year also saw an {{expansion}} of the <b>domaine's</b> metayage agreements, adding access to Griotte Chambertin, Chambertin, Clos St Denis, and Chambolle Les Charmes from <b>Domaine</b> des Chezeaux (the Mercier family). Laurent took over winemaking duties at the <b>domaine</b> in 1983, and runs the <b>domaine</b> to this day.|$|R
25|$|After Burgundy became {{incorporated}} in the Kingdom of France, {{and the power of}} the church decreased, many vineyards which had been in the church's hands were sold to the bourgeoisie from the 17th century. After the French revolution of 1789, the church's remaining vineyards were broken up and from 1791 sold off. The Napoleonic inheritance laws then resulted in the continued subdivision of the most precious vineyard holdings, so some growers hold only a row or two of vines. This led to the emergence of négociants who aggregate the produce of many growers to produce a single wine. It has also led to a profusion of increasingly smaller, family-owned wineries, exemplified by the dozen-plus Gros family <b>domaines.</b>|$|E
25|$|Apart from Pli selon pli, {{the only}} {{substantial}} new work {{to emerge in}} the first half of the 1960s was the final version of Book 2 of his Structures for two pianos. Boulez and Yvonne Loriod gave the premiere at the Donaueschinger Musiktage in October 1961. Midway through the decade, however, Boulez appeared to find his voice again. Éclat, a short and brilliant piece for small ensemble, had its first performance in Los Angeles in March 1965 and by 1970 it had grown into a substantial half-hour work, Éclat/Multiples. In 1968 the final version of Figures—Doubles—Prismes for large orchestra, a version of two movements from Livre pour quatuor for string orchestra (Livre pour cordes) and the two versions of <b>Domaines</b> (clarinet solo/clarinet and ensemble) all received first performances.|$|E
25|$|Boulez {{employed}} {{variants of}} the technique {{in a number of}} works over the next two decades: in the Third Piano Sonata (1955–57/63) the pianist may choose different routes through the score and in one movement (Trope) has the option of omitting certain passages altogether; in Éclat (1965), the conductor triggers the order in which each player joins the ensemble; in <b>Domaines</b> (1961–68) it is the soloist who dictates the order in which the sections are played by his movement around the stage. In later works, such as Cummings ist der Dichter (1970/86)—a chamber cantata for 16 solo voices and small orchestra using a poem by E. E. Cummings—the conductor is given choice as to the order of certain events but there is no freedom for the individual player. In its original version Pli selon pli also contained elements of choice for the instrumentalists, but much of this was eliminated in later revisions.|$|E

25|$|As in 2012, Valverde won {{the overall}} {{classification}} of the Vuelta a Andalucía in 2013, {{where he also}} won the points classification in the race. Valverde continued showing some good form after finishing with podium places in the Vuelta a Murcia, the Amstel Gold Race and in Liège–Bastogne–Liège. After having a decent spring campaign, Valverde aimed for a podium finish in the Tour de France. Valverde started the Tour in good form after finishing third in Ax3 <b>Domaines</b> behind Chris Froome and Richie Porte. However the next day, Porte lost over 15 minutes which moved Valverde into second overall right before the tour left the Pyrenees. On Stage 13, Valverde lost almost 10 minutes after getting a flat tire. Despite a very hard pursuit, the high crosswinds and {{the pace of the}} peloton prevented him and his teammates from catching back. They ended up with the second group at the finish causing him to slip out of the top ten. Despite losing his second position, Valverde managed to do well in the Alps which moved him back into the top ten of the overall standings, finishing 8th overall.|$|E
500|$|The {{fifth and}} sixth stages ended in bunch sprints, with Cavendish and André Greipel the victors respectively. After stage six, Daryl Impey became the first South African rider to wear the yellow jersey. His {{teammate}} Gerrans ensured it for him by holding back at the finish allowing Impey– who was second overall– the time necessary to replace him {{at the top of}} the general classification. Sagan claimed the seventh stage from a bunch sprint in Albi, with [...] rider Blel Kadri talking the polka dot jersey. In stage eight, the Tour's first mountain stage, which ended at the Ax 3 <b>Domaines,</b> Froome attacked a select five-rider group, which included Alberto Contador and Alejandro Valverde, as they passed the lone leader Nairo Quintana with [...] remaining. Froome took the stage win, fifty-one seconds ahead of his teammate Richie Porte, with Valverde third a further seventeen down. Contador and Quintana finished one minute forty-five seconds behind Froome. Froome's victory win put him in the lead of the general and mountains classifications, ahead of Porte. In the ninth stage, Froome managed to subdue attacks from his rivals, although his team's efforts left him isolated for the majority of the stage. After a descent from the mountain pass of La Hourquette d'Ancizan, a group of twenty-three riders came into the finish in Bagnères-de-Bigorre, where Dan Martin (...) beat Jakob Fuglsang (...) from sprint, twenty seconds ahead of the group. Porte lost eighteen minutes, dropping from second overall to thirty-third, with Valverde moving up to second. Rolland took back the polka dot jersey. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour.|$|E

Lasting around eighteen minutes, it is a dialogue between a solo clarinet (played live, though sometimes reverberated through an offstage piano) and its double (in passages pre-recorded by the same musician and projected around the hall). Boulez acknowledged that the work had a theatrical aspect, indeed its title refers to a scene in Paul Claudel's play Le Soulier de satin.
