5|$|At {{the time}} of the release of Mughal-e-Azam, a typical Bollywood film would garner a {{distribution}} fee of 300,000–400,000 (about US$63,000–84,000 in 1960) per territory. Asif <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would sell his film to the distributors at no less than 700,000 per territory. Subsequently, the film was actually sold at a price of 1.7million (US$356,000) per territory, surprising Asif and the producers. Thus, it set the record for the highest distribution fee received by any Bollywood film at that time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} {{days after the}} war, {{contradictory}} reports arose as to Bormann's whereabouts. Sightings were reported in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere. Bormann's wife was placed under surveillance in case he tried to contact her. Jakob Glas, Bormann's long-time chauffeur, <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> saw Bormann in Munich in July 1946.

5|$|Goldstone <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} follow a one-sided mandate but would {{investigate}} any abuses committed by either side during the conflict. He {{said that he}} had initially not been willing to take on the mission unless the mandate was expanded to cover all sides. Despite then-president of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Martin Uhomoibhi's verbal commitment that there was no objection to the revised mandate, the Human Rights Council never voted to revise the mandate, and resolution S-9/1 remained unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian troops {{suffered}} 126 {{dead and}} 241 wounded during the sporadic fighting, and killed between 1,122 and 3,500 civilians, including some Volksdeutsche. Many civilians {{were arrested and}} tortured. On 14 April 1941, around 500 Jews and Serbs were bayoneted to death, probably {{as a warning to}} others not to resist. During post-war questioning, Horthy <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not wished to invade Yugoslavia, but that he had been compelled to act by disorder and the massacre of Hungarians in Bačka, but these claims have been dismissed by Tomasevich.|$|E

After completing elementary school, his parents <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts {{and did not want}} to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E

5|$|The defense {{relied on}} the {{provision}} of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President {{had the right to}} test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|As {{provisional}} {{president in}} 1861, Davis formed his first cabinet.

John Reagan of Texas became Postmaster General. Judah P. Benjamin of Louisiana became Attorney General. Although Stephen Mallory was not put forward by the delegation from his state of Florida, Davis <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was the best {{man for the job}} of Secretary of the Navy, and he was eventually confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others {{because they were afraid}} she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E
