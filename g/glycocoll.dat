40|$|Because {{of their}} {{importance}} in biochemistry {{and in the}} theory of amphoteric electrolytes, the acid and basic dissociation constants of amino acids and polypeptides have been measured by numerou~ investigators. A summary of available data has been published by Kirk and Schmidt (1). The agreement among the results of the several investigators is not very good. This is due to numerous causes, chief among them being the ever present uncertainty of the liquid junction potentials in the potentiometric studies, the difficulty of preparing compounds of sufficient purity and the neglect of certain corrections due to ionic activity. The first two named difficulties are mechanical in nature. A method of obviating the last was undertaken by Simms (2) in a series of titration experiments wherein he employed the BrSnsted and LaMer (3) limiting equation to obtain the activity coefficients of the ionic species involved. He worked with <b>glycocoll</b> and studied its dissociation in the presence of NaC 1 and BaC 12. The further electrometric titration of <b>glycocoll</b> and gelatin was conducted in the presence of certain antagonistic salt mixtures. The effect on the pH of the solution was complex. The present paper reports the potentiometric determination of the apparent acidic and basic dissociation constants of <b>glycocoll</b> and several peptides in aqueous solution. Measurements were also made in the presence of KC 1 or of K 2 SO ~ at equal ionic strength. Two methods, hydrolysis and titration, were employed. Hydrolysis afforded a basis of comparison of order of magnitude with the result...|$|E
40|$|The rate of {{production}} of CO 2 from sodium lactate when treated with H 2 O 2 may be increased {{by the addition of}} a compound containing a sulfhydryl group, i. e. cystine. A small part of this increase in rate of CO 2 is due to the action of the amino group as shown by the action of <b>glycocoll.</b> The results tend to show that the mode of action of H 2 O 2 is one of dehydrogenation and that the action of the cystine is comparable to the Atmungskörper of Meyerhof...|$|E
40|$|From {{the liver}} {{of a young}} man who died of typical, " idiopathic" acute yellow atrophy of the liver, after an illness of six weeks, there were {{isolated}} and identified the following amino acids: Histidin, lysin, tyrosin, leucin, <b>glycocoll,</b> alanin, prolin, glutaminic acid, aspartic acid. These were found free in extracts of the liver, and presumably represent products of the autolysis of liver cells, although the amount of soluble non-protein nitrogen present in the extracts was so large as to suggest that there must be some other source for these substances. Small quantities of free proteoses and peptones, and of xanthin and hypoxanthin, were also found in the extracts. In the insoluble proteins of the liver the proportion of diamino acids was decreased slightly as compared with normal livers. The proportion of protein phosphorus was increased, probably because of active regenerative proliferation, while the sulphur was normal in amount. Iron was increased because of the large quantity of blood in the liver and the hematogenous pigmentation of the liver cells. Gelatigenous material was increased both absolutely and relatively, because of the loss of parenchyma and the proliferation of the stroma. The proportion of water to solids was much increased, there having been a loss of over two-thirds of the entire parenchymatous elements of the liver. The amount of fat, lecithin and cholesterin was not far from that normal for the liver...|$|E
40|$|These {{experiments}} {{suggest the}} following conclusions concerning hemolytic action: 1. It {{is probably the}} proteid part of the serum which inhibits the bile salts. 2. The cholalic acid group is the active part of the bile salt molecule. 3. The protection afforded by bile salts against serum is of especial interest from the following considerations: (a) The protective action is a property apparently peculiar to proteids obtained from blood serum. It is not given satisfactorily by egg albumen. (b) The conjugation of cholalic acid with <b>glycocoll</b> {{in the formation of}} the bile salts is of some advantage to the organism. Although the toxicity of the cholalate for red corpuscles, when free from serum, is at most only slightly diminished by conjugation, yet the blood serum possesses a greater inhibiting action for the resulting glycocholate than for the original cholalate. 4. As compared with its inhibition of sodium glycocholate, normal serum possesses relatively little inhibiting action against certain foreign hemolytic agents, such as tetanus toxin, sodium benzoate, phenol and ethyl alcohol. 5. Hemolytic experiments afford a fairly general method for studying, in vitro, certain syntheses occurring in the body. They avoid, largely, the complications, such as rapid chemical alteration, which might occur in animal experimentation. Contrary to the results obtained with bile salts, the conjugation of benzoic acid and of phenol results in an effective reduction of their hemolytic action independently of the presence or absence of serum...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} amino acids, such as cysteine, cystine, tryptophane, <b>glycocoll,</b> aspartic acid, {{tyrosine}}, alanine, leucine and histidine, {{and also of}} gelatine-cleavage-products, which contain all amino acids except cysteine, cystine, tyrosine and tryptophane, upon the methods of determining sugar was studied. According {{to the results of}} experiments, cysteine, eystine and tryptophane behave as glucose and give more influence than glucose, when taken weight for weight, upon Bang 2 ̆ 7 s method. For instance, when 0. 3 mg. each of glucose, cystine, cysteine and tryptophane was subjected separately to Bang 2 ̆ 7 s method, 0. 76, 0. 98, 1. 02, and 0. 77 c. c. of 0. 01 N. KIO 3 were required respectively. The other amino acids examined have only a little or no effect. Cystine and cysteine show also a remarkable influence upon t h e methods of Polin-Wu, Benedict, Hagedorn, and Shaffer-Hartmann. An example will clearly indicate this relation : A sample, consisting of a mixtnre of 50 mg. each of glucose and Cystine, was subjected to the method§ of Benedict, Folin-Wu, Hagedorn, Shaffer-Hartmann, and Bang, and 73, 59, 76, 88, and 96 mg. of glucose respectively were obtained. Attention should be given to the results thus obtained in the determination of sugar in tissues and biological fluids, since cystine, cysteine, and their derivatives, as determined by many authors, are widely distributed in them. cystein, cystine 及び triptophane は各同量に於て比較すれば葡萄糖以上に BANG 法に影響する。又含硫黄アミノ酸は BENEDICT, FOLINWU, HAGEDORN, SHAFFER-HARTMANN 等の方法にも大に影響する。金屬鹽(特に銅鹽) の還元を利用する他の總ての砂糖定量法に對しても同樣の影響を有する事が推定出來る。cystein, cystine 並に其誘導體は廣く生物の組織並に體液に存在するから砂糖定量の際には大に此點を考慮せねばならぬ...|$|E
