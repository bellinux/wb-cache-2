25|$|So {{while all}} three {{statements}} are true, progressively {{more information is}} contained in each. In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the Big Theta notation (bullets number 3 in the lists above). For example, if T(n) represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size n, the inventors and users of the algorithm might {{be more inclined to}} put an upper asymptotic bound on <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take to run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.|$|E

25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up {{a significant portion of}} its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E
25|$|What, {{excepting}} torture, {{would produce}} insanity quicker than this treatment? Here is {{a class of}} women sent to be cured. I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E
25|$|A drug's {{distribution}} coefficient strongly affects how easily the drug can reach its intended {{target in the}} body, how strong an effect it will have once it reaches its target, and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> remain in the body in an active form. Hence, the log P of a molecule is one criterion used in decision-making by medicinal chemists in pre-clinical drug discovery, for example, {{in the assessment of}} druglikeness of drug candidates. Likewise, it is used to calculate lipophilic efficiency in evaluating the quality of research compounds, where the efficiency for a compound is defined as its potency, via measured values of pIC50 or pEC50, minus its value of log P.|$|E

2500|$|Wisconsin {{governor}} Jim Doyle {{announced on}} June 10 {{that the state}} would repair the lake. He described the lake as crucial to the billion-dollar Wisconsin Dells tourism area. Engineers with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) were studying the lake, and Doyle said it will only take about two weeks for water from the river to refill the [...] lake. It is unknown, however, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take to divert and correct the river's current path back into the lake. Dell Creek is still flowing down to the Wisconsin River, and the lake would be refilled from the creek, once the breach in the highway and collaterally damaged areas are repaired.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to several}} {{standard}} interpretations of quantum mechanics, microscopic phenomena are objectively random. That is, {{in an experiment}} that controls all causally relevant parameters, {{some aspects of the}} outcome still vary randomly. For example, if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled environment, it cannot be predicted <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> take for the atom to decay—only the probability of decay in a given time. Thus, quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities. [...] Hidden variable theories reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness: such theories posit that in the processes that appear random, properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes, determining the outcome in each case.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Owen was {{a social}} {{reformer}} and wealthy industrialist who made his fortune from textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland. Owen, his twenty-two-year-old son, William, and his Scottish friend Donald McDonald [...] sailed to the United States in 1824 to purchase a site to implement Owen's vision for [...] "a New Moral World" [...] of happiness, enlightenment, and prosperity through education, science, technology, and communal living. Owen believed his utopian community would create a [...] "superior social, intellectual and physical environment" [...] based on his ideals of social reform. Owen was motivated to buy the town {{in order to prove}} his theories were viable and to correct the troubles that were affecting his mill-town community New Lanark. The ready-built town of Harmony, Indiana, fit Owen's needs. In January 1825 he signed the agreement to purchase the town, renamed it New Harmony, and invited [...] "any and all" [...] to join him there. While many of the town's new arrivals had a sincere interest in making it a success, the experiment also attracted [...] "crackpots, free-loaders, and adventurers whose presence in the town made success unlikely." [...] William Owen, who remained in New Harmony while his father returned east to recruit new residents, also expressed concern in his diary entry, dated March 24, 1825: [...] "I doubt whether those who have been comfortable and content in their old mode of life, will find an increase of enjoyment when they come here. <b>How</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> require to accustom themselves to their new mode of living, I am unable to determine." ...|$|E
