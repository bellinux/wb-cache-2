5|$|Lemoine's work defined many of {{the noted}} traits of this movement. His Géométrographie and {{relation}} of equations to tetrahedrons and triangles, {{as well as his}} study of concurrencies and concyclities, contributed to the modern triangle <b>geometry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. The definition of points of the triangle such as the Lemoine point was also a staple of the geometry, and other modern triangle geometers such as Brocard and Gaston Tarry wrote about similar points.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the <b>geometry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the <b>geometry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E

Results from a linear elastic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure indicate that it is feasible in the lunar environment.

A computerized geometric modeling technique, using bicubic Bezier surfaces to generate <b>the</b> <b>geometries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inflatable structure, was conducted. Simulated results are used to create three-dimensional wire frames and solid renderings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inflatable structure.

5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for the <b>geometry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|The {{peculiar}} <b>geometry</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Uranian system {{causes the}} moons' poles to receive more solar energy than their equatorial regions. Because the vapor pressure of CO2 is a steep function of temperature, this {{may lead to}} the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the low-latitude regions of Titania, where it can stably exist on high albedo patches and shaded regions of the surface in the form of ice. During the summer, when the polar temperatures reach as high as 85–90 K, carbon dioxide sublimates and migrates to the opposite pole and to the equatorial regions, giving rise to a type of carbon cycle. The accumulated carbon dioxide ice can be removed from cold traps by magnetospheric particles, which sputter it from the surface. Titania is thought to have lost a significant amount of carbon dioxide since its formation 4.6 billion years ago.|$|E
