After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts to <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits {{in a very long}} line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E

He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions. [...] "I'd <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> and start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up," [...] he later recalled. He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops. [...] "We had Radio Shack mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft {{people in the audience}} to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape," [...] Beck recalled.|$|E

[...] Coach Scotty Bowman called it a [...] "must win game" [...] for Canada: [...] "We really are favorites in the final. [...] Nobody in this country will tolerate a loss." [...] The players also spoke of their desire to show the Soviets {{that they were the}} world's top hockey nation. During their pre-game preparations, Tikhonov called upon his team to play the finest games of their lives: [...] "Today you got to play so well that the entire Canadian population will talk about you afterwards and remember you for a long time. [...] Play so well that the Canadian fans when they will leave Forum will wait for you when you <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> after the game and admire you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, <b>get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. [...] "When you play a great team like that, you always have the chances of obviously this happening,” Dodge said. [...] "Give credit where credit is due – a great Oklahoma football team. Um ... Wow!

Despite enjoying only a modicum of commercial success and radio airplay, Kendricks's 1972 album People... Hold On (recorded with his touring group, The Young Senators, composed of Jimi Dougans, Frank Hooker, LeRoy Fleming, Wornell Jones, David Lecraft, James Drummer Johnson and John Engram) was a cornerstone of DJ playlists in downtown New York's nascent disco scene.

The single was later remade by R singer D'Angelo for the <b>Get</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> soundtrack.

40|$|Toshihiko Sakakibara, Zhuo Wang, Yuichi KasaiDepartment of Spinal Surgery and Medical Engineering, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu City, Mie Prefecture, JapanBackground: Low {{back pain}} {{is often called}} nonspecific pain. In this type of low back pain, various {{emotions}} and stress are known to strongly affect pain perception. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate how the degree of low back pain changes in people with chronic mild low back pain when they are inside and outside of an amusement park where people are supposed to have physical and psychological enjoyment. Methods: The subjects were 23 volunteers (13 males and 10 females) aged 18 to 46 years old with a mean age of 24. 0 years who had chronic low back pain. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores of low back pain and salivary amylase levels (kIU/L) of all subjects were measured at five time points: immediately after <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> heading for <b>the</b> amusement park; 10 minutes, 1 hour (immediately after boarding the roller coaster), and 3 hours (immediately after exiting the haunted house) after arriving at the amusement park; and immediately before getting off <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> returning from <b>the</b> park. Results: The three VAS values in the amusement park (10 minutes, 1 hour, and 3 hours after arriving at the amusement park) measured were significantly lower (P &lt; 0. 05) when compared with the other two values measured immediately after <b>getting</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> heading for <b>the</b> amusement park and immediately before getting off <b>the</b> return <b>bus.</b> In salivary amylase levels, there were no statistically significant differences among the values measured at the five time points. Conclusion: Low back pain was significantly alleviated when the subjects were in the amusement park, which demonstrated that enjoyable activities, though temporarily, alleviated their low back pain.
