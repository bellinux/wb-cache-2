According to Rolling Stones Erik Hedegaard, Collins in particular was blamed by those who accused the band of selling out. [...] Retrospectively, The New Rolling Stone Album Guide critic J. D. [...] Considine documented how the band had been [...] "largely ignored" [...] by the music press and public in their earliest years, before being [...] "derided as middlebrow throwbacks still in thrall to the pomposities of art rock" [...] in the late 1970s and then dismissed as [...] "easy-listening lightweights" [...] in the 1980s. He argued this was unfair, as the band had made their [...] "share of mediocre albums" [...] but no bad ones. Q reviewer Andy Fyfe wrote in 2007 that [...] "little of the band's output has aged well" [...] and [...] "transcends in the way real classics do", suggesting they would [...] "remain perennial whipping boys for decades to come."
