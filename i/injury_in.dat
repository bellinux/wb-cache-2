Due to the NHL lockout, which cancelled the first four months of the season, Kesler only missed 12 games. Within seven games, however, Kesler was back on the injured reserve with a broken foot. He initially sustained the <b>injury</b> <b>in</b> his first game against Dallas, but subsequent X-rays came back negative.
