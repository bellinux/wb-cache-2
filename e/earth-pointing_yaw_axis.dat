30|$|The leg {{unit has}} three {{degrees of freedom}} and {{consists}} of a planar mechanism with {{two degrees of freedom}} employing two pitch axes (Axis  2 and Axis  3), and a <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> (Axis  1) which rotates the planar mechanism. To reduce the inertia of the leg around the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis,</b> the actuators for pitch axes are placed close to the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> and transmit power to each joint by using wires.|$|R

40|$|A {{humanoid}} robot includes a torso, {{a pair of}} arms, a neck, a head, a wrist joint assembly, and a control system. The arms and the neck movably extend from the torso. Each of the arms includes a lower arm and a hand that is rotatable relative to the lower arm. The wrist joint assembly is operatively defined between the lower arm and the hand. The wrist joint assembly includes a <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> and a pitch axis. The pitch axis is disposed in a spaced relationship to the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> such that the axes are generally perpendicular. The pitch axis extends between the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> and the lower arm. The hand is rotatable relative to the lower arm about each of the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> and the pitch axis. The control system is configured for determining a yaw angle and a pitch angle of the wrist joint assembly...|$|R

3000|$|In the {{experimental}} results shown below, the input torque {{is given by}} RFiri to eliminate {{the influence of the}} reduction ratio. The maximum pitch axis input torque is approximately 140  mNm, and the maximum <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> input torque is approximately 100  mNm. The input torque is determined by the ratio of the lengths from the pitch <b>axis</b> and the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> to the tip, which is 24.45 [...] mm: 17.5 mm [...] 1.4 : 1.|$|R

Subjects were rotated with eyes {{open in the}} dark, using clockwise and counter-clockwise 60 deg velocity trapezoids. The nystagmus slow component velocity is analyzed. It is shown that, despite large intersubject variability, parameters which describe earth-horizontal <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> responses are loosely interrelated, {{and some of them}} vary significantly with gender and age...|$|R

30|$|Although the {{gripping}} {{and releasing}} torques in the gripper axis have no {{influence on the}} first axis driving torque, the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> torque does interfere with the first axis driving torque. Therefore, the first axis drive system must be designed with enough drive torque and stiffness of the joints to overcome increases in angular moment when the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> interferes with the pitch axis. To increase the joint stiffness, stiffer wires and large-diameter pulleys can be used. The kinematics of the proposed wrist mechanism is almost the same as conventional clinical use articulated forceps [7].|$|R
50|$|Rudder pedals control {{rotation}} of the plane about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b> There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward, and vice versa. The pilot presses on the right rudder pedal to make the plane yaw to the right, and pushes on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left. The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns, or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{falling leaf}} is a {{controlled}} stall {{performed in a}} fixed-wing aircraft. The maneuver is performed by purposely stalling the airplane and then carefully using the rudder to try to hold the aircraft on a steady course. The falling leaf consists of a constant rotation about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> while continually changing the direction. This is opposed to a flat spin, where the aircraft constantly rotates around its <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> in only one direction, similar to a Frisbee. The falling leaf is sometimes described as carefully [...] "walking" [...] the aircraft while stalled. The maneuver is typically performed mostly with the rudder, trimming with the elevator but keeping the ailerons neutral.|$|R
50|$|The vertical/Z <b>axis,</b> or <b>yaw</b> <b>axis,</b> is an {{imaginary}} line running vertically through {{the ship and}} through its centre of gravity. A yaw motion is a side-to side {{movement of the bow}} and stern of the ship.|$|R
5000|$|In case of land {{vehicles}} like cars, tanks etc., {{which use}} the ENU-system (East-North-Up) as external reference (world frame), the vehicle's positive y- or pitch axis always points to its left, and the positive z- or <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> always points up.|$|R
30|$|Contrastingly, in {{the case}} of the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis,</b> the {{efficiency}} gently decreases, and the no-load torque increases, which are caused by increasing friction between the wire and the arc-shaped guides associated with the wire pass length error and increase in winding angle.|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the YA-19 design was its horizontal stabiliser located forward of the vertical tail. The small size of the vertical stabilizer caused some directional instability (about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis)</b> so the last YA-19 (S/N 38-555) was equipped with enlarged vertical stabilizer.|$|R
5000|$|Flat spin - Also called {{unrecoverable}} spin (although in {{some instances}} recovery may be possible), it occurs when both rotation around the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> and side-slip dominate, and the nose attitude remains level or nearly so resulting in the aircraft assuming a Frisbee or boomerang-like motion.|$|R
5000|$|By contrast, {{in case of}} air and sea {{vehicles}} like submarines, ships, airplanes etc., {{which use}} the NED-system (North-East-Down) as external reference (world frame), the vehicle's positive y- or pitch axis always points to its right, and its positive z- or <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> always points down.|$|R
40|$|In a strapped-down {{gyroscope}} {{space vehicle}} attitude control system, a method and apparatus are provided for gyro drift and input axis misalignment error compensation employing a sun and a star tracker and preselected vehicle calibration maneuvers. The outputs of two-axis strapped-down gyroscopes nominally {{aligned with the}} optical axis {{of the sun and}} star trackers are measured to provide gyro drift calibration, roll, pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> scale factors and values corresponding to the degree of nonorthogonality between the roll axis and the pitch and yaw gyro input axes and the nonorthogonality of the roll and pitch axes relative to the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b> The vehicle is then rolled and yawed through precomputed angles as modified by the calibrated data stored in a digital computer, and acquires a target without recourse to external references...|$|R

50|$|The first {{application}} of the CORE architecture was a 2 degree of freedom (roll and pitch) extruded aluminum chassis. This prototype design provided proof of concept and a testing sled for incorporating software motion integrations including physics based racing and flight simulation. A tubular aluminum chassis was later fabricated allowing for {{the addition of the}} <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> has {{its origin}} {{at the center}} of gravity and is {{directed}} towards the bottom of the aircraft, perpendicular to the wings and to the fuselage reference line. Motion about this <b>axis</b> is called <b>yaw.</b> A positive yawing motion moves the nose of the aircraft to the right. The rudder is the primary control of yaw.|$|R
50|$|Consider {{a case of}} a level sensing {{platform}} on an aircraft flying due north with its three gimbal axes mutually perpendicular (i.e., roll, pitch and yaw angles each zero). If the aircraft pitches up 90 degrees, the aircraft and platform's <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> gimbal becomes parallel to the roll axis gimbal, and changes about yaw can no longer be compensated for.|$|R

30|$|When two bending axes (a {{pitch axis}} {{orthogonal}} to the shaft <b>axis</b> and a <b>yaw</b> <b>axis,</b> or vice versa) or a bending axis (pitch <b>axis</b> or <b>yaw)</b> and a roll axis are used, the bending and rolling motions are decoupled {{from each other}} using power transmission parts such as wires, pulleys, links, and gears. However, compared to the interference mechanisms, more parts are required in the noninterference mechanisms.|$|R
30|$|The {{articulated}} leg {{consists of}} a main body {{on top of the}} two leg parts: the thigh and the shank. The latter is connected with a damping foot by means of a steel spring which stores the released impact energy which is then used for the upwards acceleration. The joints connecting these bodies are the knee, the hip and the joint rotating the thigh around the main body’s <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|R
40|$|A piloted, fixed-base {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate the handling qualities requirements for helicopter air-to-air combat using turreted guns in the near-terrain environment. The study used a version of the helicopter air combat system developed at NASA Ames Research Center for one-on-one air combat. The study focused on the potential trade-off between gun angular movement capability and required <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> response. Experimental variables included <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> response frequency and damping {{and the size of the}} gun-movement envelope. A helmet position and sighting system was used for pilot control of gun aim. Approximately 340 simulated air combat engagements were evaluated by pilots from the Army and industry. Results from the experiment indicate that a highly-damped, high frequency yaw response was desired for Level I handling qualities. Pilot preference for those characteristics became more pronounced as gun turret movement was restricted; however, a stable, slow-reacting platform could be used with a large turret envelope. Most pilots preferred to engage with the opponent near the own-ship centerline. Turret elevation restriction affected the engagement more than azimuth restrictions...|$|R
30|$|The {{structure}} of the leg is aluminum that is reinforced and supplemented with inserts. Hip and knee joints are equipped with steel bevel gears which transmit the motion from the motor shaft to its orthogonal axis, while the joint of the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> has plastic planar gears which transmit the motion from the motor shaft to its parallel axis. The sensors in the leg include a rotary optical encoder for each motor to sense the joints of hip, knee and <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b> In addition, current sensors are {{used to measure the}} joint’s torques. The maximum leg extension is about 60 cm (thigh and shank) with a total leg mass of approximatively 8 kg (the component weights, in kg, are leg structure 3.5, geared motor 0.9, bevel gear in steel 0.4, couple of plastic planar gears 0.14, spring 0.15, battery-pack 0.66). The powered leg additionally includes a custom embedded control system, whose components are located in the main body on top. The devices of the embedded control system are the MCU board, the DC motor drivers and DC/DC converters.|$|R
50|$|A yaw {{rotation}} is {{a movement}} around the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> of a rigid body that changes the direction it is pointing, {{to the left or}} right of its direction of motion. The yaw rate or yaw velocity of a car, aircraft, projectile or other rigid body is the angular velocity of this rotation, or rate of change of the heading angle when the aircraft is horizontal. It is commonly measured in degrees per second or radians per second.|$|R
