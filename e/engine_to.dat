5|$|In November 2012, REL {{announced}} that it would commence work upon a three-and-a-half-year project to develop and build a test rig of the Sabre <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> prove its performance across both the air-breathing and rocket modes.|$|E
5|$|The R-95Sh engines {{have been}} {{overhauled}} and modified with an anti-surge system installed. The {{system is designed}} to improve {{the resistance of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> ingested powders and gases during gun and rocket salvo firing.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge for}} this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This {{was overcome by}} reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing737 with CFM56 engines.|$|E
50|$|NOTE: Moto3 {{was known}} as the 125cc class until 2011, when the FIM changed the formula from 125cc {{two-stroke}} <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> 250cc four-stroke <b>engines.</b> Moto2 {{was known as}} the 250cc class until 2009, when the FIM changed the formula from 250cc two-stroke <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> a one-make 600cc four-stroke Honda engine class (chassis are open competition), with the FIM planning in 2016 to open the 600cc <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> multiple manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|The LNER {{divided the}} NBR K class into four classes, as below. It was common {{practice}} for the North British Railway <b>to</b> assign similar <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> the same class group, whereas the LNER system allowed only identical <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> bear the same class designation.|$|R
5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> arrive on the scene. Braidwood had called for the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. Baking soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as {{the water from the}} Grail washes it away.|$|E

5|$|Just {{outside the}} main walls, the castle mills had become {{increasingly}} ineffective from the 16th century onwards {{because of a}} reduction in the flow of the rivers driving the water-wheels. As a result, in 1778 they were rebuilt with a new steam <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> drive the machinery; this steam engine caused considerable discomfort to the prisoners affected by the smoke and noise.|$|E
5|$|Kojima Productions {{used their}} game engine, the Fox <b>Engine,</b> <b>to</b> develop P.T.. Hideo Kojima's {{intention}} when creating P.T. was to scare {{people in a}} unique way, {{as well as to}} deliver an interactive teaser experience instead of releasing trailers and screenshots of Silent Hills.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Merlin's {{technical}} improvements {{resulted from}} more efficient superchargers, designed by Stanley Hooker, {{and the introduction}} of aviation fuel with increased octane ratings. Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices.|$|E

5|$|Mount Sion Mill along Sion Street {{was founded}} in the early 19th century and during the First World War {{manufactured}} guncotton. A weir was constructed along with a goit, used to turn a water wheel which powered a beam <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> pump water to the reservoirs above.|$|E
5|$|On {{compatible}} systems, the Microsoft Windows version uses Nvidia's PhysX software <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> {{produce more}} realistic, dynamic {{interactions with the}} game world.

5|$|Other {{commercial}} {{programs were}} released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso, a vector drawing program with page-layout features which was ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows as Aldus FreeHand v4, and the Lotus Improv spreadsheet program.

5|$|Production {{ended in}} 1967 {{soon after the}} Rootes Group {{was taken over by}} Chrysler, which did not have a {{suitable}} <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> replace the Ford V8. Owing to the ease and affordability of modifying the Tiger, there are few surviving cars in standard form.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 fan {{features}} dovetailed {{fan blades}} which {{allows them to}} be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/SNECMA claim that the CFM56 was the first <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few fan blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{development}} was made more simple {{by the use}} of the same game <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> that of its predecessor, though extra dialogue was involved due to the presence of four factions rather than the three in Geneforge.

5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining an inverted differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several engine {{failures}} in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of the <b>engine</b> <b>to</b> be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell's hydromechanical unit.|$|E
25|$|Ferrari {{has always}} {{produced}} engines {{for its own}} Formula One cars, and has also supplied <b>engines</b> <b>to</b> other teams.
