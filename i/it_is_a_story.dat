25|$|The {{criterion}} of embarrassment {{is also used}} to argue in favor of the historicity of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Based on this criterion, given that John baptised for the remission of sins, and Jesus was viewed as without sin, the invention of this story would have served no purpose, and would have been an embarrassment given that it positioned John above Jesus.|$|E
25|$|S. L. Bhyrappa, {{a charismatic}} young writer, {{first came to}} {{attention}} in the 1960s with his first novel Dharmasri, although it was his Vamsavriksha ("Family Tree", 1966) that {{put him in the}} spotlight as one of Kannada's most popular novelists. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a respected scholar, Srinivasa Srotri, his family and their long-held values. The protagonist's young and widowed daughter-in-law wishes to remarry, putting his family tradition at risk. Bhyrappa's best novel of the period was Grihabhanga ("Breaking of a Home", 1970), a story of a woman surviving under tragic circumstances. The characters in the story are rustic and often use vulgar language. His other important novel is Parva, a major work in Kannada fiction acclaimed as an admirable attempt at recreating life on the sub-continent {{during the time of the}} epic Mahabharata.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of John the Baptist {{within the same}} time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and {{the overwhelming majority of}} modern scholars view Josephus' accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.|$|E

25|$|The {{parable of}} the blind men and an {{elephant}} originated in ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has widely diffused. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{of a group of}} blind men, who have never come across an elephant before, learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels {{a different part of the}} elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is. In some versions they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to project their partial experiences as the whole truth, ignore other people's partial experiences, and one should consider that one may be partially right and may have partial information.|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson later {{remarked that}} [...] "Johari Window" [...] was a [...] "stand-alone" [...] episode in an interview: [...] "There is nothing from that thing that {{broadens}} the story, {{except at the}} heart of <b>it,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about love and acceptance and family... Which of course, for these two guys, is the entire theme of the show for them. So I think we've done that really well". Actor John Noble added, [...] "Tolerance. Acceptance. I loved 'Johari Window'. I thought it was one of my favourite stories".|$|E
500|$|According to Rayfield, [...] "'The Student' is {{a perfect}} example in {{miniature}} of Chekhov's art, and it bridges the gap between the ecstatic mood of the [...] and steppe stories of 1886–7 and the lyricism of the prose of the 1900s." [...] "'The Student' is only a few pages long, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of extraordinary economy, beauty, and power", wrote James N. Loehlin. He continued that the story [...] "not only describes the power of narrative to evoke spiritual truth, it embodies it". Kerry McSweeney wrote that Ivan's revelation at the story's end may also provide a similar feeling of epiphany to the reader, writing that [...] "What is central is the continuing power of Chekhov's artwork to establish connections–to forge new links in a living chain that is not vertical, timeless, and sacred but horizontal, temporal and secular." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Kevin Williamson {{had little}} {{interest}} in developing the series, finding the premise too similar to other vampire tales. However, at the urging of Julie Plec, he began to read the novels and started to become intrigued by the story: [...] "I began to realize that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about <b>a</b> small town, about that town's underbelly and about what lurks under the surface." [...] Williamson has stated the town's story will be the main focus of the series rather than high school.|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] was the first song she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). Production and additional writing on the songs were done by Greg Wells, who previously worked with the singer on her second studio album, One of the Boys (2008). Perry considers it {{to be like that}} of a two-part song because she had started working on [...] "Not Like the Movies" [...] before she met Brand, and completed it after they began dating. She stated it is a [...] "really special" [...] song to her because, at {{the first part of the}} track, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> that she needed to let out, which was claiming to know something that you do not actually know. Perry later expressed relief at being able to put all of her feelings into [...] "Not Like the Movies".|$|E
500|$|With {{the rise}} of feminist {{literary}} criticism in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly Frankenstein, began to attract much more attention from scholars. Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were {{largely responsible for the}} recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer. Ellen Moers {{was one of the first}} to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein. She argues that the novel is a [...] "birth myth" [...] in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar Anne K. Mellor suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> [...] "about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman... is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a [...] "parent" [...] in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.|$|E
500|$|Others, like {{journalist}} Nick Gillespie, see The Great Gatsby {{as a story}} [...] "underlying {{permanence of}} class differences; {{even in the face}} of a modern economy's attempt to assert that the class structure is based; not on status and inherited position; but, upon the innovation and the ability of literally anyone, to succeed by meeting the ever-changing demands and tastes of consumers' needs." [...] This interpretation asserts that The Great Gatsby captures the American experience because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about change and those who resist it; whether the change comes in the form of a new wave of immigrants (Southern Europeans in the early 20th century, Latin Americans today), the nouveau riche, or successful minorities, Americans from the 1920s to modern day have plenty of experience with changing economic and social circumstances. As Gillespie states, [...] "While the specific terms of the equation are always changing, it's easy to see echoes of Gatsbys basic conflict between established sources of economic and cultural power and upstarts in virtually all aspects of American society." [...] Because this concept is particularly American and can be seen throughout American history, readers are able to relate to The Great Gatsby (which has lent the novel an enduring popularity).|$|E

Channel 2 bought the rights to the series and Loevy directed it for them. Nevertheless, Loevy insists, [...] "I had no intention of settling accounts with Channel 1. I love them like family."

500|$|Team of Rivals was {{generally}} well received by critics. Pulitzer Prize-winning Civil War historian James M. McPherson called it [...] "an elegant, incisive study of Lincoln and leading {{members of his}} cabinet that will appeal to experts {{as well as to}} those whose knowledge of Lincoln is an amalgam of high school history and popular mythology" [...] and stated that Goodwin addressed Lincoln's gift for coalition-building [...] "better than any other writer". Allen C. Guelzo wrote in The Washington Post that [...] "this immense, finely boned book is no dull administrative or bureaucratic history; rather, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of personalities – a messianic drama, if you will – in which Lincoln must increase and the others must decrease." [...] In the Seattle Times, Kimberly Marlowe Hartnett praised the book's [...] "ambitious, multi-strand structure", concluding, [...] "This monumental effort is a gift; Goodwin's work clarifies and preserves Lincoln's legacy with rare skill." [...] Randy Dotinga of the Christian Science Monitor called Team of Rivals an [...] "immense and immensely readable work". Sanford D. Horwitt of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Goodwin is [...] "an engaging, insightful chronicler of Lincoln's Civil War presidency, although she strays from time to time from her stated intention of keeping the lens focused on Lincoln and his 1860 rivals, who, in turn, were often feuding with others in Lincoln's Cabinet." ...|$|E
500|$|Stelter {{described}} Frank and Claire Underwood as a [...] "scheming" [...] couple. Michael Dobbs, {{the author}} of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based, compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries, and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Underwood has strong feelings for Claire, and frequently plots with her at night. He says, [...] "I love that woman. I love her more than sharks love blood." [...] While Underwood is Machiavellian, Claire, like Lady Macbeth, encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice-queen wife. She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness, saying, [...] "My husband doesn’t apologize... even to me." [...] Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis. Smith says [...] "The Underwoods have proven themselves ruthless, manipulative, and robotic in their pursuit and lust of power." [...] Upon viewing a four-episode preview of season 2, Goodman says the series [...] "...sells husband and wife power-at-all-costs couple...as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone's good." [...] Willimon notes that [...] "What's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect, but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules {{than the rest of us}} typically do." [...] Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels, but most importantly between Underwood and Claire. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about a man who will commit any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power.|$|E
