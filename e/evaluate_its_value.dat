40|$|AIMS: Invasive lobular {{carcinoma}} of the breast (ILC) {{is known to be}} substantially underestimated by mammography, which makes correct planning of treatment difficult. MRI has been proposed as a valuable adjunct to mammography. The purpose of the current study is to <b>evaluate</b> <b>its</b> <b>value,</b> compare it to mammography and assess the possible causes of over- and underestimation of lesion size on MRI. METHOD: The mammograms and MRI scans of 67 consecutive patients with ILC were retrieved and re-evaluated. Size measurements were correlated to the sizes extracted from the pathology report. RESULTS: MRI measurements correlated better to pathologic size (r= 0. 85) than mammographic measurements (r= 0. 27). Underestimation of tumour size was more common on mammography (p< 0. 001); overestimation occurred with equal frequency (p= 0. 69). Overestimation on MRI, caused by non-malignant findings, was attributed to enhancing lobular carcinoma in situ. CONCLUSION: MRI is a more accurate modality for determining tumour size in patients with ILC than mammography. The typical underestimation of lesion size by mammography can be prevented with the aid of MRI, without increasing the risk of lesion overestimation...|$|E

METHODS: Eighty two cases of FIGO Stage IB/IIA uterine cervical carcinoma were studied retrospectively. The tumours had been previously typed into adenocarcinomas, squamous carcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas after the tissue had been fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. p 53 protein expression was assessed using a standard immunohistochemical technique and the findings were correlated with tumour type, lymph node status and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In total, the p 53 gene product was overexpressed in 17. 1 % (14 / 82) of all carcinomas and also in areas of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III adjacent to invasive squamous carcinoma. Where present, the normal epithelium was uniformly negative. No association was found between p 53 overexpression and tumour subtype, lymph node status or clinical outcome.

40|$|Objective: The {{intensive}} {{nature of}} a 5 - or 6 -week teaching block poses unique problems for adequate delivery of content. This {{study was designed to}} compare the delivery of a unit of undergraduate neuroanatomy in a short summer school period, as a traditionally taught unit, with a rendition given {{in the form of the}} "Flipped Classroom. " The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in the intensive mode classroom. Methods: The flipped classroom encompassed the same learning outcomes, but students were responsible for covering the content at home in preparation for tutorials that applied their acquired knowledge to higher levels of thinking. The main outcome measures were the final course grades and the level of satisfaction with the course. Results: There were no significant differences between the 2 cohorts in final grades (p =. 259), self-rated knowledge (p =. 182), or overall satisfaction with the course (p =. 892). Conclusion: This particular design of the flipped classroom did not add value to the intensive mode experience.

Amino acids content {{was determined by}} LKB 4101 automatic analyzer and that of fatty acids by Chrompack CP 9000 chromatograph, using a flame ionizing detector. Protein contents amounted to 1. 18 and 39. 24 % of fresh and dry mass, respectively.

Raw fat and fibre contents in dry weight were 4. 98 and 4. 32 %, respectively, which is suitable for the commercial carp breeding. Methionine and phenylalanine are partially in deficit, whereas other essential amino acids identified in dry mass of Daphnia magna were present in amounts adequate for all carp categories. The proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in lipids of Daphnia magna were 18. 70 and 66. 20 %, respectively.

So the requirement of establishing an efficient numerical scheme for the computation of the finite order rank-one convex envelopes arises.

The approximate k-th order rank-one convex envelope Rkf is obtained iteratively by computing the approximate 1 -st order rank-one convex envelope of the numerical approx-imation of Rk− 1 f. Compared with O(h 1 / 3) obtained so far for other methods, the optimal convergence rate O(h) is established for our scheme, and numerical examples illustrate the computational efficiency of the scheme. 1...|$|R

By analyzing 43 consecutively drawn serum samples from 10 pregnant women who seroconverted, we could show that specific IgE antibodies seem to appear early after infection and are usually present for less than 3 to 5 months. Therefore, we assumed that IgE antibodies seem to be detectable only during the acute or reactivated stage of infection. According to our studies, the IgE ISAGA has an overall sensitivity of only 79. 5 %, but a specificity of 98. 0 %, with positive and negative predictive values of 95. 5 and 89. 8 %, respectively. Detection of IgE antibodies in immunosuppressed patients with reactivation of latent T. gondii infection correlates with disease activity. Despite these encouraging results, one must note that IgE antibodies were not detectable in 4 of 14 patients with very recent infection proven by seroconversion.

Methods: Forty patients with pleural effusion, 19 males and 21 females, {{with a mean age of}} 55. 960  ±  6. 835  years, were classified into transudative and exudative groups. All patients were subjected to thorough history, clinical examination, radiological examination, laboratory investigations, sputum for acid fast bacilli, tuberculin test, thoracocentesis and occasionally pleural biopsy or thoracoscopy and both serum and pleural fluid VEGF were measured in all patients. Results: There was a significant difference between exudate and transudate regarding serum and pleural fluid VEGF levels that were higher in exudates than transudate. In comparison between the subtypes of exudative effusion, there was higher concentration of VEGF in pleural of malignant than tuberculous, parapneumonic, and collagen exudative effusion.
