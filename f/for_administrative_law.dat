40|$|The {{concept of}} the rule of law ties {{together}} the seemingly disparate strands of <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> Indeed, the puzzles and tensions that <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> evokes cannot be understood without recourse to this foundational concept. This chapter discusses several of the key attributes {{of the rule of}} law and explores their relevance <b>for</b> Canadian <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> <b>for</b> example: the rule of law as an unwritten constitutional principle; the rule of law as a political ideal which structures institutional relations and competencies; and, the rule of law as a distinctive political morality. The chapter assesses the Canadian articulation {{of the rule of law}} in the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada, then turns to the contemporary judicial review of administrative action. Recent case law illustrates how the rule of law informs how judges engage with statutes, motivates deference to other branches of government, and facilitates the creation of common law constraints on judicial discretion. <b>For</b> Canadian <b>administrative</b> <b>law,</b> the rule of law is best conceived as a principle which gives rise to an open set of institutional practices entailing shared responsibility for upholding its content. This responsibility is distributed within and among coordinate institutions in the Canadian state...|$|R
50|$|The {{system of}} courts in Austria {{interpreting}} and applying Austrian law {{is marked by}} a division between ordinary courts, dealing with criminal and civil cases, and public law tribunals <b>for</b> constitutional <b>law,</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> and asylum law.

50|$|It is {{important}} to realise that the Netherlands {{does not have a}} traditional separation of powers: according to the constitution the States General and the government (the King and cabinet) share the legislative power. All legislation has to pass through the Council of State (Dutch: Raad van State) for advice and the Social-Economic Council advises the government on most social-economic legislation. The executive power is reserved for government. Note however that the Social-Economic Council has the special right to make and enforce legislation on several sectors, mostly in agriculture. The judicial power is divided into two separate systems of courts. For civil and criminal law the independent Supreme Court is the highest court. <b>For</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> the Raad van State is the highest court, which is ex officio chaired by the King.|$|E
50|$|The {{legislative}} {{branch of government}} is represented nationally by the Congress, a bicameral institution comprising a 166-seat Chamber of Representatives and a 102-seat Senate. The Senate is elected nationally and the Chamber of Representatives is elected in electoral districts. Members of both houses are elected to serve four-year terms {{two months before the}} president, also by popular vote.The judicial branch is headed by four high courts, consisting of the Supreme Court which deals with penal and civil matters, the Council of State, which has special responsibility <b>for</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> and also provides legal advice to the executive, the Constitutional Court, responsible for assuring the integrity of the Colombian constitution, and the Superior Council of Judicature, responsible for auditing the judicial branch. Colombia operates a system of civil law, which since 2005 has been applied through an adversarial system.|$|E

50|$|When {{it comes}} to civil and {{criminal}} cases, the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) {{is at the top}} of the hierarchy of courts. The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems, each topped by a high court; these are the Bundessozialgericht (Federal Social Court) for matters of social security, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) for employment and labour, the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Fiscal Court) for taxation and financial issues, and the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) <b>for</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> The so-called Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtshöfe (Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts) is not a supreme court in itself, but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court. As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility, situations like these are rather rare and so, the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently, and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory.|$|E
50|$|Constitutionally, the King is head {{of state}} and has {{a role in the}} {{formation}} of government and in the legislative process. He has to co-sign every law to make it valid. The monarch is also ex officio chair of the Council of State, which advises the cabinet on every piece of legislation and is the final court <b>for</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> Although the King takes these functions seriously, he refrains from exerting his power in these positions. The King also plays {{a central role in the}} formation of a cabinet after general elections or a cabinet crisis. Since coalition cabinets of two or more parties are the rule, this process has influence on government policy for years to come. He appoints the (in)formateur, who chairs the formation talks, after consulting the leaders of all parties represented in parliament. When the formation talks have been concluded the King appoints the cabinet. Because this advice is a matter of public record, the King can not easily take a direction which is contrary to the advice of a majority in parliament. On the other hand, what is actually talked about behind the closed doors of the palace is not known. When a cabinet falls, the prime minister has to request the King to dismiss the cabinet.|$|E
5000|$|This {{case was}} then {{used as a}} {{precedent}} for several other hostage scenarios outside of formal armed conflict. In 2001 Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig awarded the POW Medal to the thirteen USMC embassy guards held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran during the Iran Hostage Crisis. [...] According to the Navy's Deputy Assistant Judge Advocate General <b>for</b> <b>Administrative</b> <b>Law,</b> the Marines held in Tehran were [...] "entitled to award of the medal if the Secretary determines that circumstances under which they were held captive were 'comparable to those under which persons have generally been held captive by enemy armed forces during periods of armed conflict.'" [...] Similarly, in 2003 USAF Secretary James G. Roche authorized the POW Medal to all [...] "U.S. Air Force personnel taken hostage anytime {{during the period of}} 4 November 1979 to 22 January 1981, at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran." [...] According to Roche, the USAF hostages qualified because [...] "they were held by a foreign armed force hostile to the United States and were under circumstances comparable to prisoners held by enemy forces during periods of armed conflict," [...] a clear reference to the 1989 amendment. [...] The qualification of the USAF hostages was reviewed by Richard Peterson of the Air Force Office of the Judge Advocate General.|$|E
2500|$|Justices Marie Deschamps and Rosalie Abella wrote a concurring opinion. [...] While {{they agreed}} with Charron's {{decision}} {{to overturn the}} ban on the kirpan, {{they found that the}} proper way to do this was through the rules of <b>administrative</b> <b>law.</b> [...] Constitutional law should be used primarily for statutes and regulations, and the tests used in constitutional law, such as the Oakes test, work best on these laws. [...] Section 1 of the Charter indicates the Oakes test best applies to decisions [...] "prescribed by law." [...] Meanwhile, <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> would work when dealing with what in this case was an administrative body. [...] Following the Trinity Western University case and Chamberlain v. Surrey School District No. 36, Charron and Abella also felt a measure of deference was appropriate. [...] There was also indication that the law meant for local authorities rather than courts to have a greater say in such matters. [...] At any rate, Descamps and Abella found that [...] "it is difficult to imagine a decision that would be considered reasonable or correct even though it conflicted with constitutional values." [...] The ideal situation would be <b>for</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>laws</b> to apply Charter values rather than to have their decisions challenged as violations of the Charter.|$|R

50|$|Generally speaking, most {{countries}} that follow {{the principles of}} common law have developed procedures for judicial review that limit the reviewability of decisions made by <b>administrative</b> <b>law</b> bodies.
