25|$|Bryant's {{motivation}} for the massacre remains a closely guarded secret, known only to his lawyer, who is bound not to reveal confidences without his client's consent. The lawyer later released a book outlining that Bryant was motivated largely by the media reports of the then-recent Dunblane school massacre. From the moment he was captured, he continually wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed {{to listen to music}} on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.|$|E

500|$|Bolt {{failed to}} record below 10 seconds early season {{and had his}} first major 100m race of 2013 at the Golden Gala in June. He was served an {{unexpected}} defeat by Justin Gatlin, with the American winning 9.94 to Bolt's 9.95. Bolt denied the loss was due a hamstring issue he had early that year and Gatlin responded: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> have beaten Bolt but it's an honour". With Yohan Blake injured, Bolt won the Jamaican 100m title ahead of Kemar Bailey-Cole and skipped the 200m, which was won by Warren Weir. Prior to the 2013 World Championships in Athletics, Bolt set world leading times in the sprints, with 9.85 for the 100m at the London Anniversary Games and 19.73 for the 200m in Paris.|$|E

2500|$|Just as freegans argue {{food waste}} should be {{recovered}} and redistributed, many argue that unoccupied buildings are {{a form of}} [...] "waste" [...] to be reclaimed. Squatting was widespread in Western Europe as well as parts of the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, and activists used squatted buildings not only for housing but also to create community centers, pirate radio stations, or free schools. A widespread crackdown by municipalities closed many squats and legalized the remainder in the 1990s—the moment when freeganism was emerging—and so it is thus difficult to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> {{are involved in this}} activity. While research with freegans consistently shows that they endorse squatting, in practice freegan living situations vary, ranging from trading work for rent to traditional home ownership.|$|E
2500|$|After the semi-final, {{the voting}} method {{used during the}} show was commented upon, with the {{non-qualifying}} artists finding the results [...] "weird and not right". The voting method saw the televotes of 10 regions of Lithuania being converted into points, 1 point for the least favoured and 12 for the most preferred. Alanas, who failed to qualify to the final, said that she found the voting [...] "very bizarre", {{and that she would}} like to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>people</b> voted for her. Augustė, who also failed to qualify, called it [...] "nonsense", commentating on the difference in the amount of votes cast in Vilnius in comparison to smaller towns in Lithuania: [...] "I don't understand how can we compare points of Vilnius and of some small city in Lithuania. In Vilnius we need thousands of votes to get 12 points. Meanwhile in a small city a hundred votes can be enough".|$|E
