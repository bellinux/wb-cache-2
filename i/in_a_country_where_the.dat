Afghanistan–Pakistan border skirmishes intensified and many large scale attacks by the Pakistan-based Haqqani Network also took place across Afghanistan.

25|$|The first {{extensive}} Jewish emigration from Western Europe to Poland {{occurred at}} the time of the First Crusade in 1098. Under Bolesław III (1102–1139), the Jews, encouraged by the tolerant regime of this ruler, settled throughout Poland, including over the border in Lithuanian territory as far as Kiev. Bolesław III recognized the utility of Jews in the development of the commercial interests of his country. Jews came to form the backbone of the Polish economy. Mieszko III employed Jews in his mint as engravers and technical supervisors, and the coins minted during that period even bear Hebraic markings. Jews worked on commission for the mints of other contemporary Polish princes, including Casimir the Just, Bolesław I the Tall and Władysław III Spindleshanks. Jews enjoyed undisturbed peace and prosperity in the many principalities into which the country was then divided; they formed the middle class <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> general population consisted of landlords (developing into szlachta, the unique Polish nobility) and peasants, and they were instrumental in promoting the commercial interests of the land.|$|E

Human Rights Watch, Front Line, The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy also advocated on Dhondup Wangchen's behalf.

In August 2016, Valve changed its gifting policy to require that games with VAC and Game Ban-enabled games to be gifted immediately to another Steam user, which also served to combat players that worked around VAC and Game Bans, while in May 2017, Valve expanded this policy to all games. The changes also placed limitations on gifts between users of different countries if there is a large difference in pricing for the game between two different regions.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} glaring {{reflections}} of the harshness of the regime in Asmara, the Eritrean capital, is the mandatory military service that citizens on average serve from 18 to 55 and which has spurred many to flee. Amnesty International notes that <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> average life expectancy is 61 or 62, this means many spend their entire adult lives in the army, frequently facing hard labor and meager wages. Women have fled the army because they are denied the opportunity {{to start a family}} if they remain in the Eritrean military, and Eritrean army officers also have the right to have sex with subordinate female soldiers, as it's not legally considered rape. Every month about 3,000 people flee the East African country.

[...] In addition, the distribution of firearms to village self-defence militias intended to repel Vietcong guerrillas resulted in weapons only being given to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies, and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of Buddhist pagodas occurred. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse in order to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diệm's regime.|$|E

2500|$|The Venezuelan presidential [...] {{election}} of 1998, {{was held on}} 6 December 1998, to elect {{the new president of}} the country. The main candidates were Hugo Chávez, a career military officer who led a coup d'état against then-president Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992; and former Carabobo Governor Henrique Salas Römer. Both candidates represented newly formed parties, a first <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> main candidates always represented the parties of the Punto Fijo Pact. Chávez represented MVR, while Salas Römer represented Project Venezuela. Initially weak in the polls, Chávez ran on an anti-corruption and anti-poverty platform, condemning the two major parties that had dominated Venezuelan politics since 1958; and began to gain ground in the polls after the previous front runners faded. Despite the fact that the major parties (COPEI and Democratic Action) endorsed Salas Römer, {{in the end it was}} not enough, and Chávez won in a landslide. Chávez was elected to his first term as President of Venezuela with the largest percentage of the popular vote (56.2%) since 1983, when Jaime Lusinchi won with 58.4% of the vote.|$|E
2500|$|On October 18, 1996, Velasquez's seventh album, Retro, was released. The album {{featured}} cover {{versions of}} international hit singles in the 1970s and 1980s from {{artists such as}} The Carpenters, Donna Summer, Melissa Manchester, Andy Gibb and Olivia Newton-John among others. The album's first single, [...] "Fly", was released {{and is the only}} original song from the record. Maurice White, Al McKay, and Allee Willis, the members of the American disco-soul group Earth, Wind & Fire, are credited as songwriters because the song interpolates the melody of their 1978 song [...] "September". David Gonzales of AllMusic expressed approval of the album’s content having a [...] "considerable amount of adventurous, modern music, often performed in a rhythm & blues vein, a most welcome development <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> local music scene is dominated by easy listening love songs." [...] Though he pointed out the musical direction the album went with, steering away from the stereotypical genre: [...] "Filipinos will [...] listen to adventurous music by international artists, but expect their own singers to remain in an [...] "easy listening" [...] musical straitjacket. [...] the success of the album also points to one of the drawbacks on the Philippine music scene, oftentimes Filipinos prefer international music, and remakes thereof, than music composed by their countrymen." [...] Commercially, Retro has sold over 160,000 units in regional and domestic sales. That same year, Velasquez began working on the final album per her record contract with PolyCosmic. Love Was Born On Christmas Day was released in December 1996, along with the debut of its lead single of the same title. By the end of 1996, Velasquez has grown dissatisfied with the music and image her management label had created for her and felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person, having been marketed with the influence of Cantopop, J-pop and K-pop genre because of its financial trend. Along with her dissatisfaction on the creative direction of her music, Velasquez also resented being forbidden to openly state her ethnicity in order to maintain a favorable public image, as Filipinos have been indiscriminately identified as domestic workers in the region. As a result, Velasquez parted ways from PolyCosmic and signed a five-album recording contract with VIVA Records, resuming her music career in the Philippines.|$|E
