5|$|Hazlitt's {{commentary}} on Twelfth Night uses Shakespeare's play to illustrate {{some of his}} general <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> comedy, thoughts that he explored at greater length in later works, such as his Lectures on the English Comic Writers (1819).|$|E

5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century. His thoughts on Shakespeare's plays as a whole (particularly the tragedies), his discussions of certain characters such as Shylock, Falstaff, Imogen, Caliban and Iago and his <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the nature of drama and poetry in general, such as expressed in the essay on Coriolanus, gained renewed appreciation and influenced other Shakespearean criticism.|$|E

5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the exact ethnic {{identity of the}} Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D. Woodard asserts {{that in addition to}} persisting uncertainty in modern times about the proper classification of the Macedonian language and its relation to Greek, ancient authors also presented conflicting <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the Macedonians. Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Science Council of Canada during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an {{influential}} study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study's 1977 report, Canada as a Conserver Society, recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it. The work on that study helped shape Franklin's <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the complexities of modern technological society.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt's <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> many of {{the plays}} have now come to be valued as thought-provoking {{alternatives}} to those of his contemporary Coleridge, and Characters of Shakespear's Plays is now viewed as a major study of Shakespeare's plays, placing Hazlitt with Schlegel and Coleridge {{as one of the}} three most notable Shakespearean critics of the Romantic period.|$|E

5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were taken aback by the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} icon, Nancy Drew {{is cited}} as a formative influence {{by a number of}} women, from Supreme Court Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Sonia Sotomayor to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and former First Lady Laura Bush. Feminist literary critics have analyzed the character's enduring appeal, arguing variously that Nancy Drew is a mythic hero, an expression of wish fulfillment, or an embodiment of contradictory <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> femininity.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{the vacant}} {{site of the}} former synagogue {{was used as a}} {{makeshift}} volleyball court. The volleyball court made way for a prefabricated department store building, constructed in 1959. The department store was completely destroyed in a fire on December 31, 1980, and was subsequently dismantled. Despite some earlier <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> a permanent department store building on the same spot, and a 1977 architecture competition for its design, no construction took place. Instead, the parcel was turned into a parking lot, which it remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known of}} which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E

5|$|Although Clarke wrote little, {{due in part}} to her <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> {{the role}} of a female composer, her work was {{recognised}} for its compositional skill. Most of her works have yet to be published (or have only recently been published), and were largely forgotten after she stopped composing. Scholarship and interest in her compositions revived in 1976. The Rebecca Clarke Society was established in 2000 to promote the study and performance of her music.|$|E
5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> the {{series with the}} other assistants. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which is apparent in his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Havelock {{moved away}} from the socialist organisations he had been {{associated}} with, and in 1944 was elected founding president of the Ontario Classical Association. One of the association's first activities was organising a relief effort for Greece, which had just been liberated from Nazi control. Havelock continued to write about politics, however, and his political and academic work came together in his <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> education; he argued for the necessity of an understanding of rhetoric for the resistance to corporate persuasiveness.|$|E
5|$|For ten centuries {{after the}} fall of the Roman Empire, {{lesbianism}} disappeared from literature. Foster points to the particularly strict view that Eve—representative of all women—caused the downfall of mankind; original sin among women was a particular concern, especially because women were perceived as creating life. During this time, women were largely illiterate and not encouraged to engage in intellectual pursuit, so men were responsible for shaping <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> sexuality.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular <b>ideas</b> <b>about</b> {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
