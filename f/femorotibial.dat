50|$|Bone volume {{fraction}} (BV/TV) {{was found to}} be relatively constant for the variety of animal sizes tested. Larger animals did not show a significantly larger mass per unit volume of trabecular bone. This may be due to an adaptation which reduces the physiological cost of producing, maintaining, and moving tissue. However, BV/TV showed significant positive scaling in avian femoral condyles. Larger birds present decreased flight habits due to avian BV/TV allometry. The flightless kiwi, weighing only 1-2 kg, had the greatest BV/TV of the birds tested in the study. This shows that trabecular bone geometry is related to ‘prevailing mechanical conditions’, so the differences in trabecular geometry in the femoral head and condyle could potentially present the different loading environments of the coxofemoral and <b>femorotibial</b> joints.|$|E

These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.The angle of inclination formed between the neck and shaft of the femur, (collodiaphysial angle), varies with age—about 150° in the newborn, it gradually decreases to 126-128° in adults, to reach 120° in old age. Pathological changes in this angle results in abnormal posture of the leg: A small angle produces coxa vara and a large angle in coxa valga; the latter is usually combined with genu varum and coxa vara leads genu valgum. Additionally, a line drawn through the femoral neck superimposed on a line drawn through the femoral condyles forms an angle, the torsion angle, which makes it possible for flexion movements of the hip joint to be transposed into rotary movements of the femoral head. Abnormally increased torsion angles results in a limb turned inward and a decreased angle in a limb turned outward; both cases resulting in a reduced range of a persons mobility.|$|E

DesignWe defined an areal subdivision of the <b>femorotibial</b> articular cartilage surface on CT arthrography (CTA), allowing {{the division of the}} <b>femorotibial</b> articular surface into multiple (up to n =  204 per knee) subregions and the comparison of the same areas between different knees. Two readers independently classified each cartilage area as normal, abnormal or non-assessable in 41 consecutive pre-TKR OA knees. ResultsA total of 6447 cartilage areas (from 41 knees) were considered assessable by both readers. The average proportion of preserved cartilage was lower in the medial <b>femorotibial</b> joint than in the lateral <b>femorotibial</b> joint for both readers (32. 0 / 69. 8 % and 33. 9 / 68. 5 % (medial/lateral) for reader 1 and 2 respectively, all P <  0. 001). High frequencies of normal cartilage were observed at the posterior aspect of the medial condyle (up to 89 %), and the anterior aspect of the lateral <b>femorotibial</b> compartment (up to 100 %). The posterior aspect of the medial condyle was the area that most frequently exhibited preserved cartilage in the medial <b>femorotibial</b> joint, contrasting with the high frequency of cartilage lesions in the rest of that compartment.

Significant correlations were also found by multiple regression analysis. The multiple correlation coefficient of body mass index and <b>femorotibial</b> lateral angle to the procollagen IIC-propeptide concentrations was 0. 547  (p< 0. 0001).  CONCLUSIONS—The findings suggest that synthesis of type II collagen by chondrocytes is enhanced by abnormal mechanical stress, in this case obesity and varus alignment. It is concluded that procollagen IIC-propeptide concentrations in joint fluid are a useful marker of early OA. ...|$|E

Revision had to be performed in 8 cases for the following reasons: loosening (3), lateral impingement (3), malposition (1) and persistent patella instability (1). Two groups of patients were identified based upon the preoperative assessment: 21 had primary osteoarthritis without anatomic malalignment (group C) and 24 {{had a history of}} patellofemoral instability and trochlear dysplasia demonstrated by clinical and radiological evaluation (group D).

The composite graft was made by anastomosing a segment of autogenous vein in the distal position and joining it by an end-to-end oblique anastomosis to a PTFE prosthesis in the proximal position. These grafts were employed when an adequate autogenous vein could not be used for {{the entire length of the}} bypass. The graft-graft anastomosis was never placed near the knee-joint and if the PTFE segment had to cross the knee, it was always of the externally supported type. There were no early occlusions in the composite grafts. A total of 257 grafts were available for assessment at a mean of 4 years (range 6 months to 15 years). The patency for autologous saphenous vein was: 81. 2 % (121 / 142 femoropopliteal and 13 / 23 <b>femorotibial).</b> The patency for PTFE was 67. 1 % (41 / 58 fembropopliteal and 4 / 9 <b>femorotibial)</b> and for composite grafts was 76 % (10 / 11 femoropopliteal and 9 / 14 <b>femorotibial).</b> There was no significant difference in patency between the autologous saphenous vein and the Composite grafts, both in the femoropopliteal and <b>femorotibial</b> positions.

Design 158 women aged ≥ 40 years were studied. Weight-bearing extended anterior-posterior (AP) and Lyon schuss radiographs were obtained and the Kellgren Lawrence grade (KLG) determined. 97 women had a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 28, no symptoms, and were AP KLG 0. 61 women had a BMI≥ 30, symptoms in the target knee, and mild (KLG 2 = 31) to moderate (KLG 3 = 30) medial <b>femorotibial</b> radiographic OA in the AP views. Coronal spoiled gradient echo water excitation sequences were acquired at 3. 0 Tesla. Total plate and regional measures of cartilage morphology of the weight-bearing <b>femorotibial</b> joint were quantified. ResultsKLG 2 participants displayed, on average, thicker cartilage than healthy controls in the medial <b>femorotibial</b> compartment (particularly anterior subregion of the medial tibia (MT) and peripheral [external, internal] subregions of the medial femur), and in the lateral femur. KLG 3 participants displayed significantly thinner cartilage than KLG 0 participants in the medial weight-bearing femur (central subregion), in the external subregion of the MT, and in the internal subregion of the lateral tibia. These differences were generally unaffected when possible effects of demographic covariates were considered. ConclusionsThe results indicate that in <b>femorotibial</b> OA regional cartilage thickening and thinning may occur, dependent on the (radiographic) disease status of the joint.

Results 686 Framingham participants (309 men, 377 women, age 62 ± 8 years) had no radiographic <b>femorotibial</b> osteoarthritis (OA) (“normals”) and 376 (156 men, 220 women) additionally had no MRI features of cartilage lesions (“supernormals”). The Framingham “normals” had thinner cartilage in the medial (3. 59 mm) than in the lateral <b>femorotibial</b> compartment (3. 86 mm). Medially, the femur displayed thicker cartilage (1. 86 mm) than the tibia (1. 73 mm), and laterally the tibia thicker cartilage (2. 09 mm) than the femur (1. 77 mm). The thickest cartilage was observed in central, and the thinnest in external <b>femorotibial</b> subregions. Potential maximal Z-scores ranged from 5. 6 to 9. 8 throughout the subregions; men displayed thicker cartilage but similar potential maximal Z-scores as women.

40|$|REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Articular {{cartilage}} regeneration is {{the focus}} and goal of considerable research effort. Since articular chondrocytes descend from a distinct cohort of progenitor cells located in embryonic nascent joints (interzones), establishing the timing of equine interzone formation is an essential first step towards understanding equine joint and articular cartilage development. OBJECTIVES: To establish the time frame during which the equine <b>femorotibial</b> interzone forms. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive anatomical study. METHODS: Equine embryos were harvested at 37 (E 37), 40, 42, 45, 50 and 65 days' gestation. The <b>femorotibial</b> interzone was examined using high-resolution episcopic microscopy of E 37, E 42, E 45, E 50 and E 65. Additional histology and collagen-II-immunohistochemistry were performed on E 42. RESULTS: At E 37, the <b>femorotibial</b> interzone is first visible as a uniform layer, while at E 42 the interzone is fully formed and consists of 3 morphologically distinct layers. The first evidence of cavitation was seen at E 45. At E 50, the cruciate ligaments were well formed and by E 65, joint formation appeared complete. CONCLUSIONS: The embryogenesis of the equine <b>femorotibial</b> joint {{is similar to the}} developmental timeline of stage-matched human and murine embryos. Further studies looking at interzone formation on a cellular and molecular level may further our understanding of the intricate developmental patterns and pathways of articular cartilage development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – The {{largest and}} most {{complete}} joint in Bosnian and Herzegovinian mountain horse is knee joint, which consists of two joints: femoropatellar and <b>femorotibial</b> joint. From the point of functional anatomy and due to the load on the knee joint, the study of functional structures of <b>femorotibial</b> joint is of particular interest. <b>Femorotibial</b> joint is formed by the condyles of the femur and tibia. Femur and tibia are joined together by two powerful connections, the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (lig. cruciatum craniale et caudale). By dissection the muscles were carefully removed, the joint capsule opened, the ligaments dissected and the menisci separated. The results of measurement are presented in the Table. The lateral meniscus (meniscus lateralis) is highly developed. All measured parameters except for {{the width of the}} central part of the meniscus, indicate the lateral meniscus being greater than the medial meniscus.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the hemodynamic and clinical changes after occlusion of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) <b>femorotibial</b> grafts. Methods: Twenty-seven patients were randomly selected from all patients who underwent <b>femorotibial</b> bypass grafting in our department. In 10 patients, the reversed autologous saphenous vein was used as graft, and in 17 patients a PTFE prosthesis was used. Out of the latter 17 patients, 10 began long-term aspirin therapy and 7 began oral anticoagulation with warfarin. Results: Nine out of the 10 patients with occluded PTFE grafts and who received only aspirin therapy had a critical ischemia after occlusion of the graft, and 4 underwent major amputation. Among the 10 patients with occluded autologous vein bypass, critical ischemia was present in only 4 patients, and only 2 required some form of surgical therapy with no case of major amputation. Conclusions: After occlusion of a PTFE <b>femorotibial</b> graft, there is a condition of critical ischemia that is less common after occlusion of a vein graft.

40|$|Objective. Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) rupture involves {{an increased risk}} of osteoarthritis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore changes in cartilage thickness over 5 years after ACL rupture. Methods. A total of 121 young active adults (ages 18 - 35 years; 26 % women) from the Knee ACL, Nonsurgical versus Surgical Treatment (KANON) study, who had acute traumatic rupture of the ACL were studied. Sagittal magnetic resonance images were acquired within 4 weeks of ACL rupture (baseline) and at the 2 -year and 5 -year followup assessments. Medial and lateral <b>femorotibial</b> cartilage was segmented (with blinding to acquisition order), and the mean cartilage thickness was computed across 16 <b>femorotibial</b> subregions. Total <b>femorotibial</b> cartilage thickness change was the primary analytic focus. Maximal subregional mean cartilage thickness loss (ordered value 1 [OV 1]) and gain (ordered value 16 [OV 16]), independent of its specific location in individual knees, were the secondary analytic focus. Results. Overall <b>femorotibial</b> cartilage thickness increased by 31 mu m/year over 5 years (95 % confidence interval 18, 44). The increase was similar in men and women and was significantly greater in those younger, as compared with those older, than the median age (25. 3 years). The rate of total cartilage thickness change did not differ significantly between the first 2 years and the later 3 years. However, the maximal annualized subregional cartilage loss (OV 1) and gain (OV 16) were both significantly greater (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 05, respectively) during the earlier interval than during the later interval (- 115 versus - 54 mu m [OV 1] and 116 versus 69 mu m [OV 16]). Conclusion. Cartilage thickening was observed over 5 years following ACL injury, particularly in the medial <b>femorotibial</b> compartment and in younger subjects. Major perturbations in cartilage homeostasis were seen over the first 2 years after ACL rupture, with simultaneous subregional thinning and thickening occurring within the same cartilage plate or compartment...|$|E
40|$|Objective. We {{evaluated}} in a proof-of-concept double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial the efficacy {{and safety of}} intra-articular sprifermin (recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 18) in patients with symptomatic knee OA. Methods. Sprifermin was evaluated as intra-articular injection at 10, 30, and 100 μg. Primary efficacy endpoint was change in central medial <b>femorotibial</b> compartment (cMFTC) cartilage thickness at 6 and 12 months using quantitative MRI (qMRI). Primary safety endpoints were nature, incidence and severity of local and systemic treatment-emergent adverse events, acute inflammatory reactions and laboratory assessments. Secondary endpoints included changes in total and compartment <b>femorotibial</b> cartilage thickness and volume by qMRI, joint space width (JSW) from radiographs, and Western Ontario McMaster Universities (WOMAC) pain. Results. 192 patients were randomized and evaluated for safety, 180 completed the trial, 168 evaluated for primary efficacy endpoint. We found no statistically significant dose-response in change in cMFTC cartilage thickness. Sprifermin was associated with statistically significant, dose-dependent reductions in loss of total and lateral <b>femorotibial</b> cartilage thickness and volume, and in JSW narrowing in the lateral <b>femorotibial</b> compartment. All groups improved in WOMAC pain, with statistically significant less improvement at 12 months in patients receiving 100 μg sprifermin than placebo. There {{was no significant difference}} in SAEs, TEAEs, AIRs between sprifermin and placebo groups. Conclusion. There was no statistically significant relationship between treatment group and reduction in cMFTC cartilage thickness.

Femoroperoneal bypass was performed in preference to primary amputation in each case. Nine of 14 (64. 3 %) of femoroperoneal bypasses were functional whereas 57 of 79 (72. 2 %) of total distal bypasses to small vessels were functional.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo explore whether {{longitudinal}} {{change in}} cartilage thickness in <b>femorotibial</b> subregions of knees with radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) {{differs from that}} in healthy knees. Methods 3 T coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired in 152 women at seven clinical centers at baseline (BL) and 24 months. Knees from 75 women with signs of ROA in either anterior–posterior or Lyon schuss radiographs were compared with those from 77 asymptomatic healthy controls without ROA to identify knees showing greater change in cartilage thickness than expected based on observations in healthy knees. The <b>femorotibial</b> cartilage thickness was determined in BL and follow-up MR images across five tibial and three femoral subregions in the medial/lateral compartment, respectively. ResultsA substantial portion of knees with ROA were classified as having longitudinal cartilage thinning (28 %) or thickening (20 %) {{in at least one}} medial <b>femorotibial</b> subregion based on comparisons to longitudinal changes observed in healthy knees; only 5 % showed both subregional thinning and thickening across (different) medial subregions at the same time. Whereas the estimated proportion of Kellgren Lawrence grade (KLG) 3 knees (n= 28) with significant medial cartilage thinning (46 %) was substantially greater than that with cartilage thickening (18 %), the estimated percentages of KLG 2 knees (n= 30) with significant medial thinning (20 %) and thickening (23 %) were similar. ConclusionThis exploratory study indicates that OA may not be a one-way-road of cartilage loss. Subregional analysis suggests that, compared with healthy knees, cartilage changes in ROA may occur in both directions.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveClinically, {{radiographic}} {{joint space}} narrowing (JSN) is regarded a surrogate of cartilage loss in osteoarthritis (OA). Using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), we explored the magnitude and regional distribution of differences in cartilage thickness and subchondral bone area associated with specific Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) JSN grades. MethodSeventy-three participants with unilateral medial JSN were selected from the first half (2678 cases) of the OA Initiative cohort (45, 21, and 7 with OARSI JSN grades 1, 2, and 3, respectively, no medial JSN in the contra-lateral knee). Bilateral sagittal baseline DESSwe MRIs were segmented by experienced operators. Intra-person between-knee differences in cartilage thickness and subchondral bone areas were determined in medial <b>femorotibial</b> subregions. ResultsKnees with medial OARSI JSN grades 1, 2, and 3 displayed a 190 μm (5. 2 %), 630 μm (18 %), and 1560 μm (44 %) smaller cartilage thickness in weight-bearing medial <b>femorotibial</b> compartments compared to knees without JSN, respectively. The weight-bearing femoral condyle displayed relatively greater differences than the posterior femoral condyle or the medial tibia (MT). The central subregion within the weight-bearing medial femur (cMF) of the femoral condyle (30 – 75 °), and the external and central subregions within the tibia displayed relatively greater JSN-associated differences compared to other medial <b>femorotibial</b> subregions. Knees with higher JSN grades also displayed larger than contra-lateral <b>femorotibial</b> subchondral bone areas. ConclusionsThis study provides quantitative estimates of JSN-related cartilage loss, with {{the central part of}} the weight-bearing femoral condyle being most strongly affected.

RESULTS Significant differences were found for <b>femorotibial</b> rotation (the NWBCT mean changed from 2. 7 °[*]±[*] 5. 1 (reader 1) / 2. 6 °[*]±[*] 5. 6 (reader 2) external rotation to WBCT 0. 4 °[*]±[*] 7. 7 / 0. 2 °[*]±[*] 7. 5 internal rotation; P[*]=[*] 0. 009 /P[*]=[*] 0. 004), TTTG (decrease from NWBCT (13. 8  mm[*]±[*] 5. 1 / 13. 9  mm[*]±[*] 3. 9) to WBCT (10. 5  mm[*]±[*] 5. 0 / 10. 9  mm[*]±[*] 5. 2; P[*]=[*] 0. 008 /P[*]=[*] 0. 002), lateral patellar tilt angle (decrease from NWBCT (15. 6 °[*]±[*] 6. 7 / 16. 9 °[*]±[*] 7. 4) to WBCT (12. 5 °[*]±[*] 7. 7 / 15. 0 °[*]±[*] 6. 2; P[*]=[*] 0. 011 /P[*]=[*] 0. 188). The medial <b>femorotibial</b> joint space decreased from NWBCT (3. 9  mm[*]±[*] 1. 4 / 4. 5  mm[*]±[*] 1. 3) to WBCT (2. 9  mm[*]±[*] 2. 2 / 3. 5  mm[*]±[*] 2. 2; P[*]=[*] 0. 003 /P[*]=[*] 0. 004). Inter-reader agreement ranged from 0. 52 - 0. 97. CONCLUSION Knee joint alignment changes significantly in the upright weight-bearing position using CT when compared to supine non-weight-bearing CT. KEY POINTS • Cone-beam extremity CT offers upright weight-bearing examinations of the lower extremities. • Knee alignment changes significantly in an upright position compared to supine position. • Tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance (TTTG) is less pronounced in a weight-bearing position. • The weight-bearing position leads to a decrease of the lateral patellar tilt angle...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Osteochondral {{autograft}} transfer (OAT) aims at restoring normal {{articular cartilage}} surface geometry and articular contact mechanics. To date, no studies have evaluated the contact {{mechanics of the}} canine stifle following OAT. Additionally, there are no studies that evaluated {{the role of the}} meniscus in contact mechanics following OAT in human or canine <b>femorotibial</b> joints. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure the changes in <b>femorotibial</b> contact areas (CA), mean contact pressure (MCP) and peak contact pressure (PCP) before and after osteochondral autograft transplantation (OAT) of a simulated lateral femoral condylar cartilage defect with an intact lateral meniscus and following lateral meniscectomy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This was a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} long-term results of <b>femorotibial</b> bypass using autologous vein and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) over 24 years. METHODS: Some 518 patients who underwent 635 <b>femorotibial</b> bypass grafts were studied. Outcome measures analysed included primary and secondary graft patency, limb salvage rates and death. RESULTS: Overall primary and secondary graft patencies were 62 and 67 per cent respectively at 12 months, and 44 and 48 per cent at 24 months. For vein grafts, the primary and secondary patencies were 63 and 66 per cent at 12 months, and 54 and 56 per cent at 24 months. For PTFE grafts, the primary and secondary patencies were 48 and 54 per cent at 12 months, and 31 and 37 per cent at 24 months. Limb salvage and patient survival rates were 81 and 84 per cent at 12 months, and 73 and 74 per cent at 24 months. Primary and secondary graft patencies for vein were significantly better than for PTFE (P = 0. 0001). There {{was no difference in}} patency between reversed and in situ grafts. CONCLUSION: <b>Femorotibial</b> bypass can produce excellent long-term results. Vein remains the conduit of choice but in the absence of vein acceptable results can be achieved with PTFE.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{determine}} the predictive value of unicompartimental joint space narrowing (JSN) for MRI-based cartilage thickness {{loss in the}} narrowed and the non-narrowed <b>femorotibial</b> compartment. Methods 922 knees from 922 Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) participants (62. 2  ±  9. 0 years, 61 % females) with radiographic OA (158 without JSN [noJSN], 175 with lateral JSN [latJSN], 589 with medial JSN [medJSN]) were analyzed using 3  T MRI. One-year cartilage thickness change was determined in the lateral (LFTC) and medial <b>femorotibial</b> compartment (MFTC), and in <b>femorotibial</b> subregions. The probability of subsequent cartilage loss was calculated using predefined thresholds. The predictive value of JSN for the probability and magnitude of cartilage loss was compared between latJSN, medJSN and noJSN knees using Fisher's exact and Mann–Whitney-U tests. ResultsThe probability of cartilage loss was greater in the narrowed compartment of latJSN/medJSN knees (34. 9 %/ 32. 4 %) than in noJSN knees (13. 3 %/ 12. 7 %, P ≤  6. 4  ×  10 − 6) {{and so was the}} magnitude of cartilage thickness change (P ≤  8. 2  ×  10 − 6). No significant differences were observed between the narrowed compartments of latJSN vs medJSN knees (probability: P =  0. 58, magnitude: P =  0. 19) or between the non-narrowed compartment of latJSN/medJSN vs noJSN knees (probability: P ≥  0. 35, magnitude: P = ≥ 0. 23). These results were confirmed by the location-independent ordered value (OV) analyses of <b>femorotibial</b> subregions. ConclusionThe predictive value of latJSN for lateral compartment cartilage loss was comparable to that of medJSN for medial compartment cartilage loss, whereas cartilage loss in the non-narrowed compartment was similar to that in noJSN knees. These findings provide important clues to predicting progression of knee OA, and in tailoring inclusion criteria for clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|Background: Patellar {{abnormalities}} are {{a common}} cause of pain and lameness in dogs; however, in vivo the relative motion between the femur and patella in dogs is not well described. The objective {{of this study was}} to define normal in vivo sagittal plane patellofemoral kinematics in three axes of motion using non-invasive methods. We hypothesized patellofemoral alignment in the sagittal plane would tightly correlate with the <b>femorotibial</b> flexion angle. Six healthy dogs without orthopedic disease underwent computed tomography (CT) of their hind limbs to create 3 -D models of the patella and femur. Normal stifle joint motion was captured via flat-panel imaging while each dog performed a series of routine activities, including sitting, walking, and trotting. The 3 -D models of the patella and femur were digitally superimposed over the radiographic images with shape-matching software and the precise movement of the patella relative to the femur was calculated. Results: As the <b>femorotibial</b> joint flexed, the patellofemoral joint also flexed and the patella moved caudally and distally within the femoral trochlea during each activity. Patellar flexion and distal translation during walk and sit were linearly coupled with the <b>femorotibial</b> flexion angle. Offset was evident while trotting, where patella poses were significantly different between early and late swing phase (p[*]≤[*] 0. 003). Patellar flexion ranged from 51 to 6 ° while trotting. The largest flexion angle (92 °) occurred during sit. The patella traversed the entire proximodistal length of the femoral trochlea during these daily activities. Conclusions: Using single-plane flat-panel imaging, we demonstrated normal in vivo patellofemoral kinematics is tightly coupled with <b>femorotibial</b> kinematics; however, trot kinematic patterns did not follow the path defined by walking and stand-to-sit motions. Our normal data can be used in future studies to help define patellofemoral joint kinematics in dogs with stifle abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Personal {{experiences}} with femoropopliteal and tibial artery bypasses to save limbs are reviewed. There were 315 consecutive bypass procedures in 249 patients {{over a period}} of 5 years and 6 months. Femoropopliteal bypasses were done with autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts in 102 cases and with PTFE (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, Gore-Tex) grafts in 100 cases. Femoropopliteal artery bypasses were done with superficial femoral vein grafts in three cases, with bank veins in two cases, and with arm veins in three. In two cases proximal bypasses were made above the inguinal ligament, and these were included in the series of femoropopliteal artery bypasses. There were 70 cases of <b>femorotibial</b> artery bypasses with autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts, two cases with arm veins, and 19 cases with PTFE grafts. In seven cases sequential bypasses were done (femoropoplitealtibial arte-rial bypasses) with autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. In 15 cases popliteal-distal tibial artery bypasses were done with autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. In 15 cases popliteal-distal tibial artery bypasses were done with autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts. Accumulated patency rates at 5 years were 83 % and 68. 7 % in femoropopli-teal and <b>femorotibial</b> artery bypasses with autogenous greater saphenous vein grafts.

40|$|<b>Femorotibial</b> bypass {{is still}} {{infrequently}} performed in many district hospitals, {{because it is}} time consuming {{and the risk of}} failure is high, especially during the learning curve. This article reviews the results of a single consultant surgeon and his team after starting <b>femorotibial</b> bypass de novo in a district general hospital. During the period 1987 to 1992, 85 <b>femorotibial</b> grafts were performed in 76 patients for ulceration and gangrene (57), rest pain (19) and severe claudication (9). Sixty-six were autogenous vein, 15 were PTFE with distal vein cuff, two were composites and two were umbilical vein. Overall, 22 grafts (26 %) failed within the first 30 days (two were salvaged) and 21 amputations were required (five despite patent grafts). There were three early deaths (mortality 3. 9 %). At the end of 1993, 39 limbs had been amputated and 24 patients had died (eight with amputations). Twenty-three (44 % of survivors) were alive with patent grafts. These disappointing early results were due to an initial technical learning curve, after which increased confidence may have led to reconstructing some patients with inadequate distal arteries. A more selective approach is now used. Limb salvage can be achieved in a worthwhile proportion of these patients and 3 -year primary patency rates {{are similar to those of}} teaching hospitals in this country...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundIntramedullary nailing using long or modular nails is {{the most}} {{reliable}} mean of achieving <b>femorotibial</b> fusion. Here, we report the operative, clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of 17 long intramedullary nail arthodeses in patients with infection. HypothesisClinical and functional outcomes after long intramedullary nailing {{are at least as}} good as those obtained using other implants. Materials and methodsWe retrospectively reevaluated 17 patients after unilateral two-stage knee arthrodesis with a long titanium intramedullary nail and autologous bone grafting. We evaluated satisfaction, leg length discrepancy, and function (Lequesne and WOMAC indices). Radiographs were obtained to assess fusion, time to fusion, and <b>femorotibial</b> angles. ResultsNo cases of material failure were recorded. One or more complications occurred in seven patients. Mean limb shortening was 27. 6 mm. Of the 17 patients, 15 were satisfied with the procedure. The mean Lequesne index was 10. 5 / 24 and the mean overall WOMAC score was 26 / 88. Fusion was achieved in 16 patients, with a mean time to fusion of 5 months. Mean <b>femorotibial</b> angles were 178. 6 ° of varus and 1. 9 ° of flexion. DiscussionThis simple and rapid surgical technique provides functional outcomes similar to those obtained using modular nails. The fusion rate is high. Nail extraction is simple and causes minimal damage, in contrast to modular nails. Increased attention to misalignment is needed. Level of evidenceLevel IV, retrospective study...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Quantitative {{evaluation}} of radiographic methods {{proposed to improve}} the detection of joint space narrowing (JSN) in <b>femorotibial</b> osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients with knee OA and five normal controls had three different weight-bearing radiographs of the knee: (1) anteroposterior film of both knees in full extension (extended knees), (2) anteroposterior film of one knee in extension while the patient {{was standing on the}} homolateral foot (standing on homolateral foot), (3) posteroanterior film of both knees flexed at 30 ° (schuss view). Joint space was analyzed blind using both an {{evaluation of}} JSN with a six-grade scale (JSN score) and an image analyser computer measurement of the mean joint space width (mean JSW). The medial compartment of medial <b>femorotibial</b> OA knees, the lateral compartment of lateral <b>femorotibial</b> OA knees, as well as both compartments of control knees, were measured. Extended knee and schuss views were made 1 year later in 10 patients for the evaluation of sensitivity to change. Results: The JSN scores±s. d. in schuss, standing on the homolateral foot and extended knee views were 2. 75 ± 1. 31, 1. 95 ± 1. 3 and 1. 66 ± 1. 27, respectively. The mean JSW±s. d. in schuss, standing on the homolateral foot, and extended knee views were 2. 6 ± 1. 9 mm, 3. 5 ± 1. 6 mm and 3. 8 ± 1. 5 mm, respectively. Changes in JSN scores and mean JSW with schuss view increased with OA severity. In controls, JSW of the medial compartment did not vary in the three views. JSW of the lateral compartment of controls was significantly larger in the schuss view. The change in JSW after 1 year was − 0. 41 mm (P= 0. 02) in the schuss view and − 0. 17 mm (P> 0. 05) in the extended knee view. Conclusion: The schuss view is suggested as the most accurate method for the evaluation of JSW in <b>femorotibial</b> OA...|$|E
