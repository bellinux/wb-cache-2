5|$|To <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> left by {{the demise}} of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois {{encouraged}} displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).

5|$|Following {{the crisis}} in Europe, the {{modernization}} of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void.</b> Asian countries, formerly exporters of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.|$|E

5|$|The second season, , premiered on September 13, 2013 and {{concluded}} on November 22, 2013. It consists of fourteen episodes. Animation {{work was done}} by the South Korean animation studio Studio Mir as well as the Japanese animation studio Studio Pierrot. Studio Mir was expected to solely work on Book 2, but executive director Jae-myung Yoo decided that Studio Mir would animate The Boondocks instead because the animation process was less rigorous. Studio Pierrot was eventually called in to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> and animate Book 2. According to Jae-myung Yoo, Studio Mir was later contacted and re-asked to animate Book 2. Yoo feared that, if Book 2 failed, Studio Mir and Korean animators would have their reputations tarnished for Studio Pierrot's failures. Consequently, Studio Mir accepted the offer and worked alongside Studio Pierrot.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, {{the second}} year of the Civil War, government-issued coinage began {{vanishing}} from circulation. American citizens hoarded all coins with gold and silver, and eventually began hoarding copper-nickel cents as well. This made it extremely difficult for businesses to conduct transactions. In response, many merchants turned to private minters to <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> left by the hoarded coins. The first of these privately minted tokens appeared in the autumn of 1862, by H. A. Ratterman, in Cincinnati, Ohio. New York issues followed in the spring of 1863, first with Lindenmueller currency store card tokens issued by New York City barkeep Gustavus Lindenmueller and then with Knickerbocker currency patriotic tokens issued by William H. Bridgens. It is estimated that by 1864, there were 25,000,000 Civil War tokens (nearly all redeemable for one cent) in circulation, consisting of approximately 7,000â€“8,000 varieties.|$|E

5|$|The Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks {{were the}} {{earliest}} recorded {{inhabitants of the}} West Branch Susquehanna River basin, which includes Quehanna Wild Area. They were a matriarchal society that lived in stockaded villages of large long houses. The Susquehannocks' numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the Iroquois exercised nominal control of the lands of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley. They also lived in long houses, primarily {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers.

5|$|After this, {{the lands}} of the West Branch Susquehanna River valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois. The Iroquois lived in long houses, {{primarily}} {{in what is now}} New York, and had a strong confederacy which gave them power beyond their numbers. They and other tribes used the Pine Creek Path through the gorge, traveling between a path on the Genesee River in modern New York in the north, and the Great Shamokin Path along the West Branch Susquehanna River in the south. The Seneca tribe of the Iroquois believed that Pine Creek Gorge was sacred land and never established a permanent settlement there. They used the path through the gorge and had seasonal hunting camps along it, including one just north of the park near what is now the village of Ansonia. To <b>fill</b> <b>the</b> <b>void</b> left by the demise of the Susquehannocks, the Iroquois encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle in the West Branch watershed, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).|$|E
