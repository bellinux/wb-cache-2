40|$|The {{traditional}} double entry bookkeeping has a {{very important}} fault {{that it can not}} grasp the corporate economic activities and fund movements in totality because each book and financial statements are separated. The matrix bookkeeping has advantage that it can recognize whole corporate transactions and financial statements in one sheet. Now {{there are two kinds of}} matrix bookkeeping: the one is the traditional matrix bookkeeping and the other is the double <b>entry</b> <b>matrix</b> bookkeeping. The former has several faults that it needs much space, mixed transactions is arbitrarily divided into exchange transactions and income transactions, and financial statements are not recognized easily. On the other hand, the latter have many advantages and surmount the faults of the traditional matrix bookkeeping. Therefore the integrated historical cost accounting which combine the cash flow accounting and historical cost accounting and the integrated sale value accounting which combine the cash flow accounting and sale value accounting should be done by the double <b>entry</b> <b>matrix</b> bookkeeping...|$|E

Assuming that the matrix is almost of a finite bandwidth, i. e. there exists an integer n> 0 and exponent γ∈[0, 1) such that a_x,x+z= 0 for all z>n〈 x〉^γ {{and the growth}} of the ℓ_ 1 norm of a row is slower than |x|^ 1 -γ for |x|≫ 1, i. e. _|x|→+∞| x|^γ- 1 ∑_y|a_xy|= 0 we prove that the corresponding symmetric operator, defined on compactly supported sequences, is essentially self-adjoint in ℓ_ 2 (Z).

40|$|Batterham (1987) {{described}} {{a computer program}} which eases entry of mathematical programming data.

40|$|International audienceTraditionally, most {{literature}} {{has focused on}} the impact of Order Entry Points on manufacturing and logistics. Current literature about these entry points undervalues the effects on the engineering process and the writings on modular design hardly discuss the relationship with operations management. To assess and review the consequences for engineering management, a framework has been developed based on earlier research, covering the standard working methods for the conversion of customer requirements into components of a modular product architecture, the management of customer order activities and the separate development of new product architectures for future demands. Five case studies served as base for the investigation of engineering management. Although it might be expected that operations management for the engineering process should not differ from that of manufacturing, the case studies prove otherwise. The characteristics of engineering activities allow a more limited range of interventions, putting more stress on adequate capacity management. Additionally, the implementation of modular design does create sometimes resistance to change. Strategically, modular design has the advantage of architectural innovation. However, the implementation of the Order <b>Entry</b> <b>Matrix</b> in engineering management shows that control of engineering activities is weakly developed in industry...|$|E
40|$|Motivation. The {{chemistry}} of secondary metabolites is a peculiar {{field of study}} due to its complexity and the interest it raises in other fields of pharmacology. The plants of the Asteraceae, {{one of the largest}} families of plants, have been intensely studied for this reason and have been resulted in the identification of around 28000 occurrences of substances in the species of the family. The {{chemistry of}} the Asteraceae is extremely complex and the great problem with databases compiled from the literature is the lack of knowledge about the precision of the data. Thus, the imprecision of the data leads us to use specific techniques to work with this kind of incomplete data. So, the use of artificial neural networks is very adequate. In the present study we focus attention at the genus Artemisia and work at the infra genus level {{in order to try to}} predict the occurrence of chemical substances present in the genus. Method. The methodology applied starts by taking all the information on the genus Artemisia from the database. An <b>entry</b> <b>matrix</b> was assembled with the occurrences of the six most representative chemical classes in the genus: flavonoids, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, sesquiterpene lactones, polyacetylenes and coumarins.
