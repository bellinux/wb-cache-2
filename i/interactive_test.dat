40|$|What most sensed about Technical High School (known as SMK) {{students}} is {{their lack of}} analytical capability. As their nature of academic orientation is aimed at job fullfillment, the students are enhanced to follow Standard Operational Procedure (SOP) without questioning why such SOP should be followed. As for automotive students, they simply following the steps of doing things related to any activities of repairing car and other mechanical work required just because the job will be done well when the procedure completed.  This kind of mentality “following order or SOP” fits to those who only want to be workers not the men who take higher responsibilities. The progress of automotive technology demand on understanding the concept of how some system used in a car. Failure to comprehend to concept will jeopardize {{the performance of a}} car. At the same time, the progress of automotive technology is also propelled by the progress of information technology which provides more open resources {{that can be used to}} promote the quality of instuctional process.  Realizing that having analysis compentence is terribly important to run higher responsibilites and continuing education to a university, automotive students need to learn how to analyze. To promote this, teacher can use some automotive movies or animations and then chop them into many fragments related to instructional objectives. The way how the teachers arrange and present the fragments can be combined into power point and ended up with an <b>interactive</b> <b>test</b> with different model of methods, strategies, or techniques.

40|$|We {{describe}} an interactive, computer-based test {{inspired by the}} Trail Making Test (TMT). In this new test, young (mean age= 20. 4 years) and older participants (mean age= 74. 9 years) used natural, pointing responses to order series of numbers, letters, or intermixed letters and numbers. This <b>interactive</b> <b>test,</b> which avoids several deficiencies of TMT, assesses participants' baseline speed for detecting and responding to individual items, captures the time for each response, and segregates erroneous responses from correct ones. The interresponse times with intermixed letters and numbers showed that participants did not always switch between the two different ordering-tasks, but instead often recall letter-number pairs as single units. An additive factors analysis decomposed test times into functional components, including executive function, which took longer in older participants. With modest practice, both young and older participants sped up their ordering of intermixed numbers and letters, probably reflecting increased automaticity and reduced dependence upon executive function.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new heuristic approach to <b>interactive</b> <b>test</b> assembly {{that is called}} the successive item replacement algorithm. This approach builds {{on the work of}} W. J. van der Linden (1987) and W. J. van der Linden and E.

An experiment using quasi-realistic data is performed that serves to illustrate the difference in approaches for typicil practical test construction applications.
