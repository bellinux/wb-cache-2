5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> sensibility that aesthetics affect {{the physical and emotional}} health of those who use a building or structure. Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{the market for}} natural dyes in the fashion {{industry}} is experiencing a resurgence. Western consumers have become {{more concerned about the}} health and environmental impact of synthetic dyes in manufacturing and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> demand for products that use natural dyes. The European Union, for example, has encouraged Indonesian batik cloth producers to switch to natural dyes to improve their export market in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by urbanisation and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat.

5|$|The fishing industry, {{although}} still operating significantly below the Soviet level of production, remains profitable, supplying 20% of Russia's fish in 2006 {{and with the}} volumes steadily growing in 2007–2010.

5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from Keynesian stimulus does not exist. However, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E

5|$|Bacteriophages are {{viruses that}} infect {{bacteria}} and archaea. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages {{that belong to}} 11 families. They are important in marine ecology: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses {{can be a problem}} in industries that produce food and drugs by fermentation and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.|$|E
