2500|$|As {{his army}} {{continued}} its retreat into Georgia, General Bragg became concerned at the <b>heavy</b> <b>mud</b> that slowed down his supply trains {{as he passed}} through the mountains {{near the town of}} Ringgold. Fearful that pursuing Federals would catch up with them and destroy themand with them, his armyBragg ordered Cleburne to [...] "hold this position at all hazards." [...] Private Matthews writes that the 33rd Alabama had crossed the waist-deep, icy Chickamauga creek on November 27 stipped from the waist down, [...] "as the cold wind was stinging our exposed anatomy." [...] Finding the ashes from previous regiments' campfires still hot, the 33rd dried themselves and put their clothes back on, then slept beside the creek bank on the frozen ground. As the rest of their division moved on the next day, the 33rd was left with elements of the 45th Alabama and some of Joseph Wheeler's cavalry to guard the creek against the oncoming Federals. [...] They did not have long to wait: advance Federal elements skirmished with them, as the 33rd and Wheeler's Cavalry slowly backtracked toward Ringgold Gap, turning several times to fire, then retreating a short distance, then turning to fire again before repeating the process.|$|E

What a storm that must be at sea!

Between the landing and the vehicles there is a space of <b>heavy</b> <b>mud</b> to cross, and when we reach them we find the coupé appointed us occupied by three young Englishmen, who insist that they shall be driven to the boat. With that graceful superiority which endears their nation to the world, and makes the travelling Englishman a universal favorite, they keep the seats to which they have no longer any right, while the tempest drenches the ladies to whom the places belong; and it is only by the forza maggiore of our conductor that they can be dislodged. In the mean time the Portland man exchanges with them the assurances of personal and national esteem, which that mighty bond of friendship, the language of Shakespeare and Milton, enables us to offer so idiomatically to our transatlantic cousins.|$|E

30|$|For dynamic {{equilibrium}} during drilling, it {{is necessary}} to equalize (balance) the hydrostatic pressures with those predicted abnormal pore pressures and gradients, to avoid any drilling problem. The abnormal pore pressures at these two zones can now be considered as hydrostatic pressures {{that can be used for}} the calculation of the compensated mud weights as follows: mud weight (ppg) = hydrostatic pressure (psi)/ 0.052  × h (ft).

30|$|For subsalt {{wells in}} the Gulf of Mexico and other {{petroleum}} basins, drilling needs to penetrate thick salt formations {{to reach the}} hydrocarbon reserves. Salt creep in the subsalt wells is a challenge for borehole stability (Zhang et al. 2008); therefore, a <b>heavier</b> <b>mud</b> weight (e.g., mud weight can {{be as high as}} 80 %– 90 % of the overburden stress) needs to be used to control salt creep. This high mud weight requires a higher fracture gradient in the salt formation to avoid salt being fractured.|$|R

30|$|Knowledge of pore {{pressure}} {{is very important}} in deciding the drilling mud weight to be used. Drilling mud in the borehole creates hydrostatic head to balance the formation pressure during drilling.

The abnormal pore pressures at these two zones can now be considered as hydrostatic pressures {{that can be used for}} the calculation of the compensated equivalent <b>mud</b> weights. The <b>heavier</b> <b>mud</b> weight that are required and recommended to drill is 13.8  ppg.

50|$|On November 7, 2011, a Chevron owned {{oil well}} began leaking causing 200 to 330 oilbbl L {{of crude oil}} to enter the ocean every day. The leak took place in Campos Basin, Brazil 120 km {{off the coast of}} Rio de Janeiro. At first, Chevron claimed that the leak was most likely due to a seep in the ocean floor but later {{admitted}} that they had made a miscalculation. Chevron says that they underestimated the amount pressure that the reservoir would exert on the oil well and says that <b>heavier</b> <b>mud</b> should have been used to seal the well. 155,000 gal of oil were spilled over the course of four days until the well was finally sealed.|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} function of drilling mud is {{the control of}} formation fluid pressure to prevent blowouts. The density of the mud must be raised at times to stabilize incompetent formations. Any substance that is denser than water {{and that does not}} adversely affect other properties of the mud can be added to raise the density to some extent. Obviously, the specific gravity of the weighting agent is of primary importance, especially in very <b>heavy</b> <b>muds.</b> The fractional volume occupied by the added solid is a major limiting factor in its use. In this work a simple-to-use correlation has been developed to predict the effect of the specific gravity of the weighting material and the density of mud on the solids concentration of weighted muds. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being less than 0. 3 %...|$|R

5000|$|When a kick (influx of {{formation}} fluid) occurs, rig operators or automatic systems {{close the}} blowout preventer units, sealing the annulus {{to stop the}} flow of fluids out of the wellbore. Denser mud is then circulated into the wellbore down the drill string, up the annulus and out through the choke line {{at the base of the}} BOP stack through chokes (flow restrictors) until downhole pressure is overcome. Once “kill weight” mud extends from the bottom of the well to the top, the well has been “killed”. If the integrity of the well is intact drilling may be resumed. Alternatively, if circulation is not feasible it may be possible to kill the well by [...] "bullheading", forcibly pumping, in the <b>heavier</b> <b>mud</b> from the top through the kill line connection at the base of the stack. This is less desirable because of the higher surface pressures likely needed and the fact that much of the mud originally in the annulus must be forced into receptive formations in the open hole section beneath the deepest casing shoe.|$|R

50|$|On 1 November 2009, the West Triton rig {{successfully}} drilled {{the relief}} well to intercept the leaking well.

50|$|A {{well with}} 5,000 feet of {{seawater}} and 15,000 feet of rock {{could have an}} overburden pressures at the bottom as high as 17,220 psi (5000 * 0.444 + 15000 * 1.0). That pressure is reduced at the surface {{by the weight of}} oil and gas the riser pipe, but this is {{only a small percentage of}} the total. It takes <b>heavy</b> <b>mud</b> (drilling fluid) inserted at the bottom to control the well when pressures are this high.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the most}} time {{consuming}} form of well kill. It involves repeatedly pumping in small quantities of kill mud into the well bore and then bleeding off excess pressure. It works {{on the principle that}} the <b>heavier</b> kill <b>mud</b> will sink below the lighter well bore fluids and so bleeding off the pressure will remove the latter leaving an increasing quantity of kill mud in the well bore with successive steps.|$|R
50|$|Preliminary {{findings}} from BP's internal investigation indicated several serious warning {{signs in the}} hours prior to the blowout.

50|$|In {{the natural}} gas and {{petroleum}} industry, a relief well is drilled to intersect an oil or gas well that has experienced a blowout.

30|$|Pre-drill {{prediction}} of formation pore pressure from surface seismic survey {{is very important}} for drilling, production, and reservoir engineering because it affects drilling operations and well-planning processes. If it is not properly evaluated, it can lead to numerous drilling problems such as dangerous well kicks, lost circulation, blowouts, stuck pipe, excessive costs, and borehole instability. Pre-drill pore pressure estimation has been obtained from transform models using seismic interval velocities. However, the accuracy of this estimate of pore pressure {{is directly related to the}} reliability of these interval velocities. Bulk density was estimated from seismic interval velocity and transit time. Normal pore pressure gradient is estimated from the slope of a trendline that is generated from logarithm transit times versus depth. Overburden pressure at any depth was calculated from the integration of the average interval bulk densities and thicknesses above that depth. Pore pressure has been obtained from overburden pressure and observed interval velocities using modified Eaton’s equation. 154 CDPs were used along 28 seismic lines at Beni Suef basin, Western Desert, Egypt, to accomplish the purpose of this study. Two velocity reversal zones showing abnormally high pore pressure were detected and correlated to Abu Roash and Bahariya Formations. Moreover, pore pressure gradient maps were established for these two zones to predict the possible horizontal fluid flow (migration paths) for the proposal of prospects with lower pressures and less drilling risks. Finally, it is possible to calculate and recommend the required <b>heavier</b> <b>mud</b> weight to drill.|$|R
