40|$|Tourism, due its {{property}} {{of being an}} “invisible export” sector, has a strong multiplier effect over the economy. Tourists boost demand for numerous goods and services, one of them being energy. Unfortunately, energy sources are scarce {{for most of the}} countries in the region. Thus, one could think of another solution to the excess demand for energy than import. Namely, for more than a decade, renewable energy sources are in the central focus of the EU energy policy with an aim to ensure security, price stability, availably and affordability of energy to its citizens together with reduction of GHG emissions and making the EU economy more competitive. Combining tourism with renewable <b>energy</b> sources <b>utilisation</b> helps reducing the spill over effect from energy import. In this paper, the cross-section analysis based on environmental determination of tourism and renewable energy sources potentials is performed in order to indicate a pathway for implementation of renewable <b>energy</b> sources <b>utilisation</b> in the tourism and hotel industry...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to huge {{population}} and economic growth, {{the demand for}} power and energy is increasing rapidly in most Asian countries especially in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan where the power generation is based mainly on fossil fuel. Power generation from renewable energy sources especially wind energy has not been well utilised in South Asia. In comparison, European countries and countries in North America have made significant progress in wind <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> for power generation. Scant information on utilisation of renewable energy for power generation in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India is currently available in the public domain. Therefore, the primary objective {{of this study is}} to undertake a comparative analysis of wind <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> for power generation in South Asian countries.

40|$|Biogas is {{more and}} more used as an {{alternative}} source of energy, considering {{the fact that it is}} obtained from waste materials and it can be easily used in cities and rural communities for many uses, between which, as a fuel for households. Biogas has many <b>energy</b> <b>utilisations,</b> depending on the nature of the biogas source and the local demand. Generally, biogas can be used for heat production by direct combustion, electricity production by fuel cells or micro-turbines, Combined Hest and Power generation or as vehicle fuel. In this paper we search for another uses of biogas and Anaerobe Digestion substrate, such as: waste water treatment plants and agricultural wastewater treatment, which are very important in urban and rural communities, solid waste treatment plants, industrial biogas plants, landfill gas recovery plants. These uses of biogas are very important, because the gas emissions and leaching to ground water from landfill sites are serious threats for the environment, which increase more and more bigger during the constant growth of some human communities. That is why, in the developed European countries, the sewage sludge is treated by anaerobe digestion, depending on national laws. In Romania, in the last years more efforts were destined to use anaerobe digestion for treating waste waters and management of waste in general. This paper can be placed in this trend of searching new ways of using with maximum efficiency the waste resulted in big communities...|$|R

40|$|Among the {{terrestrial}} production animals, chickens {{are the most}} efficient users of energy. Apparent metabolisable energy (AME) {{is a measure of}} <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiency representing the difference between energy consumed and energy lost via the excreta. There are significant differences in the <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> capability of individual birds that have a similar genetic background and are raised under identical conditions. It would be of benefit to poultry producers if the basis of these differences could be understood and the differences minimised. We analysed duodenal gene expression and microbiota differences in birds with different <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiencies. Using microarray analysis, significant differences were found in duodenal gene expression between high- and low-AME birds, indicating that level of cell turnover may distinguish different groups of birds. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes indicated that duodenal microbiota was dominated by Lactobacillus species and two operational taxonomic units, identified as lactobacilli species, were found to be more abundant (P < 0. 05) in low-AME birds. The present study has identified gene expression and microbiota properties that correlate with differences in AME; further studies will be required to investigate the causal relationships...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{population}} growth, industrialisation and {{an enhanced}} {{quality of life}} lead to high energy demand. This demand for energy exerts pressure on non-renewable resource and environment. Classical economic philosophy emphasises either the demand or the supply side of the market, which exacerbates the issue. Furthermore, the traditional notions have some limitations in promoting the sustainability of resources and the environment {{for the well-being of}} the next generation. However, models of sustainable development do address both the demand and the supply aspects of resources simultaneously. In order to realise the goal of sustainable development, an inclusive and comprehensive policy element is needed. Accordingly, different policy elements were introduced in order to address the sustainability issue of energy and environment. The paper reviews the potential of these energy policy elements introduced by the Malaysian government in order to enhance energy efficiency as the nation moves towards becoming a developed and high-income country by 2020. Additionally, the paper discusses a plausible inter-temporal sustainability pathway which applies an economic growth model, which reveals that adhering to the sustainability notion could enhance the economic production and efficiency of <b>energy</b> resource <b>utilisation.</b> economic development; renewable resources; environmental sustainability; sustainable development; green economy models; energy policies; Malaysia; review; green economics; resource supply and demand; economic growth; <b>energy</b> resources; resource <b>utilisation</b> efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The power {{consumption}} of a data centre (DC) {{can be attributed}} to the power consumed for running the servers and to the computer room air conditioner (CRAC) power for cooling them. The challenge is to distribute the load among servers, controlling the number of active servers and optimally balancing IT and cooling power requirement. This goal demands integration of thermal, power and workload models that minimises a non-linear <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> function. In this paper first we encode this problem using a non-linear objective function and use local search for solving it. We carry out simulation experiments using data provided by the Bluesim tool. The results encourage the effectiveness of our approach, showing that system-wide <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> can be reduced using a holistic approach. I...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an obvious}} and indisputable need for an {{increase}} in the efficiency of <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> in buildings. Heating, cooling and lighting appliances in buildings account for more than one third of the world's primary energy demand. In turn, building stock is a major contributor to energy-related environmental problems. There are great potentials, which can be obtained through a more efficient use of energy in buildings. An optimisation of the exergy flows in buildings and the related supply structures, similar to other thermodynamic systems such as power stations, can help in identifying the potential of increased efficiency in <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Through analyses, it can be shown that calculations based on the energy conservation and primary energy concept alone are inadequate for gaining a full understanding of all important aspects of <b>energy</b> <b>utilisation</b> processes. The high potential for a further increase in the efficiency of; for example, boilers, can not be quantified by energy analysis - the energy efficiency is close to 100 %; however, this potential can be showed by using exergy analysis [1], the exergy efficiency of a common gas boiler is about 8 %.
