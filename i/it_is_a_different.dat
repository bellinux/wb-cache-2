50|$|Another {{name for}} blue iolite is steinheilite, after Fabian Steinheil, the Russian {{military}} governor of Finland who observed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> mineral from quartz.

25|$|At high speed, {{the driver}} cannot see lineside signals reliably. With the TVM {{signalling}} {{used on the}} high-speed lines, the target speed {{for the end of}} the current block is displayed with a flashing indication for the next block if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> speed. Auxiliary signalling information, including the location of neutral sections in the overhead supply and pantograph adjustment zones, is displayed in cab and by the lineside. The operation of circuit breakers over neutral sections is handled automatically on TVM-signalled lines only, and pantograph adjustments must always be performed by the driver.|$|E
25|$|Jack misses {{his mother}} but begins {{to settle into}} his new life. He bonds with his new family, meets Leo's dog Seamus and makes friends with a boy his age. Believing his long hair will give Joy the {{strength}} she needs to recover, Jack has his grandmother cut it for him so he can send it to her. Joy returns home and apologizes, thanking Jack for saving her life again. At Jack's request, they visit Room one last time, escorted by police. Jack is confused; he feels it has shrunk and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> place with the door open. He and Joy say their goodbyes to Room and leave.|$|E

50|$|At the 1998 Le Mans however, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story.

500|$|The {{sequence}} in which Hawkes rips his heart out {{was created by}} using a rubber heart. The fact that the faux blood begins leaking through his shirt was added to [...] "hide the fact that [...] doing a little sleight of hand". The image of the beating heart in the furnace was created by overlapping a shot of a fake beating heart and a shot of actual fire. The two were then merged in post-production by animator John Wash, because the fire would have melted the actual heart model. The beating of the hearts of Naciamento's victims was created via a pump that was operated off-screen. The actual milagro prop was crafted several times because, according to Manners, the face was particularly difficult to get right. In fact, the second time the medallion appears in the episode, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> prop.|$|E

500|$|Halo Warss {{cinematics}} {{and voice}} acting were widely lauded, although one reviewer {{wrote that the}} characters were stereotypical and unlikeable. Dakota Grabowski of PlanetXbox360 considered the Arbiter the most confusing character in the game's story. Conversely, GamePro listed the Arbiter {{as one of the}} five best things about the game, saying that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> character than the Arbiter seen in Halo2 and Halo3, he <b>was</b> [...] "like <b>an</b> alien Jack Bauer amped up on drugs".|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Vishnu-Hari inscription" [...] {{recording}} {{the construction of}} a temple during Govindachandra's reign was found among the Babri mosque debris. The authenticity of this inscription is controversial. According to some historians, it proves that Govindachandra's subordinate Anayachandra constructed a temple at the site believed to be Rama's birthplace; this temple was later destroyed and replaced with the Babri mosque by Muslim conquerors. Other historians allege that the Hindu activists planted the so-called Vishnu-Hari inscription at the Babri mosque site, and that the Govindachandra mentioned in <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person.|$|E
2500|$|Guerrilla warfare resembles rebellion, yet <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> concept. Guerrilla {{organization}} {{ranges from}} small, local rebel groups {{of a few}} dozen guerrillas, to thousands of fighters, deploying from cells to regiments. In most cases, the leaders have clear political aims for the warfare they wage. Typically, the organization has political and military wings, to allow the political leaders [...] "plausible denial" [...] for military attacks. The most fully elaborated guerrilla warfare structure is by the Chinese and Vietnamese communists during the revolutionary wars of East and Southeast Asia. A simplified example of this more sophisticated organizational type - used by revolutionary forces during the Vietnam War, is shown above.|$|E

However, when Hinton examined the type specimen of P. floridana, he discovered that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species, the only that had been called Parietaria nummularia. Under the rules of botanical nomenclature, this meant that P. nummularia needed to be renamed P. floridana, and the species that had long been called P. floridana <b>was</b> in fact <b>an</b> undescribed species, one which Hinton described as P. praetermissa.|$|R

30|$|Subject P 4 {{answered}} questions 1.1 and 1.3 using SourceTree. This subject answered question 1.2 {{differently from the}} others.

Although this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> valid interpretation, <b>it</b> may happen that authors commit changes in the same clone, and this {{would lead to a}} wrong answer for this question.

2500|$|In typography, a {{typeface}} (also {{known as}} font family) {{is a set}} of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts). For example, [...] "ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic" [...] means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> font from [...] "ITC Garamond Condensed Italic" [...] and [...] "ITC Garamond Bold Condensed," [...] but all are fonts within the same typeface, [...] "ITC Garamond." [...] ITC Garamond is a different typeface from [...] "Adobe Garamond" [...] or [...] "Monotype Garamond." [...] (These are all alternative updates or digitisations of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The miniseries invents an {{extensive}} subplot for Princess Irulan, {{a character who}} plays little part in {{the plot of the}} first novel. Harrison felt the need to expand Irulan's role because she played such an important part in later books, and epigraphs from her later writings opened each chapter of Dune. Additionally, the character gave him a window into House Corrino. Besides the final scene, the only one of Irulan's appearances based on an actual excerpt from the novel is her visit to Feyd-Rautha. However, in the book <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Bene Gesserit, Margot Fenring, who visits the Harkonnen heir, on assignment from the Bene Gesserit to [...] "preserve the bloodline" [...] by retrieving his genetic material (through conception) for their breeding program. The miniseries does not suggest this as Irulan's motive.|$|E
2500|$|This phrase {{evokes the}} {{primordial}} swamp and the Nqaul tree which grew within the original swamp.

Whilst some Serer sources postulates that the Saas was the first tree on Earth, the Serer oral tradition states that the Saas was not Nqual (the original tree in the swamp). Instead, Saas is attributed {{to one of the}} sacred trees useful for overall-bodily health. Another sacred tree − the Nquƭ, is also thought to have been the first tree. However, the general consensus is that the Nquƭ which has the properties to cure snakebite grew on the river bank whilst Nqual grew inside the primordial swamp.|$|E
