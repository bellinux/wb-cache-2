This is a skeletal plate, or sieve, opening to the water vascular system, located on the aboral surface. Just underneath the madreporite, is a cup-like depression called the ampulla. Next the stone canal carries the liquid into the central disc of the urchin. Finally, five lateral canals run along the inside of the test and converge at the aboral pole. Along this entire <b>distance,</b> <b>tube</b> feet emerge from the lateral canal through the test to outside the epidermis of the sea urchin.|$|E

Three parameters were chosen to investigate their influence on modulation transfer function: source-detector <b>distance,</b> <b>tube</b> current and binning mode. A simple method for modulation transfer function determination of digital imaging detectors from edge images was applied. The following results were achieved and briefly discussed: modulation transfer function improves with increase of the source-detector distance, slightly improves with increase of the current and remains constant for different binning modes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{effects of}} changes in {{dosimetry}} conditions on the radiation sensitivity of a constant biological population were determined. The organism {{used for this study}} was the strain B of Escherichia coli. The percentage survivals of these cells in an aqueous solution were determined at the same total exposure with different quality x-rays. The total absorbed dose was measured as a function of x-ray quality. During all irradiations the focal-target <b>distance,</b> <b>tube</b> current, field size, and biological population were held constant. The distribution of radiation to which the organisms were exposed was kept constant by the use of a rotating exposure platform. This platform was constructed of materials such that the contributions from backscatter would be minimized. The results indicated that the test organism was more sensitive to low energy x-rays than to high energy x-rays in the range from 15 keV to 145 keV effective energy. However, at low effective x-ray energies the absorbed dose was found to be lower than at higher effective energies. This was explained by differences in the specific ionization of different energy x-rays in aqueous solutions. It was concluded that dosimetry conditions are a significant factor in the determination of the radiation sensitivity of E. coli B. The results indicate the necessity of reporting accurate exposure conditions when studying the radiation response of biological populations...|$|E

The thermodetector also measures distance apart from temperature, {{which can be used}} to identify whether temperatures belong to the tube surface or furnace wall. It is worth noting that the thermodetector usually measures all tubes of a hole once before moving to the next operation. Therefore, the temperature and distance data are first stored in the arrays Temp[] and Dist[], respectively. Moreover, some other parameters must be initialized including the overlapping threshold γ of the tubes, threshold number of collection points a and b, and number of collection points d 1, d 2 and d 3, which need to be deleted.|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} context of rapidly {{depleting}} petroleum resources and growing environmental concerns, {{it is important}} to develop materials to harvest and store energy from renewable and sustainable sources. Hydrogen {{has the potential to be}} an alternative energy source, since it has higher energy content than petroleum. However, since hydrogen has very low volumetric energy density, hence {{it is important to}} design nano porous materials which can efficiently store large volumes of hydrogen gas by adsorption. In this regard carbon nanotube and Metal Organic Framework (MOFs) based materials are worth studying. Ionic liquids (IL) are potential electrolytes that can improve energy storage capacity and safety in Li ion batteries. Therefore it is important to understand IL's thermodynamic and transport properties, especially when it is in contact with electrode surface and mixed with Li salt, as happens in the battery application. This dissertation presents computation and simulation based studies on: 1. Hydrogen storage in carbon nanotube scaffold. 2. Mechanical property and stability of various nanoporous Metal Organic Frameworks. 3. Thermodynamic and transport properties of [BMIM][BF 4] ionic liquid in bulk, in Li Salt mixture, on graphite surface and under nanoconfinement. In the first study, we report the effects of carbon nanotube diameter, tube chirality, tube spacer <b>distance,</b> <b>tube</b> functionalization and presence of Li on hydrogen sorption capacity and thermodynamics at different temperature and pressure. In the second one, we observe high pressure induced structural transformation of 6 isoreticular MOFs: IRMOF- 1.

In the third study, we observe the equilibrium thermodynamic and transport properties of [BMIM][BF 4] ionic liquid. The temperature dependence of ion diffusion, conductivity, dielectric constant, dipole relaxation time and viscosity have been observed and found similar behavior to those of supercooled liquid. The ion diffusion on graphite surfaces and under nanoconfinement was found to be higher compared to those in bulk...|$|E

A simulation model for horizontal and vertically stacked horizontal tubular reactors was made to quantify {{the effect of these}} decision variables on production yield. The model uses reactor dimensions, dynamic sunlight patterns over the day and year, and growth characteristics of algae species as inputs. Scenario studies were done to study the effect of decision variables on reactor performance in The Netherlands, France and Algeria. Results indicate that the areal biomass {{productivity in}} vertically stacked photobioreactors is 25 – 70 % higher than in plain horizontal systems. Reactor design is location specific because light conditions differ. In The Netherlands, the best horizontal <b>distance</b> between <b>tubes</b> is 0. 05 m for horizontal and 0. 25 m for vertical systems. For France and Algeria, the best horizontal distance between vertical systems is 0. 20 m and 0. 15 m respectively.

To {{assess the}} {{adequacy}} of the position of the tracheal tube cuff and tracheal tube tip in the recently introduced preformed oral Microcuff paediatric endotracheal tube (PET) using the manufacturers recommendations for Microcuff tracheal tube size selection. Methods. With Hospital Ethics Committee approval and informed parental consent, the tracheas of children from birth to adolescence were orally intubated with the preformed oral Microcuff PET. First, the position of the tracheal tube's intubation depth mark in relation to the vocal cords was assessed. Second, the <b>distance</b> ‘tracheal <b>tube</b> tip-to-carina' was endoscopically measured with the patient supine and the head in a neutral position and the tube placed with the centre mark at the lower incisors or alveolar ridge. Results. A total of 166 children aged from 0. 1 to 16. 4 yr (median 5. 9 yr) were studied. In five patients the intubation depth mark was above (5 mm each), in 22 patients at the level of and in the remaining 139 patients below the vocal cords. No endobronchial intubation occurred. In four patients the <b>distance</b> ‘tracheal <b>tube</b> tip-to-carina' was smaller than the safety margin to prevent endobronchial intubation during head-neck flexion. Conclusion.

The dependence of the scattering coefficients with the <b>distance</b> between the <b>tubes</b> and their positions is analyzed for several cases {{with two or three}} flux tubes embedded in a quiet Sun atmosphere.

We also consider more general cases of ensembles of randomly distributed flux tubes, and we have evaluated the effects on the scattering measurements of changing the number of tubes included in the bundle and the average <b>distance</b> between flux <b>tubes.</b> We find that for the longest wavelength incoming waves multiple scattering enhances the absorption, and its efficiency increases with the number of flux tubes and the reduction of the distance between them.

40|$|An inverse mapping {{technique}} {{was applied to}} solve an ideal axisymmetric fluid jet impinging normally against a solid plane infinite in length and width with the tube being a finite distance from the solid plane. The problem of an ideal axisymmetric jet is typical of a class of problems in fluid mechanics involving the flow of an ideal fluid with a free streamline and axisymmetric geometry. This type of problem is difficult to solve since the shape of part of the boundary {{of the problem is}} unknown a priori and conformal mapping techniques do not apply to axisymmetric geometry. Hence solution of these problems is complicated due to geometrical effects. The problem of an ideal axisymmetric jet was investigated by Duh 4 with proper boundary conditions. He specified a priori the <b>distance</b> of the <b>tube</b> from the solid plane and then used a trial and error method for determining the shape of the free streamline. The solution contained significant error due to the trial and error method solution which was necessitated by the free streamline boundary condition. Davies and Aylward 3 have shown by conformal mapping in the two-dimensional problem that a, an independent parameter of the problem which is defined as the ratio of the deflected velocity to the incident velocity at infinite distances from the origin, {{is a function of the}} non- dimensional <b>tube</b> <b>distance.</b> They showed that a approaches 1 when the tube is an infinite distance from the solid plane and approaches infinity as the tube exit approaches the solid plane. In this work the axisymmetric jet was transformed from the r, z plane to the Psi/^, Phi/^ plane. A non-linear form of the flow equation was derived to solve the problem in the Psi/^, Phi/^ plane. Due to the transformation, R (radial distance) was solved directly; thus avoiding a trial and error method for finding the shape of the free streamline. A value for alpha/^ was selected and the <b>tube</b> <b>distance</b> was calculated. Due to the transformation the flow equation became a second order non-linear partial differential equation and the boundary condition along the free streamline also became non-linear. A relaxation {{technique was}} applied to solve the equation. a was selected equal to 1. 07 for which the <b>tube</b> <b>distance</b> was found to be 1. 494. It was found that the slope of the free streamline approached infinity at the tube exit which must be the case in order for the velocity to be continuous at that point.
