5|$|Lisa hates {{her role}} as a homemaker, and realizing that her future dreams have been shattered, she loses {{interest}} in being a <b>good</b> <b>student.</b> Bart enjoys spending time with the police, and he even ends up stopping Snake during a car chase. When Principal Skinner discovers Bart's new interest in law enforcement, he enlists him as a hall monitor. Bart starts handing out demerits to his classmates for minor infractions and has order restored to the school. When Lisa secretly steals all of the Teachers' Editions of the schoolbooks and reveals the teachers' lack of education, it is up to Bart to figure out who stole the books. Realizing his sister is the culprit, Bart takes the blame and returns to his life as a bad student and detention regular, while Lisa goes back to being a <b>good</b> <b>student.</b> As Bart spents his time in detention, Lisa plays her saxophone outside his classroom to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|Hamasaki was {{initially}} a <b>good</b> <b>student,</b> earning good grades {{in junior high}} school. Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her. Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a high school for the arts, but dropped {{out in the first}} year. Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, so she spent much of her time shopping at Shibuya boutiques and dancing at Velfarre, an Avex-owned disco club.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{main problem}} of this {{research}} was to identify personality characteristics of students whom teachers perceive to be creative and to the characteristics of <b>good</b> <b>students.</b> Polish Adjectives List composed of sixty adjectives measured on the seven-point Likert scale was used twice – to describe creative and <b>good</b> <b>students.</b> A large sample of Polish teachers (N= 630) participated in the study. Confirmatory factor analyses were applied to confirm five-factor structures of profiles. It showed an acceptable fit of the five-factor solutions in case of creative and in case of <b>good</b> <b>students.</b> Five identified factors were: dynamism, intellect, excitability, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Scale reliabilities were high (Cronbach's α exceeds. 80). Creative students were perceived as more dynamic, intellectual, and excitable and less agreeable and conscientious than <b>good</b> <b>students.</b> Effect sizes ranged from low and medium to large. The fact that the perceived profile of creative students is significantly different from good ones has consequences for our understanding of creative students’ situation in a classroom. As those profiles only partially overlap, some students with creative characteristics are in a worse situation in the classroom if they lack the ‘good student’ characteristics...|$|R
5|$|Schnaufer, {{at the age}} of six, went to {{the local}} Volksschule (primary school) at Calw. After {{completing}} his fourth grade, he received two years of schooling at the Oberschule, also in Calw. At an early age he expressed his wish to join an organisation of military character and joined the Deutsches Jungvolk (German Youth) in 1933. After completing his sixth grade at school he took and passed the entry examination at the Backnang National Political Institutes of Education (Nationalpolitische Erziehungsanstalt—Napola), a secondary boarding school founded under the recently established Nazi state. The goal of the Napola schools was to raise a new generation for the political, military and administrative leadership of the Third Reich. Schnaufer was considered a very <b>good</b> <b>student,</b> finishing top of his class every year. Aged seventeen he graduated with his Abitur (diploma) in November 1939 with distinction. At the Napola school he also received the Reich Youth Sports Badge, the base-certificate of the German Life Saving Association (Deutsche Lebens-Rettungs-Gesellschaft), the bronze Hitler Youth-Performance Badge (HJ-Leistungsabzeichen), and completed his B-license to fly glider aircraft. In 1939 Schnaufer was one of two students posted to the Napola in Potsdam. The Flying Platoon (Fliegerzug) stationed in Potsdam centralised all the destined flyers from all the Napolas. Here he learned to fly glider aircraft, at first short hops on the DFS SG 38 Schulgleiter, and later on the two-seater Göppingen Gö 4 which was towed by a Klemm Kl 25. During his stay at Potsdam, the film producer Karl Ritter was making the Ufa film Cadets in Potsdam. The Napola had detached two companies to work on the film, among them Schnaufer. It remains unclear exactly what role he played in this film.|$|E

40|$|The Study {{is about}} the Compensatory Strategies, which are the {{processes}} or strategies that operate on the conceptual and linguistic knowledge as the alternative {{ways to make the}} conversation going when their linguistic weaknesses make them difficult to communicate their intended meanings (Poulisse, 1990, pp. 192 - 193). The writer does this study by comparing the types of Compensatory Strategies used by the good and the poor students of Speaking VI and Speaking II of the English Department, Petra Christian University. The writer then also compares the types of Compensatory Strategies used between the <b>good</b> <b>students</b> of speaking VI and the <b>good</b> <b>students</b> of Speaking II, and the poor students of Speaking VI and the poor students of Speaking II. The writer does this study by asking the subjects to retell the Indonesian folk story, titled Sangkuriang, in English. Finally, the writer finds out that the <b>good</b> <b>students</b> of Speaking VI use more Conceptual Strategies and use fewer Linguistic Strategies than the poor students of Speaking VI do. In addition, the <b>good</b> <b>students</b> of Speaking II also use more Conceptual Strategies and use fewer Linguistic Strategies than the poor students of Speaking II while the poor students of Speaking II almost use Conceptual and Linguistic strategies equally. Then both the <b>good</b> <b>students</b> of Speaking VI and Speaking II use more Conceptual Strategies than both the poor students of Speaking VI and Speaking II do. However, the students of Speaking II tend to use Borrowing Strategy while the students of Speaking VI tend to use Literal translation Strategy. These differences possibly mean that different quantity of linguistic knowledge; different characteristics of learning that the good and the poor students have, and different distance of their L 1 with L 2 between the high semester and low semester students have may cause differences in the use of Compensatory Strategies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: When {{employers}} cannot {{tell whether}} a school truly has many <b>good</b> <b>students</b> or just gives easy grades, schools {{have an incentive}} to inflate grades to help mediocre students, despite concerns about preserving the value of good grades for <b>good</b> <b>students.</b> We construct a signaling model where grades are inflated in equilibrium. The inability to commit to an honest grading policy reduces the informativeness of grades and hurts schools. Grade inflation by one school makes it easier for another school to fool the market with inflated grades. Easy grades are strategic complements, providing a channel to make grade exaggeration contagious...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} models of problem situations {{in the memory of}} good and poor novice students. Subjects were shown very briefly descriptions of physics problems, and after each exposure they were asked to reconstruct the given problem. The short exposure time forces students to rely on models of problem situations in memory for giving reconstructions. Presentation of situations, and reconstructions asked for, varied in modality (words, figures, or combinations). For a number of situations subjects were asked, after they had given a reconstruction, to write down information they thought necessary for solving the problems. Results showed that all students reconstructed important information better than less important information, so both <b>good</b> and poor <b>students</b> seem to have models of problem situations at their disposal. There were, however, also differences between the two groups. First, <b>good</b> <b>students</b> gave a better reconstruction of the question than weak students did. Second, when subjects were requested to change modality in reconstruction (from figure to words or vice versa), <b>good</b> <b>students</b> tended to reconstruct important information better than the weak <b>students.</b> Finally, <b>good</b> <b>students</b> outperformed the weak group in generating information concerning the solution of the proble...|$|R
