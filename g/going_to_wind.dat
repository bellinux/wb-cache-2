500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> up having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E
2500|$|After a poor {{start to}} the 2016–17 season, and poor results overall in the 2016 {{calendar}} year, Pardew was sacked as manager on 22 December 2016; Palace had won only 6 matches of 36 played in 2016. They had won 1 in 11 and were placed 17th in the Premier League table {{at the time of}} his sacking. Palace chairman Steve Parish said Pardew's [...] "expansive style of football hasn't worked", and, [...] "Now we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> the dial back the other way." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1991 to 1993 the {{two teams}} were {{designated}} [...] "AFC" [...] and [...] "NFC" [...] to distinguish where their coaching staffs were from and to stress the professional nature of the game. This was confusing to some, as the game occurred well before the NFL draft {{and there was no}} way of determining which conference the players were actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> up in to start their professional careers. In 1994 this was dropped and the designations were reverted to the traditional [...] "North vs. South" [...] format.|$|E

2500|$|Karl Carter of Atlanta-based Guerrilla Tactics Media said fans of {{the show}} Aqua Teen Hunger Force would {{recognize}} the character and think it was funny, but other people who saw the signs wouldn't get the joke. [...] "This is probably better set up for nightclubs and other sorts of scenarios where {{the people that are}} receiving the message, one, would know what it's about, but also two, wouldn't be frightened," [...] he said. [...] "You know, if you put these in certain environments, like public spaces in this post-9/11 sensitivity, then of course you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> up in trouble." [...] Make magazine editor Phillip Torrone said the advertisers should have used better judgment, but called the Mooninite board a [...] "neat electronic project." [...] As reported by Boing Boing, the media and the State of Massachusetts insisted on maintaining the use of the words [...] "bomb hoax" [...] when describing the event, despite Turner Broadcasting Systems' firm contentions that the devices were not intended to resemble bombs and the company had no intent to arouse suspicion or panic in approving the advertising campaign.|$|E

50|$|Ireland uses an EU {{industry}} subsidy {{known as}} the Public Service Obligation to support development of wind power. The PSO charge is in place so that money is given to companies for generating electricity from renewable sources and to help fund peat-burning stations, as neither are competitive enough without it. Irish homes are charged €63 {{a year in the}} PSO levy, resulting in €328 million <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Wind</b> and peat companies as of 2015. In 2016, this was increased to €72.|$|R

These modules are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have sensors {{connected}} to them to monitor the turbine. The sensors will monitor wind speed, chassis, outside temperature, and voltage off of the main line and batteries...|$|R

60|$|Before the trekschuyt {{had gone}} far, after it {{commenced}} its voyage, a great ship was seen {{coming on the}} canal. She {{was coming from the}} Helder. It was a ship that had come from the West Indies, and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Amsterdam. The <b>wind</b> was contrary for her, and they could not use their sails, and so they were drawing her along by horses. There were two teams of horses, eight in each team. The view of these teams, walking along the tow path, with the immense ship following them in the canal, presented a very imposing spectacle.|$|R

Then, even if {{it keeps}} a stark calm like this, we shall {{be able to get}} across the sands and a mile or two up the channel before we meet the tide. There we must anchor again till the first {{strength}} is past, and then if the wind springs up we can work along {{at the edge of the}} sands against it. There is no tide close in to the sands after the first two hours. But I still think this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> turn into <b>wind</b> presently; and if it does it will be sharp and heavy, I warrant. It's either that or rain." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{stood like}} one bewitched. I drank it in, in a {{speechless}} rapture. The world {{was new to}} me, and I {{had never seen anything}} like this at home. But as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the glories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight wrought upon the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether to note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should have looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it, inwardly, after this fashion: This sun means that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>wind</b> to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small thanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef which is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill somebody's steamboat one of these nights, if it keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling 'boils' show a dissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in the slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is shoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest is the 'break' from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very best place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead tree, with a single living branch, is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> last long, and then how is a body ever <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get through this blind place at night without the friendly old landmark.|$|R

2500|$|Israel was {{concerned}} over the dropout rate, {{and suggested that}} Soviet emigres be flown directly to Israel from the Soviet Union or Romania. Israel argued that it needed highly skilled and well-educated Soviet Jewish immigrants for its survival. In addition to contributing to the country's economic development, Soviet immigration was also seen as a counterweight to the high fertility rate among Israeli-Arabs. In addition, Israel {{was concerned}} that the dropout rate could result in immigration being banned once again. The Ministry of Immigrant Absorption's position was that [...] "it could jeopardize the whole program if Jews supposedly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Israel all <b>wind</b> up in Brooklyn and Los Angeles.

[...] In 1994, Julie was seen {{dressing}} up in a school uniform to turn on Philip, who had become impotent. The scene was attacked by the Broadcasting Standards Council for being [...] "too kinky" [...] for younger viewers to watch. Lisa Anthony from BIG! magazine said that Julie accusing the Lim family of eating her dog Holly was [...] "one of the most bizarre storylines ever".

6000|$|It was in March that we {{received}} a letter from my brother, Lord Walwyn, bidding us adieu, being, when {{we received}} it, already on the high seas with the Marquis of Montrose, to strike another blow for the King. He said he could endure inaction no longer, and that his health had improved so much that he should not be a drag on the expedition. Moreover, it was highly necessary that the Marquis should be accompanied by gentlemen of rank, birth, and experience, who could be entrusted with commands, and when so many hung back it was the more needful for some to go. [...] It was a great stroke to us, for besides that Sir Andrew Macniven went on reiterating that it was mere madness, and there was not a hope of success--the idea of Eustace <b>going</b> <b>to</b> face the <b>winds</b> of spring in the islands of Scotland was shocking enough.|$|R
60|$|The Goorkha rear {{companies}} tripped and blundered over loose stones. The front files halted for {{a moment}} to take stock of the valley and to settle stray boot-laces. Then a happy little sigh of contentment soughed down the ranks, and it was as though the land smiled, for behold there below was the enemy, and it was to meet them that the Goorkhas had doubled so hastily. There was much enemy. There would be amusement. The little men hitched their kukris well to hand, and gaped expectantly at their officers as terriers grin ere the stone is cast for them to fetch. The Goorkhas' ground sloped downward to the valley, and they enjoyed a fair view of the proceedings.

When Rodney leaves the room {{and goes back to}} bed, Del explains to Grandad that Rodney had just met Blossom, a mental hospital patient who is let out on weekends for practice, and accusing people is her hobby which makes her well known to the police. Grandad asks why he doesn't tell Rodney, but Del suggests that he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> Rodney up with the Peckham Pouncer story.

5000|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers {{praised the}} cast while {{acknowledging}} his dislike for the film. Travers rated it {{two out of}} four stars and said, [...] "Think of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke {{the whole thing up}} so you can forget about it in the morning. That's Baywatch in a nutshell." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing: [...] "As was the case with CHiPS, The Dukes of Hazzard, The Beverly Hillbillies, Car 54, Where Are You? and I’ll just stop there, when you make films from junk TV, more often than not you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> up with a junk movie." ...|$|E
5000|$|The townspeople {{gather in}} the White Horse Tavern the evening before a new figure for their town clock made by Karl is to be unveiled.

The people in the tavern listen to Fritz read from his latest story about a local aristocrat, Prince Otto, and his young son, Prince Florian. Prince Otto dies while on a hunting trip. His heart has been replaced with a clockwork mechanism that enables him to drive his son home in their sledge. Fritz wrote down the story after having a dream, but he has not thought of an ending for it, and hopes that {{he will be able to}} think up one on the spot: [...] "He was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> up the story, set it going, and make up the end when he got there." ...|$|E
6000|$|For the Prussian Horse fly wildly; {{and it is}} in vain to rally.

[...] rallies his own regiment, and some others; charges fiercely in with them again; gets a sabre-slash across the face,--does not mind the sabre-slash, small bandaging will do;--gets a bullet through the head (or through the heart, it is not said which); [Helden-Geschichte, [...] i. 899.] and falls down dead; his regiment <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>winds</b> again, and HIS care of it and of other things concluding in this honorable manner. Nothing can rally that right wing; or the more you rally, the worse it fares: they are clearly no match for Romer, these Prussian Horse. They fly along the front of their own First Line of Infantry, they fly between the two Lines; Romer chasing,--till the fire of the Infantry (intolerable to our enemies, and hitting some even of our fugitive friends) repels him. For the notable point in all this was the conduct of the Infantry; and how it stood in these wild vortexes of ruin; impregnable, immovable, as if every man of it were stone; and steadily poured out deluges of fire,--"five Prussian shots for two Austrian:"--such is perfect discipline against imperfect; and the iron ramrod against the wooden.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – As {{many other}} European countries, Ger-many is now <b>going</b> <b>to</b> install large <b>wind</b> farms off shore. The {{turbines}} used in such farms are variable speed wind turbines, either doubly-fed induction generators or syn-chronous generators with full size converter. These tur-bines offer {{the capability of}} decoupled active and reactive power control. Modern onshore and offshore wind farms must provide reactive power or voltage control {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) on demand of the system op-erators. But fast changes in active power as a result of changing wind speeds can lead to fast changes in the volt-age at the PCC. In this paper, a new wind farm control system will be presented which makes use of local voltage controller at each turbine using voltage reference settings from the wind farm controller. The controller is charac-terized by a hierarchical system structure {{with a high degree of}} autonomous local control capability. The pro-posed approach is demonstrated by simulation results conducted for a wind farm, currently under planning in Germany...|$|R
