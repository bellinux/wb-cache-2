5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> a {{few weeks}} after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ACLU of Washington State {{joined with}} a pro-gun rights organization, the Second Amendment Foundation, and prevailed {{in a lawsuit}} against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> its policy of refusing to disable {{restrictions}} upon an adult patron's request. Library patrons attempting to access pro-gun web sites were blocked, and the library refused to remove the blocks. In 2012, the ACLU sued the same library system for refusing to temporarily, at the request of an adult patron, disable Internet filters which blocked access to Google Images.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> {{more than two}} months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent {{the next three years}} traveling, beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours of Europe and the Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, a panel led by Thomas R. Pickering and Michael Mullen {{issued its}} {{report on the}} matter. It was sharply {{critical}} of State Department officials <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> ignoring requests for more guards and safety upgrades and for failing to adapt security procedures to a deteriorating security environment. It focused its criticism on the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs; four State Department officials at the assistant secretary level and below were removed from their posts as a consequence. Clinton said she accepted the conclusions of the report and that changes were underway to implement its suggested recommendations.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War {{that broke}} out in 1939 {{consumed}} {{the attention of a}} new generation. Across most of the theatres of conflict, the participants attempted to respect the memorials to World War I. After the Second World War there was no equivalent mass construction of memorials to the war dead; instead, often local World War I memorials were adapted for use instead: additional names might be inscribed to the existing lists. In some cases, this resulted in memorials losing their exclusive focus on World War I. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>for</b> example, was expanded in 1950s to include corpses from the Second World War and Korea War, broadening the memorial's remit to commemorate most modern wars. In other cases, such as the Australian War Memorial, begun in the inter-war years but only opened in 1941, an essentially new memorial was formed to honour the multiple conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was not a}} success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple's only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never substantiated, both that Benjamin was impotent, and that Natalie was unfaithful.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, Grant {{and his family}} stayed with Fish <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> two months before setting out on a world tour that lasted {{approximately}} {{two and a half}} years. Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, Grant and Julia left for England aboard the SS Indiana. During the tour the Grants made stops in Europe, the Mediterranean the Holy Land and points in the Middle East, meeting with notable dignitaries, such as Queen Victoria, Pope Leo XIII, Otto von Bismarck, Emperor Meiji and others. Grant was the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. During the tour, supported by the Hayes administration transported on naval ships, Grant assumed an unprecedented diplomatic capacity, unofficially representing the United States to strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process. Homesick, the Grants left Japan sailing on the City of Tokio escorted by a Japanese man-of-war, crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.|$|E
5|$|The first bomb {{assembly}} {{team was}} formed in August 1947, followed by a second in December and a third in March 1948. Experience with assembling the bombs convincingly demonstrated the requirement, in Sandia if not <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>for</b> a much larger unit. Groves reluctantly approved a 109-man special weapons unit, and Montague converted the three lettered companies of the 38th Engineer Battalion into special weapons units. In 1948, they began training a Navy special weapons unit, as the Navy foresaw delivery of nuclear weapons with its new North American AJ Savage bombers from its s. This unit became the 471st Naval Special Weapons Unit on its certification in August 1948. Two Air Force units were created in September and December 1948, which became the 502d and 508th Aviation Squadrons. An additional Army special weapons unit was created in May 1948, and in December, the 38th Engineer Battalion (Special) became the 8460th Special Weapons Group, with all seven special weapons units under its command. The four Army units were then renamed the 111th, 122d, 133d and 144th Special Weapons Units. During the late 1940s the Air Force gradually became the major user of nuclear weapons, {{and by the end}} of 1949, it had twelve assembly units, and another three in training, while the Army had only four, and the Navy three, one for each of the three Midway-class carriers.|$|E

Upon completing his tour of duty in the Far East he returned to the United States during the summer of 1910 and assumed command of the Marine Barracks, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on 11 October of that year.|$|E

The average {{amount of time}} people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, while 34% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8.8km, while 20% travel for over 12km in a single direction.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, Morton {{moved to}} Washington, D.C., {{to become the}} manager and piano player of a bar called at various times the Music Box, Blue Moon Inn, and Jungle Inn, in Shaw, an African-American {{neighborhood}} of the city. (The building that housed the nightclub still stands, at 1211 U Street NW.) Morton was also the master of ceremonies, bouncer, and bartender of the club. He lived <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> a few years; the club owner allowed all her friends free admission and drinks, which prevented Morton from making the business a success.|$|E
25|$|The bombing tests {{had several}} {{immediate}} and turbulent results. Almost immediately the Navy and President Harding were incensed by an apparent demonstration of naval weakness just after Harding had announced on July 10 invitations to other naval powers to gather <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> {{a conference on}} the limitation of naval armaments. Statements asserting the obsolescence of the battleship by disarmament proponents in Congress such as Senator William Borah heightened official anxiety. Both services tried to defuse the results by reports from the Joint Board and General Pershing dismissing Mitchell's claims and suppressing his report, but the latter was leaked to the press.|$|E

Abramoff worked as a clerk in the prison chaplain’s office for 12 cents an hour. He was also teaching courses in public speaking and screenwriting to his fellow inmates and instituted a popular movie night.|$|E
25|$|Hagan {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 2014. The Washington Post considered her seat vulnerable. The Fiscal Times reported that Hagan benefitted from a presidential election, with its higher voter turnout, in 2008 and that without one in 2014 the race {{appeared to be a}} toss-up. Hagan declined to attend ceremonies for President Barack Obama's January 2014 visit to North Carolina, deciding instead to remain <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> Senate votes. Pundits questioned whether Hagan was attempting to distance herself from the President, whose popularity in North Carolina waned significantly after he won the state in his 2008 presidential bid.|$|E
25|$|Prior to its {{inclusion}} {{within the}} fenced compound that now includes the Old Executive Office Building {{to the west}} and the Treasury Building to the east, this sidewalk served as a queuing area for the daily public tours of the White House.

In September 2003, they resumed on a limited basis for groups making prior arrangements through their Congressional representatives or embassies <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>for</b> foreign nationals and submitting to background checks, but the White House remained closed to the public. White House tours were suspended for most of 2013 due to budget constraints after sequestration. The White House reopened to the public in November 2013.|$|E
