40|$|The {{current study}} investigates {{financial}} and emotional consequences to workers as the U. S. {{economy continues to}} shift from a manufacturing to a service economy. One hundred eighty-eight garment workers were surveyed before their plant closed in 1998 and six months later to assess reemployment opportunities, <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> and emotional well-being. All workers experienced some <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> after the plant closed, with single parents reporting the greatest <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty.</b> Workers who became immediately reemployed lost an average of $ 2. 41 in wages per hour. Sixteen {{percent of the sample}} lost their health insurance. Overall depression and anxiety scores declined over six months, but not evenly. Men and single women did not significantly decline in depression or anxiety. <b>Financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> was the most important predictor for both depression and anxiety. Immediate reemployment served to increase depression in the presence of <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{described}} the prevalence {{and characteristics of}} <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food {{and its relation to}} nutritional biomarkers in older disabled women. METHODS: Baseline data were analyzed from the Women's Health and Aging Study, a population-based survey of 1002 community-dwelling, disabled women 65 years and older from Baltimore, Md. RESULTS: Minority women (49. 5 %) were more likely than White women (13. 4 %) to report <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food (odds ratio [OR] = 6. 2, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 4. 5, 8. 6). Of the women reporting <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food, only 19. 3 % received food stamps and fewer than 7 % participated in food assistance programs. Women reporting <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food had higher levels of psychologic depression than women not reporting such difficulty. Greater likelihood of <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food was associated with poorer quality of life and physical performance among White women and with more medical conditions among minority women. Finally, anemia (hemoglobin < 120 g/L) was associated with <b>financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food (age-adjusted OR = 2. 9, 95 % CI = 1. 9, 4. 3). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Financial</b> <b>difficulty</b> acquiring food was common, and receipt of nutritional services was rare, in community-dwelling, older disabled women. Nutrition assistance programs for the elderly should reexamine their effectiveness in preventing nutritional deficits in older disabled women...|$|R

5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} <b>financial</b> <b>difficulties</b> after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of <b>financial</b> <b>difficulties,</b> shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's development cycle, and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
