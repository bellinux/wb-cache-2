5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the president. Clinton formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

25|$|President Reagan lit {{the tree}} from <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> in 1986, 1987, and 1988.

25|$|Like the English and Irish country houses it {{was modeled}} on, the White House was, from the start, {{open to the}} public until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. President Thomas Jefferson held an open house for his second inaugural in 1805, and many of the people at his {{swearing-in}} ceremony at the Capitol followed him home, where he greeted them in the Blue Room. Those open houses sometimes became rowdy: in 1829, President Andrew Jackson had to leave for a hotel when roughly 20,000 citizens celebrated his inauguration <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> His aides ultimately had to lure the mob outside with washtubs filled with a potent cocktail of orange juice and whiskey. Even so, the practice continued until 1885, when newly elected Grover Cleveland arranged for a presidential review of the troops from a grandstand in front of the White House instead of the traditional open house. Jefferson also permitted public tours of his house, which have continued ever since, except during wartime, and began the tradition of annual receptions on New Year's Day and on the Fourth of July. Those receptions ended in the early 1930s, although President Bill Clinton would briefly revive the New Year's Day open house in his first term.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 2001, Bush {{had been}} hosting {{her father and}} {{mother-in-law}} George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush at the White House and was scheduled to give a testimony to Congress on education. Instead, during the September 11 attacks, Bush was taken to <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and placed in an underground bunker, later being met by her husband, who had returned to Washington from Florida. Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush inaugurated a music concert at the Kennedy Center, organized to fundraise for families of the victims. Though she received applause, she returned the compliment {{to members of the}} audience and added that although the event was tragic, Americans had deepened their appreciation [...] "of life itself, how fragile it can be, what a gift it is and how much we need each other." [...] Senator Ted Kennedy, who introduced Bush at the event, praised her and said he knew his deceased sibling, the late President John F. Kennedy, would also be proud of her. Bush believes the September 11 attacks ignited the interest in the way Afghanistan women were treated, who were not allowed to leave their homes and of which composed a high number of widows due to terrorist attacks in Afghanistan prior to the attacks.|$|E

On June 16, 2015 District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sentenced him to a 17-month prison sentence {{to be followed by}} three years of probation. Collyer also ordered Gonzalez to stay out of Washington, D.C., give the secret Service access to his medical records, and give up his firearms and weapons. She addressed Gonzalez directly, saying [...] "No more guns, no more machetes, no more knives, no more tomahawks. Got it?" [...] Gonzalez said [...] "I would like to apologize. I am sorry for my actions. I never meant to harm anyone. I want to commit to maintain my treatment that started at the prison." [...] Prosecutor Vincent Cohen, who had recommended 18 months in prison, stated [...] "Mr. Gonzalez is now paying the price for his foolish decision to jump the fence and run <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> The prison sentence imposed by the court should deter others from taking actions that needlessly put the First Family and White House employees at risk." ...|$|E

2500|$|The ease {{of access}} to the President that Helms enjoyed in the Johnson Administration changed {{dramatically}} and for the worse with the arrival of President Richard Nixon and Nixon's national security advisor, Henry Kissinger. In order to dominate policy, [...] "Nixon insisted on isolating himself" [...] from the Washington bureaucracy he did not trust. His primary gatekeepers were H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman; they screened Nixon from [...] "the face-to-face confrontations he so disliked and dreaded." [...] While thus pushing away even top officials, Nixon started to build policy-making functions <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> From a secure distance he would direct the government and deal with [...] "the outside world, including cabinet members". Regarding intelligence matters, Nixon appointed Kissinger and his team to convey his instructions to the CIA and sister services. Accordingly, Nixon and Kissinger understood that [...] "they alone would conceive, command, and control clandestine operations. Covert action and espionage could be tools fitted for their personal use. Nixon used them to build a political fortress at the White House." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{divisions}} between Obama and Clinton that many observers had originally predicted, never happened. Indeed, {{a writer for}} The New York Times Magazine declared that [...] "Obama and Clinton have instead led the least discordant national-security team in decades, despite enormous challenges on almost every front." [...] In part, this was because Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. Nevertheless, there were limitations to her influence: Much of {{the handling of the}} Middle East, Iraq, and Iran was done by the White House or Pentagon during her tenure, and on some other issues as well, policy-making was kept <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> among Obama's inner circle of advisors. There were also differences of opinion. Clinton failed to persuade Obama to arm and train Syrian rebels in 2012, but overcame initial opposition to gain approval of her visit to Burma in 2011. Clinton's initial idea of having special envoys under her handling key trouble spots fell apart due to various circumstances. Clinton did find bureaucratic success in edging out the U.S. Commerce Department, by having the State Department take a lead role in sales pitches in favor of U.S. companies. In doing so, she helped negotiate international deals for the likes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Westinghouse Electric Company. Clinton believed, more than most prior secretaries, that the commercial aspects of diplomacy and the promotion of international trade were vital to American foreign policy goals.|$|E
