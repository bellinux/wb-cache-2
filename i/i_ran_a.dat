500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying to talk to me about how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E
2500|$|The new line-up signalled {{a decisive}} change in musical policy - early songs are dropped {{and a more}} retro, rock 'n' roll sound, highly {{influenced}} by American 1960s surf music and garage rock emerged. Jack formed the self-funded label Ostrich GT and released the debut 7" [...] single [...] "Can't Get Enough", which showcased the band's rapidly developing Hot Rod aesthetic ("I've been around / The fuzz ran me downtown / They say <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> red light / Oh well, I guess they were right"). The single sold well at early gigs and a follow-up was soon issued. [...] "Chrysler 440" [...] continued the street racing theme while B-side [...] "Fuel Injection (it's better)" [...] reflected Jack's knowledge of classic cars ("I got a big block Ford / It had a carburettor / Now I've got fuel injection / It's better"). Jack's occasional Ostrich Club nights held in various venues around Doncaster saw the band develop a loyal following and a growing reputation as they headlined their own gigs and supported some bigger names.|$|E
2500|$|Selig's {{testimony}} {{on the subject}} has been contradictory. [...] In 2005, Selig told reporters, [...] "I never even heard about them [...] until 1998 or 1999. [...] <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them. [...] It wasn't until 1998 or ’99 that I heard the discussion." [...] But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: [...] "In 1994, before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA. [...] As early as 1998, I began formulating a strategic plan to eliminate the use of performance-enhancing substances from the game." [...] During the 1988 ALCS, Oakland's Jose Canseco had been repeatedly taunted by Boston fans with a chant of [...] "ster-oids, ster-oids, ster-oids." [...] Speaking at the 2013 All-Star Game, Selig complained, [...] "People say, ‘Well, you were slow to react.’ We were not slow to react. In fact, I heard that this morning, and it aggravated me all over again." ...|$|E

60|$|As it happened, {{this letter}} was {{enclosed}} to Amy herself, and not {{sent by the}} way I had at first ordered; but it came safe to my hands; and though I was alarmed a little at it, yet I was not acquainted with the danger I was in of an immediate visit from this teasing creature till afterwards; and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> greater risk, indeed, than ordinary, in that I did not send Amy up under thirteen or fourteen days, believing myself as much concealed at Tunbridge as if I had been at Vienna.|$|E
60|$|I was fain to comply, though <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> {{risk that}} I find impossible, now, to justify to myself.

Still, my feelings were aroused, and to the excitement of a race, was added the serious but vague apprehensions all American seamen felt, in that day, of the great belligerents. It is a singular proof of human justice, that the very consequences of these apprehensions are made matter of reproach against them.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was shaken}} but not {{hurt by the}} fall; so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I {{understood}} that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly, however, as <b>I</b> <b>ran,</b> <b>a</b> deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose-bushes.|$|E
60|$|But he {{presented}} an exceedingly difficult shot. Backing down the ridge, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> little way {{to come up}} behind another tree, from which I soon shifted to a fallen pine. Over this I peeped, to get a splendid view of the wolf. He had stopped tugging at the horse, and stood with his nose in the air. Surely {{he could not have}} scented me, for the wind was strong from him to me; neither could he have heard my soft footfalls on the pine needles; nevertheless, he was suspicious. Loth to spoil the picture he made, I risked a chance, and waited. Besides, though I prided myself on being able to take a fair aim, I had no great hope that I could hit him at such a distance. Presently he returned to his feeding, but not for long. Soon he raised his long, fine-pointed head, and trotted away a few yards, stopped to sniff again, then went back to his gruesome work.|$|E
60|$|I had one {{reputation}} that I valued. At first when I {{went to the}} Hammersmith swimming-baths with the other boys, I was afraid to plunge in until I had gone so far down the ladder that the water came up to my thighs; but one day when I was alone I fell from the spring-board which was five or six feet above the water. After that I would dive from a greater height than the others and I practised swimming under water and pretending not {{to be out of}} breath when I came up. And then if <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>a</b> race, I took care not to pant or show any sign of strain. And in this I had an advantage even over the athlete; for though he could run faster and was harder to tire than anybody else, he grew very pale and I was often paid compliments. I used to run with my friend when he was training to keep him in company. He would give me a long start and soon overtake me.|$|E
