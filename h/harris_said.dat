5|$|In February 1828, Martin Harris {{arrived to}} assist Smith by transcribing his dictation. Harris {{also took a}} sample of the {{characters}} to a few prominent scholars, including Charles Anthon. <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> Anthon initially authenticated the characters and their translation, but then retracted his opinion after learning that Smith claimed to have received the plates from an angel. Anthon denied Harris's account of the meeting, claiming instead that he had tried to convince Harris that he was the victim of a fraud. In any event, Harris returned to Harmony in April 1828, and continued as Smith's scribe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> {{that he came}} up {{with the}} idea for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre {{production}} of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. Kids Can Say No!, released in October 1985 on VHS in the United Kingdom, was the first British children's film about sexual abuse and was purchased by police forces, educational institutions, and libraries across Europe. Upon the film's release, The Times obtained opinions from four sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! or any other film to teach children about the subject. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation received a positive response to its 1988 broadcast of Kids Can Say No! and therefore broadcast it a second time that year. Harris and Skippon collaborated on the 1986 sequel Beyond the Scare, which advises teachers about what to do if a child discloses abuse. Showings of Kids Can Say No! eventually decreased as VHS became less popular.|$|E
5|$|Yi chose Dan Fegan as {{his agent}} to {{represent}} {{him in the}} NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted {{by many to be}} picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them {{to be one of the}} teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city of Milwaukee did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.|$|E

500|$|Kids Can Say No! is a twenty-minute British short {{educational}} film intended {{to teach children}} about sexual abuse. <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> he was naive about the subject and was motivated to make the film by a female teacher who told him that, when she spoke to her students about abuse, a traumatised girl {{ran out of the}} room; the girl later disclosed that she was being abused by a family member. According to Harris, he {{came up with the idea}} for the film on a 1982 Canadian tour when he saw Vancouver's Green Thumb Theatre production of Feeling Yes, Feeling No, a play about child sexual abuse. He was also inspired by a similar Australian production and a Swedish film about two children befriended by a large man on a farm. In an interview, <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> that, when he saw the Swedish film, he thought the man was going to abuse the children, but that his expectations were incorrect and that [...] "the film was completely innocent; I was not".|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} highly praised by critics; IGN's Craig <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> that Golden Sun could [...] "arguably {{be one of}} the best 2D-based Japanese RPGs created for any system." [...] The game was also commercially successful, having sold more than one million copies in Japan and the United States, {{spawning}} a series that eventually included three games and appearances in other media. Golden Sun was re-released for the Virtual Console via the Wii U eShop in April 2014.|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Colosseum as {{the first}} true 3D {{role-playing}} installment in the Pokémon series. Gamers Hell reviewer John K. called it [...] "certainly {{a step in the}} right direction to a good 3D Pokémon game", although he felt that the limited number of Pokémon and lack of a true overworld detracted from the experience. IGN staff writer Craig <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> that the adaptation of the Pokémon RPG formula to the 3D zeitgeist [...] "does a decent enough job" [...] and is [...] "a bit more linear and straightforward".|$|E

500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore {{described}} Wonderwall Music as [...] "a soundtrack to a {{rarely seen}} film, though Harrison's music was inventive and the album remains among his best works". In the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, however, Mac Randall gave the release two-and-a-half stars (out of five) and grouped it with Electronic Sound as being [...] "interesting, though only for established fans". In a 2011 assessment for Mojo, John <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "As subtly inventive as you'd expect, though hardly compulsory." ...|$|E
500|$|T.I. as Rashad, {{the narrator}} of the story. Chris Robinson had {{directed}} Harris' first music video four {{years prior to the}} creation of ATL, and was very impressed by his charisma and presence. [...] "But on this film he came to the table, worked so hard and never tried to be T.I.— he became Rashad." [...] On being a part of the film's production, <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> he felt [...] "it was the most honest representation of my culture and my city ever to be put on screen and the largest production to be ever filmed in Atlanta, so I [...] somewhat obligated." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer {{and acting}} coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman's work ethic with his impressions. He {{assembled}} {{a collection of}} video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he [...] "completely embodied the person". Ryan concluded that [...] "what made [...] so funny and spot on was Phil's ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors." [...] Hartman described this process as [...] "technical." [...] Journalist Lyle V. <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> Hartman showed a [...] "rare talent for morphing into [...] anybody he wanted to be".|$|E

500|$|The {{portrait}} in oil of the Queen wearing a turquoise dress, measuring , took {{two months to}} complete. Two sittings were held at Buckingham Palace {{in the summer of}} 2005; Harris subsequently completed the painting at his own art studio. The two sittings were filmed by the BBC. Prior to painting the portrait <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> that he wanted to [...] "get the real person rather than the state image" [...] and intended that it would be [...] "representational of the way the Queen looks and her obvious charm and friendly quality, rather than the very formal". Harris aimed to create an [...] "impressionistic" [...] as opposed to a [...] "photographic" [...] portrait of the Queen.|$|E
500|$|Relegation and {{financial}} problems saw a sharp {{downturn in the}} club's fortunes between 2001 and 2005, and in 2003 the then manager Kim <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> that the owner Rajesh Khosla was [...] "raping us", after Khosla sold the Kingstonian ground for £2 million in personal profit. However, in February 2005 Khosla stepped down as chairman, selling the club to Jimmy Cochrane, whilst making a profit. While this did not save Kingstonian from relegation that year, the 2005–06 season saw Kingstonian Football Club revitalised. They only narrowly missed out on the promotion playoffs and finished their season by beating AFC Wimbledon in {{the final of the}} Surrey Senior Cup at Woking's ground by one goal to nil.|$|E
500|$|Mania Entertainment's Megan Lavey said Syaoran's and Sakura's initial {{relationship}} is a [...] "pretty simple love story", and liked their personalities. IGN's Jeff <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> Syaoran's role is interesting because he sacrifices {{his relationship with}} Sakura and his own life to recover her memories. Active Anime's Christopher Seaman said the romantic relationship between them {{is one of the}} most mature parts of the series, and it helped balance the other fantastic themes, which added more variety for the series' audience. Kimlinger said their relationship made up for some problems in the anime adaptation. Kimlinger also said Jason Liebrecht's role as Syaoran's English voice is better than Irino's work. However, Kimlinger praised both performances because of the way Syaoran's emotions are played.|$|E

[...] The following month, it was confirmed that the track was titled [...] "Call My Name", and it would be released as the lead single from Cheryl's third studio album, A Million Lights, on 10 June 2012.

The track had its radio premiere on Capital FM's breakfast show on 23 April 2012.|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{initially}} reviewed and received positive ratings in the June1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly. Steve <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> {{that the game}} was very large and expansive, noting that it [...] "is so big, and has so much to offer, most of the competition pales by comparison". Ed Semrad called the game [...] "a worthy sequel that fortunately {{is better than the}} original", similarly noting the game's size as well as difficulty. Donn Nauert appreciated the game's good graphics which complement the adventure theme, but he noted that some of the precise movements that are required in various areas may cause some frustration in gameplay. Jim Allee praised all the aspects of the game, saying [...] "if you liked Wizards & Warriors, you'll love Ironsword". All four reviewers lauded the game's involving gameplay and graphics.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and has been}} cited by many critics {{as one of the}} best in the series, with several commentators calling the twist ending shocking, unexpected and likely to change the direction of the entire series. Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker praised the twist of the episode, which he said [...] "sent the series spinning into a whole new direction for next season". Tucker praised the Dexter writing staff, [...] "for maintaining the suspense while creating a whole new world within the Dexter world: the awful universe of Trinity and his own trapped family." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun said the episode was good before the final scene, but that the twist shed a whole different light on several scenes. <b>Harris</b> <b>said</b> of the twist, [...] "It's nice to know TV can still be that impactful, isn't it? But my God, what a stunner." ...|$|E
