5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|A major railway, {{known as}} the Eurasian Land Bridge allows goods to be transported from China and the EEU to Europe. An {{expansion}} of the original railway line named the New Eurasian Land Bridge provides an uninterrupted rail link between China and the EEU. Talks with China, India and Burma are ongoing to expand the railway network. In June 2014, {{it was announced that}} Russia, North Korea and South Korea would cooperate to expand the Eurasian Land Bridge to connect the peninsula. Advantages of exporting products by rail through the EEU are reduced shipping times and reduced costs. The railways also <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> expansion, with the future creation of high-speed railway lines being considered.|$|E
5|$|Hick used Irenaeus' {{notion of}} {{two-stage}} creation {{and supported the}} belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if {{there is an element of}} mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.|$|E

25|$|To avoid its toxic {{adverse effects}} Xanthium sibiricum must be processed. Hepatotoxicity has been {{reported}} with products containing Polygonum multiflorum, glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum. The herbs indicated as being hepatotoxic included Dictamnus dasycarpus, Astragalus membranaceous, and Paeonia lactiflora. Contrary to popular belief, Ganoderma lucidum mushroom extract, as an adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy, appears to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> toxicity. A 2013 review suggested that although the antimalarial herb Artemisia annua may not cause hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy due to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.|$|E

Hepatotoxicity has been reported with products containing Polygonum multiflorum, glycyrrhizin, Senecio and Symphytum.

Metal fuels have been used in water reactors and liquid metal fast breeder reactors, such as EBR-II.|$|E

25|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> causing serious infection in newborn infants. Unpasteurized milk and cheeses can promote the growth of Listeria bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes can also cause serious infection in an infant and pregnant woman and can be transmitted to her infant in utero or after birth. The infection {{has the potential of}} seriously harming or even causing the death of a preterm infant, an infant of low or very low birth weight, or an infant with an immune system defect or a congenital defect of the immune system. The presence of this pathogen can sometimes be determined by the symptoms that appear as a gastrointestinal illness in the mother. The mother can also acquire infection from ingesting food that contains other animal products such as, hot dogs, delicatessen meats, and cheese.|$|E
25|$|Barolos {{tend to be}} rich, deeply {{concentrated}} full bodied wines with pronounced tannins and acidity. The {{wines are}} almost always lightly colored varying from ruby to garnet in their youth to more brick and orange hues as they age. Like Pinot noir, Barolos are never opaque. Barolos <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> {{a wide range of}} complex and exotic aromas with tar and roses being common notes. Other aromas associated with Barolos include camphor, chocolate, dried fruit, damsons, eucalyptus, leather, licorice, mint, mulberries, plum, spice, strawberries, tobacco, white truffles as well as dried and fresh herbs. The tannins of the wine add texture and serve to balance Barolo's moderate to high alcohol levels (Minimum 13% but most often above 15% ABV). Excessive extraction from prolonged maceration periods and oak aging can give the wines an over-extracted bitterness.|$|E

In November 2008, the company announced a two-year agreement to look at developing wind farms on land owned by UK Coal.

500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B-" [...] grade, opining that, [...] "the peaks on Neighborhoods — their first disc {{in eight years}} — {{do little more than}} recall past triumphs. Outside of some latent goth leanings ('This Is Home') and a gauzy detour ('Ghost on the Dance Floor'), it's mostly twitch-crunch-whine-repeat." [...] Michael Brown of Drowned in Sound gave a mixed review, {{awarding}} the album a lukewarm five out of ten. He critiqued that, [...] "Blink <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> much more than their past reputation may convey, but Neighborhoods is reminiscent of that first awkward conversation after a heated argument, as no-one's quite sure where to go next." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album three stars out of five, noting elements of sophistication, introspection, and darkness in the music and lyrics and commenting that [...] "Some Clinton-era pants-dropping might've been a fun nostalgia move. But those days are gone; it's their early-2010s nightmare as much as anyone else's." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club was critical of DeLonge's vocals, saying that he [...] "sounds flat as ever, and has a fondness for clunky lyrics", concluding that [...] "Although Blink-182 has long since left its past as a bare-bones punk band behind, overwrought rock isn't its forte, either. Neighborhoods finds a nice balance between the two, but it could still use a little less fussiness." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine considered it uninspired: [...] "When they try to add relatively ambitious elements to the things they actually do well, Blink-182 is more successful. [...] It's admirable that Blink-182 tries to challenge themselves over the course of Neighborhoods, but their growing pains don't make for a particularly good album or a welcome comeback." [...] Scott McLennan of The Boston Globe considered the album a step forward, summarizing, [...] "Blink-182 again delivers a record with nothing outright awful and enough dynamite songs to pack a punch at future tours." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin called the album [...] "surprisingly and refreshingly low-key," [...] but its self-examination [...] "comparatively adrift" [...] with the sound of their past.|$|E
