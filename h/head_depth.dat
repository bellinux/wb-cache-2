50|$|The eye of {{a silver}} bream is very large by {{comparison}} with its head, and this character also distinguishes it from the bronze bream {{as well as from}} all other European cyprinids apart from the bleak. The eye is round, protruding and with yellowish cornea and black iris. Head length from tip of snout to far extent of gill plate is about 4 times as large as the eye diameter, and <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> is 2.5 times as large, irrespective of the age of the fish. In bronze bream the relationship between eye size and head length changes considerably over the lifetime of the fish, being initially similar to the ratios in silver bream, but in full-grown fish the head length can be as much as 6-7 times eye width and <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> 4-5 times. The measurements are taken along lines bisecting the eye in both directions. The eye is also set very close the end of the snout, and close {{to the top of the}} head, but in bronze bream this is far less the case.|$|E
50|$|The golden skiffia {{is a small}} fish, {{reaching}} a maximum standard length (SL) of around 43 mm, with a wedge shaped head and upturned lips. It has of a row 30-35 deeply cleft outer teeth in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. Inner teeth can be cleft or conical, and are scattered irregularly. The species shows sexual dimorphism with males having larger fins, and a greater body and <b>head</b> <b>depth.</b> Males also have a notched dorsal fin, which females lack. Males are a bright gold color with a gray overcast. The gold coloration is most vibrant during courtship, largely fading to the dorsal, caudal, and anal fins in non-courting males. Females have a greater body width, and both females and juveniles are gray-green, with scattered black flecks on their backs and along the lateral line. Females do not change color during courtship. Both sexes have a black crescent just before the tail fin.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether or not starting block height has an effect on the <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> and head speed of competitive racing starts. Eleven experienced, collegiate swimmers executed competitive racing starts from three different starting heights: 0. 21 m (pool deck), 0. 46 m (intermediate block), and 0. 76 m (standard block). One-way repeated measures ANOVA indicated that starting height had a significant effect on the maximum depth of the center of the head, head speed at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth,</b> and distance from starting wall at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth.</b> Racing starts from the standard block and pool deck were significantly deeper, faster, and farther at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> than starts from the intermediate block. There were no differences between depth, speed, or distance between the standard block and pool deck. We conclude that there is not a positive linear relationship between starting depth and starting height, which means that starts do not necessarily get deeper as the starting height increases...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that swimmers perform deeper starts in deeper water (Blitvich, McElroy, Blanksby, Clothier, & Pearson, 2000; Cornett, White, Wright, Willmott, & Stager, 2011). To provide additional information relevant to the depth adjustments swimmers make {{as a function of}} water depth and the validity of values reported in prior literature, 11 collegiate swimmers were asked to execute racing starts in three water depths (1. 53 m, 2. 14 m, and 3. 66 m). One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the maximum depth of the center of the head was significantly deeper in 3. 66 m as compared to the shallower water depths. No differences due to water depth were detected in head speed at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> or in the distance from the wall at which maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> occurred.

40|$|To expand upon recent {{findings}} {{showing that}} competitive swimmers complete significantly shallower racing starts in shallower pools, 12 more experienced and 13 less experienced swimmers were filmed underwater during completion of competitive starts. Two starts (1 routine and 1 “requested shallow”) were executed from a 0. 76 m block height into water 3. 66 m deep. Dependent measures were maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth,</b> head speed at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth,</b> and {{distance from the}} starting wall at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth.</b> Statistical analyses yielded significant main effects (p < 0. 05) for both start type and swimmer experience.

30|$|We {{solve these}} {{dimensionless}} equations {{by using the}} finite difference method. For the numerical calculation, the dimensionless coordinate is divided into equally spaced grid points. The number of grid points covering the whole conduit is always set to be 100.

The magma <b>head</b> <b>depth,</b> which moves upward with time, is not always located at a grid point. The grid point just below the magma <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> is used for the calculation, and the dimension-less variables at the top grid point are determined by linearly interpolating the values at the boundary of the magma head and the values at the grid just beneath the highest grid. The magma <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> is calculated by using the magma velocity at the top grid point, which is determined from Eq. (25). When the magma head reaches the ground surface, the calculation is stopped.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} the {{investigation}} is to estimate such value of a tank <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> wherein the maximum capacity of vehicle is provided and a tank vessel durability meets the requirements. Methodo-logy. The problem solution was carried out with using the {{finite element analysis program}} NASTRAN. The finite element model is a tank shell of the railway eight-wheel tank car of model 15 - 1443. The load was presented as pressure. The value was accepted equal 0, 4 MPa. The finite element model strain-stress state was analyzed. The tank <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> changed ranging from 0, 2 m to 1, 5 m. Findings. The rational tank <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> was 0, 47 m from the tank vessel durability condition. This allows to improve the basic tank car parameters. It means to increase the tank vessel volume and to increase the capacity at 0, 7 ton. Authors has investigated that an additional increase of the tank vessel volume and the vehicle capacity can be achieved when the tank head sheets thickness as high as 13 mm. In this case it is necessary to recognize that the rational tank <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> is 0, 4 m. Tank capacity can be increase at 1 ton. Originality. This paper presents the method of analysis of the tank car volume increase. The tank car volume increase and thus а capacity of vehicle increase allows to improve the car productiveness. Calculations results allow to give the dependence of the maximum equivalent stresses in a tank head which the depth of the one change. Practical value. It is shown that the tank <b>head</b> <b>depth</b> reduction will allow to improve parameters of the existing railway tank when the tank vessel durability meets the requirements.

40|$|To expand upon {{previous}} studies showing inexperienced high school swimmers can complete significantly shallower racing starts {{when asked to}} start “shallow,” 42 age group swimmers (6 - 14 years old) were filmed underwater during completion of competitive starts.

40|$|The head depths {{and head}} speeds of {{swimmers}} attained following {{the execution of}} racing starts during competition have not been well described. To address this, 211 competitive starts were filmed into a starting depth of 2. 29 m with a block height of 0. 76 m. Starts were stratified according to age, sex, stroke, and swim meet. Dependent measures were maximum depth {{of the center of}} the head, head speed at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth,</b> and distance from the wall at maximum <b>head</b> <b>depth.</b> Significant main effects existed for age for all three measures: F(1, 106) = 13. 33, p <. 001, F(1, 106) = 18. 60, p <. 001 and F(1, 106) = 70. 59, p <. 001, respectively. There was a significant age by sex interaction, F(1, 106) = 5. 36, p = 0. 023, for head speed. In conclusion, older swimmers performed starts that were deeper and faster than younger swimmers and nearly all starts exceeded the threshold speeds for injury.

Males have a greater snout–vent length (SVL), <b>head</b> <b>depth,</b> head width, jaw length, tail length and body mass than females. Juvenile males have greater annual SVL growth rates than juvenile females, contributing to adult sexual size dimorphism.
