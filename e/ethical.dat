5|$|The {{second volume}} {{represents}} the <b>ethical</b> stage. Victor Eremita found {{a group of}} letters from a retired Judge Vilhelm or William, another pseudonymous author, to 'A', trying to convince 'A' {{of the value of}} the <b>ethical</b> stage of life by arguing that the <b>ethical</b> person can still enjoy aesthetic values. The difference is that the pursuit of pleasure is tempered with <b>ethical</b> values and responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his <b>ethical</b> theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his <b>ethical</b> theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used to determine how people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used to determine how to behave.|$|E
5|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the mismanagement behind Enron’s fall {{to a variety}} of <b>ethical</b> and political-economic causes. <b>Ethical</b> explanations centered on executive greed and hubris, a lack of corporate social responsibility, situation ethics, and get-it-done business pragmatism. Political-economic explanations cited post-1970s deregulation, and inadequate staff and funding for regulatory oversight. A more libertarian analysis maintained that Enron’s collapse resulted from the company’s reliance on political lobbying, rent-seeking, and the gaming of regulations.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 5 (on Ephesians5.4) and 6 (on Ezekiel18.7) are <b>ethical</b> saying of Jesus, {{suggesting}} that such teachings formed {{a significant part}} of the gospel.|$|E
5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and intentions are discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive <b>ethical</b> theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to <b>ethical</b> propositions. It also formulates a rule by which <b>ethical</b> actions can be determined and proposes that <b>ethical</b> actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E

5|$|The {{moral and}} <b>ethical</b> {{questions}} raised by performing experiments on animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century. There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which <b>ethical</b> principles apply to which species.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>ethical</b> {{cohesion}} {{within the}} New Age phenomenon, although Hanegraaff {{argued that the}} central <b>ethical</b> tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not {{as the result of}} evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.|$|E
5|$|Under Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer {{was firmly}} {{committed}} {{to the standards of}} <b>ethical</b> drugs, as opposed to patent medicines. <b>Ethical</b> drugs were drugs that could be obtained only through a pharmacist, usually with a doctor's prescription. Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.|$|E
5|$|Political theorists {{influenced}} by Laozi have advocated humility in leadership and a restrained approach to statecraft, either for <b>ethical</b> and pacifist reasons, or for tactical ends.|$|E

25|$|Since around 1950 the <b>Ethical</b> Culture {{movement}} has been increasingly identified {{as part of the}} modern Humanist movement. Specifically, in 1952, the American <b>Ethical</b> Union, the national umbrella organization for <b>Ethical</b> Culture societies in the United States, became one of the founding member organizations of the International Humanist and <b>Ethical</b> Union.|$|E
25|$|While <b>Ethical</b> Culturists {{generally}} {{share common}} beliefs {{about what constitutes}} <b>ethical</b> behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged {{to develop their own}} personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that <b>Ethical</b> Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. <b>Ethical</b> principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of <b>ethical</b> nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.|$|E
25|$|The American <b>Ethical</b> Union {{holds an}} annual AEU Assembly {{bringing}} together <b>Ethical</b> societies {{from across the}} US.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} wide range of {{philosophical}} views on humans' obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of <b>ethical</b> altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is <b>ethical</b> egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both <b>ethical</b> altruism and <b>ethical</b> egoism contrast with utilitarianism, which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co-inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethical</b> Societies {{also exist}} outside the U.S. Conway Hall in London {{is home to}} the South Place <b>Ethical</b> Society, which was founded in 1787.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>ethical</b> society {{along these}} lines in Britain was founded in 1886. By 1896 the four London {{societies}} formed the Union of <b>Ethical</b> Societies, and between 1905 and 1910 there were over fifty societies in Great Britain, seventeen of which were affiliated with the Union. The Union of <b>Ethical</b> Societies would later rename itself the British Humanist Association.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ethical</b> {{movement}} was {{an outgrowth of}} the general loss of faith among the intellectuals of the Victorian era. A precursor to the doctrines of the <b>ethical</b> movement {{can be found in the}} South Place <b>Ethical</b> Society, founded in 1793 as the South Place Chapel on Finsbury Square, on the edge of the City of London.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethical</b> Culture is {{premised on}} the idea that honoring and living in {{accordance}} with <b>ethical</b> principles is central to what it takes to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, and to creating a world that is good for all. Practitioners of <b>Ethical</b> Culture focus on supporting one another in becoming better people, and on doing good in the world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Confucian tradition, lǐ {{was doing the}} proper thing at the proper time, {{balancing}} between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an <b>ethical</b> social fabric, and violating {{them in order to}} accomplish <b>ethical</b> good. Training in the lǐ of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include <b>ethical</b> judgment about when lǐ must be adapted in light of situational contexts.|$|E
25|$|Coupled with Russell's other doctrines, this {{influenced}} the logical positivists, who formulated {{the theory of}} emotivism or non-cognitivism, which states that <b>ethical</b> propositions (along with those of metaphysics) were essentially meaningless and nonsensical or, at best, little more than expressions of attitudes and preferences. Notwithstanding his influence on them, Russell himself did not construe <b>ethical</b> propositions as narrowly as the positivists, for he believed that <b>ethical</b> considerations are not only meaningful, but {{that they are a}} vital subject matter for civil discourse. Indeed, though Russell was often characterised as the patron saint of rationality, he agreed with Hume, who said that reason ought to be subordinate to <b>ethical</b> considerations.|$|E
25|$|Jewish ethics may {{be guided}} by halakhic traditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish <b>ethical</b> {{practice}} is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness (chesed), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish <b>ethical</b> practices include practices of charity (tzedakah) and refraining from negative speech (lashon hara). Proper <b>ethical</b> practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethical</b> {{socialism}} is {{a variant}} of liberal socialism developed by British socialists. It became an important ideology within the Labour Party of the United Kingdom. <b>Ethical</b> socialism was founded in the 1920s by R. H. Tawney, a British Christian socialist, and its ideals were connected to Christian socialist, Fabian, and guild socialist ideals. <b>Ethical</b> socialism has been publicly supported by British Prime Ministers Ramsay MacDonald, Clement Attlee, and Tony Blair.|$|E

25|$|The rise in {{popularity}} of <b>ethical</b> consumerism {{over the last}} two decades can be linked to the rise of CSR. Consumers are becoming more aware of the environmental and social implications of their day-to-day consumption decisions and in some cases make purchasing decisions related to their environmental and <b>ethical</b> concerns.|$|E
25|$|An I/O psychologist, {{whether an}} academic, a consultant, or an employee, must {{maintain}} high <b>ethical</b> standards. The APA's <b>ethical</b> principles apply to I/O psychologists. For example, ethically, the I/O psychologist should only accept projects {{for which he}} or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an I/O psychologist works outside her or his home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while adhering to the <b>ethical</b> standards set at home.|$|E
