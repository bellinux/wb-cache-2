40|$|Non-edited document] The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is <b>flush</b> <b>pointing</b> major economic issues related to the economic impact assessment of water availability in the Zayandeh Rud basin in Iran. It goes without saying that economic assessments would start with considering water as a scarce commodity or a resource and then magnifying the intensity of scarcity along with variables or factors affecting the level of scarcity occurred or predicted to occur, for some determined span of time in the future. Having magnified the intensity of water scarcity the economics tools to deal with water scarcity is analyzed, such that goals defined i. e. food security and environmental concern along with growth are met. To show the intensity of water scarcity there are three main indices being used in the natural resource economics field namely: unit cost of providing water, market price or its shadow price, and rental value of water rights which include value paid to have access to the use of one cubic meter of water for duration of a year. However, in this research {{due to the lack of}} appropriate information on the rental value of water rights the other two indices are being used to evaluate the intensity of water scarcity in Zayandeh Rud. Before getting into the ways that can be used to measure economic scarcity of water we need t...|$|E

30|$|First, as air is {{introduced}} into contaminated soil, air displaces flushing solution {{in the largest}} pores and creates temporary flushing solution flow around <b>flushing</b> <b>point</b> [12].When an air-flushing system achieves steady state, preferential airflow pathways consisting of the largest network of pores are formed in the soil, and the induced local flushing solution flow ceases [20]. Pulsing air injection frequently creates non-steady-state conditions and induces flushing solution circulation as the air channels form and collapse during each cycle. The induced flushing solution flow created by the pulsed air flushing substantially enhances the contaminant and oxygen mass transfer in the soil [5]. Second, contaminants {{in the immediate vicinity}} of air channels can be removed within few time of the start of flushing, but contaminated present at a greater distance from the air channels is less treated because of the limited mass transport (i.e., diffusion) [8].|$|R

Because of the expenses of battery power, the railroad went bankrupt and was sold at auction on April 4, 1892. The line was later equipped with overhead wire, improving profits and patronage.

30|$|When the Leader gets a {{majority}} of acknowledge responses, it can update local committed LSN, which can be called commit point. Then the Leader <b>flushes</b> the <b>point</b> to disk and sends it to each Follower. Note that the commit point is an important metadata in Paxos replication, {{which is used to}} guarantee data consistency for read operation and recovery. In other words, this metadata enables the Follower to provide clients with timeline consistency services, and simplifies recovery processes which guarantee the data consistency when the database recovers from a failure. However, the traditional synchronization mechanism of commit point increases the overhead of storage and network. Therefore, we design and implement the low-overhead log replication adopting durability strategy for OceanBase.|$|R
30|$|Many needleless {{intravascular}} connector valves {{have been}} introduced into clinical practice {{to minimize the risk}} of needlestick injury. After disinfection of the connections, microbial contamination of these systems is lower compared with three-way stopcocks with caps [47]. However, in cohort studies, needleless systems often were still contaminated after the widely used procedure of alcoholic disinfection for 3 - 5 sec, which is clearly inadequate. Moreover, most needleless systems are opaque, making it impossible to verify that they were properly <b>flushed.</b> These <b>points</b> explain why needleless systems have been repeatedly associated with BSI outbreaks [48 – 50]. A large epidemiological study in five hospitals strongly suggested that these systems increased the risk of central line-associated infections [51].

50|$|A {{pointing}} breed {{is a type}} of gundog {{typically used}} in finding game. Gundogs are traditionally divided into three classes: retrievers, <b>flushing</b> dogs, and <b>pointing</b> breeds. The name pointer comes from the dog's instinct to point, by stopping and aiming its muzzle towards game. This demonstrates to the hunter the location of his or her quarry and allows them to move into gun range. Pointers were selectively bred from dogs who had abundant pointing and backing instinct. They typically start to acquire their hunting instincts at about 2 months of age.|$|R

30|$|We {{compared}} the PIGGY with other methods {{for the case}} of Follower receiving through monitoring the number of packets received by a Follower within one second during normal processing. Figure  7 shows the results of receiving messages per second as the workload (number of clients) was scaled up. The ASYNC method had the highest results since a background thread sent commit point in Leader frequently. With the increase in client connections, all of the three curves decreased by degrees. The reason of the decline is same as the discussion described in Fig.  5. Since the <b>flushing</b> commit <b>point</b> in SYNC increases the processing time {{of a group of}} log entries, the SYNC method has the lowest Follower receiving when the number of client was less than 1000. With the increase in connections, the PIGGY was more effective in group commit mechanism. Therefore, the PIGGY had the lowest Follower receiving when the number of connections was > 1200.|$|R
40|$|Columbian sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus: {{hereafter}} sharp-tailed grouse) {{populations have}} been declining. These declines {{have been attributed}} to a number of factors, including habitat loss due to agriculture, habitat fragmentation, overgrazing by livestock, and the loss to fire. To gather information about their status in northern Utah, I radio-marked sharp-tailed grouse in 2003 (n= 15) and 2004 (n= 20) in two research areas. The study areas were located on the south end of Cache County and in eastern Box Elder County. In the Cache study area, I monitored 7 males and 1 female in 2003, and 6 males and 3 females in 2004. In the Box Elder study area, I monitored 6 males in 2003 and 6 males and 5 females in 2004. I then located the radio-marked sharp-tailed grouse using telemetry and collected Visual Obstruction Readings (VOR) and vegetation data on each flush site and on a randomly selected paired point. I completed an unsupervised classification of the two study areas to determine if habitats were used more than would be expected based on availability. I then used a paired point linear regression to determine if vegetation parameters were correlated with sharp-tailed grouse on the landscape. Sagebrush in the Box Elder County study area and forbs in the Cache County study area were significantly correlated with habitat use by sharp-tailed grouse. The VOR readings were higher at the flush sites than at the paired points. The unsupervised classification showed that in Box Elder County, sagebrush was used in greater proportion than is available, while in the Cache County study area there were no habitat types that were used in greater proportion than was available on the landscape. I collected information on nest sites, nest success, broods, and mortality of these 2 populations. Nest success was 75 % combined over the 2 -year study, and mortality was 72 % for both populations over the 2 years. Seasonal habitat use and distance travelled were determined using Global Positioning System points collected at every <b>flush</b> <b>point.</b> The distance traveled ranged from 0. 9 km to 14. 7 km, with the longest distance being travelled in the winter...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{dredging}} in the Brisbane River estuary since European settlement {{has significantly}} altered estuarine hydrological and sediment transport processes. A large tidal ingress resulting from extensive dredging {{in the lower}} Brisbane River estuary and gravel extraction including point and non-point inputs in the upper estuary are currently maintaining two distinct turbidity maximum zones within the estuary: at the mouth (100 – 150 mg/L) and at about 60 km upstream (3 ̆e 300 mg/L). In addition, extensive dredging has also increased Brisbane estuary dry season flushing time significantly (3 ̆e 300 days) {{and as a consequence}} the estuary is currently unable to <b>flush</b> any <b>point</b> and non-point inputs beyond 35 km upstream from its mouth during the entire dry season resulting in a very high suspended sediment (SS) concentration all along the estuary except an area between two turbidity zones.
