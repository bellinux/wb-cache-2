5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to <b>drive</b> <b>current</b> through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E

2500|$|This {{portion of}} the op amp cleverly changes a {{differential}} signal at the op amp inputs to a single-ended signal {{at the base of}} Q15, and in a way that avoids wastefully discarding the signal in either leg. To see how, notice that a small negative change in voltage at the inverting input (Q2 base) drives it out of conduction, and this incremental decrease in current passes directly from Q4 collector to its emitter, resulting in a decrease in base drive for Q15. On the other hand, a small positive change in voltage at the non-inverting input (Q1 base) drives this transistor into conduction, reflected in an increase in current at the collector of Q3. This current drives Q7 further into conduction, which turns on current mirror Q5/Q6. Thus, the increase in Q3 emitter current is mirrored in an increase in Q6 collector current; the increased collector currents shunts more from the collector node and results in a decrease in base <b>drive</b> <b>current</b> for Q15. Besides avoiding wasting 3dB of gain here, this technique decreases common-mode gain and feedthrough of power supply noise.|$|E
2500|$|If a {{filename}} {{contains only}} lowercase letters, or {{is a combination}} of a lowercase basename with an uppercase extension, or vice versa; and has no special characters, and fits within the 8.3 limits, a VFAT entry is not created on Windows NT and later versions of Windows such as XP. Instead, two bits in byte 0x0C of the directory entry are used to indicate that the filename should be considered as entirely or partially lowercase. Specifically, bit 4 means lowercase extension and bit 3 lowercase basename, which allows for combinations such as [...] "example.TXT" [...] or [...] "HELLO.txt" [...] but not [...] "Mixed.txt". Few other operating systems support it. This creates a backwards-compatibility problem with older Windows versions (Windows 95 / 98 / 98 SE / ME) that see all-uppercase filenames if this extension has been used, and therefore can change the name of a file when it is transported between operating systems, such as on a USB flash <b>drive.</b> <b>Current</b> 2.6.x versions of Linux will recognize this extension when reading (source: kernel 2.6.18 /fs/fat/dir.c and fs/vfat/namei.c); the mount option shortname determines whether this feature is used when writing.|$|E
2500|$|Lifespan: The biggest {{technical}} {{problem for}} OLEDs was the limited lifetime {{of the organic}} materials. One 2008 technical report on an OLED TV panel found that [...] "After 1,000 hours the blue luminance degraded by 12%, the red by 7% and the green by 8%." [...] In particular, blue OLEDs historically have had a lifetime of around 14,000 hours to half original brightness (five years at 8 hours a day) when used for flat-panel displays. This {{is lower than the}} typical lifetime of LCD, LED or PDP technology. Each currently is rated for about 25,000–40,000 hours to half brightness, depending on manufacturer and model. Degradation occurs because of the accumulation of nonradiative recombination centers and luminescence quenchers in the emissive zone. It is said that the chemical breakdown in the semiconductors occurs in four steps: 1) recombination of charge carriers through the absorption of UV light, 2) homolytic dissociation, 3) subsequent radical addition reactions that form [...] radicals, and 4) disproportionation between two radicals resulting in hydrogen-atom transfer reactions. However, some manufacturers' displays aim to increase the lifespan of OLED displays, pushing their expected life past that of LCD displays by improving light outcoupling, thus achieving the same brightness at a lower <b>drive</b> <b>current.</b> In 2007, experimental OLEDs were created which can sustain 400nbsp&cd/m2 of luminance for over 198,000 hours for green OLEDs and 62,000 hours for blue OLEDs.|$|E
40|$|Recent work in many tokamaks has {{indicated}} that optimization of the current profile {{is a key element}} needed to sustain modes of improved confinement and stability. Generation of localized current through application of electron cyclotron (EC) waves offers a means of accomplishing this.

The central plasma current was difficult to affect, even though the calculated <b>current</b> <b>drive</b> efficiency was fairly high, 0. 07 A per W absorbed by the electrons. The main reasons are: the strongly inductive nature of the plasma current; the interplay between the fast wave <b>driven</b> <b>current</b> and the bootstrap current, which, due to the dependence of the bootstrap current on the poloidal magnetic field, decreases the bootstrap <b>current</b> as the <b>driven</b> <b>current</b> increases; and parasitic absorption of the waves that decreased the power absorbed by the electrons.
