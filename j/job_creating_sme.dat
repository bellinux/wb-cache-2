40|$|An {{alternative}} measure for gross job flows, incorporating within plant job reallocation, is proposed. Based on data with {{detailed information about}} workers occupation, we report the following results: 1. Most of the stylized facts about job reallocation do not change when we take into account within plant job reallocation. 2. Job creation and job destruction figures are decomposed into <b>job</b> <b>created</b> (destructed) by new (dying) firms, <b>job</b> <b>created</b> (destructed) by existing firms by expanding (contracting) workers in existing jobs, and the <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> (destructed) due to the birth (death) of job categories in incumbent (surviving) establishments. We call the third component as the job mix component. It {{turned out that the}} job mix component corresponds to 30 % (40 %) per cent of job creation (destruction). 3. Also, we describe patterns of job reallocation, and each of the components, by job characteristics as opposed to workers characteristics. The job mix component of both job creation and destruction are concentrated among non-production activities and manageria...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effects of}} airports on {{economic growth in the}} local areas they serve, using data from US metropolitan areas. It applies a novel identification technique that uses the overall development of the air transport network to identify changes in airport size that are not influenced by local factors. Airport size is found to have positive effects on local employment with an elasticity of 0. 02 and on GDP with an elasticity of 0. 035. This means that for every <b>job</b> <b>created</b> at the airport by an exogenous increase in traffic, there are three <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> outside of the airport. Airport size is also found to have positive effects on local wages and on the number of firms. In addition there is a positive effect on the employment rate, the magnitude of which suggests that around half of <b>jobs</b> <b>created</b> by airport expansion represent a net increase in the employment of existing residents, while half are taken up by workers who migrate to the area...|$|R
5000|$|Several {{scholars}} have found strong {{evidence for the}} presence of the local multiplier effect. Within tradable industries, Enrico Moretti discovered that, for each additional skilled <b>job</b> <b>created,</b> 2.5 <b>jobs</b> were also generated in the local non-tradable goods and services sectors, and an additional unskilled <b>job</b> <b>created</b> 1 <b>job</b> in the local non-tradable sector. [...] Highly skilled sectors such as technology have the highest multiplier effect with five non-tradable jobs for each technology job. Moretti cites the example of Apple Computers which directly employs only 13,000 workers but generates 60,000 additional service jobs in the area. Of those 60,000, 36,000 are unskilled, such as restaurant or retail workers, while 24,000 are skilled jobs such as doctors or lawyers.Other academics have taken issue with the large magnitude of the local multiplier effect claimed by Moretti. One study reanalyzes the claim of Enrico Moretti that five non-tradable <b>jobs</b> are <b>created</b> for each highly skilled tradable job. Using a modified version of Moretti’s method it found that the true multiplier effect was only 1.02 non-tradable <b>jobs</b> <b>created.</b> Furthermore the study finds that there is no difference on the local multiplier effect between whether the tradable job is skilled or unskilled.|$|R
