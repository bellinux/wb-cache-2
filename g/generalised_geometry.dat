5000|$|Abstraction is {{an ongoing}} process in {{mathematics}} and {{the historical development of}} many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Take the historical development of geometry as an example; the first steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks, with Euclid's Elements being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry—though Proclus tells of an earlier axiomatisation by Hippocrates of Chios. In the 17th century Descartes introduced Cartesian co-ordinates which allowed the development of analytic geometry. Further steps in abstraction were taken by Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Riemann, and Gauss who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop non-Euclidean geometries. Later in the 19th century mathematicians <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> even further, developing such areas as geometry in n dimensions, projective geometry, affine geometry and finite geometry. Finally Felix Klein's [...] "Erlangen program" [...] identified the underlying theme of all of these geometries, defining each of them as the study of properties invariant under a given group of symmetries. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and abstract algebra.|$|E

Firstly, we explain in a pedestrian manner how the supersymmetry constraints of type II N= 1 flux compactifications can be restated as integrability constraints on certain generalised complex structures. This reformulation uses generalised complex geometry, a mathematical framework that geometrizes the B-field. Secondly, we discuss how exceptional <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> may provide a similar geometrization of the RR fields.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{formulation}} is presented {{of the low}} energy, supergravity limit of type II string theory and M theory, including fermions to leading order. This is performed by utilising the language of <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry,</b> which is shown to be the natural setting for these theories. The core idea behind <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> – an extension of ordinary differential geometry – and what makes it such {{a powerful tool for}} analysing supergravity, is that it recasts all the bosonic fields of the manifold as the natural geometric symmetries of an enlarged tangent space. There are two versions of <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> which are of particular interest, namely O(d, d) <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> which will be used to formulate the NSNS sector of type II theories, and Ed(d) <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> (also known as exceptional <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry)</b> which enables the description of eleven-dimensional supergravity. For both cases, this work will show how one can introduce generalised connections to study the differential structure of the extended tangent spaces and define novel notions of generalised curvature. Specifying extra local structure defines a generalised notion of the Riemannian metric tensor, which contains all the relevant bosonic fields in a single, unified object. With these tools one can then reformulate the supergravity equations very naturally, as they become simply the <b>generalised</b> <b>geometry</b> analogue of Einstein gravity. One thus obtains a formalism which is automatically fully covariant under all the bosonic symmetries of supergravity. Furthermore, generalised connections are shown to be intimately related to supersymmetry, with important consequences for future applications. As an example, in the concluding chapter it will be shown how the classic problem of solving the Killing spinor equations of supersymmetric compactifications can be equivalently recast as the statement that the background possesses the generalised analogue of special holonomy.

40|$|Understanding supersymmetric flux vacua is {{essential}} in order to connect string theory to observable physics. In this thesis, flux vacua are studied by making use of two mathematical frameworks: SU(n) -structures and <b>generalised</b> complex <b>geometry.</b> Manifolds with SU(n) -structure are generalisations of Calabi-Yau manifolds. <b>Generalised</b> complex <b>geometry</b> is a geometrical framework that simultaneously generalises complex and symplectic geometry. Classes of flux vacua of type II supergravity and M-theory are given on manifolds with SU(4) -structure. The N= (1, 1) type IIA vacua uplift to N= 1 M-theory vacua, with four-flux that need not be (2, 2) and primitive. Explicit vacua are given on Stenzel space, a non-compact Calabi-Yau. These are then generalised by constructing families of non-CY SU(4) -structures to find vacua on non-symplectic SU(4) -deformed Stenzel spaces. It is shown that the supersymmetry conditions for N = (2, 0) type IIB can be rephrased {{in the language of}} <b>generalised</b> complex <b>geometry,</b> partially in terms of integrability conditions of generalised almost complex structures. This rephrasing for d= 2 goes beyond the calibration equations, in contrast to d= 4, 6 where the calibration equations are equivalent to supersymmetry. Finally, Euclidean type II theory is examined on SU(5) -structure manifolds, where generalised equations are found which are necessary but not sufficient to satisfy the supersymmetry equations. Explicit classes of solutions are provided here as well. Contact with Lorentzian physics can be made by uplifting such solutions to d= 1, N= 1 M-theory. Comment: 193 pages.
