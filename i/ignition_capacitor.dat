50|$|<b>Capacitor</b> {{discharge}} <b>ignition</b> (CDI) or thyristor ignition {{is a type}} {{of automotive}} electronic ignition system which is widely used in outboard motors, motorcycles, lawn mowers, chainsaws, small engines, turbine-powered aircraft, and some cars. It was originally developed to overcome the long charging times associated with high inductance coils used in inductive discharge ignition (IDI) systems, making the ignition system more suitable for high engine speeds (for small engines, racing engines and rotary engines). The capacitive-discharge <b>ignition</b> uses <b>capacitor</b> discharge current to the coil to fire the spark plugs.|$|R
50|$|The 215 is a {{conventional}} single-cylinder engine that weighs 39 lb in its 215R aircraft version. The engine features single breaker and points <b>ignition,</b> with single <b>capacitor</b> discharge <b>ignition</b> {{used on the}} current models. It also incorporates piston porting, tuned exhaust system, single carburetor, fan cooling, fuel pump, a cast iron cylinder liner, ball, needle and roller bearings throughout. The 215R aircraft version was offered with an optional belt reduction system and the modern industrial versions have an optional gearbox with ratios of 2.04, 2.65 and 3.06. Starting is a recoil starter with a custom electric starter available as an option.|$|R
40|$|The Nd:YAG laser {{with long}} pulse {{duration}} can be produce {{by using an}} appropriate pumping scheme. The {{purpose of this study}} is to construct a high voltage power supply for laser system. In this attempt multiple-mesh pulse forming technique was performed to obtain electrical pump pulses with a more rectangular shape and long normal-mode laser pulses at constant power. The flashlamp driver was designed with variable input energy. The developed flashlamp driver composes of five major electronic circuits. There are comprised of signal controller device, simmer power supply (SPS), trigger pulse <b>ignition</b> circuit, <b>capacitor</b> charging power supply (CCPS) and multiple-mesh LC pulse forming network (MPFN). The construction of the flashlamp driver is started by designing a signal controller. The controller generated a small voltage to activate the electronic components such as silicon controlled rectified (SCR) and transistor. The ignition circuit was used to ignite xenon gases which responsible to form ionized spark streamer between the two electrodes of flashlamp. A Low dc current was induced by the simmer power supply to sustain the flashlamp in simmering mode. The capacitor charging power supply was used to supply electrical power to capacitor bank within specific time. Nd:YAG laser oscillator was aligned and pumping by the new developed flashlamp radiation. As a result Nd:YAG laser beam was generated having fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm and 650 microsecond of pulse duration with maximum output energy of 250 mJ...|$|R
5000|$|Norton-Villiers {{developed}} the P11 from the Norton Atlas as an export {{model for the}} growing sport of desert racing. Prototyped by Californian Norton Distributor Bob Blair using the Atlas 750cc twin cylinder engine in a Matchless G85 CS (Competition Scrambles) Reynolds 531 lightweight steel frame. Blair might have been responding to requests from the importer, Joseph Berliner of Berliner Motor Corporation. The aim was to achieve the best possible power-to-weight ratio, so all the cycle parts were made as light as possible, with a small alloy fuel tank. The magneto and Monobloc carburettors on the prototype were replaced with twin coil <b>capacitor</b> <b>ignition</b> and twin Amal Concentric carburettors, {{as well as a}} speedometer and tachometer and an alloy sump guard. The fuel tank and alloy oil tank were painted in Candy Apple Red with the frame in black. The new motorcycle was known as Project 11, and although testers of the prototype suggested that it should be called the Cheetah 45, it was eventually shortened to P11 and built at the former Associated Motor Cycles factory in Woolwich, London, largely from spare parts. The first P11 (No. 121007) was completed in March 1967 and the first batch were exported to the US and launched under the advertising slogan [...] "Dynamite on wheels". They sold well with demand outstripping supply.|$|R

CDI ignition system can be interpreted as a whole in the heart in a series of two-wheeled vehicles. The authors conducted research on the use of a comparison with the standard AC-CDI of racing AC-CDI the engine performance. This research was carried out by varying the rear wheel rotation is 240 rpm, 250 rpm, 260 rpm, 270 rpm and 280 rpm in perseneling reduction of 1 and perseneling reduction of 2. The parameters obtained are Torque, Power and Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC). Standard AC-CDI perseneling reduction torgue of 1 = 4. 3274 Nm, engine rpm 7466. 34 rpm. Racing AC-CDI fueled pertamax higher torque value, the lower the engine revolution. Perseneling reduction torque of 1 = 6. 2016 Nm, revolution the engine rpm 7454. 08. Perseneling reduction torque of 2 premium = 7. 0912 Nm, engine rpm 4465. 81 rpm. Reduction torque pertamax = 10. 1148 Nm perseneling rediction of 2 and revolution the engine 4484. 12 rpm.

5000|$|The {{earliest}} model engines for free-flight {{model aircraft}} flown {{before the end}} of World War II used a 3:1 mix of white gas and heavy viscosity motor oil for the two-stroke spark ignition engines used for the hobby at that time. By 1948, the new glow plug-ignition model engines began to take over the market, requiring the use of methanol fuel to react in a catalytic reaction with the coiled platinum filament in a glow plug for the engine to run, usually using a castor oil-based lubricant contained in the fuel mix at about a 4:1 ratio. The glow-ignition variety of model engine, because it no longer required an onboard battery, ignition coil, <b>ignition</b> points and <b>capacitor</b> that a spark ignition model engine required, saved valuable weight and allowed model aircraft to have better flight performance. In their traditionally popular two-stroke and increasingly popular four-stroke forms, currently produced single cylinder methanol-fueled glow engines are the usual choice for radio controlled aircraft for recreational use, for engine sizes that can range from 0.8 cm3 (0.049 cu.in.) to as large as 25 to 32 cm3 (1.5-2.0 cu.in) displacement, and significantly larger displacements for twin and multi-cylinder opposed-cylinder and radial configuration model aircraft engines, many of which are of four-stroke configuration. Most methanol-fueled model engines, especially those made outside North America, can easily be run on so-called FAI-specification methanol fuel. Such fuel mixtures can be required by the FAI for certain events in so-called FAI [...] "Class F" [...] international competition, that forbid the use of nitromethane as a glow engine fuel component. In contrast, firms in North America that make methanol-fueled model engines, or who are based outside that continent and have a major market in North America for such miniature powerplants, tend to produce engines that can and often do run best with a certain percentage of nitromethane in the fuel, which when used can be as little as 5% to 10% of volume, and can be as much as 25 to 30% of the total fuel volume.|$|R
