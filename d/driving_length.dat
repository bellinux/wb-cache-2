40|$|An {{analytical}} {{model for a}} turbulent clumpy gas disk is presented where turbulence is maintained by the energy input due to supernovae. Expressions for the disk parameters, global filling factors, molecular fractions, and star formation rates are given as functions of the Toomre parameter Q, the ratio between the cloud size and the turbulent <b>driving</b> <b>length</b> scale delta, the mass accretion rate within the disk (M) over dot, the constant of molecule formation a, the disk radius, the angular velocity, and its radial derivative. Two different cases are investigated: a dominating stellar disk and a self-gravitating gas disk in z direction. The turbulent driving wavelength is determined in a first approach by energy flux conservation, i. e. the supernovae energy input is transported by turbulence to smaller scales where it is dissipated. The results are compared to those of a fully gravitational model. For Q = 1 and delta = 1 both models are consistent with each other. In a second approach the <b>driving</b> <b>length</b> scale is directly determined {{by the size of}} supernovae remnants. Both models are applied to the Galaxy and can reproduce its integrated and local gas properties. The influence of thermal and magnetic pressure on the disk structure is investigated.

For releasing this congestion, possibility of alternative configuration of vehicles on multiple-lane road {{is discussed in}} this paper. This is the configuration where no vehicles move aside on the other lane. It has a merit in making smooth merging at an intersection or a junction due to so-called the "zipper effect". We show, by developing a cellular automaton model for multiple lanes, that this configuration is achieved by simple local interactions between vehicles neighboring each other.

40|$|Professional golf is an {{area that}} is {{particularly}} attractive to study because it models a perfectly competitive economy where payoffs are directly related to individual productivity (Scully 2002). Since one‟s earnings on the PGA Tour are based on individual performance, different skill factors and other variables such as tour experience and the number of events entered can be compared to determine which variables explain a tour player‟s performance. This question is interesting and relevant as tour players devote countless hours to practice focusing on different aspects of their golf game.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{potential}} for a nursing-led in-patient unit (NLIU) to substitute for a period of care in the acute hospital environment and promote recovery before discharge, a randomised controlled trial was conducted. The setting was an acute inner London hospital trust, part of the UK's national health service. Of patients referred to a NLIU from acute wards, 80 were randomly assigned to usual care (remain in normal hospital system) and 97 to the NLIU (nursing-led care with no routine medical involvement). Patients were identified as medically stable but in need of additional nursing intervention by referring medical staff prior to full nursing assessment of suitability. Outcomes compared included functional dependence (Barthel Index), discharge destination and length of hospital stay. Inputs from nursing, paramedical and medical staff were measured. There {{was no significant difference in}} functional independence at discharge (p 0. 05). Patients undergoing usual care stayed in hospital for less time (mean difference 18 days, p< 0. 01) but the same number of patients were in hospital 90 days after recruitment (23 % NLIU, 24 % usual care p 0. 05) due to re-admissions. The model of care implemented differed considerably from that described in the literature with the NLIU having significantly fewer qualified nurses (RNs). Although the anticipated benefits of the NLIU were not demonstrated, the study does not conclude that the model should be rejected.

40|$|Observed {{molecular}} clouds {{often appear}} to have very low star formation efficiencies and lifetimes {{an order of magnitude}} longer than their free-fall times. Their support is attributed to the random supersonic motions observed in them. We study the support of molecular clouds against gravitational collapse by supersonic, gas dynamical turbulence using direct numerical simulation. Computations with two different algorithms are compared: a particle-based, Lagrangian method (SPH), and a grid-based, Eulerian, second-order method (ZEUS). The effects of both algorithm and resolution can be studied with this method. We find that, under typical molecular cloud conditions, global collapse can indeed be prevented, but density enhancements caused by strong shocks nevertheless become gravitationally unstable and collapse into dense cores and, presumably, stars. The occurance and efficiency of local collapse decreases as the <b>driving</b> wave <b>length</b> decreases and the driving strength increases. It appears that local collapse can only be prevented entirely with unrealistically short wave <b>length</b> <b>driving,</b> but observed core formation rates can be reproduced with more realistic driving. At high collapse rates, cores are formed on short time scales in coherent structures with high efficiency, while at low collapse rates they are scattered randomly throughout the region and exhibit considerable age spread. We suggest that this naturally explains the observed distinction between isolated and clustered star formation.

The two-dimensional version of the model (one-dimensional interface) is considered, mainly in the adiabatic limit of very slow <b>driving.</b> On <b>length</b> scales shorter than a crossover length (which grows with the strength of surface tension), the effective interface roughness exponent ζ is ≃ 1. 20, close to the expected value for the universality class of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson model. We find that the waiting times between avalanches are fully uncorrelated, as the wavelet transform of their autocorrelations scales as white noise. Similarly, detrended size-size correlations give a white-noise wavelet transform. Consideration of finite driving rates, still deep within the intermittent regime, shows the wavelet transform of correlations scaling as 1 /f^ 1. 5 for intermediate frequencies. This behavior is ascribed to intra-avalanche correlations. Comment: RevTeX, 10 pages, 9. eps figures; Physical Review E, to be publishe...|$|R

An inter-genome approach using orthologous intronic sequences was carried out, analyzing independently both variables in pairwise comparisons.

A significant correlation held between average differences of metabolic rate, length and GC content, while environmental temperature of fish habitat was not correlated with bpi and GCi.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} effects of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) on {{simulated}} car driving ability. METHODS: Twenty patients with a probable AD of mild severity (Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR = 1) were compared with 20 subjects with MCI (CD = 0. 5), {{and a group of}} age-matched neurologically normal controls on a driving simulation task. Measures of driving competence included the length of run, the number of infractions (omission of stop at pedestrian crossings, speed limits violation), the number of stops at traffic lights, the mean time to collision, and the number of off-road events. Results in the driving competence measures were correlated with scores obtained from simple visual reaction times and mini-mental state examination (MMSE). RESULTS: The patients with mild AD performed significantly worse than MCI subjects and controls on three simulated <b>driving</b> measures, <b>length</b> of run and mean time to collision (p < 0. 001), and number of off-road events (p < 0. 01).

After the drug infusion, the MAP duration (MAPd), repolarization time, and corrected QT interval were significantly prolonged during sinus rhythm, RV pacing, and RV extra stimulation. The prolongation of MAPd at 90 % repolarization during RV pacing at a cycle length of 500 ms was 31 +/- 6 ms (13 %) and 26 +/- 7 ms (11 %) at RVA and RVOT, respectively. The ventricular effective refractory period was significantly prolonged by 33 +/- 9 ms (13 %) and 22 +/- 7 ms (9 %) at <b>driving</b> cycle <b>lengths</b> 600 and 500 ms, respectively. The MAPd shortening with decreasing diastolic time intervals was significantly diminished by dofetilide in early extra beats during RV extra stimulation, suggesting a relatively more pronounced effect of this drug at the early diastolic phase. The dispersion of repolarization, defined as the difference in MAPd between RVA and RVOT, and the activation time were not significantly changed. In conclusion, acute administration of dofetilide in patients with ventricular tachycardia significantly prolonged the time intervals of ventricular repolarization and refractoriness in a parallel fashion, without affecting intraventricular conduction. The effect of dofetilide on MAPd prolongation appeared not to be reverse use-dependent in this study in humans. These results verify the selective class III antiarrhythmic property of dofetilide and warrant further studies in patients...|$|R
