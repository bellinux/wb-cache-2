40|$|In present {{work has}} been made {{investigation}} of delamination between skin <b>of</b> shell and <b>flanges</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiffener</b> by experimental testing and numerical analysis. Energy release rate has been evaluated from experimental testing under Mode I and Mode II loading conditions. The investigation has been made with aim to find the parameters for prediction a crack growing under different kind of stiffened shell loading. The numerical analysis of the structure with has been made using computer code ANSYS/LS-DYNA for explicit analysis of delamination. The energy release rate has been calculated in the damaged zones using Virtual Crack Closure Integral method [2] and so-called Tehnique-B. <b>A</b> crack front <b>of</b> delamination has been investigated since this one has considerable influence on energy release rate in the composites. A crack front isn’t a straight line and depends as from stiffness <b>of</b> the web <b>flanges,</b> as from directions of layers stacking at the delaminated surfaces...|$|R

5000|$|A flange is an {{external}} or internal ridge, or rim (lip), for strength, as the <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> iron beam {{such as an}} I-beam or a T-beam; or for attachment to another object, as the flange on the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the lens mount <b>of</b> <b>a</b> camera; or for <b>a</b> <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rail car or tram wheel. Thus flanged wheels are wheels with a flange on one side to keep the wheels from running off the rails. The term [...] "flange" [...] is also used for <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> tool used to form flanges. Pipes with flanges can be assembled and disassembled easily.|$|R

50|$|The girt is {{commonly}} used as a stabilizing element to the primary structure (e.g. column, post). Wall cladding fastened to the girt, or a discrete bracing system which includes the girt, can provide shear resistance, in {{the plane of the}} wall, {{along the length of the}} primary member. Since the girts are normally fastened to, or near, the exterior <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> column, stability braces may be installed at a girt to resist rotation of the unsupported, inner <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> the primary member. The girt system must be competent and adequately stiff to provide the required stabilizing resistance in addition to its role as a wall panel support.|$|R

30|$|Based on {{composite}} push-off tests, Jiang et al.

However, the applicability of current shear-friction design provision was questionable for composite construction interface, because all of them were proposed based on specimens made of the same type of concrete in the web and the <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> composite T-beam. This highlights the importance to examine the interface shear behavior between different types of concrete, especially for composite beams with normal weight concrete girder and lightweight concrete slab.|$|R
50|$|Conventional frogs require <b>a</b> gap <b>of</b> almost 2 in in {{the running}} surface of the rail to allow {{adequate}} clearance for the <b>flange</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> railroad wheel. When a wheel in tread-bearing mode encounters this gap at high speed, it generates high dynamic loading (particularly impact loading) {{on the edge of}} the rail at the gap. The repeated application of this impact leads to significant metal fatigue and eventual failure of the frog components, which translate directly to increased maintenance costs, train delays to allow for repairs, and an overall reduced lifespan for the frog and track structure.|$|R

40|$|Stiffened panels with curved <b>stiffeners</b> {{have shown}} <b>a</b> {{potential}} for structural tailoring of metallic panels. However, the optimal {{placement of the}} stiffener curves has remained a challenge, both due {{to the presence of}} multiple local minima in the design space, as well as the associated CPU cost to solve the problem. This paper presents a new approach to designing the stiffener curves based purely upon the first buckling mode of the unstiffened panel. The approach defines a heuristic metric for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiffener</b> in increas-ing the buckling load capacity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> panel. The <b>stiffener</b> curve with the highest metric should then provide the lowest optimum mass for the stiffened panel. Optimization results with parametric studies show that the approach provides an extremely cost effective method to obtain stiffener curves giving near-optimal panel weight.
