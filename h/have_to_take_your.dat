[...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was {{intended}} for the media, regarding [...] "how they think they know everything about , when they don't. They want to be a fly on my wall and watch [...] 24/7." [...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism. The song was directed towards [...] "the people in the back seat", children of today's generation; she said that, in the future, they would be the ones [...] "driving [...] Earth to what it's gonna be." [...] "It's the only one you got, so you gotta take care of it. And if you don't, there's gonna be, maybe not for you, right then, and your generation but your kids and their kids ... Every generation has a cycle that'll carry on for the rest of eternity", she concluded. Cyrus recorded a cover of Cheyenne Kimball's [...] "Four Walls" [...] from the album The Day Has Come (2006) for Breakout, titled [...] "These Four Walls". The twelfth and final track is a remixed version of the hit [...] "See You Again", referred to as the Rock Mafia Remix and the 2008 Remix; [...] "See You Again" [...] was originally released on the Meet Miley Cyrus disc of Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Townsend of the Daily Express stated [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> hat off to Phil Collins. Expressing the refreshingly modest {{desire to}} make an “old-sounding” album of cover {{versions}} the 59-year-old singer zips through a selection of mostly-Motown classics like Jimmy Mack and Uptight with the verve energy and wit of a man reborn." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Can we hold {{hearings}} {{to determine the}} problems that are bothering you? I mean, we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> word for what the problems are. We can't call witnesses {{and see what the}} real problems are, can we, in creating this new, substantive rule that we're going to let the courts create? Congress could do all that, though, couldn't it? ...|$|E
6000|$|Judge. [...] "Your {{domestic}} was young, active, robust, and tall. He {{was ahead}} of you. You were in a carriage, from which you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> descend: you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> pistols from a cushion, and THEN your hammer;--how are we {{to believe that you}} could have caught him, if he ran? It is IMPOSSIBLE." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you not know," [...] resumed the Mahdi, turning {{again to}} Miles with a fierce expression, [...] "that I <b>have</b> power <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> {{purse and}} your jewels from you, mejuffrouw," [...] {{he said with}} perfect equanimity, [...] "else you might have used them {{for the purpose of}} {{slipping}} through my fingers. Wenches at wayside inns are easily amenable to bribes, so are the male servants at city hostelries. But your purse and the trinkets which you wore are safely stowed away in my wallet. I shall have the honour of returning them to you when we arrive in Rotterdam." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> dose as I did," [...] {{answered}} Ben. [...] "I am glad {{it is not}} serious. Our regiment couldn't {{afford to}} lose such a brave fellow as you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” {{said the}} skipper quietly, “the ‘Ventura’ isn’t going to sea any more. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> chances in this business; {{and we got}} most of the inside out of her, anyway.” ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{played with}} the little wheel of the wick; she looked down, and then, with a glance flashed at him, she gasped: [...] "I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> lamp for the table tea is ready." ...|$|E
50|$|Lichtenstein’s {{image is}} taken from a comic romance novel of the early 1960s. The nurse’s love interest, Dr Bob Sanders, is overheard talking to her love rival, her roommate Cora. ‘But she {{told me you were}} sick!’ Bob exclaims, ‘That she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place.’ A startled Cora replies, ‘She wanted an excuse so she lied! I’ve never felt better in my life!’ In Nurse, Lichtenstein {{deliberately}} and insightfully removes all of the narrative devices and produces an impact which is more dramatic and engrossing.|$|R
6000|$|... "So you <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> part," [...] he said, {{when we had}} saluted each the other. [...] "Faith, I {{hope you}} bring good luck with you, and more joy to my mistress, for we need all that you can bring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] Sabatini assured him. [...] "On the contrary, I <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> make friends. My {{sister is}} penitent. We <b>have</b> decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> {{discretion}} for granted. I {{am here to}} explain. You want to understand all these things which seem to you so mysterious. Well, ask your questions. What {{is it that you}} wish to know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'The pig won't {{live long}} enough,' I says, 'to {{use as an}} exhibit in your senile fireside mendacity. Your grandchildren will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> word for it. I'll give you one hundred dollars for the animal.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So do I, and {{generally}} over yonder," [...] said she. [...] "But {{you are not}} very hospitable to your friend, Jack. If you do not do the honours, I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> place for the credit of West Inch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{your heart}} up!" [...] Miggs shouted, and then crawled {{along to the}} Girdlestones. [...] "There is no hope for the ship but we may save ourselves," [...] he said. [...] "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> turn at the pumps." ...|$|E
6000|$|Slavin smiled. [...] "I am {{not quite}} so sure as you seem to be. The fellow's last remark was a {{significant}} one, and he's {{not the kind of}} man to stand still anywhere very long. Anyway, he and you between you have forced my hand, and, while I <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> lead, the game {{is going to be a}} risky one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you, then, look on us pale-faces {{as having}} a right here? Do you not regard us as invaders, as enemies who <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>take</b> away <b>your</b> lands?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Twenty {{days in a}} {{concrete}} fallout/ What life <b>have</b> I <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> own/ Oh my country, won't you call out/ Doorbells are ringing with boxes of bones/ And from another land's war torn corners/ To a prison cell in my own/ Punish me for not taking your orders/ But don't lock me up for not leavin' my home Camilo/ Camilo/ Leaving my home/ Camilo/ Camilo ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's {{too much}} for you," [...] was Lingard's undertoned comment. [...] "You could be no other than true. And you are innocent! Don't wish me life, but wish me luck, for you are innocent--and you will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We may rest a bit now," [...] {{said the}} scout. [...] "There's a ledge hereabouts. There you are. Sit down. I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> hand here lest you {{fall off the}} bridge into the holes on each side o' the track." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gracious! if I {{could earn}} {{a place like}} this, I'd sing all day and be an angel; but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> chance, and get nothing for your pains, perhaps. I never do,' said the Westerner, who {{had a hard time}} with small means and large aspirations.|$|E
6000|$|She {{saw that}} after the strain of {{listening}} in a cultured manner the audience had collapsed; had given up their last hope of being amused. She cried, [...] "Now we're going to play an idiotic game which I learned in Chicago. You will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off <b>your</b> shoes, for a starter! After that you will probably break your knees and shoulder-blades." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can make}} another trip or not, {{just as you}} please. Now, I think you will be very foolish, if you don't agree; for you will make {{three times as much}} as I offer you, every thirty boxes of fruit that you can take in there; but the boat <b>has</b> got <b>to</b> go there now, and you <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> choice whether you go in her, or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard it, too," [...] said Rowland with brevity. [...] "And it 's {{in honor}} of this piece of news that you <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> bed in this fashion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you do, Miss Brander, {{remember}} I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> name off {{the list}} of nurses. We have enough to do and think about here without having fainting young ladies on our hands." [...] He spoke gravely, but Mary saw he was not really in earnest.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must do {{much better}} than this, Porter and Morr," [...] said the professor. [...] "Otherwise I shall have to place you in the next lower class. You, Lawrence and Basswood, have failed so utterly that I will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> cases under {{immediate}} consideration. The class is dismissed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{now look}} here! You {{are going in}} that cabin with Mrs. Johnson where she can look after you, but I can't. So I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> word, for I'm {{not going to give}} you away before Mrs. Johnson, that you won't try that foolishness--you know what I mean--before I see you again. Can I trust you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I'm gone, Richard, {{you will}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my place. <b>Your</b> mother is strong, {{and can do}} much; but she is a woman, and she, {{as well as your}} sisters, will need your help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sorry <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>your</b> guest away, Lady Jane," [...] he said. [...] "It's an {{important}} occasion, however. Would {{you like me}} to bring Dartrey over, if we are out this way before we go back?" ...|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. No: I {{will have}} my city named by nobody but my dear little sphinx, {{because it was}} in its arms that Caesar found me asleep. (She languishes at Caesar; then turns curtly to the priest.) Go, I am a priestess, and <b>have</b> power <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> charge from you. (The priest makes a reverence and goes out.) Now let us call on the Nile all together. Perhaps he will rap on the table.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll fix it {{up without}} you, {{as far as}} we can, but if we want you to give {{evidence}} that the man who lost his horse in the river was not farmer Winston, we'll know where to find you," [...] he said. [...] "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> chance of being tried with him if we find you're {{trying to get out of}} the country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{very likely}} {{get into the}} House of Commons. You will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> share in making laws which may prove a blessing or a curse to {{millions}} of men. But you shall not hear one word respecting the political organisation of your country; {{the meaning of the}} controversy between free-traders and protectionists shall never have been mentioned to you; you shall not so much as know that there are such things as economical laws.|$|E
6000|$|The sheriff {{looked at}} him again curiously. [...] "I never had my hands in another man's pockets before, major, but I reckon I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> derringers from yours." [...] He slipped his hand into the major's {{waistcoat}} and secured the weapons. [...] "I'll have to trouble you for your sash, too," [...] he said, unwinding the knitted silken girdle from the captive's waist. [...] "You won't want it, for you ain't walking, and it'll come in handy to me just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brother, {{you are a}} pale-face, and we are Injins. You wish to get our hunting-grounds, and we wish to keep them. To keep them, it <b>has</b> become {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> scalp. I {{hope you}} are ready <b>to</b> let us <b>have</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|Rho. Truth is, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} on't, and <b>have</b> just resolved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>your</b> counsel; and, faith, considering the damned disadvantages of a married man, I have provided well enough, for a poor humble sinner, that is not ambitious of great matters.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear father," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will really}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{something}} for <b>your</b> nerves. Nothing need happen to Mr. Pritchard at all unless {{he asks for}} it. He has his chance--. no one should expect more." ...|$|R
