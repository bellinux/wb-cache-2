In the Victorian era, it was disapproved of primarily because of what was considered to be a distasteful use of graphic violence, but from around the middle of the 20th century its reputation began to improve.|$|E

25|$|A {{neuroscience}} {{research programme}} that studies genes, {{the brain and}} behaviour in an integrated manner. It <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large-scale investigation of the function of molecules found at the synapse. This is mainly focused on proteins that interact with the NMDA receptor, a receptor for the neurotransmitter, glutamate, which is required for processes of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation (LTP). Many of the techniques used are high-throughout in nature, and integrating the various data sources, along with guiding the experiments has raised numerous informatics questions. The program is primarily run by Professor Seth Grant at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, {{but there are many}} other teams of collaborators across the world.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear fuel in {{the reactor}} {{pressure}} vessel <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fission chain reaction, which produces heat, heating {{the water in the}} primary coolant loop by thermal conduction through the fuel cladding. The hot primary coolant is pumped into a heat exchanger called the steam generator, where it flows through hundreds or thousands of small tubes. Heat is transferred through the walls of these tubes to the lower pressure secondary coolant located on the sheet side of the exchanger where the coolant evaporates to pressurized steam. The transfer of heat is accomplished without mixing the two fluids to prevent the secondary coolant from becoming radioactive. Some common steam generator arrangements are u-tubes or single pass heat exchangers.|$|E

At this point, the White Witch <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight with Peter. Suddenly, the newly arisen Aslan, along with Peter's sisters Susan and Lucy, arrives with auxiliaries from amongst those formerly petrified by the White Witch's wand, now restored by Aslan.|$|E

25|$|In {{the initial}} {{years of the}} ULFA {{movement}} (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both {{urban and rural areas}} of Assam), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Upper and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late Heerak Jyoti Mahanta hailed from a place which is just a few kilometres from the state capital Guwahati. However, with the Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA's method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the tribal areas for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising its voice against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam. The Ulfa also has strong following among the Naga people in Assam.|$|E
25|$|Rahmon is a Sunni Muslim {{and he has}} {{frequently}} stressed his Muslim background even though his administration <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relentless campaign against public displays of Islamic devotion. His suppression of Islamic expression includes banning beards, attendence at the mosque for women and children under eighteen, hajj for people under 40, studying in Islamic schools outside Tajikistan, the production, import or export of Islamic books without permission (implemented in 2017), using loudspeakers to broadcast the adhan, veils, madrassas, Islamist political parties and Arabic-sounding names (implemented in 2016). Furthermore, mosques are heavily regulated, providing unofficial Islamic teaching can lead to up to twelve years of imprisonment and an arduous process is {{required in order to}} obtain a permit to establish an Islamic organisation, publish an Islamic book or go on pilgrimage to Mecca. In January 2016, Rahmon performed an Umrah with a number of his children and senior members of his government. That was Rahmon's fourth pilgrimage to Mecca.|$|E

500|$|The {{book which}} later {{became known as}} Leicester's Commonwealth was written by Catholic exiles in Paris and printed {{anonymously}} in 1584. It was published shortly {{after the death of}} Leicester's son, which is alluded to in a stop-press marginal note: [...] "The children of adulterers shall be consumed, and the seed of a wicked bed shall be rooted out." [...] Smuggled into England, the libel became a best-seller with underground booksellers and the next year was translated into French. Its underlying political agenda is the succession of Mary Queen of Scots to the English throne, but its most outstanding feature is an allround attack on the Earl of Leicester. He is presented as an atheistic, hypocritical coward, a [...] "perpetuall Dictator", terrorising the Queen and ruining the whole country. He <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long-term conspiracy to snatch the Crown from Elizabeth in order to settle it first on his brother-in-law, the Earl of Huntingdon, and ultimately on himself. Spicy details of his monstrous private life are revealed, and he appears as an expert poisoner of many high-profile personalities. This influential classic is the origin of many aspects of Leicester's historical reputation.|$|E
