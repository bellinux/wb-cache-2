5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who {{would be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} demon Nadja, Aleph travels through the underground, finding a brainwashed Hiroko in a {{concentration}} camp. Her cell is guarded by Zayin, who admits to having {{doubts about the}} Center's action and lets Aleph free Hiroko; she refuses to leave, but Nadja frees her from the brainwashing by fusing with her. On their way back, Aleph and Hiroko learn that the Center has released the demon Abaddon to swallow the entire Valhalla district, and that the Center only plans to let those they deem worthy be allowed {{to live in the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom; everyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> abandoned and left to die. Zayin starts a revolt against the Center, who threatens to cut off the air supply to the Holytown district if he does not surrender; he, Aleph and Hiroko go to the Center to confront the four elders leading it. Aleph and Hiroko learn that the elders are actually the archangels Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel; Aleph and Hiroko fight and kill the first three archangels, after which Gabriel reveals that YHVH, the creator god, had ordered the archangels to watch over the creation of Tokyo Millennium and wait for the Messiah, but that Michael, Raphael and Uriel, unable to wait any longer, created Aleph as an artificial, false Messiah, leading YHVH to abandon them; he was the boy Hiroko was searching for, aged unnaturally fast to take on the role of Messiah. Similarly, Beth was artificially created as the Messiah's partner, Zayin as his bodyguard, Daleth as a false savior intended to be defeated by the Messiah so that Aleph would win the people's favor, and Gimmel as a trial Messiah for the Arcadia prototype.|$|E
25|$|This {{is how it}} was for me. This is how I played it. It's just a pippy-poo {{little book}} and people come back with this {{diatribe}} about its great social significance. Well it's just because nobody ever got off his high horse long enough to write to single women in any form they could associate with. If they had, somebody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the arbiter for single women at this point instead of me.|$|E

25|$|Thor {{agrees to}} compete in a {{drinking}} contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> pointless. Now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.|$|E
25|$|Home {{demolition}} {{was often}} {{employed by the}} state as a means of punishing crimes regarded as exceptionally dishonourable. In a number of medieval European countries, the relatives of those convicted of offences such as incest, sodomy, parricide or treason were sometimes collectively punished by having their homes demolished and their possessions confiscated. Patricide was similarly treated as an offence of exceptional seriousness in Qing Dynasty China; the offender would be executed, his house razed and the earth beneath it dug up. In 18th century Korea, anyone convicted of committing treason or other major offences against the king was punished with the utmost severity; he would be executed along with his entire family, their home would be destroyed and all the contents and possessions confiscated, and nobody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> permitted to build {{on the site of the}} razed house.|$|E

During the casting of the [...] "freighter folk"the nickname that Losts producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse use to refer to Daniel, Charlotte, Miles and Frankfake names, occupations and scenes were temporarily assigned, to limit the leak of spoilers. In the initial casting call, Daniel was referred as [...] "brilliant mathematician" [...] "Russell".|$|E

500|$|Because of his father's career, Hextall's {{education}} {{was far from}} stable; each year began at Brandon, and once the hockey season commenced in October, he moved to a school nearer to where his father was playing. At school, he achieved B and C grades, putting in the minimum amount of effort, but his mind remained on hockey, and specifically goaltending. [...] "Everybody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> working and I'd be drawing pictures of Tony Esposito and Jimmy Rutherford," [...] he recalled. Hextall came to mostly enjoy the constant moving, later saying [...] "I got to hang around NHL rinks. What more would I have wanted?" ...|$|E
500|$|The single was {{supposed}} to feature Hunte on the song's hook, but when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic {{were asked if they}} thought anyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested Keys. Mary J. Blige was also considered for the part, but Keys was chosen after Jay-Z heard the song's piano loop. The song was viewed as being an [...] "orchestral rap ballad" [...] and has pop-rap musical styles. It contains references to various locations in New York and its famous residents, while describing the city's essence. Profanity is present throughout the song and, although it is usually included during live performances, it was omitted during the performance at Game 2 of the 2009 World Series.|$|E
500|$|Jagger's knighthood {{received}} mixed reactions. Some {{fans were}} disappointed when {{he accepted the}} honour as it seemed to contradict his anti-establishment stance. A report in UPI in December 2003 noted, Jagger has no [...] "known record of charitable work or public services" [...] although he is a patron of the British Museum. Jagger was on record as saying [...] "apart from the Rolling Stones, the Queen {{is the best thing}} Britain has got," [...] but was absent from the Queen's Golden Jubilee pop concert at Buckingham Palace marking her 50 years on the throne. Charlie Watts was quoted in the book According to the Rolling Stones as saying, [...] "Anybody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> lynched: 18 wives and 20 children and he's knighted, fantastic!" [...] Jagger’s father and daughters Karis and Elizabeth were in attendance.|$|E

500|$|Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were {{hesitant}} though, as {{they had}} sent the track for consideration already and been unsuccessful. According to Hunte, when a Notorious B.I.G. figure she kept by the computer fell over as they played the track for Platt—a statue that had never moved before regardless of how loud they've blasted music—she realized it was an omen. She commented, [...] "We all just {{looked at each other}} like, 'if Biggie approves, then, send it to Jay'". The next day Platt sent it to Jay-Z and he [...] "loved it and recorded it that night". Hunte recalls, [...] "We were just so happy he wanted to honor our work and our production. Two female producers/writers, and for him as a rapper to take our song—that's not a combination you see a lot. For him to be so open-minded about it, we just couldn't be any more grateful and thankful." [...] Originally composed as a song to be sung, Jay-Z ended up rewriting new verses inspired from the original lyrics and leaving Hunte on the song's hook. However, when Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic were asked if they thought someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more appropriate for the chorus, Hunte suggested R and soul artist Alicia Keys. Hunte said, [...] "She's never done a record with him and she also has my same vocal tone. She made the song sound so close to the original, She just nailed it and brought it home. It was a great choice." [...] Keys also contributed to writing [...] "Empire State of Mind"s new bridge.|$|E
500|$|After Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) {{landed on}} the island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> on the boat she came from. They wanted these new characters {{to be interested in}} finding the island for their own personal reasons. The team created consisted of Frank, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume, referred to as the [...] "freighter folk". Their relationship with the survivors of Flight 815 formed the crux of the fourth season. Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". According to producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". Cuse had enjoyed Fahey's roles in The Lawnmower Man and The Marshal, and he and Lindelof commended his [...] "intense eyes", stating that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. Fahey was offered the part without having to audition. At the time the producers began to consider him for the role, he had taken a break from acting and was living in Afghanistan, doing charity work and running an orphanage in Kabul. When Cuse contacted him about appearing in the show, Fahey was {{on the top of a}} mountain in Caracas, Venezuela during a rainstorm, having just opened an orphanage. He had never seen the series before, but the producers talked him through the first three seasons in an attempt to convince him to return to acting and accept the role. When he was cast, Fahey was unaware of whether he would be a guest star, or would develop into a regular. Focus on the character was diminished by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which resulted in the fourth season being cut short. The latter half of the season did feature the character more predominately, however some stories planned for Frank and his fellow freighter folk had to be deferred to the fifth season.|$|E

2500|$|Swedish {{newspapers}} advocated {{that the}} Swedish referee {{used for the}} match Martin Hansson be removed from further major international assignments.

Anything <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a further insult to the Irish nation". Mark Ogden of The Telegraph criticised Henry for not informing referee Hansson during the game, and speculated the incident would 'ruin his career', comparing the cases of referees Anders Frisk and Tom Henning Øvrebø.|$|E

You had a bunch of kids working on this {{campaign}} together, and it was such a mix of the serious and momentous and just the silly ways that we are. For people in my generation, it was an unbelievable way to grow up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mohamed ElBaradei was {{reportedly}} appointed prime minister by acting President Mansour, {{over the objections}} of Islamists. The announcement of ElBaradei's appointment was later retracted, with a spokesman for the president saying no decision had been made on whether ElBaradei or somebody <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> named prime minister. Ahmed Douma, a dissident jailed for [...] "insulting" [...] President Morsi and inciting violence against the Muslim Brotherhood during protests earlier in the year, was released from custody pending a court verdict. Meanwhile, clashes continued on the Sinai Peninsula, with a Coptic Christian priest shot to death by masked gunmen. Pro-Morsi supporters continued their sit-in in front of the Rabia Al-Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City, a suburb of Cairo, demanding the reinstatement of the former president.|$|E

2500|$|Extended {{notice is}} usually given when a sitting prime {{minister}} does {{not plan to}} lead his/her party into another election. Leadership contests to determine the successor to a prime minister are usually held during {{the final days of}} the incumbent's term, and are traditionally a lengthy and competitive process. In almost all cases, the outgoing prime minister hands over power directly to their designated successor, without any interim prime minister. By contrast, during leadership contests for the official opposition party, the leader of the opposition has often (though not always) been occupied by an interim parliamentary leader. [...] The opposition party's deputy leader (assuming that post is occupied) is often chosen for this role unless (s)he plans to run in the leadership election, in which case someone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen since it would be considered harmful to the election process if the interim leader was to be one of the candidates.|$|E
2500|$|In The Observers {{issue of}} 1 May 1938, [...] "Torquemada" [...] (Edward Powys Mathers) said, [...] "I {{have to confess}} I have just been beaten again by Agatha Christie. There was no excuse. I was feeling in {{particularly}} good form; and {{the worst of it}} is that she handicapped herself in the latest game with what in anyone <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> insolent severity. Murder on the Nile (sic) was entirely brilliant; Appointment with Death, while lacking the single stroke of murderer's genius which provided the alibi in the former story, must be counted mathematically nearly twice as brilliant, since the number of suspects is reduced by nearly half. Indeed, though we begin our story in Jerusalem and meet our murder in Petra, the Red Rose City, we might as well be in a snowbound vicarage as far as the limitation of suspicion is concerned. And it is in this respect that Agatha Christie repeats her Cards on the Table triumph and beats Steinitz with a single row of pawns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although a naval Board of Inquiry was {{suggested}} by senior RAN officers {{as the best}} way to investigate the incident, a series of incidents and accidents during the 1950s and early 1960s had left the general public with a mistrust of navy-run investigations, and Prime Minister Robert Menzies made it clear that an inquiry supervised by a federal judge would be the only acceptable route: anything <b>else</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> seen as a cover up. Regulations for such an externally supervised inquiry were supposed to have been drafted following an explosion aboard [...] in 1950, but they were never enacted, so Menzies' only option was to call for a Royal Commission. The commission, to be headed by Sir John Spicer, was announced by Menzies on 13 February 1964. This commission was directed primarily to investigate the immediate causes of the collision, and the circumstances which led up to it. Secondary considerations included the suitability of both ships for the exercise, and the rescue and treatment of survivors. These instructions were prepared without the consultation of the RAN. The high number of competing arguments slowed the investigation, and it was not until 25 June that the inquiry was ended and the report begun. The Spicer Report was released publicly on 26 August 1964.|$|E
