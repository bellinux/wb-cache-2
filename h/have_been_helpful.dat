5|$|Granger and Gregory {{argued that}} the large incisors were used for defence or for {{loosening}} shrubs by moving the neck downwards, thereby acting as picks and levers. Tapirs use their proboscis to wrap around branches while stripping off bark with the front teeth; this ability would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> to Paraceratherium. Some Russian authors suggested that the tusks were probably used for breaking twigs, stripping bark and bending high branches and that, because species from the early Oligocene had larger tusks than later ones, they probably had a more bark than leaf based diet. Since the species involved are now {{known to have been}} contemporaneous, and that the differences in tusks are perhaps sexually dimorphic, the latter idea is not accepted today. Herds of Paraceratherium may have migrated while continuously foraging from tall trees, which smaller mammals could not reach. Osborn suggested that its mode of foraging would have been {{similar to that of the}} high-browsing giraffe and okapi, rather than to modern rhinoceroses, whose heads are carried close to the ground.|$|E
5|$|South Indian mercenaries {{were often}} {{employed}} in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages. Manavamma and Moggallana I (491–508) obtained {{the assistance of the}} Pallavas during succession disputes to secure the throne. However, the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods, such as when Sena II sent his armies to South India against the Pandyan king. Gajabahu I also launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12,000 captives, and brought back 12,000 prisoners as well as the freed captives. Surprisingly however, a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and one was rarely maintained. This would have been the first line of defence for the island nation and would also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> in dealing with invasions from South India.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{originated in}} the Eastern Tennessee Seismic Zone, among the most active seismic areas in the Southeastern United States and one capable of producing moderately strong earthquakes, a few of which have caused damage. The frequency for non-damaging earthquakes from this zone measures out to about one per year, and it has produced many faint earthquakes recorded on seismographs. Such earthquakes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> in highlighting the activity of faults below the Paleozoic detachment. Fault-plane solutions of multiple earthquakes throughout the area confirmed strike-slip faulting between two steeply declining planes. Both right and left-lateral movement occurs in the area, most movement being associated with north-to-south planes (right-lateral) and east-to-west planes (left-lateral). All of these mechanisms indicate reactivation of basement faults below more-recent faults. These basement faults probably converge on one another, and one being strong and the other being weak, produce earthquakes.|$|E

Although in some towns Jews may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> to Muslim success, they were of limited impact overall.|$|E
25|$|Hydrotaea species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> in {{forensic}} cases worldwide by indicating post-mortem interval (PMI). These flies typically inhabit a carcass 4 to 5 {{months after}} the start of decomposition. Their presence indicates that the corpse was not burned and that the earlier blow-fly phase has ended. Hydrotaea larvae may feed on each other and on other flies, such as blow-flies.|$|E
25|$|SOMs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> to {{researchers}} in identifying and investigating the constraints and {{variables of interest}} {{in a number of}} acquisition processes, and in exploring the consequences of these findings on linguistic and cognitive theories. By identifying working memory as an important constraint both for language learners and for current computational models, researchers have been able to show that manipulation of this variable allows for syntactic bootstrapping, drawing not just categorical but actual content meaning from words' positional co-occurrence in sentences.|$|E

25|$|The hazard of {{the short}} section of single line with the single lead {{junction}} would be reduced if there were two red signals protecting it. British practice mostly has one protecting signal. New South Wales practice mostly has two red signals protecting such a junction, albeit {{at the cost of}} some reduction in train headway. Alternatively, trap points could be installed to protect the single line. Two signal protection is a relatively easy way to reduce these risks, and would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> at the Ladbroke Grove rail crash. A comprehensive ATP system would also help.|$|E
25|$|Fasting insulin {{level or}} GTT with insulin levels (also called IGTT). Elevated insulin levels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> to predict {{response}} to medication and may indicate women needing higher dosages of metformin {{or the use}} of a second medication to significantly lower insulin levels. Elevated blood sugar and insulin values do not predict who responds to an insulin-lowering medication, low-glycemic diet, and exercise. Many women with normal levels may benefit from combination therapy. A hypoglycemic response in which the two-hour insulin level is higher and the blood sugar lower than fasting is consistent with insulin resistance. A mathematical derivation known as the HOMAI, calculated from the fasting values in glucose and insulin concentrations, allows a direct and moderately accurate measure of insulin sensitivity (glucose-level x insulin-level/22.5).|$|E
25|$|Sheridan's raid was {{an overall}} {{tactical}} success, having killed Jeb Stuart at Yellow Tavern and beaten Fitzhugh Lee at Meadow Bridge, all with relatively minimal casualties—about 625 {{men for the}} entire raid, compared to 800 Confederate. From a strategic standpoint, however, the raid deprived General Grant of the cavalry resources that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> at Spotsylvania Court House and his subsequent advance to the North Anna River, and there are lingering questions about whether Sheridan should have attempted to assault the city of Richmond. In the latter case, Sheridan believed {{it would not have}} been worth the risk in casualties and he recognized that the chances of holding the city for more than a brief time would be minimal; any advantages would primarily result from damage to Confederate morale.|$|E

500|$|Character {{dialogue}} {{was recorded}} on a fortnightly basis, with lines {{for up to}} four episodes taped at each session, at the Anvil Films Recording Studio at Denham in Buckinghamshire. Each actor, regardless {{of the size of}} their contribution, was paid 15 guineas (£15 15 shillings) per episode with repeat fees. The cast were not given the opportunity to tour the Century 21 studios in Slough until all their work was finished and therefore had no visualisation of their characters during the recording itself. This was to the regret of Liz Morgan: [...] "We all said that we wished we had seen the puppets before doing the dialogue, as it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> to have something physical to base the voices on.

And she was arrested at—while she was getting marijuana to make into these brownies, and she worked at San Francisco General Hospital at the AIDS ward.

This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> researched from the participators view by conducting qualitative interviews. The data was analyzed by using thematic analysis. Antonovsky’s theory, Sense of Coherence was used as theoretical instrument to understand the collection of data. The main findings of this study indicate that occupations aimed for social purpose is important for the participators. In the study social support and the social interaction between staff and other participators appears to be the most important findings. Another important finding was the lack of research within the field of studies regarding social occupations such as day care. ...|$|R

In his testimony, Prince noted that, [...] "It seems the ballistics analysis was done to prove the guilt of the Americans, not to just try to identify what happened there." [...] Erik Prince said that he didn't believe the FBI had fully investigated the sources of all the used bullets in Nisour Square, arguing that it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>helpful</b> if the defense had been in possession of a complete ballistics report. FBI scientists couldn't match bullets from the square to guns carried by the Blackwater guards and FBI investigators found foreign cartridge cases of a kind not used by U.S. or Blackwater personnel.
