Our aim was to analyse the ability of human milk to inhibit the attachment of rNV VLPs (recombinant NV-like particles) to their carbohydrate ligands and to characterize potential inhibitors found in milk. Milk from women with the secretor phenotype was strongly inhibitory, unlike milk from women that are non-secretors, which is devoid of 2 -linked fucosylated structures. At least two fractions in human milk acted as inhibitors for the NV capsid attachment. The first fraction corresponded to BSSL (bile-salt-stimulated lipase) and the second to associated mucins MUC 1 and MUC 4.

40|$|The {{exchange}} of information during interactions of T cells with dendritic cells, B cells or other T cells regulates the course of T, B and DC-cell activation and their differentiation into effector cells. The tumor necrosis factor superfamily member LIGHT (homologous to lymphotoxin, exhibits inducible expression and competes with HSV glycoprotein D for binding to herpesvirus entry mediator, a receptor expressed on T lymphocytes) is transiently expressed upon T cell activation and modulates CD 8 T cell-mediated alloreactive responses upon herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) engagement. LIGHT-deficient mice, or WT mice treated with LIGHT-targeting <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> HVEM-Ig, LTβR-Ig or sDcR 3 -Ig, exhibit prolonged graft survival compared to untreated controls, suggesting that LIGHT modulates the course and severity of graft rejection.

40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} {{has found}} smart ways {{to exploit the}} chemokine network in order to subvert immune attack. Chemokines trigger the arrest and firm adhesion of inflammatory cells to the vascular wall. Scavenging of chemokines by viral <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors,</b> such as US 28, might prevent arrest of leukocytes to the vascular wall and impair an antiviral immune response. We determined the effect of chemokine scavenging by endothelium-expressed signaling mute US 28 (US 28 R 129 A) on static monocyte adhesion. Despite the chemokine scavenging capacity of US 28 R 129 A, expression of this construct by endothelial cells was insufficient to disrupt leukocyte adhesion to cytokine-activated monolayers. Our {{results suggest that the}} concentrations of chemokines that trigger firm leukocyte adhesion are too high to be efficiently scavenged by viral chemokine <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> like US 28. From the results of this experimental model a role for US 28 in viral immune evasion by chemokine scavenging would appear therefore unlikely. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) ligand and receptor superfamily members play critical {{roles in}} diverse developmental and pathological settings. In search for novel TNF superfamily members, we identified a murine chromosomal locus that contains three new TNF receptor-related genes. Sequence alignments {{suggest that the}} ligand binding regions of these murine TNF receptor homologues, mTNFRH 1, - 2 and - 3, are most homologous {{to those of the}} tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors. By using a number of in vitro ligand-receptor binding assays, we demonstrate that mTNFRH 1 and - 2, but not mTNFRH 3, bind murine TRAIL, suggesting that they are indeed TRAIL receptors. This notion is further supported by our demonstration that both mTNFRH 1 :Fc and mTNFRH 2 :Fc fusion proteins inhibited mTRAIL-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Unlike the only other known murine TRAIL receptor mTRAILR 2, however, neither mTNFRH 2 nor mTNFRH 3 has a cytoplasmic region containing the well characterized death domain motif. Coupled with our observation that overexpression of mTNFRH 1 and - 2 in 293 T cells neither induces apoptosis nor triggers NFkappaB activation, we propose that the mTnfrh 1 and mTnfrh 2 genes encode the first described murine <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> for TRAIL, and we renamed them mDcTrailr 1 and -r 2, respectively. Interestingly, the overall sequence structures of mDcTRAILR 1 and -R 2 are quite distinct from those of the known human <b>decoy</b> TRAIL <b>receptors,</b> suggesting that the presence of TRAIL <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> represents a more recent evolutionary event...|$|R

Members of the IL- 1 Receptor (IL- 1 R) family include six receptor chains forming four signaling <b>receptor</b> complexes, two <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> (IL- 1 R 2, IL- 18 BP), and two negative regulators (TIR 8 or SIGIRR, IL- 1 RAcPb).

40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown that {{apoptosis}} mediated by TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is regulated by the expression of two death receptors [TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-RI) and TRAIL-R 2] and two <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> (TRAIL-R 3 and TRAIL-R 4) that inhibit apoptosis, In previous studies, me have shown that TRAIL but not other members of the tumor necrosis factor family induce apoptosis in approximately two-thirds of melanoma cell lines. Here, we examined whether the expression of TRAIL-R at the mRNA and protein level in a panel of 28 melanoma cell lines and melanocytes correlated with their sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, We report that at least three factors appear to underlie the variability in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. (a) Pour of nine cell lines that were insensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis failed to express death receptors, and in two instances, lines were devoid of all TRAIL-Rs. Southern analysis suggested this was due to loss of the genes for the death receptors, (b) Despite the presence of mRNA for the TRAIL-R, some of the lines failed to express TRAIL-R protein on their surface. This was evident for TRAIL-RI and more so for the TRAIL <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> TRAIL-R 3 and -R 4, Studies on permeabilized cells revealed that the receptors were located within the cytoplasm and redistribution from the cytoplasm may represent a posttranslational control mechanism. (c) Surface expression of TRAIL-RI and -R 2 (but not TRAIL-R 3 and -R 4) showed an overall correlation with TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, certain melanoma cell lines and clones were relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis despite the absence of <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> and moderate levels of TRAIL-RI and -R 2 expression. This may indicate the presence of inhibitors within the cells, but resistance to apoptosis could not be correlated with expression of the caspase inhibitor FLICE-inhibitory protein. mRNA for another TRAIL receptor, osteoprotegerin, was expressed in 22 of the melanoma lines but not on melanocytes. Its role in induction of apoptosis remains to be studied. These results appear to have important implications for future clinical studies on TRAIL...|$|R

TRAIL was detected by ELISA in extracts of term choriodecidual (but not amnion) tissues and explant-conditioned media. Concentrations of OPG (determined using ELISA) in gestational membranes were 20 - to 50 -fold greater than those of TRAIL. Median OPG concentrations in amniotic fluid (AF) at 15 - 17 wk gestation {{were similar to those}} at term before and during labor, whereas levels in pregnancies sampled preterm were significantly elevated. OPG levels in AF from women with preterm PROM were similar to those from women in preterm labor. In contrast, in pooled AF samples (n = 23 - 33), TRAIL concentrations at term with and without labor were elevated compared with samples from preterm deliveries. TRAIL-R 3 and -R 4 <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors</b> were detected in term amnion and choriodecidual extracts by immunoblotting and were localized by immunohistochemistry to amnion epithelial cells and chorionic trophoblasts. TRAIL (100 ng/ml) had little or no effect on amnion or choriodecidual cell viability or apoptosis, although these tissues responded to TNF-α with increased prostaglandin E 2 production. Our findings suggest that OPG is abundant in gestational membranes and, in concert with TRAIL <b>decoy</b> <b>receptors,</b> may protect resident cells of the fetal membranes against the proapoptotic effects of TRAIL and other related ligands during pregnancy...|$|R
