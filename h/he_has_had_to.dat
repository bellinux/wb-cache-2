5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia have been much more accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E

25|$|Kotoōshū managed {{only three}} double-figure scores in 2006, and {{none at all}} in 2007, only doing enough to {{maintain}} his rank. Shortly before the November 2007 tournament he dislocated his right knee in training. Clearly troubled by the injury he pulled out on the 7th day, {{the first time in}} his career that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from a tournament. He preserved his ōzeki rank with a 9–6 score in January 2008. In the Osaka tournament of March 2008 he injured his left arm in a match with Kakuryū on the 4th day and withdrew on Day 9 with only two wins. There was speculation that he would be demoted to sekiwake in the following tournament in May.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} return to racing in the UK at the Revolution22 event in Manchester in December. He {{received}} a standing ovation from the Manchester faithful {{at the start of}} the event when he was introduced to the crowd. At this event Hoy won both the Sprint and Keirin competitions, defeating likes of Jason Kenny, Jamie Staff, Ross Edgar, Matthew Crampton and Teun Mulder along the way. Hoy competed in the World Cup Classics series' final event in Copenhagen, Denmark in February, helping his team to a gold medal in the team sprint event. However, he crashed out during the men's Keirin final and was forced to miss the final day of competition, including the men's sprint. Although at first, his injury seemed minor, he returned to Manchester where, following a scan, he was diagnosed with a serious de-gloving injury which finished his season and kept him off his bike for almost 3 months. He was unable to compete as planned at the Revolution 24 event in Manchester the following weekend, he did however make an appearance at the event. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pull out of the World Championships in Poland at the end of March, where he would have attempted to defend 2 World titles, because of the hip injury.|$|E

50|$|The {{campaign}} {{was to be}} carried out by the Army of Estremadura, under the Duke of Albuquerque's much depleted force of 8,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> transfer three divisions of infantry and twelve regiments of cavalry to reinforce the Army of La Mancha, under Venegas, and which, after its defeat at Almonacid, <b>had</b> been reduced <b>to</b> only 25,000 men.|$|R
500|$|Gibney {{began working}} on Going Clear in 2013 after {{becoming}} intrigued by Wright's book. He collaborated with Wright, who came on board as a producer, to explore the book's underlying theme of [...] "how people become prisoners of faith in various ways". Gibney saw Scientology {{as one of the}} toughest subjects <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tackle in his career as a documentarian, alongside government complicity in torture, corporate financial malfeasance, and clerical sexual abuse.|$|E
500|$|When Pretty in Pink co-star Molly Ringwald told Out {{magazine}} in 2012 {{that she believed}} Cryer's character was gay, Cryer defended Duckie and other [...] "slightly effeminate dorks," [...] and said <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> live with others' [...] "faulty" [...] gaydar. Also in 2012, Joyner told Jeff Probst that when she and Cryer started dating, {{she wondered if he}} might be gay because [...] "he never kissed me." [...] Cryer was asked in 2014 if he was [...] "mistaken for gay"; he again called himself [...] "an effeminate heterosexual dork" [...] and cracked a joke about never being propositioned: [...] "Fellas, you're dropping the ball." ...|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{approached}} Nathan Fillion to {{play the}} lead role of Malcolm Reynolds; after Whedon explained the premise and showed him the treatment for the pilot, Fillion was eager for the role. Fillion was called back several times to read for the part before he was cast. He noted that [...] "it was really thrilling. It was my first lead and I was pretty nervous, but I really wanted that part and I wanted to tell those stories." [...] Fillion later said he was [...] "heartbroken" [...] when he learned the series had been cancelled. Fillion has called his time on Firefly the best acting job he ever had, and compares every job <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E

50|$|In Chapter 7, When Maturin looks {{upon the}} two corpses in the bath, he {{reflects}} {{that this is}} like the end of Titus Andronicus, a play by Shakespeare where corpses pile up as revenge plays out.

25|$|Schwedler <b>had</b> {{three daughters}} and a son; however, his {{youngest}} daughter {{and his son}} died in 1863 and 1864, and his wife in 1867 after a long decline.

500|$|Although {{to remain}} a viable {{candidate}} to pitch in the Phillies rotation he needed to regain complete health, Pettibone began the 2014 Phillies season's spring training with more shoulder discomfort. Although the issue was not structural according to an MRI, it was disconcerting to the Phillies, as {{he was a young}} pitcher. Ultimately, the discomfort kept him from remaining a competitor for a spot {{in the back of the}} Phillies' rotation, and he began the season in the minor leagues. However, he was the first pitcher to be called up from the minor leagues to make a start for the Phillies in 2014, serving as a spot starter while Cole Hamels recovered from injury. He made two starts before being demoted back to the minor leagues. His injury woes subsequently continued; he was diagnosed with a SLAP tear, and though he declined surgery, he received a cortisone injection and was placed on the disabled list to rest. Todd Zolecki, the Phillies beat writer for MLB.com, noted, [...] "Pettibone’s shoulder is a legitimate concern because this is the third time <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop pitching in less than a year because of it. He finished last season on the disabled list before falling behind schedule in Spring Training because of shoulder pain." [...] On June 18, 2014, he underwent season-ending surgery performed by Dr. James Andrews to repair his SLAP tear.|$|E
500|$|Broadly, {{the critics}} did not welcome Fleming's {{experiment}} with the Bond formula; academic Christoph Linder {{has pointed out that}} The Spy Who Loved Me received the worst reception of all the Bond books. The Daily Telegraph, for example, wrote [...] "Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!" [...] while The Glasgow Herald thought Fleming was finished: [...] "His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail." [...] Writing in The Observer, Maurice Richardson described the tale as [...] "a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation", going on to hope that [...] "this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography". Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking [...] "why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?" [...] The critic for The Times was not dismissive of Bond, whom they describe as [...] "less a person than a cult" [...] who is [...] "ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war". Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that [...] "the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment". John Fletcher thought that it was [...] "as if Mickey Spillane had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association".|$|E
2500|$|Contemporaries widely {{commented on}} Barberini's very dissolute conduct during the pontificate of his uncle. According to Gregorio Leti, [...] "The great {{inclination}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> women hath been no small blemish to his reputation". Contemporary John Bargrave, who met Barberini {{while he was}} travelling through the Alps {{on his way to}} exile in France, also made comment on Barberini's [...] "vicious deportments" [...] and [...] "life full of liberty and debauchery".|$|E
50|$|In 1644 when Rupert {{took over}} a {{regional}} command in the North, Wilmot stepped into his shoes as commander of all the Royalist cavalry and as the a dominant influence on military matters.

50|$|In 1953, Woods {{was hired}} to call New York Yankees games {{alongside}} Mel Allen and Joe E. Brown.

2500|$|Perhaps {{driven by}} his {{financial}} circumstances, Pratt {{was the only}} South Melbourne player to play in every senior game in 1936. The South Melbourne players, including Pratt, had suffered {{a large number of}} injuries over the season, and the (astounding in 1936) number of 39 different men played at least one senior game that season: and, [...] "of [...] Bob Pratt {{is the only one who}} has played in every engagement, and on occasions <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> nurse injuries certain to have kept most other players out of the game".|$|E
2500|$|Sunset in the West (2011), another {{painting}} that took {{ten years to}} complete, depicts the Buddhist monk Xuanzhang’s epic pilgrimage to India through the desert wilderness in the western regions of China to translate Buddhist scriptures and bring those back to China. [...] It {{is a tale of}} perseverance and determination in the name of spiritual devotion and commitment to enlightenment, something Yim has managed to convey in a single scene. [...] As Yim has made clear in interviews and his writings, Xuanzhang is one of his favorite subjects, likely for reasons relating to his own life story and the difficult path <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> travel as an artist and a man.|$|E
