Blue-red combo is often used by police and ambulance, but red can only be used in combo with blue. Some police units often use additional lighting, e.g. strobe lights, alternating <b>headlight</b> <b>flash,</b> behind-windshield blue/red lights. Detachable blue flash lamps are occasionally used by unsigned cars of special police forces, by personal transport services for government members, and diplomatic convoy/escort vehicles. Amber/yellow flashing lights are for warning some special attribute (e.g. oversized, slow, parking at unexpected places etc.) of vehicles like garbage trucks, road cleaning/control/repair, snow plow, car assistance services, construction, transporting dangerous materials etc. Amber/yellow lights do not grant traffic privileges, except {{to go in the}} opposite direction in one-way streets or driving on the opposite side in some cases, e.g. road cleaning.|$|E
25|$|In California, <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> {{is legal}} in some {{situations}} and illegal in others.

2500|$|<b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> is {{commonly}} used to warn other drivers of dangers on the road, such as crashed cars or police speed traps. [...] <b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> {{can be used to}} give thanks to another driver. For example, in situations where a driver is warned of police activity in the area, it is sometimes considered courteous to flash one's own lights in response.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the most}} basic sense, <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> {{is a way of}} {{attracting}} attention, for any of a number of purposes. [...] In this way, it can be perceived as the visual equivalent of blowing the horn, again for any of a number of reasons. [...] This equivalency is underscored by some car owner's manuals, which identify the steering column control lever which allows <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> as the [...] "optical horn". <b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> can be used simply to let other drivers know of one's presence, or as a response to acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers. Some drivers <b>flash</b> their <b>headlights</b> as a signal that they are yielding the right of way to another driver, for example at an intersection controlled by stop signs.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> varies from state to state. Some states consider that drivers have a First Amendment right to <b>flash</b> their <b>headlights.</b> In other states, law enforcement officers give citations for <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> under three types of laws: (1) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation, (2) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle, and (3) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle’s high beams at oncoming traffic. The specific language of each law varies by state along with courts’ holdings on whether their respective laws prohibit <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing.</b> Additionally, although not legally binding, the state driver’s manual of some states suggests flashing high beams under specific scenarios (e.g. if an oncoming vehicle is using its high beams, driver’s manuals suggest a motorist flash his or her high beams momentarily).|$|R

25|$|The signal can be {{intended}} {{to convey a}} variety of messages, including a warning to other drivers of road hazards or of speed traps, and {{it can also be}} a form of aggressive driving. The legality of <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> varies by jurisdiction.|$|R
25|$|<b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> {{is common}} in Bangladesh, where roads are {{sometimes}} narrow and lane discipline is lax.

50|$|Although {{the use of}} <b>flashing</b> <b>headlights</b> does {{increase}} the visibility of any vehicle, it can also create problems.

25|$|<b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> is the act {{of either}} briefly {{switching}} on the headlights of a car, or of momentarily switching between a headlight's high beams and low beams, {{in an effort to}} communicate with another driver or drivers.

25|$|<b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> as an {{effective}} mode of driver communication has been questioned, and researchers have found the ability of drivers to {{communicate with one another}} is about the same as the communication abilities among insects.

25|$|It {{can also}} be used to inform drivers of {{problems}} with their car, such as headlamps left off after dark, burned out or misaligned lights, or misuse of high beam rather than low beam in traffic, or to berate a driver who poses a risk to traffic. <b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> coupled with blowing the car's horn can help clear deer from a driver's path.|$|R

25|$|<b>Headlight</b> <b>{{flashing}}</b> in India {{is often}} used as a signal that the driver flashing you is offering {{to let you go}} first.

It is also used to indicate to an oncoming vehicle to either stop or give way in narrow lanes.|$|R
25|$|Drivers often <b>flash</b> <b>headlights</b> to {{indicate}} the intention to overtake or pass another driver, or to signal a driver who has just overtaken {{that he or she}} is far enough ahead to change back into the lane of the overtaken vehicle. Flashing is also commonly used to request or insist that a leading driver speed up or change lanes to get out of the way of a faster following driver. <b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> may also be a part of aggressive driving, and can be used in an attempt to intimidate others into speeding or otherwise driving unsafely.|$|R

25|$|<b>Headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> {{might have}} come into more common use {{as a means of}} {{attempting}} driver-to-driver communication by the mid-1970s, when cars began to come with headlight beam selectors located on the steering column—typically activated by pulling the turn signal stalk—rather than the previous foot-operated pushbutton switches. The signal stalk configuration was later wired to permit the momentary activation of the high beams regardless of whether the headlamp switch was turned on or off.|$|R

5000|$|The six {{cylinder}} engines were {{fitted with}} a new Carter carburetor. A vacuum operated “Fuel Pacer” was offered as an option, the device using a flashing light to assist the driver in avoiding fuel wastage. This light was initially on the right-hand guard, but was later fitted to the instrument panel. Additional safety features included a pressure proportioning valve in the rear brake circuit, power-boosted brakes and hazard warning lights. Indicator, <b>headlight</b> dipping, <b>headlight</b> <b>flashing</b> and windscreen wiper controls were now housed in a steering column stalk.
