25|$|Baum's avowed {{intentions}} {{with the}} Oz books and other fairy tales was to retell tales such as {{are found in}} the works of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, make them in an American vein, update them, avoid stereotypical characters such as dwarfs or genies, and remove the association of violence and moral teachings. The first books contained a fair amount of violence, but it decreased with the series; in The Emerald City of Oz, Ozma objected to doing violence even to the Nomes who threaten Oz with invasion. His introduction is often cited as the beginnings of the sanitization of children's stories, although he did not do a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> eliminate harsh moral lessons.|$|E
25|$|Pirates had {{a system}} of {{hierarchy}} on board their ships determining how captured money was distributed. However, pirates were more egalitarian than any other area of employment at the time. In fact, pirate quartermasters were a counterbalance to the captain and {{had the power to}} veto his orders. The majority of plunder was in the form of cargo and ship's equipment with medicines the most highly prized. A vessel's doctor's chest would be worth anywhere from £300 to £400, or around $470,000 in today's values. Jewels were common plunder but not popular as they were hard to sell, and pirates, unlike the public of today, had little concept of their value. There is one case recorded where a pirate was given a large diamond worth a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the value of the handful of small diamonds given to his crewmates as a share. He felt cheated and had it broken up to match what they received.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I, the political party Sinn Féin ("Ourselves") won the majority of votes in the Irish general election, 1918, this political party pursued a policy of complete independent self-determination for the island of Ireland as outlined in the Sinn Féin campaign Manifesto of 1918, a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the devolved government/Home Rule advocated by the (I.P.P)Irish Parliamentary Party. Following the Sinn Féin victory in these elections the Irish Declaration of Independence was penned and Irish republicans launched a guerrilla campaign against British rule in what became the Irish War of Independence (January 1919 – July 1921). The fighting in Ulster during the Irish War of Independence generally {{took the form of}} street battles between Protestants and Roman Catholics in the city of Belfast. Estimates suggest that about 600 civilians died in this communal violence, the majority of them (58%) Roman Catholics. The IRA remained relatively quiescent in Ulster, {{with the exception of the}} south Armagh area, where Frank Aiken led it. A lot of IRA activity also took place at this time in County Donegal and the City of Derry, where one of the main Republican leaders was Peadar O'Donnell. Hugh O'Doherty, a Sinn Féin politician, was elected mayor of Derry at this time. In the First Dáil, which was elected in late 1918, Prof. Eoin Mac Néill served as the Sinn Féin T.D. for Derry city.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, Bruegmann noted that [...] "Chicago architecture was always a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> that" [...] and expressed his satisfaction that the publication of Pond's autobiography [...] "should {{go a long way toward}} bringing back into focus one of America's most interesting and important architectural practices." ...|$|E

Coker and his wife are also active in church and civic activities, such as counseling young married couples. Coker still has nightmares from his time as a POW.

500|$|During the war, McKinley also {{pursued the}} {{annexation}} of the Republic of Hawaii. The new republic, dominated by business interests, had overthrown the Queen in 1893 when she rejected a limited role for herself. There was strong American support for annexation, {{and the need}} for Pacific bases in wartime became clear after the Battle of Manila. McKinley came to office as a supporter of annexation, and lobbied Congress to act, warning that to do nothing would invite a royalist counter-revolution or a Japanese takeover. Foreseeing difficulty in getting two-thirds of the Senate to approve a treaty of annexation, McKinley instead supported the effort of Democratic Representative Francis G. Newlands of Nevada to accomplish the result by joint resolution of both houses of Congress. The resulting Newlands Resolution passed both houses by wide margins, and McKinley signed it into law on July 8, 1898. McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan notes, [...] "McKinley was the guiding spirit behind the annexation of Hawaii, showing... a firmness in pursuing it"; the President told Cortelyou, [...] "We need Hawaii just as much and a good <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> we did California. It is manifest destiny." ...|$|E

500|$|The cost of {{building}} a castle varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material. It is certain that stone castles cost a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> those built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around £200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which {{was built in the}} late 12thcentury for £1,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about £7,000 between 1181 and 1191. Spending on the scale of the vast castles such as Château Gaillard (an estimated £15,000 to £20,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from £1,000 to £10,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting a lord's finances. Costs in the late 13thcentury were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing £14,500 and £9,000 respectively. Edward I's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329. Renowned designer Master James of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost: ...|$|E

[...] On the other hand, former President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration, wrote that McKinley's annexation of the territory was a [...] "perversion of our national destiny".

Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely imperialism.|$|E

2500|$|On May 10, 1940, Germany {{launched}} the blitzkrieg offensive against France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, {{and millions of}} refugees took to the roads. [...] On May 15, Sousa Mendes issued transit visas to Maria Tavares, a Luxembourg citizen of Portuguese origin, and to her husband Paul Miny, also a Luxembourger. Two weeks later, the couple returned to the Bordeaux Consulate asking Sousa Mendes to issue them false papers. Sousa Mendes agreed to their request, and on May 30, 1940, he issued a Portuguese passport listing Paul Miny as Maria's brother, therefore as having Portuguese citizenship. This time Sousa Mendes risked himself a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> he had before; disobeying Dispatch 14 was one thing, but issuing a passport with a false identity, for someone of military age was a crime. Sousa Mendes later provided the following explanation: “This couple asked me for a Portuguese passport, where they would figure as brother and sister, for fear that the husband, who was still of military age, would be detained on passing the French border, and incorporated in the Luxembourg army then being organized in France."

2500|$|Biographer Myra Friedman commented in her {{original}} version of Buried Alive {{that was published}} in hardback in 1973, Given the near-infinite potentials of infancy, it is really impossible to make generalizations about what lies behind sexual practices. [...] This, however, is probable: to become clearly homosexual, to make the choice that one honestly prefers relations with one's own sex, no matter the origins of such preference, requires a certain integration, a stability of psychic development, a tidiness of personality organization. [...] The ridicule and the humiliation that took place at that most delicate period in [...] early teens, her own inability to surmount the obstacles to regular growth, devastated her a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> most people comprehended. [...] Janis was not heir to an ego so cohesive as to permit her an identity {{one way or the}} other. [...] She was, as [...] Mr. [...] Giarritano put it , [...] "diffused" [...] -- spewing, splattering, splaying all over, without a center to hold. [...] That had {{as much to do with}} {{her original}} use of drugs [...] as did the critical component of guilt and its multiplicity of sources above and beyond the contribution made by her relationships with women.

2500|$|Critics who {{had seen}} the {{production}} in New York (such as Frank Rich) found it substantially more [...] "upbeat" [...] and lacking in the atmosphere it had originally possessed.

[...] The AP quoted Michael Convey of The Financial Times, who wrote: [...] "'Follies' is a great <b>deal</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a camp love-in for old burlesque buffs and Sondheim aficionados." [...] The New York Times critic wrote: [...] "The initial critics' reviews ranged from unqualified raves to some doubts whether the reworked book of James Goldman {{is up to the}} inventiveness of Sondheim's songs. 'A truly fantastic evening,' The Financial Times concluded, while The London Daily News said, 'The musical is inspired,' and The Times described the evening as 'a wonderful idea for a show which has failed to grow into a story.'" [...] He further commented: [...] "In part, the show is a tribute to musical stage history, in which the 57-year-old Mr. Sondheim is steeped, for he first learned song writing at the knee of Oscar Hammerstein II and became the acknowledged master songwriter who bridged past musical stage romance into the modern musical era of irony and neurosis. Follies is a blend of both, and the new production is rounded out with production numbers celebrating love's simple hope for young lovers, its extravagant fantasies for Ziegfeld aficionados, and its fresh lesson for the graying principals." ...|$|E
