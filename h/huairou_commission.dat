In a tent at the Civil Society Village established especially for poor, grassroots women at the conference (organized by GROOTS International), the <b>Huairou</b> <b>Commission,</b> a registered non-governmental organization with a global secretariat in Brooklyn, NY, was established to ensure that grassroots women would have a voice at subsequent UN conferences and in other development processes.|$|E

Certainly the goals are the same: secure tenure, basic services, affordable housing, inclusive cities, effective redistribution of resources and the support for communities to lead these struggles.|$|E

Their work demonstrates an ‘imagining’ of development different from mainstream development discourse, {{because it is}} bottom?up, self?help work. The women's ongoing strategies and new coping mechanisms serve {{as a foundation for}} community empowerment and resilience as they face the impacts of current crises. Leaders of grassroots women's community groups and NGOs that are connected through the global network of the <b>Huairou</b> <b>Commission</b> reviewed the impacts of the recent financial and food crises and of climate change on their communities. They revealed clear hardships {{as a result of the}} crises, but also questioned the emphasis on the crises, noting that donors and governments used the crises to cut funding and services. Participants instead emphasised a crisis in values and consumption patterns, where multinational corporations are tightening their grip on their lives...|$|E
