5|$|After a {{match in}} the Cincinnati Gardens, Costello's hip was damaged when an enraged fan threw a fire {{extinguisher}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b> Costello had hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15 days in jail, and was fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. With Costello unable to compete, the Fabulous Kangaroos split up. After the Kangaroos went {{their separate ways}} Don Kent returned to NWA Mid-America as a singles wrestler.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by the Georgian successes, Süleymanshah II, the resurgent Seljuqid {{sultan of}} Rûm, rallied his vassal emirs and marched against Georgia, but his camp was {{attacked}} and destroyed by David Soslan at the Battle of Basian in 1203 or 1204. The chronicler of Tamar {{describes how the}} army was assembled at the rock-hewn town of Vardzia before marching on to Basian and how the queen addressed the troops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Menem sported an image {{similar to the}} old caudillos, such as Facundo Quiroga and Chacho Peñaloza. He groomed his sideburns in a similar style. His presidential inauguration was {{attended}} by several gauchos. Contrary to Peronist tradition, Menem did not prepare huge rallies in the Plaza de Mayo to address the people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of the Casa Rosada. Instead, he took full advantage of mass media, such as television.|$|E

50|$|At {{the centennial}} {{anniversary of the}} parish, twenty flags <b>from</b> {{countries}} around <b>the</b> world, including the United States and the Vatican, were displayed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> to represent <b>the</b> diversity of the parish.|$|R
5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front of the platform to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry {{at the rear of the}} platform.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station. The players, {{in the first of}} a convoy of four coaches, waved to the assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the Council House, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them on behalf of the city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> before the coaches continued through the city centre and back to St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old Billy Walton, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's 1931 cup final team, and a trade delegation from the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk.|$|E

50|$|The {{buildings}} and architecture of New Orleans are reflective {{of its history}} and multicultural heritage, from Creole cottages to historic mansions on St. Charles Avenue, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> of <b>the</b> French Quarter to an Egyptian Revival U.S. Customs building and a rare example of a Moorish revival church.|$|R
50|$|Designed by John Portman, {{the hotel}} {{has one of}} the largest open atriums in Southeast Asia, which rises through 21 levels and is {{permeated}} by natural light. Each of the 575 rooms is accessed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> overlooking <b>the</b> atrium, and has views of the Singapore harbour and the city skyline.|$|R
5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E
5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and is profoundly affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E

25|$|An Extra Assistant Commissioner in Jalandhar, Jilani died a {{few days}} before his thirtieth birthday, thus {{becoming}} the second-ever Indian Test cricketer, after Amar Singh, to die.

25|$|As {{his first}} act as pope, he revived the {{traditional}} public blessing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony,</b> Urbi et Orbi ("to {{the city and}} to the world"), abandoned by his predecessors since the loss of Rome to the Italian state in 1870. This suggested his openness to a rapprochement {{with the government of}} Italy.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua, CNN cameraman Jonathon Schaer and NBC cameraman Tony Wasserman {{appear to be the}} only television cameramen who captured the scene. ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|E

25|$|Vettori's {{captaincy}} had a rocky start, {{losing a}} Test series in England first up. Vettori also attracted some {{criticism in the}} following ODI series when he engaged in angry shouting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> at The Oval, regarding a controversial run out that had occurred. He then refused {{to shake hands with}} the England team after the match. This contrasted with Fleming's more languid, laid back style.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, after {{a triumphant}} entry into Austria, Austrian-born Adolf Hitler {{spoke to the}} Austrian Germans <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> of the Neue Burg, {{a part of the}} Hofburg at the Heldenplatz. Viennese Jews were looted, {{deported}} and murdered.. Between 1938 (after the Anschluss) {{and the end of the}} Second World War, Vienna lost its status as a capital to Berlin as Austria ceased to exist and became a part of Nazi Germany. It was not until 1955 that Austria regained full sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|When the Queen {{returns to}} Buckingham Palace, the first {{division}} of the Escort to the Colour will form into two detachments of New Guards and enter the forecourt, opposite the Old Guards. Each year, the Queen then stops at the gateway together with the Duke of Edinburgh. Standing before the central gateway, they then receive the salute of {{the remainder of the}} guards and then the mounted troops. As they file past, their regimental marches are played by the massed and mounted bands respectively. The Royal Family observes the spectacle <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balcony.</b>|$|E
2500|$|He {{commanded}} a monarchist incursion on October 4, 1911. This entered Portugal from Cova da Lua, Espinhosela and Vinhais (where the monarchist flag was raised <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies</b> of <b>the</b> city council halls) and attacked {{the city of}} Chaves, with the discreet indifference of the Spanish government of Alfonso XIII. [...] Three days later, Republican forces forced his troops into retreat, and they escaped to Galiza.|$|R
5000|$|Como is {{probably}} most notable {{now for the}} iconic [...] "Como Hotel", a historic Edwardian styled hotel which was extensively rebuilt after a large fire had destroyed the original back in November 1996.

50|$|By early 1791, clubs {{like the}} Jacobins, the Club des Cordeliers and the Cercle Social were {{increasingly}} dominating French political life. Numbers of men were member {{of two or}} more of such clubs. Women were not accepted as members of the Jacobin Club (nor of most other clubs), but they were allowed to follow <b>the</b> discussions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>balconies.</b> <b>The</b> rather high subscription of the Jacobin Club confined its membership to well-off men. The Jacobins claimed to speak on behalf of the people but were themselves not of 'the people': contemporaries saw the Jacobins as a club of the bourgeoisie.|$|R
