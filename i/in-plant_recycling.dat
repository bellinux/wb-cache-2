40|$|The use of {{recycled}} materials can {{address some of}} the issues associated with the cost and environmental implications of non-renewable materials. So the prime aim of this work was to determine the thermodynamic changes in the polypropylene (PP) mixtures depending on the percentage amount of different origin recyclates for sustainable nanocomposites. In this study, different polypropylene mixtures with the addition of PP recyclates from a selective waste collection system and <b>in-plant</b> <b>recycling</b> system have been subjected to detailed analysis. It was obvious that recyclates from technological waste were of higher quality than post-user recyclates obtained from a selective waste collection system. The influence of the source of the recyclates on the different properties of the processed materials has been studied in detail. The content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates was found to explain the unexpected influence of the recyclates content on the properties of the final product. A mathematical model was also formulated to calculate the content of the material with certain amount of recirculations in the <b>in-plant</b> <b>recycling</b> system since no analyses concerning the content of the repeatedly processed material in the technological recyclates added to the original material were found in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The metal {{container}} industry has plants throughout central and western Canada, but {{the concentration of}} plants are in Ontario. The {{metal container}} industry has gone through many changes {{with the advent of}} metal recycling. <b>In-plant</b> <b>recycling</b> of waste products has become a normal operating procedure. In 1976, the Progressive Conservatives led by Premier Bill Davis decided to pass amendments to the Environmental Protection Act which would require the gradual phasing out of non-refillable pop containers. The Metal Container Manufacturer’ Advisory Council (MCMAC) stated that if the regulations were implemented there would be a loss of more than 1, 200 jobs in steel can making and capital facilities worth more than $ 50 million owned by companies involved with soft drink can manufacturing would be abandoned. 38 cm, (1 box) containing correspondence, press releases, clippings and publications pertaining to the Metal Containers Manufacturers' Advisory Council...|$|E
40|$|The {{procurement}} of new landfill {{sites for}} in-plant waste disposal presents certain challenges to {{companies in the}} steel manufacturing industry. These include the increased costs of the acquisition of land space, {{as well as the}} potential adverse environmental and social impacts associated with landfill activities. Scaw Metals Group, an international steel-manufacturing organisation, is currently seeking a recycling initiative for its in-plant waste materials. This is a proposal developed in efforts to shift the company away from its current custom of landfill disposal of all of its in-plant waste materials. This would not only reduce the costs of waste disposal to the company and render it economically beneficial, but it would also provide environmental and social benefits. This study investigates the economic viability of a nine-month recycling trial that transpired at Scaw Metals Group’s operations in Johannesburg, South Africa, and examines the potential costs and benefits that would be incurred and accrue to the company over time. To buttress the reliability of the cost and benefit estimates obtained, further analyses are undertaken to account for variability in the purchasing price of steel scrap, for the economic outcomes that would arise under different waste diversion scenarios, and for factors that would influence Scaw Metals Group’s decision to adopt or abandon <b>in-plant</b> waste <b>recycling</b> efforts. The results suggest that the project would be financially worthwhile for Scaw to pursue, and would be robust under the various scenario analyses examined. Further discussion on the limitations of the study and on the critical issues that should be taken into consideration for future analysis concerning this project have been included...|$|R
40|$|Eco-friendliness, energy {{efficiency}} and cost effectiveness are major drivers responsible for cold recycled asphalt mixtures being considered as alternatives to hot mixtures. Although such mixtures are still regarded in some quarters as second class asphalt, results from field trials on such materials under temperate climates {{have been reported to}} be highly impressive and encouraging. Some developed countries with temperate climates have since developed guidelines for the production and use of cold mixtures in road building. However, evidence from the literature shows that little or nothing has been done to ascertain the performance and suitability of such sustainable materials in developing countries located in hot tropical climates. Ascertaining the performances of such will, among other things enable the formulation of guidelines required for producing and using these alternative sustainable materials and methods in developing countries with hot tropical climates, where available funds for road building are increasingly inadequate to meet demand. The work reported in this thesis attempts to simulate what should be expected in terms of the performance of flexible pavements containing cold mixes of bitumen emulsion stabilized RAP as road base in hot climates. Cold <b>recycling</b> <b>in-plant</b> was deemed appropriate for the obvious reason that it enables control of the quality of mixtures produced. The challenge of sourcing severely aged RAPs required for this study afforded the opportunity of developing a laboratory ageing protocol for producing RAPs with controlled properties, typical of those found in hot tropical belts (with residual binders of very low penetration). The result of the physico-chemical and rheological studies showed that ageing hot mix asphalt at 125 ⁰C does not degrade the binder when compared to that aged at 85 ⁰C, which is the conventional protocol (for temperate climates). A target mix design based on Overseas Road Notes (ORN) 19 and 31 for 20 mm DBM, which the literature suggests is suitable for road base layers of road pavements, yielded an aggregate gradation containing RAP (with residual bitumen of 20 dmm penetration), 5 mm granite dust and granite mineral filler in the proportion 65 : 30 : 5 respectively. Further investigations patterned after Marshall and Hveem mix design methods, indicated that a cationic bitumen emulsion content of 6. 5 % and pre-wetting water content of 1. 5 % were suitable. Unlike hot mixtures, cold mixtures due to their peculiarity i. e. intermediate nature (close to unbound granular materials in early life and close to fully bound materials when fully cured), require curing before being assessed for mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength etc. Performances of the five cold bituminous emulsions mixtures (CBEMs), one with 100 % virgin aggregate, the others including RAP with binder penetrations 5, 10, 15 and 20 dmm, manufactured at 20 ⁰C and 32 ⁰C (to reflect average minimum and maximum temperatures in hot tropical climates) showed that: • Properties of CBEM are dependent on the state of curing or maturation attained i. e. early life, intermediate life and fully cured or stable condition; • High air void content in CBEMs appears to be inevitable; • Mixing and compaction temperature is very important for achieving relatively low air void contents in CBEMs. For example, mixing and compacting CBEMs at 32 ⁰C gave better results than at 20 ⁰C; • Indirect Tensile Stiffness Modulus is useful for quickly ranking the CBEMs; • The RAP CBEMs performed better than the virgin aggregate CBEM in terms of water susceptibility; • An increase in stiffness modulus up the range from 10 dmmCBEM to 15 dmmCBEM and to 20 dmmCBEM, with higher values than the virgin aggregate CBEM as observed in this work gives the impression that the residual binder in the studied RAPs is active as a result of possible softening or rejuvenation. Alternatively, the stiffness enhancements could possibly have been caused by the alteration of the volumetrics of such RAP CBEMs which consequently enhanced their compactability; • Overall, RAP CBEMs are better than virgin aggregate CBEM in mechanical performance and durability; • Fatigue lives of the CBEMs are generally lower than those for hot mix asphalt (HMA); • The CBEMs are stress-dependent as they all fitted the k-Θ model. The results of the analytical pavement design showed the importance of using tools such as KENLAYER which account for the non linearity of CBEMs. Although the structural design was a hypothetical case, the results confirmed that the virgin aggregate CBEM was inferior in terms of axle loads to failure compared to the RAP CBEMs, and the RAP CBEMs were inferior to HMA. The findings of this limited investigation suggest that the studied RAP CBEMs are suitable for low volume traffic roads, an indication of the great potential of these sustainable materials when properly harnessed. In the light of this, a short and concise set of guidelines for mix design of RAP CBEMs and structural design of pavements containing such non linear materials was proposed in the thesis.

40|$|Stakeholders in the {{pavement}} sector have been seeking new engineering solutions {{to move towards}} more sustainable pavement management practices. The general approaches for improving pavement sustainability include, among others, reducing virgin binder and virgin aggregate content in HMA and WMA mixtures, reducing energy consumed and emissions generated in mixtures production, applying in-place recycling techniques, and implementing preventive treatments. In this study, a comprehensive and integrated pavement life cycle costing- life cycle assessment model was developed to investigate, from a full life cycle perspective, {{the extent to which}} several pavement engineering solutions, namely hot <b>in-plant</b> <b>recycling</b> mixtures, WMA, cold central plant recycling and preventive treatments, are efficient in improving the environmental and economic dimensions of pavement infrastructure sustainability, when applied either separately or in combination, in the construction and management of a road pavement section located in Virginia, USA. Furthermore, {{in order to determine the}} preference order of alternative scenarios, a multicriteria decision analysis method was applied. The results showed that the implementation of a recycling-based maintenance and rehabilitation strategy where the asphalt mixtures are of type hot-mix asphalt containing 30 % RAP, best suits the multidimensional and conflicting interests of decision-makers. This outcome was found to be robust even when different design and performance scenarios of the mixtures and type of treatments are considered...|$|E
40|$|In France, road {{transport}} accounts for 50 % and 30 % of the NOx and CO 2 emissions respectively. Asphalt recycling consists in including Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) into new Asphalt Concrete. This technique can allow {{firms in the}} road construction field to reduce their impacts {{on the environment and}} thus to achieve the goals set by the European Commission. Unfortunately, asphalt recycling just began to have more importance in France. Additionally, the lack of easily available data and studies about this method makes it complicated to enhance the development of asphalt recycling. The thesis aimed to picture a good overview of the current asphalt recycling practices in France and to analyze them from an environmental point of view. The main attention was concentrated on GreenHouse Gases (GHGs) emissions and energy consumptions of those techniques. Moreover, the thesis tried to describe the main advantages and drawbacks of the different asphalt recycling techniques in order to understand their proportions in France. The study also aimed to learn from the experiences of other regions by comparing the French practices with other European countries and analyzing these differences. The methodology used is literature review, interviews and use of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool: asPECT.   The literature review provided all the theoretical background needed to understand asphalt recycling and also data about its impacts on the environment. In order to add a current component that reflects the reality of road constructions firms, data was also collected with interviews and interpreted with the LCA tool. Finally, the LCA approach was used to compare and analyze all the results collected by providing the necessary simplifications. Study results show that France increased its proportion of RAP recycled significantly lately to reach 63 %. The main two asphalt recycling techniques used are Hot <b>In-Plant</b> <b>recycling</b> and Cold In-Place Recycling (CIR). CIR is the most environmental friendly asphalt recycling technique, reaching a reduction of 80 % in GHGs emissions and energy consumptions compared to a classical rehabilitation method. Hot <b>In-Plant</b> <b>recycling</b> only allows a reduction of approximately 30 % in the same environmental factors. Thanks to those techniques 113   000 tons of CO 2 e and 10, 3 * 105 GJ have been saved in 2010. Asphalt recycling also enables making economic profits and improving social conditions. However, pollutants, tar or asbestos contaminated asphalt, haulage distance limit the development of asphalt recycling in France. It was also observed that France is behind its neighbors but is catching up lately. The main reasons for this delay are the aggregates’ supplies; the number of plants fit for recycling and the legislation about waste disposal and RAP recycling rates. It was concluded that to enhance the use of asphalt recycling in France, French authorities, research centers, road construction firms and certification organisms have to cooperate and work together in order to stem the main drawbacks of asphalt recycling, settle the LCA problems, to win the trust of the State and the firms and to increase the competition...|$|E
40|$|Road {{infrastructure}} {{is essential in}} the development of human society, but has both negative and positive impacts. Large amounts of money and natural resources are spent each year on its construction, operation and maintenance. Obviously, there is potentially significantenvironmental impact associated with these activities. Thus the need for integration of life cycle environmental impacts of road infrastructure into transport planning is currently being widely recognised on international and national level. However certain issues, such as energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the construction, maintenance and operation of road infrastructure, are rarely considered during the current transport planning process in Sweden and most other countries. This thesis examined energy use and GHG emissions for the whole life cycle (construction, operation, maintenance and end-of-life) of road infrastructure, with the aim of improving transport planning on both strategic and project level. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was applied to two selected case studies: LCA of a road tunnel and LCA of three methods for asphalt recycling and reuse: hot in-plant, hot in-place and reuse as unbound material. The impact categories selected for analysis were Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and Global Warming Potential (GWP). Other methods used in the research included interviews and a literature review. The results of the first case study indicated that the operational phase of the tunnel contributed the highest share of CED and GWP throughout the tunnel’s life cycle. Construction of concrete tunnels had much higher CED and GWP per lane-metre than construction of rocktunnels. The results of the second case study showed that hot in-place recycling of asphalt gave slightly more net savings of GWP and CED than hot <b>in-plant</b> <b>recycling.</b> Asphalt reuse was less environmentally beneficial than either of these alternatives, resulting in no net savings of GWP and minor net savings of CED. Main sources of data uncertainty identified in the two case-studies included prediction of future electricity mix and inventory data for asphalt concrete. This thesis contributes to methodological development which will be useful to future infrastructure LCAs in terms of inventory data collection. It presents estimated amounts of energy use and GHG emissions associated with road infrastructure, on the example of roadtunnel and asphalt recycling. Operation of road infrastructure and production of construction materials are identified as the main priorities for decreasing GHG emissions and energy use during the life cycle of road infrastructure. It was concluded that the potential exists for significant decreases in GHG emissions and energy use associated with the road transport system if the entire life cycle of road {{infrastructure is}} taken into consideration from the very start of the policy-making process.

40|$|The steel {{industry}} in the United States generates about 30 million tons of by-products each year, including 6 million tons of desulfurization and BOF/BOP slag. The recycling of BF (blast furnace) slag has made significant progress in past years {{with much of the}} material being utilized as construction aggregate and in cementitious applications. However, the recycling of desulfurization and BOF/BOP slags still faces many technical, economic, and environmental challenges. Previous efforts have focused on <b>in-plant</b> <b>recycling</b> of the by-products, achieving only limited success. As a result, large amounts of by-products of various qualities have been stockpiled at steel mills or disposed into landfills. After more than 50 years of stockpiling and landfilling, available mill site space has diminished and environmental constraints have increased. The prospect of conventionally landfilling of the material is a high cost option, a waste of true national resources, and an eternal material liability issue. The research effort has demonstrated that major inroads have been made in establishing the viability of recycling and reuse of the steelmaking slags. The research identified key components in the slags, developed technologies to separate the iron units and produce marketable products from the separation processes. Three products are generated from the technology developed in this research, including a high grade iron product containing about 90 %Fe, a medium grade iron product containing about 60 % Fe, and a low grade iron product containing less than 10 % Fe. The high grade iron product contains primarily metallic iron and can be marketed as a replacement of pig iron or DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) for steel mills. The medium grade iron product contains both iron oxide and metallic iron and can be utilized as a substitute for the iron ore in the blast furnace. The low grade iron product is rich in calcium, magnesium and iron oxides and silicates. It has a sufficient lime value and can be utilized for acid mine drainage treatment. Economic analysis from this research demonstrates that the results are favorable. The strong demand and the increase of price of the DRI and pig iron in recent years are particularly beneficial to the economics. The favorable economics has brought commercial interests. ICAN Global has obtained license agreement on the technology from Michigan Tech. This right was later transferred to the Westwood Land, Inc. A demonstration pilot plant is under construction to evaluate the technology. Steel industry will benefit from the new supply of the iron units once the commercial plants are constructed. Environmental benefits to the public and the {{steel industry}} will be tremendous. Not only the old piles of the slag will be removed, but also the federal responsible abandoned mines from the old mining activities can be remediated with the favorable product generated from the process. Cost can be reduced {{and there will be no}} lime required, which can avoid the release of carbon dioxide from lime production process...|$|E
