5|$|A book {{based on}} the {{production}} of the series, Star Trek Phase II: The Lost Series was published in 1997 by Pocket Books. It was written by Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, and went into <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conception of the planned and later aborted series, looking at several aspects of production, with behind-the-series information, color artwork, storyboards, blueprints, technical information and photos. It also contained two full scripts from the planned series.|$|E
5|$|In Athens, {{the early}} tragedians Phrynicus and Sophocles both wrote plays called Troilos and the comic playwright Strattis wrote {{a parody of}} the same name. Of the esteemed Nine lyric poets of the archaic and {{classical}} periods, Stesichorus may have referred to Troilus' story in his Iliupersis and Ibycus may have written in <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character. With the exception of these authors, no other pre-Hellenistic written source {{is known to have}} considered Troilus at any length.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the defence}} {{measures}} {{appear to have}} prevented the final destruction and collapse of the Mycenaean states. A second destruction struck Mycenae in ca. 1190 BC or shortly thereafter. This event {{marked the end of}} Mycenae as a major power. The site was then reoccupied, but on a smaller scale. The palace of Pylos, in the southwestern Peloponnese, faced destruction in c. 1180 BC. The Linear B archives found there, preserved by the heat of the fire that destroyed the palace, mention hasty defence preparations due to an imminent attack without giving any <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> attacking force.|$|E

5|$|The {{survivor}} was Edgar Forwood, 67-year-old Managing-Director of Forwood Down and Company Ltd., a South Australian engineering company. He was {{the oldest}} person on board the flight, and probably the most experienced air traveller. He was interviewed by police in hospital in Perth, but {{was not aware of}} much <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> final minutes of the flight. He said {{there was no sign of}} fire prior to the crash and no announcement to passengers to fasten their seat belts. He died six days after the crash and was buried at the North Road cemetery in Adelaide, his home town.|$|E
5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E
5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between an AVM and surrounding brain tissue. In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography {{may be required}} to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E

5|$|Edward and Karl find {{a fork in}} {{the road}} and travel down {{separate}} paths. Edward follows a path through a swamp and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming he was expected. There, he befriends Ashton poet Norther Winslow and the mayor’s daughter Jenny. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down but promises Jenny he will return. In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him to tell her the story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening outside the door. Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman. Karl and Edward get jobs in the circus where the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> woman at the end of every month.|$|E
5|$|His {{father was}} {{released}} after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had {{to continue working}} at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later Dickens wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' prisons in The Pickwick Papers (1836–1837), David Copperfield (1849–1850), and most extensively in Little Dorrit (1855–1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Marshalsea in Little Dorrit reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if anything, he downplayed the licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect Victorian sensibilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the important and influential military aristocracy that formed in Mycenaean society offers an overwhelming impression of a fierce and warlike people. This impression of militarism {{is reinforced by the}} fortifications erected throughout Mycenaean Greece, the large numbers and quality of the weapons retrieved from the Mycenaean royal graves, artistic representations of war scenes and the textual evidence provided by the Linear B records. The Linear B scripts also offer some <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> organization of the military personnel, while military production and logistics were supervised by a central authority from the palaces. According to the records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army; similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E

25|$|On June 20, IGN {{published}} {{an interview with}} lead artist Fin McGechie.

25|$|Little <b>detail</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{stabilization}} system is recorded.

The wing tips could rotate to control roll. The system was pneumatically powered and could be turned on and off in flight to test its efficiency.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, auctions of {{art works}} were {{commonly}} held in taverns and coffeehouses.
