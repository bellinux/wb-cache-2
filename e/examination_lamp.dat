40|$|Background  The {{most widely}} used method for {{establishing}} the minimal erythema dose (MED) before narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B phototherapy is time-consuming, inconvenient and may yield inconsistent results. Objectives  To assess the equivalence of MED assessment using a filtered xenon arc lamp UV source, a semiautomated MED tester, and a UV-opaque template method of MED determination with a panel of TL- 01 311 -nm UVB fluorescent tubes. Secondly, to gauge the current usage of MED testing, and the method used, in a large sample of U. K. phototherapy units. Thirdly, to assess variation in UV output of the semiautomated skin tester immediately after switching on to identify optimum warm-up time. Finally, to assess reproducibility of MED testing by assessing within-patient variability and interobserver variability of MED test results. Methods  Sixty-five patients about to undergo UVB phototherapy had their MED determined using three different methods. Within each patient we compared the values of MED determined by a semiautomated Durham MED tester, a panel of narrowband UVB lamps with a UV-opaque template constructed by a phototherapist, and a 310 -nm filtered xenon arc lamp with a liquid light guide. MED test results were assessed by clinical evaluation using a 6500 K colour temperature <b>examination</b> <b>lamp.</b> The output of the semiautomated MED tester was measured by spectroradiometer {{over a period of}} 20 min in order to identify the time to steady output. Reproducibility of MED testing with the semiautomated MED tester was carried out in 25 normal volunteers. All MEDs were assessed by at least two independent observers. A postal questionnaire was sent to 78 U. K. phototherapy units to assess routine practice concerning MED testing prior to narrowband UVB phototherapy. Results  The semiautomated MED tester showed consistency with the panel method (r = 0 · 92, panel MED = − 0 · 57 + 1 · 14 × Durham MED). The semiautomated MED tester produced a slightly lower MED result than the panel MED. Reproducibility tests showed high interobserver agreement (kappa value = 0 · 79), and high consistency for successive day testing (kappa value = 0 · 79). Questionnaires were returned from 67 of 78 phototherapy units (85...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} Fourier-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (FD-OCT) as {{an adjunct}} to traditional slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> of donor corneas with suspected Anterior Stromal Opacities. Methods. Seven corneas suspected of having anterior stromal opacities by slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> were evaluated with FD-OCT. Each cornea was evaluated to confirm the presence of opacity and, if present, the depth of opacity was measured. Results. The opacity depth ranged from 82 [*]μm to 624 [*]μm. The initial slit lamp impressions of five of the seven corneas were confirmed by OCT. In two corneas, the OCT findings were different from the initial slit lamp impressions. Slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> of the first cornea gave the impression of anterior stromal scarring, but OCT showed that the opacity was limited to the epithelium. Slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> of the second cornea suggested opacity limited to the epithelium, but OCT identified significant sub-Bowman's scarring. In all cases, the Eye Bank Technicians reported that the location and depth of corneal opacity were more sharply defined by OCT than by slit lamp. Conclusion. The high resolution of OCT makes it easier to determine the location of corneal opacities compared to slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examinations.</b> This enhanced visualization can improve decisions regarding transplant suitability of donor corneas...|$|R

40|$|Background: Fungal {{infection}} {{is a common}} disease in tropical and subtropical countries. Warm and humid climates provide a favourable environment for organism causing superficial mycosis. One of the fungal infections that commonly occurred in children is tinea capitis. Tinea capitis is a superficial fungal infection of the hair and scalp caused by dermatophytes. The age predilection of this disease is children aged 3 until 14 years. The {{purpose of this study}} was to detect the presence of tinea capitis among elementary school students in Jatinangor, Sumedang, Indonesia. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study involved 391 students from thefirst until sixth grade at four elementary schools in Jatinangor, in the period of September until October 2013. Anamnesis, physical <b>examination,</b> Wood’s <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> and direct microscopic examination were conducted to diagnose the disease. The collected data were analyzed and presented in the form of frequency distribution and percentages shown in tables. Results: Out of 391 students participating in this study, 194 were boys and 197 were girls. The age range was 6 until 16 years. Based on the screening results, 74 students were known to have complaints about their hair and scalp and only 49 students could continue the study as they have no positive result of tinea capitis. Conclusions: There is no positive findings of tinea capitis according to anamnesis, physical <b>examination,</b> Wood’s <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> and direct microscopic examination.

40|$|Nitisinone, {{although}} unapproved {{for use in}} alkaptonuria (AKU), {{is currently}} the only homogentisic acid lowering therapy with a potential to modify disease progression in AKU. Therefore, safe use of nitisinone off-label requires identifying and managing tyrosine keratopathy. A 22 -year-old male with AKU commenced 2  mg daily nitisinone after full assessment. He was issued an alert card explaining potential ocular symptoms such as red eye, tearing, ocular pain and visual impairment and how to manage them. On his first and second annual follow-up visits to the National Alkaptonuria Centre (NAC), there was no corneal keratopathy on slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examination.</b> On his third follow-up annual visit to the NAC, he {{was found to have}} typical dendritiform corneal keratopathy in both eyes which was asymptomatic.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} gene mutations {{associated with}} three different types of corneal dystrophies (CDs), and to establish a phenotype-genotype correlation. Methods: Two patients with Avellino corneal dystrophy (ACD), four patients with lattice corneal dystrophy type I (LCD I) from one family, and three patients with macular corneal dystrophy type I (MCD I) were subjected to both clinical and genetic <b>examinations.</b> Slit <b>lamp</b> <b>examination</b> was performed for all the subjects to assess their corneal phenotypes. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The coding regions of the human transforming growth factor β-induced (TGFBI) gene and carbohydrate sulfotransferase 6 (CHST 6) gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to direct sequencing. DNA samples from 50 healthy volunteers were used as controls. Results: Clinical examination showed three different phenotypes of CDs. Genetic examination identified that two ACD subjects were associated with homozygous R 124 H mutation of TGFBI, and four LCD I subjects were all associated with R 124 C heterozygous mutation.
