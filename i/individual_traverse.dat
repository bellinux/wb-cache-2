5000|$|In {{ethology}} {{and behavioral}} ecology, trap-lining or traplining is a feeding strategy {{in which an}} individual visits food sources on a regular, repeatable sequence, much as trappers check their lines of traps. Traplining is usually seen in species foraging for floral resources. This involves a specified route in which the <b>individual</b> <b>traverses</b> {{in the same order}} repeatedly to check specific plants for flowers that hold nectar, even over long distances. Trap-lining has been described in several taxa (sing. taxon), including bees, butterflies, tamarins, bats, rats, and hummingbirds and tropical fruit-eating mammals such as opossums, capuchins and kinkajous. Traplining is used to term the method in which bumblebees and hummingbirds go about collecting nectar, and consequently, pollinating each plant they visit. The term [...] "traplining" [...] was originally coined by Daniel Janzen, although the concept was discussed by Charles Darwin and Nikolaas Tinbergen.|$|R

We flew pigeons (Columba livia) through an array of vertical obstacles in a flight arena, presenting them with this choice. The pigeons selected either a strategy involving only a slight pause in the normal wingbeat cycle, or a wings folded posture granting reduced efficiency but greater stability should a misjudgment lead to collision. The more stable but less efficient flight strategy was not employed to traverse easy obstacles with wide gaps for passage, but came to dominate the postures used as obstacle challenge increased with narrower gaps and there was a greater chance of a collision. These results indicate that birds weigh potential obstacle negotiation strategies and estimate task difficulty during locomotor pattern selection...|$|R

Facing the dilemma of low food but high temperature in the epilimnion vs. high food but low temperature in the hypolimnion, Daphnia distribute above and below the thermocline in order to optimise their fitness. Labelling hypolimnetic algae with 15 N revealed that the vertical distribution of Daphnia is dynamic, i. e., all <b>individuals</b> <b>traverse</b> the thermocline and allocate a certain proportion of their time to feeding in the cold water. The overall energy gain from the deep-water algal maximum is lower than from the same algal concentration in the epilimnion due to the low temperature and the limited time an individual spends in the hypolimnion. The results provide mechanistic support for the hypothesis that Daphnia chose their habitat according to an Ideal Free Distribution with Costs model...|$|R

Youth gender, grade, and ethnicity moderated these associations. Cumulative risk predicted change over time in depressed mood. Scholastic achievement and self-esteem compensated for this risk. Findings indicate that youth attributes offer limited protection when adolescents experience risk factors across life domains.

Wildlife crossing structures {{are often used}} {{as a solution to}} overcome this growing problem, but are frequently installed without further study on the features that can influence their efficacy. We addressed this issue by investigating the effect of moisture levels inside road tunnels on the movement of California tiger salamanders (Ambystoma californiense) during their annual migration. Specifically we studied the effects of moisture on the rate of tunnel completion and the speed at which <b>individuals</b> <b>traversed</b> a tunnel. Sixty-four individuals were used in this study, and 28 completed the tunnels regardless of moisture levels. Our results showed that moisture levels had no effect on the probability of tunnel completion or rejection, but had an effect on the speed of movement, resulting in individuals spending 33 % less time traveling through wet tunnels. Stronger precipitation increased the probability of completions and decreased the speed of movement through tunnels. Our findings suggest that internal moisture levels have little effect on the use of road tunnels and the migration of A. californiense. Rather, external precipitation drives tunnel usage and migratory behavior. Nonetheless, our study demonstrated the successful use of wildlife crossing structures in safely facilitating A. californiense under a hazardous roadway...|$|R

40|$|Research {{on child}} and {{adolescent}} mental health problems has burgeoned since the inaugural issue of Development and Psychopathology was published in 1989. In the quarter century since, static models of psychopathology have been abandoned in favor of transactional models, following the agenda set by editor Dante Cicchetti and other proponents of the discipline. The transactional approach, which {{has been applied to}} autism, depression, self-injury, and delinquency, (a) specifies vulnerabilities and risk factors across multiple levels of analysis spanning genes to cultures, (b) identifies multifinal and equifinal pathways to psychopathology, and (c) transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. However, as noted by Rutter and Sroufe (2000), specific mechanisms of continuity, discontinuity, and comorbidity of psychopathology must be identified if we wish to understand etiology fully. In this article, we present a model of early-onset externalizing behavior in which comorbidities and continuities are viewed as ontogenic processes: products of complex longitudinal transactions between interdependent individual-level vulnerabilities (e. g., genetic, epigenetic, allostatic) and equally interdependent contextual risk factors (e. g., coercive parenting, deviant peer group affiliations, neighborhood criminality). Through interactions across levels of analysis, some <b>individuals</b> <b>traverse</b> along the externalizing spectrum, beginning with heritable trait impulsivity in preschool and ending in antisociality in adulthood.

However, previous observations {{were limited to}} a single foraging trip where {{only a small number}} of individuals were simultaneously tracked. Consequently, it is not known whether coordinated behaviour is consistent over time, or what factors influence it. In the present study, breeding adults were concurrently instrumented with GPS and dive behaviour data loggers for at least 2 consecutive foraging trips during guard and post-guard stage at two breeding colonies (London Bridge and Gabo Island, south-eastern Australia) of contrasting population size (approximately 100 and 30, 000 - 40, 000, respectively). At both colonies, individuals were sampled in areas of comparable nesting density and spatial area. At London Bridge, where individuals use a short (23 m) common pathway from their nests to the shoreline, > 90 % (n = 42) of birds displayed foraging associations and 53 - 60 % (n = 20) maintained temporally consistent associations with the same conspecifics. Neither intrinsic (sex, size or body condition) nor extrinsic (nest proximity) factors were found to influence foraging associations. However, individuals that departed from the colony at a similar time were more likely to associate during a foraging trip. At Gabo Island, where individuals use a longer (116 m) pathway with numerous tributaries to reach the shoreline, few individuals (< 31 %; n = 13) from neighbouring nests associated at sea and only 1 % (n = 1) maintained associations over subsequent trips. However, data from animal-borne video cameras indicated individuals at this colony displayed foraging associations of similar group size to those at London Bridge. This study reveals that group foraging behaviour occurs at multiple colonies and the pathways these <b>individuals</b> <b>traverse</b> with conspecifics may facilitate opportunistic group formation and resulting in foraging associations irrespective of nesting proximity and other factors...|$|R

The lecture {{is part of a larger}} mixed media project ‘Like Vessels’ (2011 – ongoing) exploring ideas around abstraction and interiority, and taking the architecture of Bologna as a starting and reference point. Abstract: An interior/exterior duality is implicit in any discussion of Giorgio Morandi’s work. On the one hand, a collection of domestic objects was the artist’s primary source of subject-matter for most of his career, during which time he worked, from 1910 to 1964, in an apartment on Bologna’s Via Fondazza, in a small studio bedroom facing onto a rear courtyard. Morandi’s images of bottles, vases and containers, however, were architectonic ‘constructions’ as much as still-life studies – their umber volumes and tower-like forms suffused with the atmosphere of the city. But Morandi’s work has never been discussed, in English, with specific and detailed reference to the architectural feature so unique to Bologna: the 37 km matrix of colonnaded streets, or portici, that likewise participate in a very particular and striking dialogue between interior space and exterior urban fabric. In disrupting the usual division of private and public, the portici set up a quasi-theatrical space between, reconfiguring boundaries and physical proximities. The obscuring of a ‘frontal’ view of the cityscape ahead also directs a shift in perspective – a sideways pan, through the arches and into the passage that adjoins the far side of the street. And, in functioning as conjunction between one interior space and another, the portici interact with the imaginative experience of the <b>individual</b> <b>traversing</b> the city. The continuous – at times barely perceptible – re-configurations of plastic vocabulary (vault, support, decoration), coupled with the contrasts and modulations of changing light, trace a multivalent and unfolding space in which to project and ‘abstract’. This paper will explore some of the interior/exterior relationships in operation in Morandi’s work, his home and recently reconstructed studio, and the architectural landscape in which both are contained. The paper will interweave discussion of relevant texts with a descriptive (and visual) account of a visit to the city...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Distribution of {{remotely}} subscribed multicast {{content in}} a Proxy Mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6) domain is performed {{by means of}} bi-directional IP-in-IP tunnels established between the mobility anchor and the visited access gateways where the mobile terminals consuming such traffic are attached to. Each access gateway subscribing to content on behalf of an attached mobile terminal requires a separate copy of the remote multicast flow being distributed over the PMIPv 6 domain. In many cases, these <b>individual</b> copies <b>traverse</b> the same routers in the path from the mobility anchor towards the access gateways, incurring in an inefficient distribution, which {{is equivalent to the}} unicast delivery of the remote multicast content within the domain. This paper explores the potential gain obtained by using explicit multicast instead of the standard IP-in-IP tunneling, showing relevant capacity savings with lower overhead respect to the standard distribution case. This transport service based on explicit multicast emerges then as an attractive transport alternative for PMIPv 6 domain operators serving visiting mobile multicast consumers.

To test this paradigm, we {{injected}} N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) intradermally in guinea pigs, harvesting tissue at 5 – 60 min. At FMLP-injected sites, venular endothelium developed increased surface wrinkling and variation in thickness. Marginating neutrophils formed contacts with endothelial cells and with other neutrophils, sometimes forming chains of linked leukocytes. Adherent neutrophils projected cytoplasmic processes into the underlying endothelium, especially at points of endothelial thinning. To determine the pathway by which neutrophils transmigrated endothelium, we prepared 27 sets of serial electron microscopic sections. Eleven of these encompassed in their entirety openings through which <b>individual</b> neutrophils <b>traversed</b> venular endothelium; in 10 of the 11 sets, neutrophils followed an entirely transendothelial cell course unrelated to interendothelial junctions, findings that were confirmed by computer-assisted three-dimensional reconstructions.

Thus, in response to FMLP, neutrophils emigrated from cutaneous venules by a transcellular route through both endothelia...|$|R

Specifically, we first note that a sequence of symmetric graphs with Diaconis–Stroock constant bounded above has an unstructured Kingman-type coalescent in the limit for a sample of size two from two different demes. We then show that circular and toroidal models with long-range but restricted migration have an upper bound on this constant and so have an unstructured-migration coalescent in the limit. We investigate the rate of convergence to this limit using simulations...|$|R

Depending on a variant, it is about 75 or more than 80 km (50 mi) long and its the highest climbing difficulty is estimated between IV and VI UIAA grade. During the last two climbing summer seasons in the Tatra Mts. a few long-distance traverses of the Main Ridge of first-rate importance were realized (solo on the knife-edge of Andrzej Marcisz in 2015, probably the fastest team crossing of Artur Paszczak and Adam Pieprzycki in 2016, semi-alpine style traverse of Tadeusz Grzegorzewski in 2016). This prompts us to try to analyse and clarify criteria which may be useful in describing and classifying traverses of the Main Ridge of the Tatras and of its combination with sections of the main ridge of the Belianske Tatra Mts. The achievements of great predecessors have set standards of style. The examples of the historical and contemporary traverses have been mentioned, solely focusing on their sportive aspects (for instance, the first winter full traverse of Andrzej Zawada team in 1959, record fast soloings of Krzysztof Żurek and Władysław Cywiński in 1975, the first winter solo of Pavel Pochylý in 1979, or winter traverse of Michal Sabovčík and Adam Kadlečík in 2013). Considering the criteria of topography, the fallowing four factors have been analysed: 1) limit points of the Main Ridge of the Tatras (the course of the ridge still arouses controversy among the Polish and the Slovak geographers); 2) quantum of topographical objects of the ridge; 3) a traverse line vs. the knife-edge of the ridge; 4) a direction of the traverse vs. difficulties of climbing. In the domain of the tactical and logistic criteria have been analysed six elements: 1) solo climbing (including incomplete soloing); 2) team ascents of sum-mits; 3) reconnaissance; 4) climbing protection; 5) provisioning; 6) accommodations. In sum, transition time is the subsidiary measure in the evaluation of a climbing exploit on the Main Ridge of the Tatras. In fact, it is the result of topographical, tactical and logistic elements, and first of all of the weather conditions. They are an objective factor, which makes it impossible to compare <b>individual</b> <b>traverses.</b> Unfortunately, time is nowadays the most important and often the only measure of a „record”, which is comprehensible for a wider audience, who are unaware of the challenges of the Main Ridge of the Tatras.

40|$|The {{period of}} {{adolescence}} is a transitional developmental stage, critical in shaping health trajectories across the life course. While many <b>individuals</b> <b>traverse</b> the adolescent transition relatively unscathed, a number suffer from significant health problems from adolescence to adulthood. Recent studies {{have begun to}} investigate the biological mechanism through which social conditions early in the life course influence health trajectories. Previous research on allostatic load, an indicator of physiological dysregulation resulting from {{the wear and tear}} of stress, has focused on adults and the aging, but few have explored allostatic load among adolescents. Additionally, recent literature has begun to explore the mechanisms through which social conditions during adolescence lead to changing obesity patterns during the transition to adulthood, though none have considered the mediating mechanism of stressful life events. Using data from two nationally representative samples of adolescents age 12 to 19 years, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (N = 8, 431) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) (N = 9, 311), the overarching goals of this study were (1) to investigate sociodemographic correlates of AL across adolescence from age 12 to 19 years, and (2) to determine whether stressful life events (SLE) in adolescence explain the relationship between adolescent sociodemographic factors and longitudinal patterns of obesity from adolescence to young adulthood. The research for this dissertation drew upon life course, social stratification, and stress process theories. Specific significant differences in AL among adolescents by age and race/ethnicity were found. In particular, higher AL scores, suggestive of greater cumulative physiological dysregulation, were significantly associated with older age and Black race/ethnicity. Select significant mediating pathways of adolescent SLE on becoming obese among males were also found. Mediation analysis revealed that SLE done to adolescent males partially explained the relationship between age and low family income on becoming obese over time. Surprisingly, no significant mediating effects of adolescent SLE on longitudinal obesity patterns were found among females. This study provided the first examination of associations between major sociodemographic factors and AL among a nationally representative sample of adolescents. The concept of AL offers great promise toward expanding our understanding of how social and environmental factors are embodied within our biological regulatory systems, and translated into disease outcomes and health disparities. The present research has significant implications for informing health prevention interventions among younger populations. Additionally, by focusing on the intervening mechanism through which adolescent social conditions may affect obesity, this research contributes {{to an understanding of the}} processes of obesity development during childhood and adolescence. These findings point to possible interventions that can prevent obesity among young males who are from low SES households.

40|$|To {{improve the}} quality of cancer {{treatment}} with protons, a translation of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) images into a map of the proton stopping powers needs to be more accurate. Proton stopping powers determined from CT images have systematic uncertainties in the calculated proton range in a patient of typically 3 – 4 % and even up to 10 % in a region containing bone. As a consequence, part of a tumor may receive no dose, or a very high dose can be delivered in healthy tissues and organs at risks (e. g. brain stem). A transmission radiograph of high-energy protons measuring proton stopping powers directly will allow to reduce these uncertainties, and thus {{improve the quality}} of treatment. The best way to obtain a sufficiently accurate radiograph is by tracking <b>individual</b> protons <b>traversing</b> the phantom (patient). In our simulations, we have used an ideal position sensitive detectors measuring a single proton before and after a phantom, while the residual energy of a proton was detected by a BaF 2 crystal. To obtain transmission radiographs, different phantom materials have been irradiated with a 3 × 3 cm 2 scattered proton beam, with various beam energies. The simulations were done using the Geant 4 simulation package. In this study, we focus on the simulations of the energy loss radiographs for various proton beam energies that are clinically available in proton radiotherapy...|$|R
50|$|The {{social problem}} film often takes a larger social issue during its {{respective}} era and displays it {{in a much}} more focused way. The problem will be expressed through a narrative often involving a few characters, often a family or an <b>individual</b> that <b>traverses</b> the filmic world experiencing the perceived social issue. Oftentimes they will interact directly with social institutions meant to display the social problems.The typifying of these institutions is styled based on the overall ideological message of the film, either being portrayed as ineffective or idealized as a proper solution. These can be seen throughout the development of the social problem film and even into contemporary times as the form of the social problem film changed. Examples if this style of narrative are apparent within films such as The Soul of Youth in which the larger problem of delinquent children with no home is portrayed through the ineffectiveness of the orphanage the protagonist resides in juxtaposed with the idealized life of the family of the judge he eventually settles in with. Another instance that deserves to be mentioned comes once again from Wild Boys of the Road in which the film reaches its climax as the protagonists are being dealt with by a judge, bringing the larger social issue into an individualist lens by applying the solution of a nationwide problem to a few individual experiences.|$|R
