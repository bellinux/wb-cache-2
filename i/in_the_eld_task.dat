40|$|Abstract. There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in articial neural networks (ANNs) based on quantum theoretical concepts and techniques due to cognitive science and computer science aspects. The so called Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) is an exciting area of research <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> of quantum computation and quantum information. However, a key question about QNNs is what such an architecture will look like as an implementation on quantum hardware. To look for an {{answer to this question}} we rstly review some basic concepts in ANNs and emphasize their inherent non-linearity. Next, we analyze the main algorithms and architecture proposed <b>in</b> this <b>eld.</b> <b>The</b> main conclusion is that, up to now, there is no a complete solution for the implementation of QNNs. We found partial solution in models that deal with nonlinear effects <b>in</b> quantum computation. <b>The</b> Dissipative Gate (D-Gate) and the Quantum Dot Neural Network are <b>the</b> focused models <b>in</b> this <b>eld.</b> <b>The</b> former is a theoretical one while the later is a device composed by a quantum dot molecule coupled to its environment and subject to a time-varying external eld. A discretized version of the Feynman path integral formulation for this system can be put into a form that resembles a classical neural network.
