5|$|Andretti <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> race, and {{occasionally}} win, in the USAC National Championship {{during his time}} in the Formula One world championship. In 1979 a new organization, Championship Auto Racing Teams, had set up the Indycar world series as a rival to the USAC National Championships that Andretti had won three times in the 1960s. The new series had rapidly become the top open wheel racing series in North America.|$|E

Scientists <b>have</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> elucidate {{the secrets of}} Koshihikari’s genome. Farmers <b>have</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> provide delicious rice, including both Koshihikari and cultivars with different characteristics that {{meet the demands of}} consumers. Such sincere and large-scale efforts will <b>continue,</b> leading <b>to</b> sustainable rice production in Japan’s paddy fields.|$|R

5|$|Benchley <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> receive {{positive}} {{responses from}} his performing, and in 1925 he accepted a standing invitation from film producer Jesse L. Lasky for a six-week term writing screenplays at $500. While the session did not yield significant results, Benchley did get writing credit for producing the title {{cards on the}} Raymond Griffith silent film You'd Be Surprised (released September 1926), and was invited to do some titling for two other films.|$|E
5|$|In {{between his}} various duties and responsibilities, Nansen <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> take skiing {{holidays}} when he could. In February 1930, aged 68, {{he took a}} short break in the mountains with two old friends, who noted that Nansen was slower than usual and appeared to tire easily. On his return to Oslo he was laid up for several months, with influenza and later phlebitis, and was visited on his sickbed by King Haakon VII.|$|E
5|$|Morris <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> devote {{much time}} to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy {{published}} Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E

5|$|Through 7 August, American troops <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> press south near Vire, on {{the right}} flank of the German attack. The 116th Panzer Division—which was {{supposed}} to advance in this sector—was actually driven back. In the afternoon, the 1st SS and 116th Panzer Divisions made renewed attacks, but the flanks of the Mortain positions had been sealed off, allowing the American VII Corps to contain the German advance.|$|E
5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent {{out from behind}} the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|After Malky MacDonald {{took charge}} of two games on a {{caretaker}} basis, Bobby Brown was appointed manager. Brown was the first Scotland manager to be given full control of the team, as until then the SFA selection committee <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> choose the players. Scotland achieved {{one of their most}} famous victories in his first game in charge, a 3–2 win against 1966 World Cup winners England at Wembley. The team generally performed well under Brown, but were drawn with West Germany in 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification. Scotland needed to avoid defeat in Hamburg to keep their qualification hopes alive, but lost 3–2.|$|E

5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} unsure of what Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 20 September, the Eighth Ottoman Army {{had been}} pushed {{back out of the}} coastal Plain of Sharon and the Desert Mounted Corps was {{blocking}} the Seventh and what remained of the Eighth Armies' main lines of retreat northwards. The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E
5|$|Clwyd County Council and its six districts ceased {{operations}} at midnight on 1 April 1996, {{and local government}} was immediately transferred to the new principal areas of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. However, although bearing the same names, the boundaries of Flintshire and Denbighshire were substantially {{different from those of}} the earlier counties. As it happened, the county records for historic Flintshire had been retained at the Hawarden branch of the Clwyd Records Office while those for historic Denbighshire <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> be held at the Ruthin branch, so there was no problem in segregating the records.|$|E

Hichens had also taken up offshore yacht racing {{and was a member}} of the Royal Ocean Racing Club, competed three times in the Fastnet race, and crewed in the Channel race in June 1939.|$|E
5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> block the pass were surrounded and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the impact}} was {{far greater than}} anyone on the Allied side realised, and the ramifications went far beyond New Guinea. Imperial General Headquarters had {{regarded}} the defeats in the Guadalcanal Campaign and Battle of Buna–Gona as setbacks only, and <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> plan offensives in the South West Pacific. Now it concluded that the Japanese position was over-extended. A new defensive line was drawn running through Western New Guinea, the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands. Henceforth, positions beyond that line would be held as an outpost line. General Imamura was now charged not with winning a decisive victory, but only with holding on {{as long as possible}} so as to delay the Allied advance.|$|E

5|$|Hugh {{was elected}} to the see of Lincoln about 14 April 1209, after a papal command to the cathedral chapter to elect a new bishop, as Lincoln had again been without a bishop since 1206. During the summer of 1209, Hugh, along with his brother, was one of the councilors of King John urging the king to settle with Pope Innocent III before the pope excommunicated the king. However, {{negotiations}} with papal representatives got nowhere, and the king was excommunicated on 8 November 1209. Hugh and his brother Jocelin <b>had</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> support King John until this, two years after many of their fellow bishops had deserted the king, but by late in the year, Hugh left the king's service and went into exile.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading.

At the same time that he was choreographing The Band Wagon he was staging dances for Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Can-Can.
