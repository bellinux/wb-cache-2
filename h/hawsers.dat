25|$|The {{automatic}} {{towing machine}} {{also includes a}} Series400 traction winch {{that can be used}} with synthetic line towing <b>hawsers</b> up to 14inches in circumference. The winch has automatic payout but only manual recovery.|$|E
25|$|Mooring {{lines and}} <b>hawsers</b> {{may also be}} made by {{combining}} wire rope and synthetic line. Such lines are more elastic and easier to handle than wire rope, {{but they are not}} as elastic as pure synthetic line. Special safety precautions must be followed when constructing a combination mooring line.|$|E
25|$|As the {{hurricane}} lessened and the seas became a little calmer, {{the crew was}} able to get a sail under Centaur, and use her <b>hawsers</b> to lash it to her, much reducing the leaks and bracing her shattered frame. To help keep Centaur afloat, the crew also threw all but a dozen or so guns overboard. The 74-gun third rate HMS Eagle was then able to tow Centaur into Halifax. There Commissioner John Inglefield, who had been captain of the previous Centaur when she foundered after the Atlantic hurricane of 16–17 September 1782, greeted her.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hawser</b> cutter: The <b>hawser</b> cutter {{is used to}} cut the <b>hawser</b> {{near the}} ship after the last victim is rescued. The cutter rides along the <b>hawser</b> and is pulled back and forth by the surfmen pulling on the whip line. The blades are {{carefully}} angled so that the <b>hawser</b> cutter moves freely along the <b>hawser</b> when being pulled seaward, but slices the <b>hawser</b> in two when pulled toward the shore.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hawser</b> and {{traveling}} block: The <b>hawser</b> {{is the work}} horse of all the lines. It is a thick, strong rope made from manila with a traveling block attached. This block travels along the <b>hawser</b> and carries the breeches buoy {{back and forth from}} the vessel by means of the whip.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hawser</b> {{arrangement}} usually {{consist of}} nylon rope, which is shackled to an integrated mooring uni-joint on the buoy deck. At the tanker {{end of the}} <b>hawser,</b> a chafe chain is connected to prevent damage from the tanker fairlead. A load pin {{can be applied to}} the mooring uni-joint on the buoy deck to measure <b>hawser</b> loads.|$|R
25|$|Preparation for the patrols {{began in}} November, {{with all the}} ship's equipment, {{including}} masts, sails, rigging, boats, tackle, steering gear, pumps etc. being carefully inspected and repaired or renewed where necessary. New towing <b>hawsers</b> and heaving lines would also be procured. The ship would additionally be fitted over the cutwater with an iron, V-shaped icebreaker 3/8 of an inch thick and extending 18inches {{above and below the}} waterline, secured by a number of heavy chains. Officers would discard their normal uniforms in preference for reefer jackets, fur cap and gloves.|$|E
25|$|One of Gan Ning's {{servants}} committed {{an offence}} and {{was afraid of}} being punished so he sought shelter under Lü Meng. Lü Meng feared that Gan Ning would kill the servant so he did not send the servant away. Later, when Gan Ning visited Lü Meng's house and brought along gifts for the latter's mother, Lü brought the servant out to meet Gan, and Gan promised to spare the servant. However, Gan Ning reneged on his word later as he tied the servant to a tree and personally killed him by firing arrows at him. After that, {{he went back to}} his boat and ordered his men to lengthen the <b>hawsers</b> while he undressed and rested inside the cabin.|$|E
25|$|Before Ariel {{had even}} crossed {{the bar of}} the Min River, Captain Keay had the crew working on the fore and aft trim of the ship, a process that {{continued}} for over two weeks. Adjustments were needed later in the voyage as stores and water were used. The loaded draft of 18 feet 8 inches forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft was eventually altered to 18 feet 1 inch forward and 18 feet 3 inches aft by moving some of the cargo into the after cabin, and generally moving aft any heavy movable material such as <b>hawsers,</b> casks of salt pork, and spare spars. This improved the steering and general sailing performance. Adjusting the trim went on against the continual background of sail trimming, setting and taking in sails, maintenance work and repairs.|$|E

On receiving the <b>hawser</b> the crew discover another tally attached to it, and read:-- ...|$|R
2500|$|The Grasp's caprail is curved to {{fairlead}} {{and prevent}} chafing of the towing <b>hawser.</b> It includes two vertical stern rollers to tend the towing <b>hawser</b> directly aft and two Norman pin rollers {{to prevent the}} towing <b>hawser</b> from sweeping forward of the beam {{at the point of}} tow. The stern rollers and Norman pins are raised hydraulically and can withstand a lateral force of [...] at mid barrel.|$|R

25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire <b>hawsers</b> attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of the water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
500|$|Stenhouse first {{attempted}} to anchor the ship {{on the north}} side of Glacier Tongue itself. Disaster was only narrowly avoided when a change in the wind direction threatened to imprison Aurora between the Tongue and the advancing pack ice. With other options considered and rejected, Stenhouse finally decided to anchor at Cape Evans, site of Captain Scott's 1911 Terra Nova headquarters, some six nautical miles (11km) north of Glacier Tongue. On 14 March, after numerous failed attempts, Stenhouse manoeuvred Aurora into position, stern-first towards the shore at Cape Evans, where two large anchors had been sunk and cemented into the ground. Cables and <b>hawsers,</b> together with a heavy chain, attached these to the ship's stern. Two bower anchors were also dropped. By 14 March the ship was settling into the shore ice with, according to second officer Leslie Thompson, [...] "enough <b>hawsers</b> and anchors to hold a battleship".|$|E
500|$|The Germans had erected three iron <b>hawsers</b> {{across the}} valley to prevent low flying bombing raids but on the ground most of their defences were {{positioned}} to prevent an assault from the ridge above the plant, the direction from which they believed an attack was most likely. [...] Minefields and booby traps predominantly protected {{this side of the}} plant, but there were also searchlights on the roof and a machine gun nest near the entrance. [...] A single bridge crossed the steep gorge in front of the plant, but was normally only protected by two guards. [...] There were 300,000 German troops in Norway at this time and reinforcements could quickly be called into the area, which would complicate the commandos' escape to the Swedish border.|$|E
5000|$|Crotch pole: The crotch pole {{is used to}} {{keep the}} victims and {{equipment}} traveling along the <b>hawser</b> above the crashing surf. It consists of two boards approximately 8 ft long fashioned together similar {{to a pair of}} scissors. Once tension is placed on the <b>hawser</b> by means of the surfman pulling on the fall the Keeper will give the command to raise the crotch pole in position. Now the <b>hawser</b> is high above the surf and is ready to transport equipment.|$|R
60|$|This {{decided the}} pirates, {{and in a}} short time the end of a <b>hawser</b> was tied to one of the thwarts of the boat. The boat was then hauled back to L’Agile, and when the cable was got on board it was knotted to their own strongest <b>hawser.</b>|$|R

500|$|When Mackintosh {{departed}} on 25 January 1915 to {{lead the}} depot-laying parties he left the Aurora {{under the command of}} First Officer Joseph Stenhouse. The priority task for Stenhouse was to find a winter anchorage in accordance with Shackleton's instructions not to attempt to anchor south of the Glacier Tongue, an icy protrusion [...] midway between Cape Evans and Hut Point. This search proved a long and hazardous process. [...] Stenhouse manoeuvred in the Sound for several weeks before eventually deciding to winter close to the Cape Evans shore headquarters. [...] After a final visit to Hut Point on 11 March to pick up four early returners from the depot-laying parties, he brought the ship to Cape Evans and made it fast with anchors and <b>hawsers,</b> thereafter allowing it to become frozen into the shore ice.|$|E
500|$|At about 9 p.m. on 6 May, {{during a}} fierce storm, the men aboard heard two [...] "explosive reports" [...] {{as the main}} <b>hawsers</b> parted from the anchors. The {{combined}} forces {{of the wind and}} the rapidly moving ice had torn Aurora from its berth and, encased in a large ice floe, the ship was adrift in the Sound. Stenhouse ordered that steam be raised in the hopes that, under engine power, Aurora might be able to work back to the shore when the gale abated, but the engines had been partly dismantled for winter repairs, and could not be started immediately. In any event the [...] engine and single-screw propeller lacked the required power. Slowly, the ship drifted further from the shore; the noise of the storm meant that the scientific party ashore at Cape Evans hut heard nothing; it would be morning before they found the ship had gone.|$|E
