Kurtz, (706) 542 - 7140 UGA LAW SCHOOL 2 ̆ 7 S SIBLEY LECTURE EXAMINES POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING AND THE CONSTITUTION ATHENS, Ga. [...] An {{onslaught of}} {{negative}} advertisements, vicious mudslinging in stump speeches, increasingly aggressive tactics [...] {{as the nation}} 2 ̆ 7 s presidential primaries move into full swing, our TVs are bombarded with such daily examples of modern American politics. But is this what {{the framers of the}} U. S. Constitution envisioned when they established elections in order to hold public officials accountable to the people? Or is it the antithesis? Samuel Issacharoff, a constitutional and voting law expert from Columbia University, will examine that timely topic in the University of Georgia School of Law 2 ̆ 7 s 91 st Sibley Lecture, to be held Thursday, March 16 at 4 p. m. in the law school 2 ̆ 7 s Hatton Lovejoy Courtroom. Issacharoff 2 ̆ 7 s lecture, 2 ̆ 2 Political Parties, the Constitution and Democratic Competition, 2 ̆ 2 and the reception which follows {{are open to the public}} without an admission charge. 2 ̆ 2 The American Constitution presumes accountability for public officials through democratic elections, but oddly says nothing about how those shall occur, 2 ̆ 2 says Issacharoff. 2 ̆ 2 The original constitutional framework also presumed that political parties were an evil to be avoided at all cost. By contrast, 20 th century constitutions give extraordinary attention both to how elections will be conducted and to the role of parties as integral actors in the democratic process. Much of the 20 th century constitutional jurisprudence governing the political process may be seen as an effort to fill in these major gaps in the original constitutional design. 2 ̆ 2 Issacharoff will present his theory that the constitution must be understood as carrying a guarantee of effective competition in the political system. He will address the issue in the context of the challenge to the California blanket primary requirement currently before the U. S. Supreme Court in Jones v. California Democratic Party. Issacharoff teaches constitutional law, voting rights and redistricting law, complex litigation, legal process, civil procedure and employment law at Columbia. He currently is teaching a course called 2 ̆ 2 Civil Procedure and Advanced Constitutional Law: The Political Process, 2 ̆ 2 and in November 1999 organized a symposium on 2 ̆ 2 The Law Governing Political Parties. 2 ̆ 2 Issacharoff earned his law degree from Yale University, where he served as editor of the Yale Law Journal. After completion of a federal judicial clerkship, he practiced federal court litigation until 1989 (also teaching as a visiting lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania from 1986 - 89). He joined the faculty of the University of Texas School of Law in 1989 and held the Joseph D. Jamail Centennial Chair in Law before joining the Columbia Law School faculty in 1999. 2 ̆ 2 We are excited about the prospect of such a well-recognized legal expert <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> present his views on this extraordinarily important and timely topic, 2 ̆ 2 said Paul Kurtz, associate dean of the UGA law school. 2 ̆ 2 Sam Issacharoff continues in the proud tradition of the Sibley Lecture series. 2 ̆ 2 The Sibley Lecture Series, established in 1964 by the Charles Loridans Foundation of Atlanta, is designed to attract outstanding legal scholars of national prominence to the law school. It honors the late John A. Sibley, a 1911 law school graduate who served for many years as chair of the board of the Trust Company of Georgia. ## A photograph of Samuel Issacharoff is available electronically via UGA Communications 2 ̆ 7 Photographic Services Web Site at [URL] You will need to search for Issacharoff by name...|$|E

40|$|Osgoode Hall Law School of York University today {{announced}} {{the appointment of}} two award-winning journalists in its inaugural Journalist in Residence Program that will get underway this fall. Gail J. Cohen, former Editor-in-Chief of Thomson Reuters-owned Canadian Lawyer magazine and its family of publications, and Roxana Olivera, a Canadian investigative journalist of Peruvian heritage, will each spend time during the 2017 - 18 academic year pursuing journalistic projects that will engage the Osgoode community, involve law students and enrich our understanding of law and its impact. “We received stellar applications from talented journalists for these two positions,” said Osgoode Dean Lorne Sossin. “We’re delighted that Gail Cohen and Roxana Olivera will be <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> explore stories about justice {{and the impact of}} law in our society and in our world. ” Osgoode’s Journalist in Residence program is designed to encourage journalistic projects focused on interpreting legal history, examining law’s realities today, and imagining law’s future. The Journalist in Residence Program is funded in part from Osgoode’s Fund for Innovation in Law 2 ̆ 6 Media (FILM), made possible by a gift from alumna Kathryn Podrebarac, and the Art Vertleib Q. C. Fund. Both funds are dedicated to exploring the intersection of law, media and journalism. Cohen was Editor-in-Chief of Canadian Lawyer, Canadian Lawyer 4 Students, Law Times, Canadian Lawyer InHouse and Legal Feeds blog from 2006 to 2016 as well as FindLaw. ca from 2012 to 2016. She is currently a media and communications consultant and is working with the Canadian Civil Liberties Association as its Director, Media and Communications. Among the projects she plans to pursue while at Osgoode, she will examine the impact of landmark rights and equality cases involving the LGBTQ community from the litigant’s perspective {{as well as on the}} legal landscape in Canada. “I’m looking forward to having the time and resources to focus on a project that I am passionate about as well as being able to take my years of experience running the largest group of legal periodicals in Canada to help amplify to the public the great work happening at Osgoode,” Cohen said. She also looks forward to working with students, staff and faculty on the role media can play in legal advocacy. An exceptional writer and editor, Cohen has received a long list of awards over the past 20 years including a Canadian Association of Journalists/Canadian International Development Agency fellowship in 2003 to cover the International War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda. Olivera’s passion for the rule of law, human rights and social justice informs her work, which has been published in English, Spanish and German. At Osgoode, she will be working on a project that will explore the boundaries of the law concerning child abuse and exploitation and the proliferation of offending material online in the digital age. “This appointment is for me a great opportunity to work alongside internationally renowned scholars on a project that aims to stir debate about change in national and global legislation regarding online child exploitation and how to better support and protect survivors,” Olivera said. Olivera’s reporting has appeared in digital, broadcast and print media. Her radio documentary, The Good Italian?, which she produced with Steve Wadhams, won a bronze medal at the New York Festival’s International Radio Program Awards for the World’s Best Radio Programs in 2014. Her feature, Standing Up to Big Gold, which was published in the United Church Observer, received an award of excellence from the Associated Church Press in Chicago in 2014. More recently, she formed part of the investigative team of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) that carried out an investigation – Evicted and Abandoned: The World Bank’s Broken Promise to the Poor – which received several awards, including the prestigious Al Neuharth Innovation in Investigative Journalism Award.
