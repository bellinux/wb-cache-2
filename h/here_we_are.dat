25|$|The {{only one}} who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by {{deepening}} the things which Cézanne wanted to do, {{but it was too}} hard a task for him: it killed him. And now <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what Cézanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.|$|E
25|$|The second first-person {{narration}} we {{have from}} Alhambra is altogether different from the first – <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not offered her history, but rather a history of 20th century cinema – a past which she seems to adopt as her own, {{as if she were}} each of the characters in those films. “The Middle” deals, again, with each of the family members’ experiences of Amber: she throws Astrid’s camera off a bridge into the road, she seduces Magnus, and reveals flaws in Eve and Michael’s relationship. “The Middle” ends with Eve throwing Amber out of their holiday home.|$|E

25|$|My dear friend, {{what is this}} our life?

Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.|$|E
25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
500|$|Between January 9 and 11, 1969, {{the band}} {{performed}} at the Fillmore West as a farewell to the group's most famous lineup, with Jack Casady of Jefferson Airplane standing in as the bass player. The band was joined by Jerry Garcia, Jorma Kaukonen, Steve Miller, and Mickey Hart for the 38-minute finale, [...] "Donavan's Reef Jam". Recordings from the concerts were later assembled on the live album Live! Fillmore West 1969, released on March 12, 1996. Hirsh and Cohen left soon after recording the group's next album, <b>Here</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Again, and a new lineup was configured with Casady and David Getz, who formerly played drums with Big Brother and the Holding Company. The group released <b>Here</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> Again {{in the spring of}} 1969. [...] It charted at number 48, and saw Country Joe and the Fish moving to a pop-oriented approach. Country Joe and the Fish's personnel remained relatively stable for the next six months, though Peter S. Albin, also an alumnus of Big Brother and the Holding Company, replaced Casady at bass.|$|E

500|$|Bloc Party's {{critically}} acclaimed debut album Silent Alarm charted in 18 countries on four continents {{by the end}} of April 2005. The Japanese edition included three bonus songs which later appeared on Silent Alarm Remixed: [...] "So <b>Here</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> (Four Tet Remix)", [...] "Plans (Mogwai Remix)", and [...] "Pioneers (M83 Remix)". The US double LP version contained another two tracks which later formed part of the track list: [...] "Positive Tension (Jason Clark Remix)" [...] and [...] "Price of Gas (Automato Remix)". During the month of May, other musical acts were asked to remix the rest of the songs from the band's work. Frontman Kele Okereke has stated that the decision was taken because the band members wanted to show that dance music was significant to them as a rock quartet.|$|E
500|$|Uncharacteristically, Rosas {{remained}} passive {{throughout the}} conflict. The Argentine ruler lost heart once {{he realized that}} he had fallen into a trap. Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: [...] "There is no other way; we have to play for the high stakes and go for everything. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and from here there is no retreat." [...] After an unsuccessful battle against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires. Once there, he disguised himself and boarded a ship that took him to Britain to live in exile. Embittered, he remarked: [...] "It is not the people who have overthrown me. It is the monkeys, the Brazilians." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{discovering}} and journeying through {{islands of}} different characteristics, the tribe, {{with the help}} of The Breath, have overcome numerous natural disasters including tsunami and volcanic eruption. The tribe follows the path of The Ancients, yet their lands are nowhere to be found. By the last island, the players are given the chance to place the totem around the island and create and form their own island. After placing the final totem, the tribe reaches the place for the final ritual. After the ritual is completed, the entire island collapses and reshapes and sinks into the sea, leaving only the passageway above sea level. After the tribespeople pass the gateway, they realize that they have returned to the first island where they began their journey. The story ends with the narrator saying [...] "And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> as on the first day." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{learning}} of the revolt, the Viscount of Ouro Preto and the other Cabinet ministers went to Army Headquarters, located at the Field of Santana {{in the heart of}} the capital. The supposedly loyal troops there outnumbered and were better equipped than the rebel force. The adjutant-general (Commander) of the Army, Field Marshal Floriano Peixoto guaranteed his men's loyalty to Ouro Preto, but he was secretly in alliance with the rebels. Floriano and the Minister of the War Rufino Enéias, Viscount of Maracajú (a cousin of Deodoro) ignored repeated orders from Ouro Preto to attack the rebels who were approaching the headquarters. He tried to convince them, recalling the acts of bravery by the Brazilian military in the Paraguayan War. But Floriano replied to him that, [...] "in front of us there were enemies, and <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> all Brazilians", which finally brought him to a realization of how far the mutiny had spread among the officer corps.|$|E
500|$|During the 2000 season, Thome hit [...]269 with 37 {{home runs}} and 106 RBIs. On June 21, he hit his 20th home run of the year against the Chicago White Sox, marking the seventh {{consecutive}} season in which he hit 20 or more home runs. On September 29, while {{in the midst of}} a tight race for the AL Wild Card spot, Thome led the Indians to an 8–4 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays by hitting a two-run home run. After the game, Thome was quoted as saying, [...] "This team has battled all year, so this was nothing new. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> and we're here tomorrow to play another day." [...] Despite finishing with a record of 90–72, the Indians missed the playoffs. For the 2001 Indians' season, he finished second in the AL with 49 home runs. In addition, Thome had 124 RBIs and 111 walks. However, he led the league with 185 strikeouts. He and Juan González, who totaled 140 RBIs, powered the Indians to another division title. Despite these numbers, the Indians could once again only reach the AL Division Series, where they lost in five games to the Seattle Mariners.|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

500|$|Forty-four {{seconds after}} Moosally's order, Lieutenant Buch {{reported}} that Turret Two's right gun was loaded {{and ready to}} fire. Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, [...] "We have a problem <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> not ready yet. We have a problem here." [...] Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, [...] "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is having a little trouble. We'll straighten that out." [...] Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that {{the left and right}} guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, [...] "I'm not ready yet! I'm not ready yet!" [...] Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, [...] "Mort! Mort! Mort!" [...] Ziegler shouted, [...] "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" [...] At this time, Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer's booth {{in the rear of the}} turret into the center gun room and yelled at the crew to get the breech closed. About this same time, Hanyecz yelled over the phone circuit, [...] "Oh, my God! There's a flash!" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things our own way. Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to be able to say to the public: <b>HERE</b> <b>WE</b> <b>ARE</b> AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E

500|$|PewDiePie {{originally}} registered a YouTube account {{under the}} name [...] "Pewdie"; he explains that [...] "pew" [...] represents the sound of lasers and [...] "die" [...] means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the [...] "PewDiePie" [...] YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. It was just something I loved to do. And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios.|$|E
