5|$|Before {{the reign}} of terror reached its climax, Forster died after a rheumatic illness in <b>his</b> <b>small</b> attic {{apartment}} at Rue des Moulins in Paris in January 1794, {{at the age of}} thirty-nine. At the time, he was making plans to visit India.|$|E
5|$|Farther south, Tyrion and <b>his</b> <b>small</b> retinue stop {{to spend}} the night at the Inn at the Crossroads. There he recognizes Lady Catelyn Stark in disguise.

5|$|Hitler {{was very}} fond of Magda Goebbels and the children. He enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax. Magda had a close {{relationship}} with Hitler, and became a member of <b>his</b> <b>small</b> coterie of female friends. She also became an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} to Earth, a bearing at the Guam {{tracking}} station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use <b>his</b> <b>small</b> hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease. Greg later was thanked by Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Paul Schlesselman is of German {{descent and}} {{was a high school}} dropout raised by a single father in Helena–West Helena, Arkansas. He hated <b>his</b> <b>small</b> Delta region {{hometown}} because of its predominantly black population. He had never had any problems with the law prior to the alleged Obama plot. He had a strong affinity for drinking and smoking.|$|E
50|$|In the {{elections}} of 1980, Macon was the most Democratic county in the nation while in 1984 {{it was the most}} Democratic outside of the District of Columbia. Macon County was only 0.02 percent shy of this in 1992, when it gave both George Bush senior <b>his</b> <b>smallest</b> proportion outside of the District of Columbia and independent Ross Perot <b>his</b> <b>smallest</b> vote share in any county nationwide.|$|R

5|$|The {{moment he}} starts to speak, not at the lectern, but walking around it on cat's paws, he is simply enchanting. In the Middle Ages, this man would have been sent into exile. He is not only eloquent, he also keeps his {{listeners}} spellbound by his sparking personality, reflected in <b>his</b> <b>small,</b> dark eyes.|$|E
5|$|Though his {{finances}} remained shaky, and {{his attempts}} at various business enterprises were unsuccessful, Rush continued {{to the end}} of his life to be interested and involved in the sport of rowing and sculling, organising carnivals and umpiring important matches. Rush died on <b>his</b> <b>small</b> farm in Hurstville, in December 1922.|$|E

5|$|Akins {{began playing}} high school {{football}} at Starkville High School as a freshman. Due to <b>his</b> <b>small</b> size, Akins rarely played. As a senior, he was ruled ineligible for academic reasons but continued practicing with the football team throughout the season. Akins was also able to participate on the track and field team, running sprints. After Akins impressed his {{high school football}} coach by practicing despite his ineligibility, the coach invited East Mississippi Community College to look at Akins. A representative of East Mississippi attended a track and field meet where Akins won the 100 metres and offered him a scholarship to play college football shortly afterward.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Confederates would march on Gettysburg {{from the west}} {{on the morning of}} July 1, Buford laid out his {{defenses}} on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by <b>his</b> <b>small</b> cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.|$|E
5|$|As a {{prominent}} figure in Portland he continually worked {{to raise funds}} for the library he supported. He would also rely on financial help from his associates in order to supplement <b>his</b> <b>small</b> salary as a federal judge. This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with what was expected of prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

5|$|At 1.15 pm, Parker {{was waiting}} outside the harbour with the reserve {{and raised a}} signal {{ordering}} Nelson to withdraw. Nelson acknowledged the signal but ignored it, while Nelson's second in command, Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves, repeated the signal but too did not obey it. Riou now {{found himself in a}} difficult position. Too junior an officer to risk disobeying a direct order, he remained in action for a further half an hour before reluctantly giving the order for <b>his</b> <b>small</b> squadron to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite <b>his</b> <b>small</b> size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15–3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|But the {{agreement}} broke down a month later. In late June, the defeated king and <b>his</b> <b>small</b> retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan. But on 1 July 1287, {{the king was}} captured en route and assassinated by his second son Thihathu, the Viceroy of Prome. Anarchy ensued. Each region in the country which had not revolted broke away. No successor to Narathihapate, who could honor and enforce {{the terms of the}} treaty of Beijing, emerged. Indeed, a king would not emerge until May 1289.|$|E

5|$|Carpenter, in {{this fight}} with others of <b>his</b> <b>small</b> {{regiment}} at Fairfield, stood against two of the crack brigades of Stuart's cavalry. The 6th Cavalry's stand {{was considered one of}} the most gallant in its history and helped influence the outcome the battles being fought around Gettysburg. While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut to pieces, it fought so well that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops. The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force. Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand, the two brigades of Virginians could have caused serious problems to the Union rear areas.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960–61 season, Crozier {{spent the}} {{majority}} of his time in the OHA-Jr. Due to <b>his</b> <b>small</b> frame and size, Crozier was not a favourite with either scouts or critics. Despite this, the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL) recruited Crozier to fill in for their injured starting goaltender, Denis DeJordy that same season. Appearing in three games, Crozier recorded two wins and a 2.31 goals against average (GAA). Crozier returned as the starting goaltender for the Teepees for the 1961–62 season. He also had short stints with the Sault Ste. Marie Thunderbirds of the Eastern Professional Hockey League (EPHL), and the Bisons.|$|E
5|$|During the 5th century, one of {{the last}} Emperors of the Western Roman Empire, Julius Nepos, ruled <b>his</b> <b>small</b> empire from the palace. The period ends with Avar and Croat invasions {{in the first half of}} the 7th century and {{destruction}} of almost all Roman towns. Roman survivors retreated to more favourable sites on the coast, islands and mountains. The city of Dubrovnik was founded by such survivors from Epidaurum.|$|E
