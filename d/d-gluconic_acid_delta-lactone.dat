40|$|Abstract only availableThe {{effects of}} β-glucosidase {{inhibitor}} <b>D-Gluconic</b> <b>acid</b> δ-lactone were measured under water deficit and well watered conditions in maize. Kinematic analysis had previously shown root growth maintenance in the apical 3 mm of seedlings under water deficits (Zhu, et al., 2006). Distinct region-specific responses of cell wall proteins to water stress were analyzed and showed up-regulation of β-glucosidase. ß-glucosidase, a common hydrolase, {{has been found}} to cleave inactive ABA-conjugates in barley leaves, hence freeing ABA to its biologically active state (Dietz et al., 2000). Furthermore, Sauter and Hartung (2000) found that when lateral water flow increased in root systems, the ABA-conjugate concentration in the xylem decreased while the ABA concentration increased. This implies that something in the medium caused cleavage of the ABA-conjugate. The medium used to perform this experiment contained ß-glucosidases. <b>D-Gluconic</b> <b>acid</b> δ-lactone {{has been used as a}} ß-glucosidase inhibitor in maize coleoptiles (Jabben, et al., 2006).

The productivity of the strain was also remarkable at low pH, producing 146 gL− 1 d-xylonate at 1. 2 gL− 1 h− 1 at pH 3. 0. This is the best low pH production reported for d-xylonate. These results encourage further development towards industrial scale production...|$|R
40|$|Alginate/hydroxyapatite {{composite}} scaffolds {{were developed}} using a novel production design. Hydroxyapatite (HAp) {{was incorporated into}} an alginate solution and internal gelling was induced by addition of slowly <b>acid</b> hydrolyzing <b>D-gluconic</b> <b>acid</b> δ-lactone (GDL) for the direct release of calcium ions from HAp. Hydrogels were then freeze-casted to produce a three-dimensional isotropic porous network. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and microcomputed tomography (μ-CT) analysis of the scaffolds showed an optimal interconnected porous structure with pore sizes ranging between 100 and 300 μm and over 88 % porosity. Proliferation assay and SEM observations demonstrated that human osteosarcoma cell lines were able to proliferate, maintain osteoblast-like phenotype and massively colonize the scaffold structure. Overall, these combined {{results indicate that the}} novel alginate based composites efficiently support the adhesion and proliferation of cells showing at the same time adequate structural and physical-chemical properties for being used as scaffolds in bone tissue engineering strategies...|$|R
40|$|D-glucono- 1, 5 -lactone {{differs from}} D-glucopyranose {{only in that}} it has a C=O group instead of CHOH group at carbon atom number one. The {{molecule}} therefore possesses an intact 3, 4 a-glycol group and is sweet. However, it autohydrolyses in water solution at room temperature, forming <b>D-gluconic</b> <b>acid</b> and D-glucono- 1, 4 -lactone. As the solution pH falls it becomes sweet-sour and eventually almost completely sour as the generated hydronium ions dominate both the solution properties and the taste perceptions elicited. It is shown that the ratio of generated hydronium ions to unchanged lactone accords with anticipated taste quality during the first 28 min of autohydrolysis. Changes in both apparent specific volume and apparent isentropic compressibility illustrate increasing solute-solvent interaction and increasing disturbance of water structure during the course of autohydrolysis. These changes are consistent with the concurrent sweet to sour change, but do not explain the weak bitterness which als...|$|R
40|$|Sorbents {{for high}} {{temperature}} CO capture are under intensive development owing to their potential applications in advanced zero emission power, sorption-enhanced {{steam methane reforming}} for hydrogen production and energy storage systems in chemical heat pumps. One of the challenges in the development is the prevention of sintering of the sorbent (normally a calcium oxide derivative) which causes the CO capture capacity of the material to deteriorate rapidly after a few cycles of utilization. Here we show that a simple wet mixing method can produce sintering-resistant sorbents from calcium and magnesium salts of <b>d-gluconic</b> <b>acid.</b> It was found that calcium oxide was well distributed in the sorbents with metal oxide nanoparticles on the surface acting as physical barriers, and the CO capture capacity of the sorbents was largely maintained over multiple cycles of utilization. This method was also applied to other organometallic salts of calcium and magnesium/aluminum and the produced sorbents showed similarly high reversibility...|$|R
