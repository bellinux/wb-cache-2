40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we tested the}} automatic-effortful {{processing}} assumption of the Grouping Model. According to the Grouping Model, left±right cues are pull cues and inner±outer cues are push cues, evoking exogenous and endogenous control, respectively. In a series of four experiments we manipulated {{the characteristics of the}} cues: Onset vs. no-onset cues, spatial vs. symbolic cues, valid vs. invalid cues. The results consistently showed a dissociation between left±right and inner±outer cues. Together, the present findings provide converging evidence for the notion that left±right cues induce a <b>fast,</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> of the cued responses, whereas inner±outer cues need slower, effortful processes to establish a selective preparatory set. Forewarning people about upcoming events and impending actions generally improves performance. The preparatory processes underlying this performance enhancement have been studied in precuing paradigms, with precues providing advance information about some �or all) aspects of the upcoming stimulus and its associated response. In the so-called response-cueing paradigm developed by Miller � 1982) Ðwho adapted Rosenbaum's � 1980, 1983) movement precueing techniqueÐspatial cues provide information about which fingers to use for responding. In particular, participants are forewarned about the location of an upcoming response or, more precisely, about a particular subset of possibl...|$|E

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>selection</b> of key-shots is an {{important}} step for video data processing. Depending on the purpose, key-shot selection provides user feed back on recorded data, storage reduction and viewpoint selection and it can be used for panoramic image stitching and 3 D-reconstruction. In particular, investigating scenes of crime or accidental investigations involves large amount of data, containing information on physical arrangement of objects, details on surface geometry and appearances. This paper proposes an efficient method for <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> of key-shot, providing onsite feedback on recorded segments and <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> of view-points for 3 D-reconstruction. It uses appearance based object and scene modeling for a freely moving, hand held camera. The camera motion is determined on two levels, comparing appearances of local image regions and full 3 D reconstruction. On the lower level, the 2 D-warp between subsequent video frames is used to determine local change of image appearance and derive a set of motion key frames. These keyframes than are used to determine full 3 D motion and to reconstruct objects. Furthermore, key-frames are used for fast indexation and detection of loop closures. Examples for <b>automatic</b> key-frame <b>selection</b> are given for an re-enacted crime scene, and compared to manual selection...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT] An <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> {{method of}} {{reasonable}} training areas for supervised texture classification is proposed. This method {{is based on}} both the texture representation method using rotation invariant moments and the genetic algorithm (GA). In the proposed method, first, sets of candidates for each texture category are roughly given. The chromosomes for the GA are formed by the indexed candidates and their extent. The fitness function for the GA is obtained by the mixed texture model and quantified pure textures. In this paper, summary of the texture representation method and comparison of texture discrimination ability with the conventional Haralick 2 ̆ 7 s method are described. Furthermore, {{the details of the}} proposed <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> method are presented, and some simulation results are also shown...|$|R

40|$|Information {{divergence}} {{that measures}} {{the difference between}} two nonnegative matrices or tensors has found its use {{in a variety of}} machine learning problems. Examples are Nonnegative Matrix/Tensor Factorization, Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, topic models, and Bayesian network optimization. The success of such a learning task depends heavily on a suitable divergence. A large variety of divergences have been suggested and analyzed, but very few results are available for an objective choice of the optimal divergence for a given task. Here we present a framework that facilitates <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> of the best divergence among a given family, based on standard maximum likelihood estimation. We first propose an approximated Tweedie distribution for the beta-divergence family. Selecting the best beta then becomes a machine learning problem solved by maximum likelihood. Next, we reformulate alpha-divergence in terms of beta-divergence, which enables <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> of alpha by maximum likelihood with reuse of the learning principle for beta-divergence. Furthermore, we show the connections between gamma and beta-divergences as well as Rényi and alpha-divergences, such that our <b>automatic</b> <b>selection</b> framework is extended to non-separable divergences. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can quite accurately select information divergence across different learning problems and various divergence families.
