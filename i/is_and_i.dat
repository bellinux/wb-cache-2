En route there, Company B was {{assigned}} to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello. The Axis began their evacuation of Messina on 27 July. Although the 3rd Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment secured the port on 17 August, the Axis had already completed their evacuation hours before.

Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat, praised the choice, saying [...] " [...] led the country in the health care exchanges in the Affordable Care Act, knows firsthand about the success of the Affordable Care Act" [...] Other Democrats, however, felt it was a mistake, with Pennsylvania's Bob Brady saying, [...] "I don't know who the former governor of Kentucky <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't think anybody else does, either.

At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend Cesare De Sanctis [...] " [...] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music.

It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established {{that she would have}} an abortion in this circumstance." [...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang <b>is.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous.

500|$|A {{scientist}} {{studying the}} Kaiju. Day stated: [...] "Certainly myself and Burn Gorman provide {{a little bit}} of much needed levity, it's a break from the monsters and the guys fighting. But then the character gets thrust into the story in a way that his life is seriously at risk and it becomes a little more action oriented and a little more horror movie-esque. So, he kinda bounces back between being humorous and also being real… the rest of these guys, they look really good in their suits and they've got abs, they can kick and fight and punch. Newt is sort of the 'everyman' and he's flawed and he's arrogant." [...] Del Toro gave Geiszler the mentality of a celebrity chef, with tattoos and a [...] "big personality". According to the director, Day was cast based on his performance in an episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia: [...] "He comes out with a stick, and he has a monologue about what it is to hunt the rats in the basement. It was very funny, but he was coming from character. He was not doing big stuff, he was, like, really mourning and lamenting his job, you know, how inhuman it <b>is.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'This guy is great at shading and comedy.' There are moments in the movie where he delivers them both." [...] Trek Buccino portrays Geiszler as a child.|$|E
500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook. On his character, Garfield remarked that [...] "No one knows who Eduardo Saverin <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't either. Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because you feel {{a greater sense of}} responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film that might otherwise be without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and that just came out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E
