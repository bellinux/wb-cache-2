Boakes has said he prefers working on the Dark Fall games without a development team as [...] "the worlds of Dowerton and Fetch Rock are created from an informed imagination, using textures and sounds from the world around me. I think {{a little of that}} personality would be lost if tackled by a small team." [...] Of Lost Souls, he felt working alone helped him establish the game's atmosphere of isolation; [...] "working alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the Darkling Room {{is the best way to}} approach this game [...] It's an eerie, isolating experience." ...|$|E

50|$|Ghost nets are fishing nets {{that have}} been left or lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ocean by fishermen. These nets, often nearly {{invisible}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light,</b> can be left tangled on a rocky reef or drifting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open sea. They can entangle fish, dolphins, sea turtles, sharks, dugongs, crocodiles, seabirds, crabs, and other creatures, including the occasional human diver. Acting as designed, the nets restrict movement, causing starvation, laceration and infection, and suffocation in those that need {{to return to the}} surface to breathe.|$|R
50|$|The Bluespews {{live on the}} farthest, and coldest planet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> solar system. They are by far {{the most}} {{intelligent}} and arrogant of the three alien races. Bluespews have evolved several natural adaptations to survive on their frozen world: such as large eyes to see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> and webbed feet to help them keep their traction on the ice. Bluespew blood is highly acidic, and eventually burns the outer layers of their own skin into an armored exoskeleton. While they may fall prey to the Gangreens, the Dredrocks are no match for their acidic touch and are dissolved in minutes.|$|R

25|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is first mentioned in Red Mars; it takes off when Sax creates an alga {{to withstand the}} harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform <b>the</b> planet. <b>In</b> Green Mars, GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By Blue Mars, GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimmer</b> <b>light</b> of <b>the</b> outer planets.|$|R

50|$|The Werewolf of Dole, Gilles Garnier was a reclusive hermit {{living outside}} the town of Dole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Franche-Comté Province <b>in</b> France. He had {{recently}} been married and moved his new wife out to his isolated home. Being unaccustomed to feeding more than just himself he {{found it difficult to}} provide for his wife causing discontent between them. During this period several children went missing or were found dead and the authorities of the Franche-Comté province issued an edict encouraging and allowing the people to apprehend and kill the werewolf responsible. One evening a group of workers travelling from a neighbouring town came upon what they thought <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> to be a wolf but what some recognised as the hermit with the body of a dead child. Soon after Gilles Garnier was arrested.|$|R
40|$|Tapetum lucidum is the {{specially}} modifided, bio-reflecting tissue layer, {{which at}} most vertebrates covers the biggest {{part of the}} middle eye tunic, the chorioidea. Physiologically, the most important role of this layer is to reflect light which passes through the retina back to it, causing the secondary stimulation of <b>the</b> photoreceptors. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> ambient conditions when the pupil is dilated, reflected beams of the light create the visual effect of the “animals' eyes shining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark“, while exiting the eyes. The aims {{of this study are}} to define bio-reflecting and morphological charachteristics of <b>the</b> tapetum lucidum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dog and cow eyes. Because the tapetum lucidum is an adaptive structure of the eye on poorly illuminated environment, the results of our research indicate that the anatomy of the eye, particulary shape of the pupil, placement of the eyes on the animals' head, and diet, all affect the morphology and bio-reflecting characteristics of this structure. Key words: tapetum lucidum, eyeshine, morphology</p...|$|R
500|$|On November 12, in {{response}} to rumors that the French had sent out a raiding force, Forbes sent out a detachment of the Virginia regiment to investigate reports of a French raiding expedition. When sounds of gunfire reached the British camp, Forbes sent a second detachment. Primary sources are unclear on which detachment Washington led; the other was led by Lieutenant Colonel George Mercer. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimming</b> <b>light</b> of early evening and the haze of musket smoke the two detachments mistook {{each other for the}} enemy; the friendly fire incident resulted in 40 casualties. Washington claimed to have interceded, [...] "knocking up with his sword the presented pieces", but Captain Thomas Bullitt, the only other officer to leave an account, held Washington responsible for the incident, noting that his opinion was shared by [...] "several of the officers." [...] The incident appeared to leave an emotional scar on Washington, who did not speak or write of it for many years.|$|R

40|$|Humans have {{selectively}} bred {{and used}} dogs {{over a period}} of thousands of years, and more recently the dog has become an important model animal for studies in ethology, cognition and genetics. These broad interests warrant careful descriptions of the senses of dogs. Still there is little known about dog vision, especially what dogs can discriminate in different light conditions. We trained and tested whippets, pugs, and a Shetland sheepdog in a two-choice discrimination set-up and show that dogs can discriminate patterns with spatial frequencies between 5. 5 and 19. 5 cycle per degree (cpd) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bright light condition (43 cd m- 2). This is a higher spatial resolution than has been previously reported although <b>the</b> individual variation <b>in</b> our tests was large. Humans tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same set-up reached acuities corresponding to earlier studies, ranging between 32. 1 and 44. 2 cpd. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> condition (0. 0087 cd m- 2) the acuity of dogs ranged between 1. 8 and 3. 5 cpd while in humans, between 5. 9 and 9. 9 cpd. Thus, humans make visual discrimination of objects from roughly a threefold distance compared to dogs in both bright and <b>dim</b> <b>light...</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} intrepidity and gallantry <b>in</b> {{action at}} <b>the</b> risk {{of his life}} {{above and beyond the}} call of duty. First Lt. Miller, Infantry, Company A, was serving as a platoon leader at night when his company ambushed a hostile force infiltrating from Cambodian sanctuaries. After contact with the enemy was broken, 1st Lt. Miller led a reconnaissance patrol from their prepared positions through the early evening darkness and dense tropical growth to search the area for enemy casualties. As the group advanced they were suddenly attacked. First Lt. Miller was seriously wounded. However, the group fought back with telling effect on the hostile force. An enemy grenade was thrown into the midst of the friendly patrol group and all took cover except 1st Lt. Miller. who <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> located <b>the</b> grenade and threw himself on it, absorbing the force of the explosion with his body. His action saved nearby members of his patrol from almost certain serious injury.

50|$|Furthermore, {{though in}} his {{confession}} Clewes had admitted sheltering {{the man he}} knew had murdered Rev. Parker, he swore the death of Heming had happened without either his foreknowledge or consent. The mastermind of the conspiracy against Parker had been a Captain Evans of Church Farm, a retired army officer and local magistrate, who had since died. Clewes claimed that the day after Parker's murder Evans had told him he must allow Heming to hide in his barn, and after Clewes reluctantly consented, Evans then told him to meet up at the barn at 11 o'clock that night 'to do something with him (Heming) to send him off'. When Clewes arrived Evans entered the barn along with a local bad character, a farrier called James Taylor, who had with him a heavy club-like instrument known as a 'blood stick' normally used to let blood from horses. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> Evans called out 'Get up Heming I have got something for thee', and as Heming rose into a sitting position Taylor swung the blood stick, smashing his skull.

40|$|To make {{a smooth}} {{touchdown}} when landing, an insect {{must be able}} to reliably control its approach speed as well as its body and leg position – behaviors that are thought to be regulated primarily by visual information. Bumblebees forage and land under a broad range of light intensities and while their behavior during the final moments of landing has been described in detail in bright light, little is known about how this is affected by decreasing light intensity. Here, we investigate this by characterizing the performance of bumblebees, B. terrestris, landing on a flat platform at two different orientations (horizontal and vertical) and at four different light intensities (ranging from 600 lx down to 19 lx). As light intensity decreased, the bees modified their body position and the distance at which they extended their legs, suggesting that the control of landing in these insects is visually mediated. Nevertheless, the effect of light intensity was small and the landings were still well controlled, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>dimmest</b> <b>light.</b> We suggest that <b>the</b> changes <b>in</b> landing behavior that occurred in <b>dim</b> <b>light</b> might represent adaptations that allow the bees to perform smooth landings across the broad range of light intensities at which they are active...|$|R
