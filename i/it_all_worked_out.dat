500|$|The rating did {{not come}} without its share of controversy. Reginald Dennis {{described}} to the reaction that followed Minya Oh's review: [...] "I was happy, Jon was happy, Nas was happy, everybody was happy — except {{for all of the}} people who felt that The Chronic should have also gotten a 5." [...] Only two years prior, Dr. Dre's groundbreaking The Chronic failed to earn the coveted rating, despite redefining the musical landscape of hip hop. It was later revealed that while everybody at the magazine knew it was an instant classic, they decided to comply with the strict policy of staying away from a perfect rating. Subsequently, when Nas's album was exempted from this moratorium, many fans pointed to this decision as a confirmation of journalistic bias towards East Coast hip hop. Despite receiving criticism over his staff's earlier review of The Chronic, Reginald Dennis continues to defend the decision to award Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating: [...] "I’m just happy that Illmatic is universally acclaimed as a classic, so no one can accuse me of dropping the ball... And if I hadn’t gone through what I did with The Chronic, I wouldn’t have had the flexibility to allow for the bending of my policy. So I think <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> well.” ...|$|E

He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, [...] "It {{takes a long time}} for an idea to strike. Then I {{have to think about it}} for a long time. I don't start painting until I have <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as [...] "sad face of woman unlit", [...] "electric light from ceiling", and [...] "thighs cooler".|$|E

60|$|She {{wondered}} if she ought {{to appear before the}} board in uniform. Her nurse's dresses were packed in her trunk at Mrs. Slaney's, in Woodhouse. It was now May. The whole business at Woodhouse was finished. Manchester House and all the furniture was sold to some boot-and-shoe people: at least the boot-and-shoe people had the house. They had given four thousand pounds for it--which was above the lawyer's estimate. On the other hand, the theatre was sold for almost nothing. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> that some thirty-three pounds, which the creditors made up to fifty pounds, remained for Alvina. She insisted on Miss Pinnegar's having half of this. And so that was all over. Miss Pinnegar was already in Tamworth, and her little shop would be opened next week.

50|$|Diligence, in Christianity, is {{the effort}} to do one's part, while keeping faith and {{reliance}} in God. In other words, diligence and faith are two sides of a mystery.

He had dined at the mess, and the officers had told him how quickly they could take the field. They had shown him the water-tanks and the food beside each beast, and he had admired the completeness of the arrangements, with little thought as to what it might mean to him in the future. It would be at least an hour before they would all get started again from their present halting-place. That would be a clear hour gained. Perhaps by next morning---- ...|$|E
