5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
25|$|After {{three days}} of trial, the {{prosecutor}} concluded his closing argument urging <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> convict Hans Reiser for murdering his wife. In his closing argument, Reiser's attorney, William Du Bois, urged the jury to consider a sentence of voluntary manslaughter if they believed that Nina was dead and that Hans Reiser killed her {{in a moment of}} passion.|$|E
25|$|In March 2017, {{the defense}} {{asked the court}} to call up 2,000 people as {{potential}} jurors. They wished to mail the potential jurors a questionnaire so lawyers could winnow the field of potential jurors. The prosecution objected to Cosby's defense team's requests as to the amount of <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> be questioned, {{the manner in which they}} were to be selected, and the timeframe for jury selection, saying that Cosby was trying to get special treatment.|$|E

25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless {{the artist had}} a friend or protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> curry favor. Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E
25|$|Jury {{selection}} {{began on}} October 25. As voir dire continued, Darrow became increasingly {{concerned about the}} outcome of the trial. He felt J. B. could not be relied on as a witness and would break down under cross-examination. On October 15, he learned that the prosecution had acquired masses of evidence to support 21 separate charges. On October 18, he learned that U.S. Attorney General George W. Wickersham had obtained enough evidence on his own to secure, with President William Howard Taft's approval, a federal subpoena against the McNamaras. The first panel of jurors was exhausted on October 25, forcing the court to order an additional panel of <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> appear. The jury was finally seated on November 7.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement on his own behalf. In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

50|$|Loftus {{conducted}} more {{experiments to}} prove the reliability of expert psychological testimony versus the accepted basic eyewitness testimony. It was found that jurors who hear about a violent crime {{are more likely to}} convict a defendant than of one from a nonviolent crime. To reduce this tendency for a <b>juror</b> <b>to</b> quickly accuse, and perhaps wrongly accuse, choosing to utilize expert psychological testimony causes the <b>juror</b> <b>to</b> critically appraise the eyewitness testimony, instead of quickly reaching a faulty verdict.|$|R

The jurors intended {{to present the}} special prize alongside the award for best documentary. Shortly before the ceremony, Baxter informed Flemming that he couldn't present the award due to [...] "music clearance issues", and refused to allow it despite Flemming's protests. According to Ledonne, Flemming tried to hold his ground, but eventually gave in to Baxter's request.|$|E
500|$|... {{must not}} allow the desire for {{competent}} <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> lead them into selections which do not comport {{with the concept of}} the jury as a cross-section of the community. Tendencies, no matter how slight, toward the selection of jurors by any method other than a process which will insure a trial by a representative group are undermining processes weakening the institution of jury trial, and should be sturdily resisted. That the motives influencing such tendencies may be of the best must not blind us to the dangers of allowing any encroachment whatsoever on this essential right. Steps innocently taken may, one by one, lead to the irretrievable impairment of substantial liberties.|$|E
500|$|Louis {{inherited}} Poland {{after his}} uncle's death in 1370. Since {{he had no}} sons, he wanted his subjects to acknowledge the right of his daughters to succeed him in both Hungary and Poland. For this purpose, he issued the Privilege of Koszyce in 1374 spelling out the liberties of Polish noblemen. However, his rule remained unpopular in Poland. In Hungary, he authorized the royal free cities to delegate <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> the high court hearing their cases {{and set up a}} new high court. Suffering from a skin disease, Louis became even more religious during the last years of his life. At the beginning of the Western Schism, he acknowledged Urban VI as the legitimate pope. After the pope dethroned Joanna I of Naples and made Louis's distant cousin, Charles of Durazzo, king of Naples, Louis helped Charles occupy the kingdom. In Hungarian historiography, Louis was regarded for centuries as the most powerful Hungarian monarch who ruled over an empire [...] "whose shores were washed by three seas".|$|E

Judge Gagliardi instructed both the prosecution and the defense not to bring up Shakur or Sadiki's connections to the BLA, saying they were [...] "not relevant." [...] Gagliardi denied requests by the <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> pose questions to the witnesses—either directly or through him—and declined to provide the jury with information they requested about how long the defense had been given to prepare, saying it was [...] "none of their concern."

500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 1370s, the Lackfis' {{influence}} diminished and new favorites emerged in the royal court. James Szepesi was appointed judge royal in 1373, and Nicholas Garay became the palatine in 1375. The organization of central government was also modified to create a more centralized power structure. Louis's [...] "secret seal", that he had always taken with him during his wars and journeys, was declared authentic, and Louis entrusted it to the secret chancellor who was always to accompany him. A new high official, the Lord Chancellor were authorized to use the great seal in the king's name in 1376 or 1377. Demetrius, Bishop of Zagreb, who was of humble origin, was the first to hold this new office. The Lord Chancellor became the head of a new central court of justice, called the court of [...] "the king's special presence" [...] in 1377. From around the same time, the royal free towns delegated <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> assist the master of the treasury, who headed the court of appeal for the towns. A new official, the treasurer, took over the financial duties of the master of the treasury.|$|E
500|$|In 1914, Ferrari {{started work}} at the {{obstetrics}} clinic of the Hospital Ramos Mejía of Buenos Aires. [...] She applied to teach obstetrics at the university but was turned down. In {{the proceedings of the}} Honorable Consejo Directivo (HCD) on 23 June 1915, it was stated: [...] "Despite their qualifications, for physiological and psychological reasons people of the feminine sex do not meet the required conditions to be engaged as professors in the Faculty [...] ". The following year, she was permitted to teach at the School of Midwifery, but this lacked the prestige and credentials of a professorship at the university. When an opening for an alternate professorship appeared in 1919, Ferrari reapplied to the university but was met with resistance. The members of the HCD delayed calling together the <b>jurors</b> <b>to</b> fill the vacancy until 1925, altering evidence, ignoring recommendations, and evading a decision. In 1926, she sent a detailed outline of her accomplishments to the committee, stating that she had taught in secondary schools for 20 years and had dedicated 15 years to her field of medicine, and had enrolled in university courses for nine years. One adviser, Dr. Speroni, having read her qualifications, sent a message to the dean imploring that they admit her, on the grounds that she was qualified, had shown dedication and the school was understaffed. It was not until 1927, that the jurors met and her application for an alternate professorship was approved by a vote of thirteen to two. The news of the first female university professor in Latin America made headlines throughout Spanish-speaking countries. Newspapers in Argentina including La Prensa, La Nación, La Razón and others of the capital, El Censor in Gualeguaychú, Los Andes in Mendoza, Buenos Aires Sud in Florencio Varela, and the Italian La Patria degli Italiani and [...] Spanish El Diario Español carried stories of her triumph.|$|E
