5|$|Needham {{may have}} {{introduced}} Charteris to Sally Salisbury around 1708. Salisbury was the pre-eminent prostitute {{of the day}} and was kept by Charteris for a short time as mistress at the beginning of her career. When her previous bawd, Mother Wisebourne, died in 1719, she became a member of Needham's household and brought with her a clientele from the highest ranks of society. Salisbury brought further fame to Needham's house by involving another of her girls in the theft of the Earl of Cardigan's clothes. The two women accompanied him to Newmarket where he became drunk, and after putting <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> at an inn they stole his clothes and jewellery and returned to London. The Earl treated the matter as a joke.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Peter Rabbit is a British children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter that follows mischievous and disobedient young Peter Rabbit as he is chased about the garden of Mr. McGregor. He escapes and returns home to his mother, who puts <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> after dosing him with camomile tea. The tale was written for five-year-old Noel Moore, son of Potter's former governess Annie Carter Moore, in 1893. It was revised and privately printed by Potter in 1901 after several publishers' rejections, but was printed in a trade edition by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1902. The book was a success, and multiple reprints were issued in the years immediately following its debut. It has been translated into 36 languages, and with 45 million copies sold {{it is one of the}} best-selling books of all time.|$|E
25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So we gave him some black powder and put <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E
50|$|Trotter, Stanhope and Hibbert {{drink and}} talk about women. They all appear to be enjoying {{themselves}} until Hibbert is annoyed when Stanhope tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and he tells Stanhope <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> instead, then Stanhope suddenly becomes angry and begins <b>to</b> shout at <b>him</b> and tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> clear off and get out.|$|R

25|$|Moravia did {{not finish}} {{conventional}} schooling because, {{at the age}} of nine, he contracted tuberculosis of the bone, which confined <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> for five years. He spent three years at home and two in a sanatorium near Cortina d'Ampezzo, in north-eastern Italy. Moravia was an intelligent boy and devoted himself to reading books and some of his favourite authors were Giosuè Carducci, Giovanni Boccaccio, Fyodor Dostoevsky, James Joyce, Ludovico Ariosto, Carlo Goldoni, William Shakespeare, Molière, Gogol and Mallarmé. He learned French and German and wrote poems in French and Italian.|$|E
25|$|Jones {{suffered}} serious {{medical problems}} {{in his old}} age, specifically deafness and chronic diarrhea, which his physician blamed on his exposure to artillery fire and {{his time in the}} swamps along the Chickahominy River during his military service. He also suffered from constant pain in his right sciatic nerve, attributed to his old war wound suffered at Chancellorsville, as well as his wound in the gluteal region. Almost every spring and fall, he suffered from chills and fever lasting a week or two and confined <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> He also had occasional episodes of jaundice for which he took calomel, citrus of magnesia and an unknown type of Indian medicine.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in New York, Mark goes {{straight}} to Rose's building, where he meets Carol (Alida Valli), the concierge, {{and some of}} the residents, including a nurse (Veronica Lazar) who cares for elderly Professor Arnold (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr.), a wheelchair-bound mute. Mark encounters the sickly Countess Elise De Longvalle Adler (Daria Nicolodi), who tells him that Rose has disappeared. After the two find blood on the carpet outside Rose's room, Mark follows the stains. He becomes ill and falls unconscious. Elise sees a black-robed figure dragging Mark away, but the figure suddenly stops and gives chase to Elise. The figure eventually finds her swarmed with rabid cats in a room and stabs her to death. Mark staggers to the house's foyer where Carol and the nurse put <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

25|$|While Charles was in Paris, Marie {{wrote to}} him passionate love letters {{and sent him}} her picture, {{as well as a}} Christmas cake {{in the spirit of the}} season. He ate a piece of it and {{suddenly}} became violently ill soon after. As cholera-like symptoms were common in those days, he did not think about consulting with a physician, but threw the cake away, thinking that it became spoiled in transit. When he returned to Le Glandier, having raised some money, he still felt ill. Marie put <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and fed him venison and truffles. Almost immediately, Charles was again afflicted with la maladie parisienne. The family physician, Dr. Bardon, agreed with its cholera-like symptoms and was not suspicious when Marie asked him for a prescription for arsenic, in order to kill the rats that disturbed her husband during the evening.|$|E
25|$|On 24 September 1980, Bonham {{was picked}} up by Led Zeppelin {{assistant}} Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios for a tour of North America, to begin 17 October in Montreal, Quebec – the band's first since 1977. During the journey, Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he drank four quadruple vodka Screwdrivers (16 shots between 400–560 ml, also equivalent to 9-13 American standard drinks). He then continued to drink heavily after arriving at rehearsals. The band stopped rehearsing late in the evening and then went to Page's house, the Old Mill House in Clewer, Windsor. After midnight on Thursday, 25 September, Bonham fell asleep; someone took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and placed him on his side. Led Zeppelin tour manager Benji LeFevre and John Paul Jones found him unresponsive the next afternoon. Bonham was later pronounced dead at 32 years old.|$|E

500|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, Thomas was worried about conscription, and {{referred}} to his ailment as [...] "an unreliable lung". Coughing sometimes confined <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and he had a history of bringing up blood and mucus. After initially seeking employment in a reserved occupation, he managed to be classified Grade III, which meant that he would be among the last to be called up for service. Saddened to see his friends going on active service, he continued drinking and struggled to support his family. He wrote begging letters to random literary figures asking for support, a plan he hoped would provide a long-term regular income. Thomas supplemented his income by writing scripts for the BBC, which not only gave him additional earnings but also provided evidence that he was engaged in essential war work.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the image}} was cultivated, {{especially}} {{after his death in}} the detailed family memoirs by his nephew Sebastian Hensel, of a man always equable, happy and placid in temperament, this was misleading. The nickname [...] "discontented Polish count" [...] was given to Mendelssohn because of his aloofness, and he referred to the epithet in his letters. Mendelssohn was frequently given to alarming fits of temper which occasionally led to collapse. On one occasion in the 1830s, when his wishes had been crossed, [...] "his excitement was increased so fearfully... that when the family was assembled... he began to talk incoherently, and in English, to the great terror of them all. The stern voice of his father at last checked the wild torrent of words; they took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> and a profound sleep of twelve hours restored him to his normal state". Such fits may be related to his early death.|$|E

2500|$|Edwards {{spent a year}} in {{intensive}} study of early Church history, then began to seek out anyone who had known Watchman Nee and his church planting ministry in China. [...] He first sought the company of Beta Sheirich, a former co-worker of Nee's who had returned from China to a fellowship in Louisville, Kentucky. [...] While meeting in a conference with this group, he contracted disseminated histoplasmosis, which nearly took his life and confined <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> for the next year. [...] Pain and illness from this disease would haunt Edwards for the remainder of his life. [...] In August 1965, he moved his family from Texas, to the Los Angeles area, where he soon began teaching high school (a profession he would remain in for the next 10 years).|$|E
2500|$|The {{syllogism}} was {{too much}} for Ted. He collapsed and fell on his umbrella which, though the night was hot, he had carried with him for hours neatly rolled up, and he broke it into two equal halves. We then, the sergeant and I, put <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> the sergeant all the time solicitously muttering, 'I bror 'im home. Jus' a l'il drunk, tha's all, pore f'ler.' Next morning Ted came down to breakfast fresh as a daisy and saw the broken halves of his umbrella which Mrs. Rodenhurst had carefully laid on the sofa. 'What the 'ell,' said Ted blankly. I told him what had occurred the night before. Ted reflected; 'Ah remember as far as commin' out of t' King's Arms wi' t' sergeant and gettin' as far as t' Royal Oak, An' Ah remembers nowt else.'" ...|$|E
