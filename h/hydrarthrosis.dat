5000|$|Henry Hugh Clutton (12 July 1850 [...] - [...] 9 November 1909) was an English {{surgeon who}} {{described}} painless symmetrical <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (an {{accumulation of water}} in the cavity of a joint), especially of the knee joints: seen in hereditary syphilis. The ailment is called [...] "Clutton's joints." [...] He is commemorated by the Clutton Medal and Prize, awarded for excellence in Clinical Surgery at St Thomas's Hospital, Kings College School of Medicine and Dentistry.|$|E
5000|$|Intermittent <b>hydrarthrosis</b> is {{uncommon}} and its prevalence is not known. (In 1974 {{more than}} 200 cases {{were reported in}} published literature). [...] It affects men and women equally although some publications suggest the condition is slightly more prevalent in females. Case reports indicate that only white people are affected. [...] First onset of IH is most common {{between the ages of}} 20 and 50 years, and in females, onset can often coincide with puberty.|$|E
50|$|Intermittent <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (IH), {{also known}} as {{periodic}} synoviosis, periodic benign synovitis, or periodic hydrarthritis, is a chronic condition of unknown cause characterized by recurring, temporary episodes of fluid accumulation in the knee. While the knee is mainly involved, occasionally other joints such as the elbow or ankle can additionally be affected. Fluid accumulation in the joint can be extensive causing discomfort and impairing movement, although affected joints are not usually very painful. While the condition is chronic, {{it does not appear}} to progress to more destructive damage of the joint. It seems to affect slightly more women than men.|$|E
40|$|Anakinra for a {{refractory}} case of intermittent <b>hydrarthrosis</b> with a TRAPS-related {{gene mutation}} Intermittent <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (IH) {{is a rare}} condition characterised by its periodic schedule: recurrent self-remitting episodes of acute arthritis with a fixed periodicity; this clinical picture has been recognised as a clue for diagnosis for a long time. 1 The pathogenesis of IH is unknown. An involvement of mastocytes has been reported. 2 Interestingly, Cañete et al 3 found mutations of the Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV) in a small series of patients with IH. For management of the disease, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and colchicine are used, generally with good results, but some patients persist with recurrent episodes of arthritis.

40|$|AbstractPatients with {{spinal cord}} {{injuries}} are prone to knee <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (also known as “water on the knee”), which can cause pain, functional impairment and the restriction of social activities. Total knee arthroplasty is a potentially appropriate treatment. Here, we report on a patient presenting partial T 12 AIS grade C paraplegia {{who was able to}} walk with two forearm crutches, an ankle-foot orthosis on the right leg and a knee-ankle-foot orthosis on the left leg. Thirteen years after the spinal cord injury, the patient presented with septic arthritis of the right knee, complicated by recurrent <b>hydrarthrosis</b> during standing and walking. Arthroscopy revealed advanced osteoarthritis. Total knee arthroplasty was performed, with very good functional and social outcomes two and half years after surgery...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} guideline 'Traumatic knee complaints' {{from the}} Dutch College of General Practitioners {{is aimed at}} differentiating between intra-articular and extra-articular lesions. - The diagnosisis based mainly {{on a combination of}} patient history and a limited physical examination of the knee. - Specific tests for <b>hydrarthrosis,</b> injuries to the collateral or cruciate ligaments, and meniscal pathology have only a low diagnostic accuracy. - Few reliable studies have been conducted into the diagnostic value of specific tests; most studies employed poor methodology, had considerable inter-observer variation and produced widely heterogenous results. - Inspection of the knee can provide information regarding the presence of fluids in the knee (<b>hydrarthrosis</b> or haemarthrosis). - A restricted active range of movement in flexion and extension may indicate osteoarthritis or arthritis...|$|E
30|$|During the {{treatment}} period after HTO, patients were evaluated using the JOA score. This scoring method {{consists of four}} items: pain on walking, pain {{going up and down}} stairs, range of motion, and <b>hydrarthrosis.</b> This study excluded the range of motion and <b>hydrarthrosis</b> scores from the evaluation so that the degree of recovery could be evaluated by the patient’s subjective symptoms. This score was evaluated over time, and the healing period was considered to have ended when the score stopped showing improvement after OWHTO. Since the condition of the knee joint after HTO is not shown on radiographic images, no imaging evaluation to observe the effect of treatment is available for this technique. Bone fusion of the osteotomy area was assessed by sequential CT images, and it was observed in all cases at the time of implant removal 1  year after surgery.|$|E
30|$|Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) is {{a common}} disease in aging people. The characteristics of OA are degeneration and destruction of the articular cartilage, with secondary induction of <b>hydrarthrosis</b> and synovitis by inflammatory cytokines and growth factors from the destroyed cartilage and synovial membrane [1]. In advanced OA, hyaluronic acid (HA) is decreased in the synovial fluid (SF) [2], and the SF viscosity and chondroprotective function are also reduced. These changes cause further destruction of the articular cartilage.|$|E

40|$|Hench (1938) {{reported}} the ameliorating effect of pregnancy upon rheumatoid arthritis, fibrositis, and intermittent <b>hydrarthrosis,</b> and noted the comment of Garrod (1890) that pregnancy {{acted as a}} tem-porary check upon the development of chronic arthritis in some cases. Hench studied the effect of 37 pregnancies in 22 women and found striking relief in 20 of them. The relief of joint symptoms, as a rule, was felt {{in the early stages}} of pregnancy, and remission lasted until a few weeks after par-turition, when the arthritic symptoms recurred with equal or greater severity.

40|$|Patients with a {{total of}} 112 chronic knee effusions unresponsive to the usual {{conservative}} methods of therapy were treated with intra-articular injections of radioactive gold and followed from 6 months to 5 years. Most patients in the study had rheumatoid arthritis but others had ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, intermittent hydrathrosis and undiagnosed synovitis. After 6 months 81 % showed improvement. This figure diminished to approximately 70 % at 1 and 2 years, 60 % at 3 and 4 years and 50 % at 5 years. The mose beneficial results were seen in patients with intermittent <b>hydrarthrosis.</b> Twelve patients with a synovial cyst and/or rupture improved.

40|$|Severe {{degenerative}} joint {{changes can}} be caused by lack of the protection afforded by the sense of pain. Usually the loss of pain sense is known before the joints are damaged. Recently we have investigated a man with a generalised analgesia and neuropathic arthritis of several joints, who had only a localised sensory disturbance at the age of thirteen when the first joint became affected. CASE HISTORY A boy, born in 1935, was seen at another hospital in 1948 because ofa swollen right knee. The first radiographs showed no bony changes (Figs. 1 and 4), but after a further six months he still had a <b>hydrarthrosis</b> and the lateral femoral condyle was seen to be roughened (Fig. 2). The diagnosis remained obscure and an arthrotomy revealed degenerative arthritis only. A few months later, suffering from difficulty in walking because of instability of the knee, he was admitted to the neurological department of a teaching hospital; here he was observed for over three months. The senses of pain and temperature were found to be abnormal only in the right leg below the knee, although it was noted that the interpretation was difficult. Lumbar puncture and serological tests for syphilis gave normal results. On discharge he wa...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} synovial proliferation (synovitis), articular cartilage and subchondral bone degradation and synovial inflammation. Joint swelling and oedema often accompany pannus formation and joint chronic inflammation in RA. Clinical {{evidence suggests that}} joint swelling and oedema frequently accompany the chronic inflammation observed in synovial joints of RA patients. Although joint swelling is understood {{to be a major}} problem in synovitis, very {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms responsible for the oedema fluid formation that is associated with joint inflammation. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes express aquaporin 1 (AQP 1) water channels. Aquaporins are a family of small integral membrane proteins related to the major intrinsic protein (MIP or AQP 0). In recent studies we have used immunohistochemistry to investigate whether the expression of the AQP 1 water channel is altered in synovitis. Our data suggests that this membrane protein is upregulated in the synovium derived from RA and psoriatic arthritis patients. In this chapter these observations are discussed in the context of RA and psoriatic arthritis. AQP 1 and other aquaporins may play an important role in joint swelling and the vasogenic oedema fluid formation and <b>hydrarthrosis</b> associated with synovial inflammation. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} synovial proliferation (synovitis), articular cartilage and subchondral bone degradation {{as well as}} joint swelling. Joint swelling and edema often accompany pannus formation and chronic joint inflammation in RA. We have recently shown that human chondrocytes and synoviocytes express aquaporin 1 (AQP 1) water channels and that AQP 1 is upregulated in RA cartilage. Clinical evidence suggests that joint swelling and edema accompany the chronic inflammation observed in synovial joints of RA patients. Therefore we hypothesized that AQP 1 water channels {{may be involved in}} joint swelling and synovial edema formation. To test this hypothesis, we performed immunostaining of normal and human synovitis tissue microarrays (TMAs) to investigate whether the expression of AQP 1 water channels is altered in the synovium in synovitis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that AQP 1 is expressed in synovial micro-vessels and synoviocytes from normal joints (n= 20 normal subjects). Semi-quantitative histomorphometric analysis of AQP 1 expression in the TMAs revealed upregulation of the membrane protein in the synovium derived from RA (n= 10) and psoriatic arthritis (n= 8) patients. These results indicate a potential role for synovial AQP 1 and other aquaporins in joint swelling and the vasogenic edema fluid formation and <b>hydrarthrosis</b> associated with synovial inflammation. Future experiments will need to determine whether the expression of other aquaporins is altered in synovitis...|$|E
40|$|Immunosuppressive {{therapy in}} Beh^et's disease Immunosuppressive therapy seetm to he the {{treatment}} ofchoice in Beh<;et's disease if administered early, at adequate dosages andfor relatively {{long periods of}} time. Corticosteroids can be very effective durlng the initial stages ofthe disease, but the frequeni and rapid onset of dependence and resistance to these drugs limits their usefulness. The Authors report a case ofBehget's disease treated with the immunosuppressive alkylating agent chlorambucil. Thepatient, a 39 year old white male, presented the followingclinicaland laboratory findings: aphthae buccalis andgenitalis, diffused uveitis with marked retinal vasculitis, pyoderma, diffused arthralgia, relapsis <b>hydrarthrosis,</b> HLA B 5 marker, circidating immimocomplexes and increased serum C 4. Chlorambucil was initially administered in a single 5 mg daily dose, after 3 months of corticosteroid (prednisone) treatment. The dosage of chlorambucil was itureased by 2. 5 mg/week imtil a dady dose of 12. 5 mg was reached. MeanwhUe, corticosteroid treatment was withdrawn. After 5 months of treatment, there was complete remission ofeye inflammation as well as remarkable general improvement. Dosages of chlorambucd were progressively decreased over the next 7 months. C 4 serum levels returned to norrnal. Relapses of eye inflammation were sporadic and mild and appeared more amenable to corticosteroid treatment. These results confirm the previous observation of 5 I patients after early administration of chlorambucd: overall improvement of their clinical condition and prognosis of Behget's disease was demonstrated.

30|$|The {{relationships}} between biomarkers and clinical scores might {{enable us to}} identify the biomarkers that act as prognostic factors and indicate therapeutic effects. To date, researchers have reported several correlations between biomarkers and clinical scores. Hasegawa et al. [46] found a negative correlation between C 4 S or tenascin-C and VAS scores, while Sugimoto et al. [47] found {{a positive relationship between}} C 6 S or aggrecan and the JOA score. However, there are also reports that no correlations were found between biomarkers and clinical scores [45],[55]. In the present study, we investigated the correlations between C 6 S, C 4 S, HA, IL- 6, SF viscosity, or SF volume and each item in the AKS and KOOS scores. Our results indicated a positive correlation between SF viscosity and KOOS symptom scores before the fifth injection. No other positive correlations between biomarkers and clinical scores were observed. These results suggest that SF viscosity is related to the clinical scores. A higher viscosity of SF, which reflects the theoretical basis of IA HA, was found to be the important factor for the clinical scores. Additionally, the SF volume exhibited a negative correlation with the KOOS symptom scores at the fifth visit after IA HA treatment. No other negative correlations between biomarkers and clinical scores were observed. Increased SF volume elevated pressure in the knee joint, worsened range of motion and clinical symptom. The correlation coefficients (r) between viscosity and KOOS symptom, and SF volume and KOOS symptom were 0.466 and − 0.499. These correlation coefficients might not be strong. However, these correlations indicate that viscosity and <b>hydrarthrosis</b> are important parameters for IA HA treatment.|$|E
40|$|Aging, obesity, {{and female}} gender are {{risk factors for}} {{osteoarthritis}} (OA) of the knee. Basic {{research has suggested that}} leptin may {{play an important role in}} the pathological process of OA, and that interleukins (ILs) and growth factors may be related to this process. The objective of the present clinical study was to examine the possible correlations between the serum leptin concentration and gender, fat mass, and the IL and growth factor levels in synovial fluid among patients with knee OA. Forty-four patients with knee OA and <b>hydrarthrosis</b> (age: 50 - 88 yr) were recruited in our outpatient clinic. Plain radiographs of the knee were taken, and blood and synovial fluid of the knee joint were collected. The serum leptin concentration was significantly higher in women than in men. A simple linear regression analysis showed that body weight, body mass index, and total fat mass, but not age, height, radiographic grade of knee OA, lean body mass, or the levels of IL- 6, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), or insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) in synovial fluid were significantly correlated with the serum leptin concentration. A multiple regression analysis showed that among gender and the three above-mentioned significant factors, only gender and total fat mass were significantly associated with the serum leptin concentration. These results suggested that the serum leptin concentration was higher in women than in men and that it was related only to an increased total fat mass in patients with knee OA. However, the present clinical study failed to show a significant correlation between the serum leptin concentration and the IL or growth factor levels in synovial fluid...|$|E
40|$|AIM/BACKGROUND: Mycoplasmas, {{especially}} Mycoplasma fermentans, were suggested {{more than}} 20 {{years ago as}} a possible cause of rheumatoid arthritis but this hypothesis was never substantiated. In view of the superior sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay over culture, the aim was to use this method to seek M fermentans and M penetrans in synovial samples from patients with various arthritides. METHODS: Synovial fluid samples (n = 154) and synovial biopsy specimens (n = 20) from 133 patients with various rheumatic disorders were stored at - 80 degrees C for between one and 40 months. Aliquots (500 microliters) of the synovial fluid samples were centrifuged and the deposit, and also the synovial biopsy specimens (approximately 1 g) were placed in lysis buffer with proteinase K for DNA extraction. The DNA was tested by using a semi-nested PCR assay for M fermentans and a single-round PCR for M penetrans. RESULTS: M fermentans was detected in the joints of eight (21 %) of 38 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, two (20 %) of 10 patients with spondyloarthropathy with peripheral arthritis, one (20 %) of five patients with psoriatic arthritis, and four (13 %) of 31 patients with unclassified arthritis. M fermentans was not found in the joints of the seven patients with reactive arthritis, the 29 with osteoarthritis or post-traumatic <b>hydrarthrosis,</b> the nine with gouty arthritis, nor the four with chronic juvenile arthritis. M penetrans was not detected in any sample. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the presence of M fermentans in the joint is associated with inflammatory rheumatic disorders of unknown cause, including rheumatoid arthritis. However, whether this organism triggers or perpetuates disease of behaves as a passenger remains conjectural...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-eight {{patients}} with osteoarthritis {{of the knee}} who showed a relatively mild deformity on the X-rays associated with <b>hydrarthrosis</b> and pain on exercise were administered high molecular weight sodium hyaluronate (SPH; average molecular weight, 800, 000) by injection into the knee joint, {{once a week for}} 5 consecutive weeks. Synovial fluid was withdrawn by puncture prior to each injection and biochemically analyzed. The relations between the biochemical findings and the clinical efficacy as assessed by the knee score established by the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA), the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the patient 2 ̆ 7 s impression were studied. After treatment, not only the amount of synovial fluid but also the synovial fluid markers, such as chondroitin 6 -sulfate OS), chondroitin 4 -sulfate (C 4 S), C 6 S/C 4 S ratio, prostaglandin E_ 2 (PGE_ 2), etc, were significantly decreased, while type II procollagen C-peptide (pCOL II-C) was significantly increased. The decrease in the amount of synovial fluid and in PGE_ 2 strongly suggested that SPH had had an anti-inflammatory effect inside the articular cavity. The decrease in C 6 S and the increase in pCOL II-C suggested that SPH had both suppressed cartilage impairment and contributed to its repair. Of the synovial fluid markers, the decrease in C 6 S and in C 4 S correlated well with the degree of articular pain relief in terms of variations in JOA knee score and VAS. These findings suggested that the presence of a cartilage-repairing mechanism and the improvement in synovitis might be important for articular pain relief. Based on the decrease in PGE_ 2 found in this study and on a report on the effect of SPH on arachidonic acid metabolism by other investigators, it was inferred that SPH would exert an inhibitory effect on arachidonic acid metabolism...|$|E
