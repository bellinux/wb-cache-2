2500|$|On June 2, 1949, Stevenson privately gave a sworn {{deposition}} as {{a character}} witness for Alger Hiss, a former State Department official who was later {{found to be a}} spy for the Soviet Union. Stevenson had infrequently worked with Hiss, first in the legal division of the AAA in 1933, and then in 1945, 1946, and 1947 on various United Nations projects, but he was not a close friend or associate of him. In the deposition, Stevenson testified that the reputation of Hiss for integrity, loyalty, and veracity was good. In 1950 Hiss was found guilty of perjury on the spying charges. Stevenson's deposition, according to his biographer Porter McKeever, would later be used in the 1952 presidential campaign by Senators Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon to [...] "inflame public opinion and attack Adlai as 'soft on communism'." [...] In the 1952 campaign, Senator Nixon would claim that Stevenson's [...] "defense of Hiss" [...] reflected such [...] "poor judgment" [...] on his part that [...] "doubt was cast about Adlai's capacity to govern." [...] In a 1952 appearance on NBC's Meet the Press, Stevenson responded to a question about his deposition for Hiss by saying [...] "I'm a lawyer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the most fundamental responsibilities...particularly of lawyers, is to give testimony in a court of law, to give it honestly and willingly, {{and it will be a}} very unhappy day for Anglo-Saxon justice when a man, even in public life, is too timid to state what he knows and what he has heard about a defendant in a criminal trial for fear that defendant might later be convicted. That would to me be the ultimate timidity." ...|$|E

"Looking at it {{that way}} we all tend to go insane a little bit, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> ok. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> of the things the album is saying - it is ok to go insane, it can be quite cathartic actually, to watch {{yourself}} go out to the edge and sort of reel yourself back in - now hopefully you do reel yourself back in." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of {{the causes}} of these {{repeated}} failures is that our best and greatest men have greatly underestimated the size of this question. They have constantly brought forward small cures for great sores--plasters too small to cover the wound. That is one reason that all settlements have proved temporary--so evanescent.|$|E

5000|$|Common (Elam Ferguson) {{spoke about}} the audience's {{perception}} of the American frontier through Elam: [...] "We haven't seen a character like this from that time period, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> was important. <b>One</b> thing <b>that</b> I've really appreciated about Elam is that he's a leader and very intelligent. He cares for people, he's passionate, and has his own dream, and thinks for himself. You know, he's a human being. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> {{of the most important}} things that people can learn from Hell on Wheels and that time period is that people were people. Some of the same things that we go through now, they experienced." ...|$|R
5000|$|Carrigan {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for establishing the [...] "big fat drum sound" [...] associated with Nashville recordings during the 1970s. He said: [...] "I started playing real loose, deep-sounding snare drums on country records. Billy Sherrill loved it. So I started experimenting with different things, different kinds of drums. I bought {{the first set of}} concert tom-toms that were in Nashville. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> reason the producers liked my sound. I had a different approach." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] replied Mr. Purcey, {{a little}} puzzled; [...] "that, of course. D'you know, {{of all your}} pictures, Mrs. Dallison, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> you call 'The Shadow' is the most rippin'. There's a {{something}} about it that gets hold of you. That was the original, wasn't it, at your Christmas party--attractive girl--it's an awf'ly good likeness." ...|$|E

[...] "There are things going on around us which no one can understand. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of his schemes has miscarried; he has gone too far. He {{suspects}} you; I cannot tell you why or how. If only you would go away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suzanne!" [...] I called, [...] "Suzanne!" [...] for I {{thought that}} she was in her chamber; but the girl, knowing that Piet van Vooren was here, had slipped out, and of this he was aware. He knew, moreover, where she had gone, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of his Kaffir {{servants}} was watching outside and told him, and thither he followed her and made love to her.|$|E
5000|$|Araya commented {{about the}} {{misconception}} {{of the band}} labeled as Satan worshippers, [...] "Yeah, yeah <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> of the biggest misconceptions towards the band, but next to that {{just the fact that}} we're normal." [...] If guitarist King writes a good song, Araya puts his beliefs aside, [...] "I'm not <b>one</b> <b>that's</b> going to go, 'This sucks because it's contrary to my beliefs.' To me it's more like 'This is really good stuff. You're going to piss people off with this.'" ...|$|R

In the coming months we {{hope to be able}} to talk about more of the people who are working on it. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> of the most fundamental things about it, is the talent.|$|R
30|$|He {{would say}} oh, you’re {{not a true}} Australian, but you’re Australian. But you’re not a true Australian because you don’t look like one. He wasn’t racist in that sense because we’re friends and he’s OK with me. But {{when it came to}} {{defining}} the term he thinks of Australian as white. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> <b>one</b> thing <b>that’s</b> tricky because people who would call themselves Australian have different ideas of what an Australian is. Nobody really knows and it’s not consistent, there’s no consensus.|$|R
6000|$|May God bless you, dearest Mrs. Martin! My {{best and}} kindest regards to Mr. Martin.

5000|$|Schrader once {{described}} Milius' writing as containing too many good lines and scenes. He says Warren Beatty once [...] "told John something I've been telling him too: 'You come too soon {{and you come}} too often.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> of his problems: he's so full of juice he just can't stop coming, rather than holding back and tightening the situation and building characters. That releasing diffuses the energy, the characters are too broad because they never have time {{to build up the}} inner strength." ...|$|R

[...] (Comparing Wordplay with I.O.U.S.A.)“There's such a huge disparity between the wealthy and the poor in this country, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> {{of the reasons why}} consumerism is so rampant. A lot of us have become addicted to a lifestyle we can't afford. We're immersed in the culture of excess, so it's going to get really ugly when it has to stop.

60|$|On the whole, I {{think that}} short visits to Europe are {{better for us}} than long ones. The former {{preserve}} us from becoming Europeanized; they keep our pride of country intact, {{and at the same}} time they intensify our affection for our country and our people; whereas long visits have the effect of dulling those feelings--at least in the majority of cases. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> who mixes much with Americans long resident abroad must arrive at this conclusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know, mother," [...] was Cheenbuk's reply, [...] "I {{have always}} {{differed}} from my friends about wives. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> wife {{is enough for}} one man; sometimes too much for him! I also think that if it is fair {{for a man to}} choose a woman, it is also fair for the woman to choose the man. I would gladly take Adolay for a wife, for she is good as well as pretty, but I do not know that she would take me for a husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{times we}} led the beasts out in {{detachments}} to water at wayside stations, {{and there was}} usually much profanity and destruction of property before we got them back again, and left the agent to assess the damage to his feelings, besides splintered gangways and broken rails.

5000|$|Asked by the Pacific Journalism Review for {{her opinion}} {{as to why}} there were (in 1995) no women in Papua New Guinea's Parliament, she stated:"I {{maintain}} that I will not give money to somebody to vote for me. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> big reason. The men can get money, the men can bribe. We are finding {{it very difficult for}} women to go around bribing people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this is where the country is going nowhere because here {{there is a lot of}} bribes, there is a lot of corruption, something that women don't want in this country." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} for Digital Spy, lead singer Wyatt explained the video, [...] "We really liked director Andreas's images and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they go together {{in a way that}} feels truthful with what we do. As Stephen Colbert would say, truthiness will come out in different ways for different people. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> of the strengths of his work because it matches our sound and you can read into it in different ways. The 'Paddling Out' clip is the first episode of more videos. We'll see, we don't really know exactly what's going to happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Quatermain," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have come}} to this God-forsaken country to get that great Cypripedium, and get it I will or die in the attempt. Still," [...] he added after {{surveying}} our rather blank faces, [...] "I {{have no right to}} play with your lives, so if you think the thing too dangerous I will go on alone with this old boy, Babemba. Putting everything else aside, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of us ought to visit Bausi's kraal in case the gentleman who you call Brother John should turn up there. In short, I have made up my mind, so it is no use talking." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a nice}} question," [...] Philip said; [...] "but {{seeing that}} the Catholics never keep their oaths and their {{promises}} to what they call heretics, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> would be justified, not in telling a lie, for nothing can justify that, but in availing one's self of a loophole such as one would scorn to use, to others. I should be sorry to have the question asked me, though seeing I am not myself a Huguenot, although I am fighting with them, I think that I could reply 'no;' especially as {{it is not a}} question of my own life only, but one involving the whole cause of the Huguenots.|$|E

5000|$|Even though Jackie Robinson {{became the}} first black player in modern major league history in April 1947, Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier that July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945, 1946, and 1947. Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>thats</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|R

[...] "I'm really {{proud of the fact}} that I'm a more national Indian, so to speak—I’m equally comfortable with different languages, cultures, foods. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> of the aspects of being an army kid. It is <b>one</b> thing <b>that</b> is common among almost every army brat. It’s almost like we are a culture of our own." [...] In May 2014, he married his long-time partner, Ipsa Jamwal.
