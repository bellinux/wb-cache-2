5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including <b>equipment</b> <b>cost,</b> labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Resistance welding {{involves}} {{the generation of}} heat by passing current through the resistance caused by the contact between two or more metal surfaces. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the weld area as high current (1000–100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, resistance welding methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are somewhat limited and the <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> can be high.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and gas {{metal arc welding}} has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|Cave diving {{has been}} {{perceived}} {{as one of}} the more deadly sports in the world. This perception may be exaggerated because the majority of divers who have lost their lives in caves have either not undergone specialized training or have had inadequate equipment for the environment. Some cave divers have suggested that cave diving is in fact statistically much safer than recreational diving due to the much larger barriers imposed by experience, training, and <b>equipment</b> <b>cost,</b> but there is no definitive statistical evidence for this claim.|$|E

5000|$|Resource Costs: Resources {{consist of}} labor, equipment, materials, subcontractors, trucking, {{and any other}} cost detail items. Labor and <b>equipment</b> <b>costs</b> are {{internal}} crew costs, whereas all other resource costs are received from vendors, such as material suppliers, subcontractors, and trucking companies. Labor costs are usually calculated from wages, benefits, burden, and workers compensation. <b>Equipment</b> <b>costs</b> are calculated from purchase price, taxes, fuel consumption, and other operating expenses.|$|R

25|$|In 2009 supercapacitors enabled LRV's {{to operate}} in the {{historical}} city area of Heidelberg without catenary overhead wires preserving the city's architectural heritage. The SC <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> an additional €270,000 per vehicle, which was expected to be recovered over the first 15 years of operation. The supercapacitors are charged at stop-over stations when the vehicle is at a scheduled stop. This approach may allow many LRV city lines to serve catenary overhead wires that are too expensive to fully route installation. In April 2011 German regional transport operator Rhein-Neckar, responsible for Heidelberg, ordered a further 11 units.|$|E
25|$|The {{company began}} by {{purchasing}} real estate at Norris St., Philadelphia, {{a few blocks}} from its existing works, on which it built an entirely new shipyard, which was fitted with its own blacksmith, engine, boiler and carpentry shops in addition to a 700-foot outfitting wharf. Cramp also purchased new tools and production <b>equipment.</b> <b>Cost</b> of the real estate alone was above $265,000, and in order to limit the financial risk involved in the expansion, the firm made the decision to incorporate as the William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company; however, it remained a proprietary business with the Cramp family owning all the shares.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Gareth Edwards, while Allan Niblo and James Richardson of Vertigo Films served as producers. Edwards did not storyboard or script the film, but wrote a treatment of the story and outlines that detailed specifics points that needed to be hit in dialogue. The filming <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> approximately $15,000, and the production budget came in [...] "way under" [...] $500,000. The film was able to be made on such a low budget largely due to the production using consumer grade prosumer level equipment instead of professional paraphernalia. For instance, the film was shot using digital video cameras rather than the more expensive 35mm film and was edited on a laptop computer. Many of the locations in the film were used without permission, and most of the extras were people who were already at the locations. As the extras were non-actors who were persuaded to be in the film, their actions were improvised.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} the network capacity planning (or dimensioning) problem. The assignment of links capacity is often made by {{taking into account}} link costs and neglecting other <b>equipment</b> <b>costs</b> such as routers and line cards. However, with the massive deployment of optical fiber in all western countries, the cost of leasing transmission lines becomes cheaper and cheaper, and <b>equipment</b> <b>costs</b> are now a significant {{fraction of the total}} cost. The main contribution {{of this paper is to}} integrate the <b>cost</b> of the <b>equipments</b> in the capacity planning process. An exact algorithm and a local search-based heuristic are proposed to solve this problem. Numerical results show that significant cost-savings can be achieved when <b>equipment</b> <b>costs</b> are taken into account in the capacity planning process. I...|$|R

2500|$|Construction {{began on}} February 5, 1896. Originating at the North Pacific Coast Railroad depot in Mill Valley, {{the line was}} planned to ascend the {{surrounding}} hills to the summit of Mount Tamalpais, then {{over the top of}} the peak and down to Bolinas Beach. The pristine beach was difficult to access, and residents supported the line's planned arrival. This remained only a plan, as did the initial proposal to make the line an electric trolley route. A wagon road was constructed to Willow Camp (Stinson Beach) in 1902 [...] and electric power never supplanted the geared steam locomotives used to construct the line. Supplies and laborers arrived in Mill Valley and began work by February 1896. Over 200 men, an international mix of laborers, graded the route and laid rails. Many left their jobs in protest over poor pay and expensive board—$1.75 a day for 10 hours of work followed by a night at an obligatory boarding house costing $5.25 a week. Despite these labor concerns and some local enmity from residents who opposed noisy locomotives running adjacent to their property, construction ensued. Within six months, the railroad construction was completed at a cost of $55,000; <b>equipment</b> <b>cost</b> an additional $80,000. The last spike was driven on August 18, 1896, with the first passenger train operating just four days later.|$|E
