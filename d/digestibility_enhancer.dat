40|$|The {{ban on the}} use of {{antibiotics}} as growth promoters has stimulated the search for alternative feed supplements in poultry production. The active principles of thyme essential oil act as a <b>digestibility</b> <b>enhancer,</b> balancing the gut microbial ecosystem and stimulating the secretion of endogenous digestive enzymes and thus improving growth performance in poultry (Lovkova et al., 2001; Williams and Losa, 2001). A study was performed to investigate the effects of thyme essential oil (TEO) on performance, carcass characteristics, some blood parameters and ileal microflora of Japanese quail. This study lasted 35 days of age. One hundred and fifty day-old male Japanese quail chicks in a completely randomized design with two treatments (with or without 1 g/kg TEO) and five replicates of 15 birds each were used. All parameters were measured {{at the end of the}} experiment. The supplementation of TEO significantly (...|$|E
40|$|The {{additive}} AveMix® XG 10 is {{an enzyme}} preparation of endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase (xylanase) and endo- 1, 3 (4) -beta-glucanase (glucanase), produced by two strains of Trichoderma reesei. This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} chickens for fattening, laying hens, minor poultry species and weaned piglets as a zootechnical additive, under the functional group of <b>digestibility</b> <b>enhancers.</b> The applicant is now seeking {{an extension of the}} authorisation to turkeys for fattening at a recommended dose of 4 000 XU (xylanase units) and 900 BGU (glucanase units) per kg complete feed. The results obtained in a tolerance study in turkeys for fattening showed that the birds tolerated well a 100 -fold overdose of the recommended dose. Therefore, the additive is safe for turkeys for fattening when used at the recommended dose. Three efficacy studies carried out in turkeys for fattening showed that the additive {{has the potential to be}} efficacious at the dose of 4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg complete feed...|$|R
40|$|Natugrain® TS is {{an enzyme}} {{preparation}} that contains endo- 1, 4 -beta-xylanase and endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase, produced by two genetically modified strains of Aspergillus niger. This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} piglets (weaned), poultry species and ornamental birds as a zootechnical additive under the functional group of <b>digestibility</b> <b>enhancers.</b> The applicant is now seeking for the extension of its use as a zootechnical additive for pigs for fattening at a dose range of 560 to 840  TXU (thermostable xylanase units) and 250 to 375  TGU (thermostable glucanase units) per kg feed. Since the product has been demonstrated to be  safe in piglets at the maximum recommended dose, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) considers that this conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening, provided that the same maximum dose applies. In two long-term trials, Natugrain® TS significantly improved {{the performance of the}} pigs for fattening at the minimum recommended dose (560  TXU and 250  TGU/kg feed). In a balance trial, the metabolisable energy content of the diet was significantly improved by the addition of Natugrain® TS in feed at the minimum recommended dose. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Natugrain® TS at the minimum recommended dose (560  TXU and 250  TGU/kg feed) {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in pigs for fattening...|$|R
40|$|Feed is {{responsible}} for about 70 % of broilers production costs, leading to {{an increasing number of}} studies on alternative dietary products that benefit bird performance and lower production costs. Since the 1950 s, antimicrobial additives are the most frequently used performance enhancers in animal production and their positive results are observed even in high-challenge conditions. Since the 1990 s, due to the ban of the use of some antibiotics as growth promoters and the growing trend of the public to consume natural products, plant extracts have been researched as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters. The first study that evaluated the antibacterial activities of plant extracts was carried out in 1881; however, they started to be used as flavor enhancers only during the next decades. With the emergence of antibiotics in the 1950 s, the use of plant extracts as antimicrobial agents almost disappeared. There are several studies in literature assessing the use of plant extracts, individually or in combination, as antimicrobials, antioxidants, or <b>digestibility</b> <b>enhancers</b> in animal feeds. Research results on the factors affecting their action, such as plant variety, harvest time, processing, extraction, as well as the technology employed to manufacture the commercial product and dietary inclusion levels show controversial results, warranting the need of further research and standardization for the effective use of plant extracts as performance enhancers, when added to animal feeds. This article aims at presenting plant extracts as alternatives to antibiotics, explaining their main modes of action as performance enhancers in broiler production.

40|$|The {{additive}} AGal-Pro, {{also named}} as Biogalactosidase BL and AlphaGal BL, is a preparation of alpha-galactosidase (galactosidase) {{produced by a}} genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of endo- 1, 4 -beta-glucanase (glucanase) produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus niger. This product is authorised for use in chickens for fattening as a zootechnical additive, functional group of <b>digestibility</b> <b>enhancers.</b> The applicant seeks for {{the extension of the}} use of the additive to chickens reared for laying and to minor poultry species for fattening at a dose range of 50 to 100 alpha-galactosidase units and of 285 to 570 glucanase units per kg feed (corresponding to 50 to 100 mg additive/kg feed). In a previous evaluation the additive was shown to be safe in chickens for fattening at a dose of 100 galactosidase and 570 glucanase units per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying. Given the margin of safety established for the major species, these conclusions can be extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening. The potential of the product to be efficacious when used in chickens for fattening was previously established at the dose of  50 U galactosidase and 285 U glucanase per kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that this conclusion applies to chickens reared for laying. Since the mode of action of the galactosidase and glucanase can be reasonably assumed to be the same in all poultry species the conclusion on efficacy in chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to include the minor poultry species for fattening...|$|R

This product is currently authorised {{for use in}} chickens for fattening, laying hens, minor poultry species and weaned piglets as a zootechnical additive, under the functional group of <b>digestibility</b> <b>enhancers.</b> The applicant is now seeking {{an extension of the}} authorisation to pigs for fattening and minor porcine species at a recommended dose of 4 000 XU (xylanase units) and 900 BGU (beta-glucanase units) per kg complete feed. The FEEDAP Panel considers that, since the additive has been demonstrated to be safe for piglets at the recommended dose, this conclusion can be extended to pigs for fattening and extrapolated to minor growing porcine species. Supplementation of diets for pigs for fattening with Avemix® XG 10 at the recommended dose (4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg) resulted in a significantly higher body weight and daily weight gain in one trial and significantly improved feed to gain ratio in two trials. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that AveMix® XG 10 {{has the potential to be}} efficacious in pigs for fattening at this dose. Since the mode of action of xylanases and glucanases can reasonably be assumed to be the same in all porcine species, the conclusions on efficacy for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening can be extrapolated to include all minor porcine species for growing at 4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg complete feed...|$|R
