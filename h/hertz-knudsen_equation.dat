40|$|Transport {{conditions}} were evaluated during the vapor phase growth of mercurous chloride crystals {{in a closed}} tube. Experimentally observed growth rates were much smaller than those calculated by the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> (H-K) <b>equation.</b> The Arrhenius behavior of growth rate with the temperature was used to derive the sticking coefficient.

40|$|Simulation of low-density {{supersonic}} free jets {{is considered}} in application to vacuum technology processes. In particular, {{results have been}} obtained for thin film deposition processes for copper. The vapor phase of monatomic copper is simulated using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique. The growth rates obtained from the DSMC simulations are compared with measured growth rates. It is shown that, by simultaneously calculating the mass flow rate and the Knudsen number accurately, excellent agreement is obtained between simulated and measured growth rates. Based on this comparison, parameters of a variable hard sphere molecular model for copper vapor have been determined. Three different compact models for the dependence of the normalized growth rate profiles on the Knudsen number are considered and compared with each other. Droplet transport including momentum and energy coupling between the gas and droplet phase are used to compute the trajectories of droplets originating at the throat and lip of two different nozzles. The maximum droplet radius reaching the substrate and the variation of droplet size with angle predicted by the trajectory computations agrees well with the measurements using Optical Microscopy. Droplet formation models using the Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) and droplet growth using the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equations</b> are also considered. It was found that these models do not predict the formation of micron-sized droplets that are observed in the deposition experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|Theories on the {{evaporation}} of pure substances {{are reviewed}} {{and applied to}} study vacuum evaporation of pure metals. It is shown that there is good agreement between different theories for weak evaporation, whereas there are differences under intensive evaporation conditions. For weak evaporation, the evaporation coefficient in <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> is 1. 66. Vapor velocity {{as a function of}} the pressure is calculated applying several theories. If a condensing surface is less than one collision length from the evaporating surface, the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> applies. For a case where the condensing surface is not close to the evaporating surface, a pressure criterion for intensive evaporation is introduced, called the effective vacuum pressure, peff. It is a fraction of the vapor pressure of the pure metal. The vacuum evaporation rate should not be affected by pressure changes below peff, so that in lower pressures below peff, the evaporation flux is constant and equal to a fraction of the maximum evaporation flux given by <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> as 0. 844 n˙Maxn˙Max. Experimental data on the evaporation of liquid and solid metals are included...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a unified tightly coupled multi-phase computational framework is described for the analysis and design of cooling spray nozzle configurations on the flame deflector in rocket engine test stands. An Eulerian formulation is used to model the disperse phase and is coupled to the gas-phase equations through momentum and heat transfer as well as phase change. The phase change formulation is modeled according to a modified form of the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation.</b> Various simple test cases are presented to verify {{the validity of the}} numerical framework. The ability of the methodology to accurately predict the temperature load on the flame deflector is demonstrated though application to an actual sub-scale test facility. The CFD simulation was able to reproduce the result of the test-firing, showing that the spray nozzle configuration provided insufficient amount of cooling...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaporation}} rate of a liquid is determined, inter alia, by its equilibrium vapour pressure {{and by the}} actual pressure of vapour just above the surface. The relationship between these properties, the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation,</b> can be deduced from the kinetic theory of gases. The evaporation coefficient, long used as a correction factor in this relationship, has been shown by recent experiments of Hickman, Maa, Schulze, and Cammenga to be unity, provided the equilibrium vapour pressure used in the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> is the value for {{the surface of the}} liquid. Difficulties in determining the surface temperature, and hence the vapour pressure, have led to values of the evaporation coefficient less than unity. It is also essential that the liquid surface be clean. Minute quantities of contamination on the surface can inhibit the convective transfer of heat through the liquid to the surface, and this can lower the {{evaporation rate}}. Certain monolayers, when spread on a liquid surface, can reduce the evaporation rate of the liquid. In some situations this reduction can be partly attributed to reduced heat transfer by convection, but often the monolayer itself can impede evaporation. This property is conveniently described by an evaporation resistance. Monolayers in condensed surface states usually have significant evaporation resistances, but there are some important exceptions. The resistance depends on molecular architecture, temperature, surface pressure and carbon chain length. Treatment of evaporation resistance in terms of an energy or free energy barrier to evaporation describes most of the experimental data, but attempts to predict resistance values have had little success. A postulate that evaporation is restricted to those parts of the surface not obstructed by monolayer molecules, the accessible area, has led to successful predictions of some aspects of evaporation resistance. However, there is, as yet, no comprehensive theory of evaporation resistance: indeed, some experimental observations can not be explained by any of the current theories...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to examine evaporation kinetics of metallic iron, {{one of the important}} materials forming terrestrial planets and meteorites. Platelets of pure metallic iron were heated at temperatures ranging from 1075 to 1312 ℃ under vacuum (10 ^ to 10 ^ Torr) for 0. 5 to 96 hrs. The evaporation proceeds by forming evaporation steps, although small wustite crystals were formed on the surfaces by partial oxidation of iron under vacuum. Amounts of evaporated iron estimated from mass loss of experimental charges increased with time at constant temperatures, showing a linear rate law. The evaporation rates, j, can be represented by ln j= 22. 21 ± 2. 29 [mol m^ s^]- 390. 6 ± 29. 2 [kJ mol^]/RT. The evaporation coefficients, α_v, were obtained by comparing the experimental results with calculated rates using the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation.</b> The value of α_v is close to unity if effects of partial oxidation are taken into consideration. The present results give basic information for discussing chemical evolution of the primordial solar nebula...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{multiphase}} models for simultaneous heat and mass transfer process during bread baking. Our main {{objective is to}} provide an explanation and a remedy to the observed erroneous and/or divergent results associated with the instanta-neous phase change model used in the literature. We propose a reaction-diffusion model based on the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation,</b> where the phase change is not instantaneous but determined by an evaporation/condensation rate. A splitting scheme is designed for the reaction-diffusion model so that a link between these two models can be estab-lished and the non-intuitive numerical instability associated to the instantaneous phase change model can be identified and eliminated. The evaporation/condensation rate is estimated {{by comparing the results}} of the reaction-diffusion model with the experimen-tal observations in the literature. For the evaporation/condensation rate beyond the estimated value, oscillatory solution with multiple regions of dry and two-phase zones is observed. We show that these are caused by an instability intrinsic to the model (which we call diffusive instability) using linear stability analysis and numerical tests...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{evaporation}} of binary alloys {{occurs in}} a number of practical applications, as e. g. in the fabrication of electrical resistors by use of a Cr-Ni alloy. The chemical composition of the alloy determines the physical properties of the deposited film. During the evaporation process the number of atoms of both species and thus source, vapor and thin film compositions are continuously changed, with possible adverse effects on the film properties. In order to maintain high quality features in mass production of devices and components, {{it is important to know}} the mass fraction that may be evaporated without modifying too much the intented composition of the thin film of the binary alloy. The present paper describes a theoretical analysis of the evaporation behavior of a molten binary alloy through changes in the chemical composition of the source, the vapor, and the thin film during the process. We employed Roult’s law to described the relation between partial vapor pressure and composition for an ideal alloy and for the evaporation of pure metals the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study two related {{multiphase}} models for simultaneous heat and mass transfer process during bread baking. Our main {{objective is to}} provide an expla-nation and a remedy to the observed erroneous and/or divergent results associated with the instantaneous phase change model used in the literature. We propose a reaction-diffusion model based on the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation,</b> where the phase change is not instantaneous but determined by an evaporation/condensation rate. A splitting scheme is designed so that a relation between these two models can be established and the non-intuitive numerical instability associated to the instantaneous phase change model can be identified and eliminated through the reaction-diffusion model. The evapora-tion/condensation rate is estimated from balancing these two models and reasonable and consistent results are produced by using the estimated rate. For the evapora-tion/condensation rate beyond the estimated value oscillation, solutions with multiple regions of dry and two-phase zones is observed. We show that these are caused by an instability intrinsic to the model (which we call diffusive instability) {{and the effect of}} the diffusive instability to the bread-baking simulation is also explained through a linear stability analysis and supported by numerical tests...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{refers to}} the {{development}} of a numerical simulator for Laser Milling process useful for industrial applications able to predict the machining results when different materials are processed, different surface conditions are encountered and spatial and temporal distributions of the pulsed beam are set. The original software presented, developed by the authors, are well suited for simulating laser milling or laser micromachining operations with power density up to 1014 W/m 2 and pulse duration in the order of nanoseconds. The temperature of the solid phase is evaluated by solving the Fourier equation by using the finite difference method (FDM). The recession velocity of the ablating surface is evaluated according to the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> assuming that the explosive effects are negligible. The plasma plume is considered in local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) and the energy balance permits to evaluate the plume temperature, ion distribution and pressure under the assumption that the gas expansion, from the surface target, produces a sonic front. The plume energy balance is influenced by the energy lost for irradiation from the plume and by the quantity of laser beam energy reflected from the target surface. Numerical simulations have been conducted to quantify this influence on the plasma plume physical state and, consequently, on the ablation process considering a Nd:YAG diode pumped source and three different target materials: Fe-C alloy, copper and aluminum...|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study is}} presented, evaluating in a comparative manner {{the capability of}} various mass-transfer rate models to predict the evolution of flashing flow in various geometrical configurations. The examined models comprise phase-change mechanisms based on the kinetic theory of gases (<b>Hertz–Knudsen</b> <b>equation),</b> thermodynamic-equilibrium conditions (HEM), bubble-dynamics considerations using the Zwart-Gerber-Belamri model (ZGB), as well as semi-empirical correlations calibrated specifically for flash boiling (HRM). Benchmark geometrical layouts, i. e a converging-diverging nozzle, an abruptly contracting (throttle) nozzle and a highly-pressurized pipe, for which experimental data {{are available in the}} literature have been employed for the validation of the numerical predictions. Consideration on additional aspects associated with phase-change processes, such as the distribution of activated nucleation sites, as well as the deviation from thermodynamic-equilibrium conditions have also been taken into account. The numerical results have demonstrated that the onset of flashing flow in all cases is associated with the occurrence of compressible flow phenomena, such as flow choking at the constriction location and expansion downstream, accompanied by the formation of shockwaves. Phase-change models based on the kinetic theory of gases produced more accurate predictions for all the cases investigated, while the validity of the HRM and ZGB models was found to be situational. Furthermore, it has been established that the inter-dependence between intrinsic physical factors associated with flash boiling, such as the nucleation-site density and the phase-change rate, has a significant, yet not clearly distinguishable influence on the two-phase flow characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Context. Ice {{lines are}} {{suggested}} {{to play a}} significant role in grain growth and planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. Evaporation fronts directly influence the gas and ice abundances of volatile species in the disk and therefore the coagulation physics and efficiency and the chemical composition of the resulting planetesimals. Aims. In this work we investigate the influence of the existence of the CO ice line on the particle growth and on the distribution of CO in the disk. Methods. We include the possibility of tracking the CO content and/or other volatiles in particles and in the gas in our existing dust coagulation and disk evolution model and developed a method for evaporation and condensation of CO using the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation.</b> Our model does not include fragmentation, yet, which will be part of further investigations. Results. We find no enhanced grain growth just outside the ice line where the particle size is limited by radial drift. Instead we find a depletion of solid material inside the ice line which is solely due to evaporation of the CO. Such a depression inside the ice line may be observable and may help to quantify the processes described in this work. Furthermore, we find that the viscosity and diffusivity of the gas heavily influence the re-distribution of vaporized CO at the ice line and can lead to an increase in the CO abundance by up to a factors of a few in the region just inside the ice line. Depending on the strength of the gaseous transport mechanisms the position of the ice line in our model can change by up to 10 AU and consequently, the temperature at that location can range from 21 K to 23 K.

40|$|In this study, a {{computational}} {{model has been}} developed to predict condensation heat transfer between vertical parallel plates. Transient simulations of filmwise condensation in a small two-dimensional parallel plate passage are performed. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is used to track the vapor liquid interface. The Geometric Reconstruction Scheme, which is a Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC) method, is employed to keep the interface sharp. The governing equations and the VOF equation with relevant source terms for condensation are solved explicitly. The surface tension is {{taken into account in}} the modeling and it is evaluated by the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) approach. Different methods to evaluate the source terms in the VOF and energy equations are summarized based on previous studies. The simulation is performed using the CFD software package, Ansys Fluent, and an in-house developed code. This in-house code is specifically developed to calculate the source terms associated with phase change, which are deduced from the <b>Hertz-Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> based on the kinetic gas theory. The predicted results show that a laminar regime exists {{at the top of the}} wall, where the film is the thinnest. A wavy regime appears as a series of regular ripples/waves of condensate moving downwards under the action of both gravity and shear stress in the interface area. As a further step, the simulations have been run under different surface tension, wall temperature, and inlet velocity conditions. The predictions also indicate that the wave peak height decreases with increasing surface tension and decreases with increasing inlet velocity. This has an effect on the heat transfer characteristics of the condensation process. The condensation heat transfer increases sharply by increasing the temperature difference between the wall and saturation temperature of the inlet steam...|$|E
40|$|Increased use of {{prescribed}} fire by {{land managers}} {{and the increasing}} likelihood of wildfires due to climate change require an improved modeling capability of extreme heating of soils during fires. This issue is addressed here by developing and testing the soil (heat–moisture–vapor) HMV-model, a 1 -D (one-dimensional) non-equilibrium (liquid–vapor phase change) model of soil evaporation that simulates the coupled simultaneous transport of heat, soil moisture, and water vapor. This model is intended for use with surface forcing ranging from daily solar cycles to extreme conditions encountered during fires. It employs a linearized Crank–Nicolson scheme for the conservation equations of energy and mass and its performance is evaluated against dynamic soil temperature and moisture observations, which were obtained during laboratory experiments on soil samples exposed to surface heat fluxes ranging between 10 000 and 50 000 W m − 2. The <b>Hertz–Knudsen</b> <b>equation</b> {{is the basis for}} constructing the model's non-equilibrium evaporative source term. Some unusual aspects of the model that were found to be extremely important to the model's performance include (1) a dynamic (temperature and moisture potential dependent) condensation coefficient associated with the evaporative source term, (2) an infrared radiation component to the soil's thermal conductivity, and (3) a dynamic residual soil moisture. This last term, which is parameterized as a function of temperature and soil water potential, is incorporated into the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity functions in order to improve the model's ability to capture the evaporative dynamics of the strongly bound soil moisture, which requires temperatures well beyond 150 °C to fully evaporate. The model also includes film flow, although this phenomenon did not contribute much to the model's overall performance. In general, the model simulates the laboratory-observed temperature dynamics quite well, but is less precise (but still good) at capturing the moisture dynamics. The model emulates the observed increase in soil moisture ahead of the drying front and the hiatus in the soil temperature rise during the strongly evaporative stage of drying. It also captures the observed rapid evaporation of soil moisture that occurs at relatively low temperatures (50 – 90 °C), and can provide quite accurate predictions of the total amount of soil moisture evaporated during the laboratory experiments. The model's solution for water vapor density (and vapor pressure), which can exceed 1 standard atmosphere, cannot be experimentally verified, but they are supported by results from (earlier and very different) models developed for somewhat different purposes and for different porous media. Overall, this non-equilibrium model provides a much more physically realistic simulation over a previous equilibrium model developed for the same purpose. Current model performance strongly suggests that it is now ready for testing under field conditions...|$|E
