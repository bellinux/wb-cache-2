5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine.</b> An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to vaccination has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent vaccination campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after vaccination. Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E

40|$|Cold-chain requirements, limited {{stockpiling}} {{potential and}} the lack of potent immune responses are major challenges of parenterally formulated <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Decreased cold chain dependence and stockpiling can be achieved if vaccines are formulated in a dry state using suitable excipients and drying technologies. Furthermore, having the vaccine in a dry state enables the development of non-parenteral patient friendly dosage forms: microneedles for transdermal administration, tablets for oral administration, and powders for epidermal, nasal or pulmonary administration. Moreover, these administration routes have the potential to elicit an improved immune response.

40|$|Owing to the {{variability}} of <b>influenza</b> viruses, <b>vaccine</b> composition needs to be up-dated annually. As many variables can influence their efficacy, vaccines are still considered "sub-optimal". Many studies {{have been carried out}} in recent years to improve vaccines. In particular, researchers and vaccine-producing corporations have focused on developing a live vaccine. Among the candidate vaccines, the strain developed by Maassab has recently been licensed in the USA and Europe, after extensive investigation. This vaccine is safe and well tolerated, and has shown very good genetic stability. Although vaccine recipients are able to spread the virus, transmission to close contacts is practically non-existent. Studies on cold-adapted attenuated <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> have demonstrated that such vaccines are effective, and sometimes more effective than inactivated <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Cold-adapted attenuated <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> therefore appear to be an important weapon against influenza.

40|$|Vaccination is {{the most}} {{cost-effective}} {{way to reduce the}} considerable disease burden of seasonal influenza. Although seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are effective, their performance in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals would benefit from improvement. Major problems related to the development and production of pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> are response time and production capacity as well as vaccine efficacy and safety. Several improvements can be envisaged. Vaccine production technologies based on embryonated chicken eggs may be replaced by cell culture techniques. Reverse genetics techniques can speed up the generation of seed viruses and new mathematical modelling methods improve vaccine strain selection. Better understanding of the correlates of immune-mediated protection may lead to new vaccine targets besides the viral haemagglutinin, like the neuraminidase and M 2 proteins. In addition, the role of cell-mediated immunity could be better exploited. New adjuvants have recently been shown to increase the breadth and the duration of influenza vaccine-induced protection. Other studies have shown that <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> based on different viral vector systems may also induce broad protection. It is to be expected that these developments may lead to more universal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> that elicit broader and longer protection, and can be produced more efficiently...|$|R
