50|$|In Austria, Kabinett is {{subcategory}} of Qualitätswein {{rather than}} a Prädikatswein, and the term always <b>designates</b> <b>a</b> dry <b>wine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Strohwein or Schilfwein is <b>an</b> Austrian <b>wine</b> {{term in the}} Prädikatswein {{category}} which <b>designates</b> <b>a</b> straw <b>wine,</b> <b>a</b> sweet dessert <b>wine</b> {{made from}} raisin-like dried grapes. Stroh is German for straw, while Schilf means reed.|$|R

5000|$|Porca de Murça (literally the [...] "Sow of Murça" [...] in Portuguese, {{although}} the sculpture appears {{to represent a}} boar, i.e. a male rather than a female pig). The name has been taken to <b>designate</b> <b>a</b> red <b>wine</b> of the Douro district.|$|R
5000|$|The term Ausbruch {{initially}} <b>designated</b> <b>a</b> <b>wine</b> {{made from}} mixing grapes strongly affected by noble rot with must from less concentrated grapes, in the Spätlese to Beerenauslese range. This filled {{the purpose of}} dissolving crystallized sugars in the grapes in order {{to speed up the}} fermentation and make it more efficient. This has also been called to [...] "break out" [...] the sugar, which is how the term was coined. This is the same as Aszú method of the Tokaji Aszú and Tokajský výber wines are produced in Austria's neighbouring countries Hungary and Slovakia, although a classification system with several levels is used there. However, in difference from the Aszú and [...] "výber" [...] methods, Ausbruch wines are not required to be made by mixing the two components, and in reality almost all present-day Austrian Ausbruch wines are produced {{in the same way as}} a Trockenbeerenauslese, but subject to a 27 ºKMW rather than 30 ºKMW requirement.|$|R

2500|$|The Colli dell'Etruria Centrale DOC {{is located}} within the {{geographical}} boundaries of the Chiant zones this DOC is a [...] "catch-all" [...] designations for alternative styles of wines that would otherwise not qualify for anything above vino da tavola. There are three distinct styles of Vin Santo that can produced under the Colli dell'Etruria Centrale DOC label-Occhio di Pernice, Abboccato and Amabile (also known as Secco). The first style, Occhio di Pernice, is a pale rosé style wine made from at least 50% Sangiovese {{with a mix of}} local red and white grape varieties permitted to fill in the remaining 50%. The <b>wine</b> must have <b>a</b> minimum alcohol level of at least 10.5% and be aged for at least 3 years prior to release. The Amabile and Abboccato styles related to their sweetness level with Abbocato <b>designating</b> <b>a</b> slightly sweet (or [...] "off dry") style and Amabile <b>designating</b> <b>a</b> <b>wine</b> that is sweeter but not quite as sweet as something that would be labelled as Dolce.

5000|$|Green Valley {{was first}} <b>designated</b> as <b>a</b> <b>wine</b> region {{with the name}} Sonoma County Green Valley AVA on November 21, 1983, a name that was similar in {{structure}} to the Solano County Green Valley AVA created in 1982. [...] Many wines {{that could have been}} labelled with the Sonoma County Green Valley AVA designation were instead labelled with the broader appellation designation of the Russian River Valley AVA, due to the greater market awareness of Russian River Valley <b>wines.</b> <b>A</b> group of <b>wine</b> producers from the region petitioned the United States Department of the Treasury Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau for a name change to associate the Green Valley with the more popular Russian River Valley. [...] The name of the appellation was changed with an amendment to the federal law designating American Viticultural Areas, effective April 23, 2007, to be the Green Valley of Russian River Valley AVA.|$|R
50|$|Caunes {{is also in}} the Minervois, <b>a</b> <b>designated</b> <b>wine</b> growing {{region with}} AOC status but with an ancient heritage. The name derives from the ancient {{regional}} capital of Minerve, some 20 km east of Caunes, itself named for the Roman Goddess Minerva. The Romans came through here, settling and introducing vines & olives in the region. Minervois Vignerons have been dynamic in changing the perception of the world towards wine from the south of France, developing quality products and experimenting with both old and new grape varieties and techniques.|$|R

50|$|In {{wine tasting}} the aftertaste or finish of <b>a</b> <b>wine,</b> is <b>an</b> {{important}} part of the evaluation. After tasting <b>a</b> <b>wine,</b> <b>a</b> taster will determine the wine's aftertaste, which is a major determinant of the wine's quality. The aftertaste of <b>a</b> <b>wine</b> can be described as bitter, persistent, short, sweet, smooth, or even non-existent. Included in assessing the aftertaste of <b>a</b> <b>wine</b> is consideration of the aromas still present after swallowing. High quality wines typically have long finishes accompanied by pleasant aromas. By assessing the combination of olfactory and aftertaste sensations, wine tasting actually determines not only the aftertaste profile of <b>a</b> <b>wine,</b> but its flavor profile as well.|$|R
