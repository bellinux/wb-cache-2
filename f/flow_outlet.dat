The existence of a top central outlet and inability for all the fluid to leave at the cone apex outlet, assist the inward migration of some of the fluid from the external moving mass. The amount of inward migration increases as the apex is neared, i.e. the radius decreased and the fluid which flows in this migratory stream, ultimately reverses its vertical velocity direction and flows upward to the cyclone over <b>flow</b> <b>outlet,</b> i.e. vortex finder.

40|$|Background]: Carotid artery {{occlusion}} {{can lead}} to the development of rare true posterior communicating artery (PCoA) aneurysms because of hemodynamic stress on the PCoA. Surgical treatment of these lesions is challenging. [Case Description]: The authors report a case of a true PCoA aneurysm that developed and ruptured 37 years after ligation of the ipsilateral common carotid artery for epistaxis. The lesion was successfully treated with clipping of the distal M 1 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) after the occipital artery-radial artery free graft-MCA bypass, which led to extreme reduction in collateral flow through the PCoA. A cortical branch, located just proximal to the obliteration site, functioned as a sufficient <b>flow</b> <b>outlet.</b> The aneurysm shrank, and the patient has been doing well without any symptoms for 5 years after surgery. [Conclusions]: M 1 obliteration combined with high-flow extra-intracranial bypass might be a promising option for a true PCoA aneurysm, and therapeutic design that leaves a sufficient <b>flow</b> <b>outlet</b> on the M 1 is mandatory to avoid unexpected occlusion of the M 1 and its perforators...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{regime of}} Svalbard's Nordaustlandet ice caps is {{dominated}} by fast <b>flowing</b> <b>outlet</b> glaciers, making assessment of their response to climate change challenging. A key element of the challenge {{lies in the fact}} that the motion of fast outlet glaciers occurs largely through basal sliding, and is governed by physical processes at the glacier bed, processes that are difficult both to observe and to simulate. Up to now, most of the sliding laws used in ice flow models were based on uniform parameters with a condition on temperature to identify regions of basal sliding. However these models are usually not able to reproduce observed velocities with sufficient accuracy. With the development of inverse methods, it is now common to infer a spatially varying field of sliding parameters from surface ice-velocity observations. These parameter distributions usually reflect a high spatial variability and represent valuable information to understand and test various hypotheses on physical processes involved in sliding. However, in these models, basal sliding is uncoupled from the thermal regime of basal ice and the evolution of the sliding parameters in prognostic simulations remains problematic. Here we explore the role of different heat sources (friction heating, strain heating and latent heat through percolation of melt water) on the development of sliding and fast flow through thermomechanical coupling on Nordaustlandet outlet glaciers. We focus on Vestfonna with a special emphasis on Franklinbreen, a fast <b>flowing</b> <b>outlet</b> glacier which has been observed to accelerate between 1995 and 2008 and possibly already prior to 1995. We try to reconcile the impacts of temperature and heat sources on basal friction coefficients inferred from observed surface velocities during these two periods. Our simulations reproduce a temperature profile from borehole measurements, allowing an interpretation of the vertical temperature structure in terms of temporal evolution of climate. We identify firn heating as a crucial heat source to explain Vestfonna's temperature distribution, especially in the thick areas in the center. However, friction heating is the dominant heat source at the bed of fast <b>flowing</b> <b>outlet</b> glaciers. Our findings do not support a purely temperature dependent sliding law for Vestfonna, implying that hydrology and/or sediment physics need to be represented in order to simulate fast <b>flowing</b> <b>outlet</b> glaciers...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} jet engine {{compressor}} blading always implies a compromise between design and off-design operation. The {{reason for this is}} a fixed blade geometry which has to be operated over a wide range of operating conditions. Consequently, maximum achievable efficiencies at design operation are limited by off- design requirements, e. g. a certain stall margin. This paper describes an approach using shape-variable blades equipped with integrated piezoceramic based Macro Fiber Composite (MFC) Actuators on the blade’s suction and pressure sides. By applying a voltage to these actuators it is possible to increase and to decrease the blade stagger angle and therefore the blade turning. Compared to a conventional fixed blade profile the actuated design is thus adaptable within a certain range regarding ambient conditions. The first part of the paper describes the geometry and structure of the shape-variable blades for use in a compressor cascade experiment. In the next part the three-dimensional deformation behavior of all manufactured blades at different shape conditions is characterized with a photogrammetric measurement system called ATOS. The first results without aerodynamic loads show an average displacement at the trailing edge of approximately Δz ≈ 0. 9 mm compared to the non-actuated condition. This corresponds to an average outlet angle variation of approximately ∆κ 2 ≈ ± 1 °. The third part of the paper presents the results of the low speed cascade experiment using a fully actuated cascade. On the one hand the objective is to determine the influence of blade actuation on aerodynamic characteristics such as <b>flow</b> <b>outlet</b> angle, total pressure loss and pressure distributions. On the other hand optical blade displacement measurements are used to investigate combined 2 D- and 3 D-deformation effects of blade actuation in conjunction with aerodynamic loads. For these measurements the ATOS system is also used. The wake evaluations show that maximum blade actuation leads to <b>flow</b> <b>outlet</b> angle deviations up to ± 1 ° which can be described by an almost linear shift of the cascade performance without changing the loss distribution significantly. Furthermore, for the chosen profile this margin is approximately constant over the operating range...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{response}} of fast flowing ice streams or outlet glaciers to changing climate is crucial {{in order to make}} reliable projections of sea level change over the coming decades. Motion of fast outlet glaciers occurs largely through basal motion governed by physical processes at the glacier bed, which are not yet fully understood. Various subglacial mechanisms have been suggested for fast flow but common to most of the suggested processes is the requirement of presence of liquid water, and thus temperate conditions. We use a combination of modelling, field, and remote observations in order to study links between different heat sources, the thermal regime and basal sliding in fast flowing areas on Vestfonna ice cap. A special emphasis lies on Franklinbreen, a fast <b>flowing</b> <b>outlet</b> glacier which has been observed to accelerate recently. We use the ice flow model Elmer/Ice including a Weertman type sliding law and a Robin inverse method to infer basal friction parameters from observed surface velocities. Firn heating, i. e. latent heat release through percolation of melt water, is included in our model; its parameterisation is calibrated with the temperature record of a deep borehole. We found that strain heating is negligible, whereas friction heating is identified as one possible trigger for the onset of fast flow. Firn heating is a significant heat source in the central thick and slow flowing area of the ice cap and the essential driver behind the ongoing fast <b>flow</b> in all <b>outlets.</b> Our findings suggest a possible scenario of the onset and maintenance of fast flow on the Vestfonna ice cap based on thermal processes and emphasise the role of latent heat released through refreezing of percolating melt water for fast flow. However, these processes cannot yet be captured in a temporally evolving sliding law. In order to simulate correctly fast <b>flowing</b> <b>outlet</b> glaciers, ice <b>flow</b> models not only need to account fully for all heat sources, but also need to incorporate a sliding law that is not solely based on the basal temperature, but also on hydrology and/or sediment physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{data from}} flow tests which {{employed}} two different production zones in a well at Fenton Hill indicates the flow impedance of a wellbore zone damaged by rapid depressurization was altered, possibly by pressure spallation, {{which appears to}} have mechanically propped the joint apertures of <b>outlet</b> <b>flow</b> paths intersecting the altered wellbore. The rapid depressurization and subsequent flow test data derived from the damaged well {{has led to the}} hypothesis that pressure spallation and the resultant mechanical propping of <b>outlet</b> <b>flow</b> paths reduced the <b>outlet</b> <b>flow</b> impedance of the damaged wellbore. Furthermore, transient pressure data shows the largest pressure drop between the injection and production wellheads occurs near the production wellbore, so lowering the outlet impedance by increasing the apertures of <b>outlet</b> <b>flow</b> paths will have the greatest effect on reducing the overall reservoir impedance. Fenton Hill data also reveals that increasing the overall reservoir pressure dilates the apertures of flow paths, which likewise serves to reduce the reservoir impedance. Data suggests that either pressure dilating the wellbore connected joints with high production wellhead pressure, or mechanically propping open the <b>outlet</b> <b>flow</b> paths will increase the near-wellbore permeability. Finally, a new method for calculating and comparing near-wellbore outlet impedances has been developed. Further modeling, experimentation, and engineered reservoir modifications, such as pressure dilation and mechanical propping, hold considerable potential for significantly improving the productivity of HDR reservoirs...|$|R
