5|$|Glacier National Park has a fire {{management}} plan which ensures that human-caused <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> generally suppressed. In {{the case of}} natural fires, the fire is monitored and suppression {{is dependent on the}} size and threat the fire may pose to human safety and structures.|$|E
5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through {{ground based}} and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first {{determine whether a}} fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning {{and the amount of}} fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E
5|$|The element iron {{can combine}} with {{chlorine}} at high temperatures {{in a strong}} exothermic reaction, creating a chlorine-iron fire. Chlorine-iron <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> a risk in chemical process plants, {{where much of the}} pipework that carries chlorine gas is made of steel.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> now 90% contained. <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> still {{estimated}} at 4,400 hectares.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fires</b> <b>were</b> very {{important}} to all Aboriginal people of Australia. To the Yirrganydji, the Piri <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> used for cooking food, preparing medicines or artefacts, keeping warm, and chasing away the mosquitoes and sand flies. <b>Fires</b> <b>were</b> usually made close {{to the entrance of}} a shelter.|$|R
50|$|The Rim <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> ignited on the Stanislaus National Forest in August 2013, and {{eventually}} grew {{to become the}} third-largest fire in California history. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> named after the Rim of the World Vista on California State Route 120, where the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> initially reported.|$|R
5|$|Poorly {{ventilated}} cooking fires, often {{fueled by}} coal or biomass fuels such as wood and dung, lead to {{indoor air pollution}} and {{are one of the}} most common causes of COPD in developing countries. These <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> a method of cooking and heating for nearly 3billion people with their health effects being greater among women due to more exposure. They are used as the main source of energy in 80% of homes in India, China and sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} almost totally {{restricted}} to the swales and lower slopes of dunes. Various reasons for this have been proposed; on the one hand, {{it has been argued}} that its dependence on ground water necessitates that it grow only where ground water is relatively near the surface; on the other hand, it has been suggested that it cannot survive in higher parts of the landscape because <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> too frequent there. The latter hypothesis is supported by the recent expansion of B.prionotes along road verges of the Brand Highway, where <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> relatively rare. Despite B.prionotes occurrence in lower parts of the landscape, it does not occur in areas prone to flooding, because of its intolerance of heavy soils, and because extended periods of flooding kill seedlings. However, recent falls of the water table on the Swan Coastal Plain have seen B.prionotes replace the more water-loving Banksia littoralis in some areas that were previously flood-prone.|$|E
50|$|On July 3, the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> 95% contained. The Wallow <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> {{declared}} 100% contained as of 6 p.m., July 8.|$|R
50|$|The East Peak <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> {{a forest}} <b>fire</b> that began {{east of the}} East Spanish Peak near La Veta, Colorado at 5:10 PM on Wednesday, June 19, 2013. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} named the Scout Ranch Fire because the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> first reported by the Spanish Peaks Scout Ranch.|$|R
50|$|The River Complex <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in the Trinity Alps Wilderness, Trinity County, California during the 2015 California wildfire season. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> started on July 30 {{as a result of}} a lightning strike. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared 100 percent contained on October 29, with 75,081 acre burned.|$|R
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15â€“30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
5000|$|In Chinese philosophy, <b>fire</b> (...) <b>is</b> the prosper of the matter, or the matter's {{prosperity}} stage. <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> {{the second}} phase of Wu Xing.|$|R
30|$|Three <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} {{to illustrate the}} persistence of fires through periods of substantial precipitation. One of these <b>fires</b> <b>was</b> a recent WFU event.|$|R
50|$|By June 7, reports {{indicated}} the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> slowing down. On June 8, President Clinton signed Federal Disaster Declaration AK-1119-DR, making federal disaster relief funding available. This funding eventually exceeded $8 million. On June 10, the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared to be contained. On June 15, the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> declared {{to be under}} control.|$|R
5|$|Glacier National Park {{has almost}} all its {{original}} native {{plant and animal}} species. Large mammals such as Grizzly bears, moose, and mountain goats, as well as rare or endangered species like wolverines and Canadian lynxes, inhabit the park. Hundreds of species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species, and a few reptile and amphibian species have been documented. The park has numerous ecosystems ranging from prairie to tundra. Notably, the easternmost forests of western redcedar and hemlock grow in the southwest portion of the park. Large forest <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> uncommon in the park. However, in 2003 over 13% of the park burned.|$|E
5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, stimulated {{by exposure to}} heat and smoke. Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> thought to be most beneficial for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E
5|$|Lara follows {{them to the}} Solarii {{fortress}} and is {{aided by}} Grim. The Solarii take Grim hostage, but he sacrifices himself so Lara can escape. With Roth's aid, Lara infiltrates the fortress and sees the ritual begin. She tries to stop the ritual, but gets captured and has her weapons taken. When the <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> lit, a great wind blows them out, showing Sam {{to be the next}} Sun Queen. Lara escapes again with just a bow and arrows and reunites with her friends (Reyes, Jonah, and Alex), forming a plan to rescue Sam and escape.|$|E
50|$|The Goose <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in Fresno County, California. By {{the time the}} <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> contained, 2,241 acre of land had burned.|$|R
50|$|The {{maximum rate}} of <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> usually stated as five rounds/minute, and 65 rounds/hour sustained. In Soviet service, {{the unit of}} <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> 60 rounds.|$|R
30|$|Although {{the first}} WFU fire didnâ€™t officially occur until 1998, two lightning-ignited {{fires in the}} 1970 s were not {{suppressed}} in an early attempt to change park fire management policy {{to what is now}} WFU. The 1976 Polecat Ridge <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> one of these fires (Harmon 1981). The other <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> not explicitly identified in reports but notes included in the fire report suggest it was the 1977 Polecat Ridge Fire. These two <b>fires</b> <b>were</b> not included in the suppressionera lightning fire statistics for total number of suppressed fires, size, or duration. When the area of the 1976 Polecat Ridge <b>Fire</b> <b>is</b> included in unsuppressed-lightning <b>fire</b> data, it <b>is</b> noted. The 1977 Polecat Ridge <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> not included in the unsuppressed fire discussions due to incomplete data.|$|R
5|$|Like all rare-earth metals, cerium is of low to {{moderate}} toxicity. A strong reducing agent, it ignites spontaneously in air at 65 to 80Â°C. Fumes from cerium <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> toxic. Water {{should not be}} used to stop cerium fires, as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas. Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching, sensitivity to heat, and skin lesions. Cerium is not toxic when eaten, but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse. Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms, on account of being damaging to cell membranes, but this is not an important risk because it is not very soluble in water.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is in range, the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} lesson learned is {{that a number of}} ecosystems, including the one that contains Yellowstone, are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires. This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988, and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home. While large destructive <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities, they are mandatory in a region such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{if it is to be}} maintained in a natural manner.|$|E
30|$|ENSO values during fire {{years prior}} to 1900 did not depart {{significantly}} from mean ENSO values, although years in which <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> widespread (at least four sites recording <b>fire)</b> <b>were</b> associated with positive ENSO (El NiÃ±o) values. Years in which no <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> recorded were associated with negative ENSO (La NiÃ±a) values (Figure 5).|$|R
25|$|An {{investigation}} {{made by the}} Chicago Police Department {{and fire}} department. The survivors claimed that the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> started in a plywood wardrobe closet in Room 306 which was unoccupied at the time. Although the actual cause of the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> unknown, the Police Bureau of Investigation arrested a housekeeper who was charged with multiple counts of arson. It is unclear, however, how the authorities determined that the <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> an act of arson, and the arsonist's motives for starting the <b>fire</b> <b>were</b> never noted.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> a self-sustaining, {{exothermic}} oxidation {{reaction that}} emits heat and light. When a <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> accelerated, it can produce more heat, consume the reactants more quickly, burn {{at a higher}} temperature, and increase {{the spread of the}} fire. An accelerated <b>fire</b> <b>is</b> said to have a higher [...] "heat release rate," [...] meaning it burns more quickly.|$|R
5|$|When {{placed over}} a flame, lithium {{compounds}} give off a striking crimson color, {{but when it}} burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors. Lithium is flammable, and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other alkali metals. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers (Class D type). Lithium {{is one of the}} few metals that react with nitrogen under normal conditions.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused <b>fires,</b> <b>are</b> to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King VÃ¶lsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King VÃ¶lsung's hall. At the hall, large <b>fires</b> <b>are</b> kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E
50|$|The Frog <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a fatal <b>fire</b> that {{occurred}} during the 2015 California wildfire season that burned 4,863 acre of land in the Modoc National Forest. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> one of many <b>fires</b> that <b>was</b> started on July 30 during a lightning storm.|$|R
50|$|The Border <b>Fire</b> <b>was</b> a {{wildfire}} {{that burned}} in Potrero, San Diego County, California. The <b>fire</b> <b>was</b> so named {{due to its}} proximity to the United States-Mexican border.|$|R
