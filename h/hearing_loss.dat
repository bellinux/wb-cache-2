5|$|<b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes. When <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is a result of injury or damage to the outer ear or middle ear, it is known as conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. <b>Hearing</b> <b>loss</b> problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> and conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hearing aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if the <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> is severe or prolonged. Hearing aids work by amplifying {{the sound}} of the local environment and are best suited to conductive <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> Cochlear implants transmit the sound that is heard {{as if it were a}} nervous signal, bypassing the cochlea.|$|E
50|$|For {{people with}} {{unilateral}} cochlear <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> or asymmetrical <b>hearing</b> <b>losses,</b> the same tone presented alternately {{to the two}} ears {{may be perceived as}} having different pitches in the two ears. This is the phenomenon of diplacusis.The magnitude of the shift can be measured by getting the subject to adjust the frequency of a tone in one ear until its pitch matches that of the tone in the other ear.|$|R
40|$|The Ministry of Health Regulation No. 986 / 1992 {{regarding}} {{environmental health}} conditions in hospitals determines that noise levels in every room, depending on its function, must fulfil the health requirements. Rooms {{such as the}} laundry and kitchen, as well as hot and cold water supply rooms should have a maximum noise level of 78 dBA. Yet, the measurement of noise levels in those rooms showed that noise levels ranged between 80 - 88 dBA, thus exceeding the threshold limit. Consequently, some form of study needs to be conducted. The objectives {{of the study is}} to determine wheter there is any difference in <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> experienced between employees exposed to high noise levels and those who are not exposed. Result: The noise level of boiler water (exposed) 81 - 82 dBA was exceeded the regulation but level of unexposed was 56 - 58 dBA.

For the management of sensorineural <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> hearing aids have been used.

25|$|In the ear aids (ITE) devices fit in {{the outer}} ear bowl (called the concha). Being larger, these are easier to insert and can hold extra features.

They can be used in mild to some severe <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> Feedback, a squealing/whistling caused by sound (particularly high frequency sound) leaking and being amplified again, may be a problem for severe <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> Some modern circuits are able to provide feedback regulation or cancellation to assist with this.|$|R
5|$|Causes of {{conductive}} <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> {{include an}} ear canal blocked by ear wax, ossicles that are fixed together or absent, or {{holes in the}} eardrum.

Tympanoplasty is the general name of the operation to repair the middle ear's eardrum and ossicles. Grafts from muscle fascia are ordinarily used to rebuild an intact eardrum. Sometimes artificial ear bones are placed to substitute for damaged ones, or a disrupted ossicular chain is rebuilt in order to conduct sound effectively.|$|E

Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome.

Broad thumbs and big toes are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The ear may be {{affected}} by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. Diseases of the ear may lead to <b>hearing</b> <b>loss,</b> tinnitus and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also {{be affected}} by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{principal}} damage mechanisms {{to the inner}} ear in industrialised society, and both injure hair cells. The first is exposure to elevated sound levels (noise trauma), {{and the second is}} exposure to drugs and other substances (ototoxicity). A large number of people are exposed to sound levels on a daily basis that are likely to lead to significant <b>hearing</b> <b>loss.</b> The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has recently published research on the estimated numbers of persons with hearing difficulty (11%) and the percentage of those that can be attributed to occupational noise exposure (24%). Furthermore, according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), approximately twenty-two million (17%) US workers reported exposure to hazardous workplace noise.

5|$|Although only males {{produce the}} cicadas' {{distinctive}} sound, both sexes have membraneous structures called tympana {{by which they}} detect sounds; the equivalent of having ears. Males disable their own tympana while calling, thereby preventing damage to their hearing; a necessity partly because some cicadas produce sounds up to 120dB (SPL) which is among the loudest of all insect-produced sounds. The song is loud enough to cause permanent <b>hearing</b> <b>loss</b> in humans should the cicada sing just outside the listener's ear. In contrast, some small species have songs so high in pitch that they are inaudible to humans.|$|E

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this study is to compare the {{relative}} value of three methods of conducting a hearing survey used within this study. These three methods may be described as (1) teacher referral, (2) individual screening test of each child followed immediately by a diagnostic threshold evaluation, and (3) individual screening test with the diagnostic threshold evaluation following after the lapse of one month or more. In order to compare these methods, three surveys were used. Survey I, Survey II, and Survey III were done in Superior, Nebraska, Saunders County, Nebraska, and Burt County, Nebraska, respectively. Survey IV and Survey V were conducted in Colfax County, and Cuming County respectively. From the findings of this study, it appears that: Although more efficient than the teachers of Curry’s study, the teachers of Survey I were not efficient enough in making referrals to justify a hearing survey being carried out by the teacher referral method alone. From the statements of the teachers and comparison with Curry’s findings, the teachers of this study were aided in their ability to recognize cases with <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> by the information sheets describing the characteristics of the hard of hearing child. The selection of the method for conducting a hearing survey is somewhat indicated by the demands of the situation, and the availability of personnel and equipment. In this study of 9631 pupils, 751 pupils, 7. 80 per cent of the total population, were found to have impaired hearing. These statistics compare favorably with those reported in the related literature of this study. There was no difference in the ability of the teachers in Survey I to identify serious <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> or slight <b>hearing</b> <b>losses.</b> A greater incidence of slight <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> was reported through the use of the method of conducting the screening tests followed immediately by the diagnostic evaluations than by the method of following the screening tests with diagnostic evaluations after one month or more. If the population of this study is similar to the public and parochial school population of approximately 297, 000 school children in kindergarten through grade twelve in the state of Nebraska, it could be expected that an estimated 23, 166 pupils with <b>hearing</b> <b>losses</b> would be found in the schools of Nebraska. If the method of training an individual in screening testing is followed by an audiologist’s evaluation is employed in conducting a hearing survey of the school population in Nebraska, approximately 28, 000 man hours would be involved in the administration of such a hearing survey.
