50|$|Basically, {{there are}} four {{techniques}} used {{in the design of}} jobs. These include <b>Job</b> <b>simplification,</b> Job enlargement, Job enrichment and Job rotation.|$|E
50|$|On the {{negative}} side, <b>job</b> <b>simplification</b> results in workers experiencing boredom, frustration, alienation, {{lack of motivation}} and low job satisfaction. This, in turn, leads to lower productivity and increased cost.|$|E
50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>simplification</b> is {{a design}} method whereby jobs {{are divided into}} smaller {{components}} and subsequently assigned to workers as whole jobs. Simplification of work requires that jobs {{be broken down into}} their smallest units and then analysed. Each resulting sub-unit typically consists of relatively few operations. These subunits are then assigned to the workers as their total job.Many fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, Burger King and KFC use simplification because employees can learn tasks rapidly; short work cycles allow task performance with little or no mental effort and low-skilled and low-paid employees can be hired and trained easily.|$|E
40|$|Work {{redesign}} is {{not only}} important for the wellbeing of the employee, {{but it has also}} captured the imagination and zeal of some employers. Recent studies (Hendry, 1990; Cordery, Mueller 2 ̆ 6 Smith, 1991) have indicated that employees become more positive and enthusiastic towards their jobs and employers experience gains in productivity. Over the years many people have examined the concept and need for work redesign (Hackman 2 ̆ 6 Oldham, 1976; Galbraith, 1984; Pasmore, 1988). Concepts such as work <b>simplification,</b> <b>job</b> enrichment, job enlargement, socio-technical redesign, alternative work arrangements and quality of work life programmes have been introduced, developed and implemented. This paper seeks to ascertain the possibility of redesigning work in organizations, by examining instances where this has occurred, where it is occurring and where it could possibly occur...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{justification}} of organisation’s structure for strategy implementation. The study sought to evaluate the implication of job enrichment and job specification in public sector organisations, analyze the justification for job specification and job description in public sector organisations, determine the implication of environmental influence on organizational structure, and determine the organisation's purpose, mission and objectives. The study was descriptive and was carried out primarily through interview of employees in three public sector organizations in Nigeria. Secondary data which were mainly qualitative were obtained through books and journals. Findings indicated that job enrichment increases worker's involvement and interest in their job while <b>job</b> <b>simplification</b> reduces efficiency and makes employees demotivated and unhappy. Job specification identifies the qualification of an individual to a particular job while job description identifies the tasks, duties, and activities required in a particular job. Job description {{could be used to}} develop a fair and comprehensive compensation and reward system. However, the study recommended that efficiency can further be realized in as much as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly at a low costs...|$|E
40|$|In July 2012, Regional Regulation of Banten Province Number 3 Year 2012 about The Establishment of The Provincial Department of Banten was enacted. The {{regulation}} mandated {{changes in}} Organizational Structure and Work Procedures (SOTK) in Department of Finance and Regional Asset Management (DPKAD) of Banten Province, {{the function of}} asset management was diverted and DPKAD was turned into Department of Revenue and Finance (DPPKD) of Banten Province. Changes in SOTK were aimed {{to make a better}} department 2 ̆ 7 s performance. In transition period to desired condition, there will be a decline in productivity. To minimize the size and the period of declined productivity, the right change management strategy is needed. This study aims to formulate a change management strategy in DPKAD of Banten Province. Data was collected through the distribution of questionnaires to 112 respondents and conducted interviews with 5 of Chief in DPKAD. From the collected data, it was discovered that 4 major restraining forces in DPKAD are fear of losing incentives, problems in system 2 ̆ 7 s synchronization, skepticism, and change the way employees work. 4 major driving forces are mandated in Regional Regulation, <b>job</b> <b>simplification,</b> desire to obtain WTP and develop job performance. In formulating change management strategy, this research used ADKAR model approach, communication strategy, and designing reward system through KPI as performance assessment which is expected to motivate employee to improve their performance...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{tenet of}} {{traditional}} industrial engineering {{is that a}} factory worker can be manipulated, through {{time and motion study}} procedures and other techniques, into enriching his company at the expense of himself. The truth is that a man on the job can outfox the company almost every time. Nobody is going to work faster or better if it means cutting his own throat…. People – and their brains – are the most precious resource we have in our shop … Our most valuable partners in cutting waste are the people on the production floor, who know their jobs better than anyone. The above quotation comes from Clair Vough’s (Vough & Asbell, 1975 : 6 - 7) introduction to a book about increasing productivity through redesigning the assembly lines at IBM in the 1950 - 60 ’s. At the time that this redesign was being implemented, the Taylorism and <b>job</b> <b>simplification</b> prevalent in the early 1900 ’s was giving way to a new philosophy on jobs; one that emphasized how employee’s experienced their work and recognized that the way work was designed mattered to employees, and should therefore matter to the organization. The understanding of how people experience and shape their jobs remains a salient issue today, especially given the multitude of management practices that have work design issues at thei...|$|E
40|$|Trailblazing {{findings}} on integrated and participative technology, organization and personnel development were {{produced by the}} HHLA Work and Technology Projekt. What they prove, among other things, is the following: Complex design processes can be mastered if the inter-disciplinary and cooperative development of work and technology systems takes place as a feedback concept based on corporate development guidelines for which a consensus exists. The concept of integrative process management {{has proved to be}} successful procedural path. Learning and working are supported by standardized DP systems whose use is simplified by situatively suitable support funktions. The participative design of applications improves the suitability of tasks and reduces the need for subsequent changes and the risk of non-acceptance. Older employees or those unused to learning can be qualified to carry out such tasks providing there is a guaranteed integration of buisiness and DP qualifications with clear emphasis on the employees' past experience. The concept of qualifications' engineering points to the necessity of organizing personnel development just as systematically as technological development is. Providing due consideration given to the possibilities of personnel and organizational changes, DP development can lead to <b>job</b> <b>simplification,</b> extension and enrichment when linked to the appropriate qualifications' concept. Improvements in the service offering in the form of personality-enhancing work contents have been achieved through coordinated development and the structuring of work to suit an employee's qualificationsAvailable from TIB Hannover: F 93 B 1184 +a / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekSIGLEBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|Context Job {{rotation}} {{has been}} proposed as a managerial practice to be applied in the organizational environment to reduce job monotony, boredom, and exhaustion resulting from <b>job</b> <b>simplification,</b> specialization, and repetition. The scientific literature distinguishes between job-to-job and project-to-project rotations. Despite the potential benefits and its actual use on behalf of software companies, {{we do not have}} an accumulated body of scientific knowledge about benefits and limitations of job rotation in software engineering practice. In particular, we have no concrete empirical evidence about the use of project-to-project rotations in practice. Goal We aim to identify and discuss evidence about project-to-project (P 2 P) job rotation, {{in order to understand the}} potential benefits and limitations of this practice in software organizations. Method We deployed a mix-method research strategy to collect and analyze empirical evidence from the scientific literature, performing a systematic literature review, on one hand and from industrial practice, performing qualitative case studies on the other. We synthesized the evidence using techniques from meta-ethnography. Results We found eight benefits, nine limitations, and two factors classified as both benefits and limitations of P 2 P rotations in software engineering. Different research methods yielded confirmatory and complementary evidence, emphasizing the importance of conducting mix-method research. We found no contradictory evidence and five factors were identified in more than one study using different research methods, contributing to the strength of the evidence. Conclusion We synthesized evidence from multiple sources and used different research methods concerning the benefits and limitations of P 2 P rotation in software engineering practice. Our findings show that rotation tends to benefit important job outcomes, such as motivation, and to decrease job monotony. The main limitations were associated with the potential increase in intra-group social conflicts, individual cognitive effort, and workload, and a temporary decrease in productivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{centralized}} {{structure of}} {{ownership of the}} local television industry in the United States today has resulted {{from a combination of}} regulatory and market pressures. This dissertation analyzes the ways in which centralizing tendencies in ownership structure have been accompanied by the centralization of operations. As station groups add more stations and seek to operate the stations they already own in an ever more profitable manner, changed industrial practices are vitally important because they have direct effects upon the product of those stations, especially local television news. In analyzing such centralizing tendencies, the project focuses not only on centralization of ownership and operation, but on two further factors as well: changing interpretations of the "public interest" and the development of technologies for local television stations. Changing interpretations of the "public interest" provision of regulatory law permitted and encouraged station groups to grow larger, redefining the structure of the local television industry, even in the times of heaviest restriction. In terms of technological development, after a brief period of equipment designed simply to get product on the air, television equipment developers followed a consistent guiding principle of staff reduction and <b>job</b> <b>simplification</b> which aided this momentum towards centralization. The combination of changing ownership structures, shifts in understandings of "public interest," and new technologies has resulted in new business models built around invoking economies of scale, including centralcasting and multi-channel operation. These new business models have dramatically altered the program product of local television stations, especially local news. News programming, which initially entered broadcasting in response to the regulatory mandate that broadcasters serve the public in return for free access to the public airwaves, has been transformed into a primary source of local station revenue. This commodified version of news programming is the logical result of practices begun in newspapers and continued in radio broadcasting. The news product of local stations is an area of vital concern in the present day media environment, as the quantity of news on the air increases without a corresponding increase in newsroom resources, jeopardizing the quality and veracity of those news programs...|$|E
