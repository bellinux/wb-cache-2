2500|$|As {{with any}} {{security}} measure, passwords vary in effectiveness (i.e., strength); some are weaker than others. For example, {{the difference in}} weakness between a <b>dictionary</b> <b>word</b> and a word with obfuscation (i.e., letters in the password are substituted by, say, numbers — a common approach) may cost a password cracking device a few more seconds; this adds little strength. The examples below illustrate various ways weak passwords might be constructed, {{all of which are}} based on simple patterns which result in extremely low entropy, allowing them to be tested automatically at high speeds.: ...|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} {{exceedingly}} useful words in this language. SCHLAG, for example; and ZUG. There are {{three-quarters of a}} column of SCHLAGS in the dictonary, and a column {{and a half of}} ZUGS. The word SCHLAG means Blow, Stroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin, Stamp, Kind, Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure, Field, Forest-clearing. This is its simple and EXACT meaning--that is to say, its restricted, its fettered meaning; but there are ways by which you can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of the morning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word you please to its tail, and make it mean anything you want to. You can begin with SCHLAG-ADER, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole <b>dictionary,</b> <b>word</b> by word, clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER, which means bilge-water--and including SCHLAG-MUTTER, which means mother-in-law.|$|E

Cryptonyms are sometimes written with a slash after the digraph, e.g., ZR/RIFLE, and sometimes in one sequence, e.g., ZRRIFLE. The latter format is the more common style in CIA documents.|$|E

This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} correction of optically read Devanagari character strings using a Hindi <b>word</b> <b>dictionary.</b> The <b>word</b> <b>dictionary</b> is partitioned {{in order to reduce}} the search space besides preventing forced match to an incorrect <b>word.</b> The <b>dictionary</b> partitioning strategy takes into account the underlying OCR process. The <b>dictionary</b> <b>words</b> at the top level have been divided into two partitions, namely: short words partition and the remaining words partition. The short word partition is sub-partitioned using the envelop information of the words. The envelope consists of the number of top, lower, core modifiers along with the number of core characters. Devanagari characters are written in three strips. Most of the characters referred to as core characters are written in the middle strip. The remainin...|$|R

5000|$|In 1976, Frank Rubin {{produced}} an incomplete ten-square containing two nonsense phrases {{at the top}} and eight <b>dictionary</b> <b>words.</b> If two words could be found containing the patterns [...] "SCENOOTL" [...] and [...] "HYETNNHY", this would become a complete ten-square.|$|R

50|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} here in 1913. The {{name comes from}} the <b>dictionary</b> <b>word</b> meaning a standard by which to judge quality.

Although other local residents preferred the name Three Notches, for a large, notched juniper tree growing nearby, the Post Office rejected the two-word proposal in favor of the single word, Criterion. The post office closed in 1926.|$|E
50|$|For example: a user might first {{instruct}} {{the operating system}} to load a word processor program from one file, and then edit a document stored in another file with the word processor program. In this example, the document would be considered data. If the word processor also features a spell checker, then the <b>dictionary</b> (<b>word</b> list) for the spell checker would also be considered data. The algorithms used by the spell checker to suggest corrections would be either machine code data or text in some interpretable programming language.|$|E

50|$|Oxford University Press, {{which publishes}} the Oxford English Dictionary {{and many other}} dictionaries, announces an Oxford <b>Dictionaries</b> UK <b>Word</b> of the Year and an Oxford <b>Dictionaries</b> US <b>Word</b> of the Year; {{sometimes}} {{these are the same}} word. The Word of the Year need not have been coined within the past twelve months but it does need to have become prominent or notable during that time. There is no guarantee that the Word of the Year will be included in any Oxford dictionary. The Oxford <b>Dictionaries</b> <b>Words</b> of the Year are selected by editorial staff from each of the Oxford dictionaries. The selection team is made up of lexicographers and consultants to the dictionary team, and editorial, marketing, and publicity staff.|$|R

50|$|The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) {{security}} protocols {{were later}} created {{to address the}} problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a <b>dictionary</b> <b>word</b> or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.|$|E
50|$|Levenshtein automata may be {{used for}} {{spelling}} correction, by finding words in a given dictionary that are close to a misspelled word. In this application, once a word is identified as being misspelled, its Levenshtein automaton may be constructed, and then applied to all of the words in the dictionary to determine which ones are close to the misspelled word. If the dictionary is stored in compressed form as a trie, the time for this algorithm (after the automaton has been constructed) is proportional to the number of nodes in the trie, significantly faster than using dynamic programming to compute the Levenshtein distance separately for each <b>dictionary</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
