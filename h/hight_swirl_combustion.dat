Laboratory-scale burners which reduce {{the scale of the}} investigative challenge but retain the underlying fundamental behaviours associated with full- or pilot-scale set-ups {{play a key role in}} these advances. Such laboratory-scale burner platforms must embody essential phenomena present in full-scale systems such as the formation of primary and secondary recirculation zones. They must also span a dynamic operating envelope which allows the initiation of multi-modal (time varying) instabilities over a range of flame stabilization regimes. This paper presents a fixed-scope overview of experimental works on laboratory-scale swirl flame burners where significant reporting of results or data bases exists. The study focuses on selected gaseous fuel burners that span premixed, partially premixed and non-premixed combustion over unconfined and confined conditions.

With fuel jet increase: the width of recirculating zone and axial mean velocity peaks changes little; length of recirculation zone and the biggest reverse flow velocity increases; the expansion angle of swirling jet increase at first, and then changes little; axial non-uniform coefficient of outlet reduces at first, and then increases. With airflow velocity increase: axial mean velocity peaks increase; the dimension of recirculating zone and the expansion angle of swirling jet are unchanged; axial non-uniform coefficient of outlet increases.

40|$|Abstract—A {{diesel engine}} {{requires}} close tolerances {{to achieve its}} compression ratio. The air entering the engine must be clean, free of debris and as cool as possible. Also to improve engine’s efficiency, the compressed air must be cooled after being compressed.

In this regard, design of valve controller and most importantly valve mixer mechanism with fin arrangements has taken into consideration.

Technology of low emission stirred swirl (TeLESS), which is characterized with stratified swirl flow, has been developed in Beihang University to reduce NOX emission. However, large-scale flow structure would be induced in strong swirl flow. Experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation were carried out to investigate the unsteady flow feature and its mechanism in TeLESS combustor. Hotwire was firstly applied to testing the unsteady flow feature and a distinct mode with 2244 Hz oscillation frequency occurred at the pilot swirl outlet. The flow mode amplitude decayed convectively. Large eddy simulation (LES) was then applied to predicting this flow mode and know about its mechanism. The deviation of mode prediction compared with hotwire test was 0. 8 %. The spiral isobaric structure in pilot flow passage indicates that precessing vortex core (PVC) existed. The velocity spectrum and phase lag analysis suggest that the periodic movement at the pilot outlet was dominated by precessing movement. Negative tangential momentum gradient reflects that the swirl flow was unstable. Another phenomenon was {{found out that the}} PVC movement was intermittently rotated along the symmetric axis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Swirl</b> {{stabilized}} <b>combustion</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} successful technologies for flame and nitrogen oxides control in gas turbines. However, complex fluid dynamics and lean conditions pose a problem for stabilization of the flame. The problem is even more acute when alternative fuels are used for flexible operation. Although there is active research on the topic, there are still various gaps in the understanding of how interaction of large coherent structures during the process affect flame stabilization and related phenomena. Thus, this paper approaches the phenomenon of lean premixed <b>swirl</b> <b>combustion</b> of CH 4 /H 2 /CO blends to understand the impacts of these fuels on flame blowoff. An atmospheric pressure generic swirl burner was operated at ambient inlet conditions. Different exhaust nozzles were used to alter the Central Recirculation Zone and observe the impacts caused by various fuel blends on the structure and the blowoff phenomenon. Methane content in the fuel was decreased from 50 % to 10 % (by volume) with the remaining amount split equally between carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Experimental trials were performed using Phase Locked PIV. The Central Recirculation Zone and its velocity profiles were measured and correlated providing details of the structure close to blowoff. The results show how the strength and size of the recirculation zone are highly influenced by the fuel blend, changing stability based on the carbon-hydrogen ratios. Nozzle effects on the shear flow and Re numbers were also observed. Modelling was carried out using the k-ω SST CFD model which provided more information about the impact of the CRZ and the flame nature close to blowoff limit. It was observed that the model under-predicts coherent structure interactions at high methane fuel content, with an over-prediction of pressure decay at low methane content when correlated to the experimental results. Thus, complex interactions between structures need to be included for adequate power prediction when using very fast/slow syngas blends under lean conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the liquid fuel spray and flow field characteristics inside a combustor is crucial for designing a fuel efficient and low emission device. Characterisation of the flow field of a model gas turbine liquid swirl burner is performed by using a 2 -D particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) system. The flow field pattern of an axial flow burner with a fixed swirl intensity is compared under confined and unconfined conditions, i. e., with and without the combustor wall. The effect of temperature on the main swirling air flow is investigated under open and non-reacting conditions. The result shows that axial and radial velocities increase {{as a result of}} decreased flow density and increased flow volume. The flow field of the main swirling flow with liquid fuel spray injection is compared to non-spray swirling flow. Introduction of liquid fuel spray changes the swirl air flow field at the burner outlet, where the radial velocity components increase for both open and confined environment. Under reacting condition, the enclosure generates a corner recirculation zone that intensifies the strength of radial velocity.

The study covers a wide range of engine load and speed operating conditions, comprising measurements of cylinder pressure diagrams, high-pressure fuel pipe pressures, exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumptions, exhaust smokiness and exhaust gas emissions (nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide). Processing of the measurements provides important performance parameters such as maximum combustion pressure, dynamic injection timing, ignition delay, combustion irregularity and knocking tendency. The differences in the measured performance and exhaust emission parameters are determined for engine operation with JP- 8 fuel, against baseline engine operation using diesel fuel. The study shows that the exhaust emission levels are not much different for operation with the two fuels. On the contrary, operation with JP- 8 fuel increases combustion pressures, combustion intensity and irregularity. This is caused mainly by high pressure fluctuations present in the fuel injection system due to the different physical properties of JP- 8 fuel (compared to diesel fuel), which totally change the injection characteristics. Retardation of the static injection timing is one means of improving this situation, while using the same fuel injection equipment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

The principal focus is put {{on the development of}} high efficient solution method and high accurate scheme for chemical species transport equations. Based on the finite volume frame, an implicit method is developed to solve the 3 -D Navier-Stokes equations and chemical species transport equations in general curvilinear coordinates. A distinctive feature of this method is that the contravariant velocities are employed as the dependent variables. The momentum equations of contravariant velocities are discretized in staggered control volumes while the energy equations and species equations are integrated basically by using a cell-centered finite volume scheme. In this way, the discretized mass equation remains its simple form as in the Cartesian grids and the stencil is spatially the compactest. A third-order monotone upwind-biased scheme by van Leer (described by Anderson at. al. 1986) is used for all the convection terms of flow equations and species equations to minimize numerical diffusion and maintain the sharp gradients present in flames.

Prior analyses and laboratory scale data indicated that for Coal Tech's 20 MMBtu/hour, air-cooled, slagging coal combustor slag mass flow rates in excess of 400 lb/hr should limit sulfur re-evolution.

A total of 36 days of testing on the combustor were completed during the period of performance of this project.
