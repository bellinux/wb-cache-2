In Afshar's variant, light generated by a laser passes through two closely spaced circular pinholes (not slits). After the dual pinholes, a lens refocuses the light so {{that the image of}} each pinhole falls on separate photon-detectors (Fig. 1). A photon that goes through pinhole number one impinges only on detector number one, and similarly, if it goes through pinhole two it impinges only on detector number two, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> see the pinholes separately in the image plane close to the mirrors before the photon-detectors.|$|E

As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu, [...] "There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> need as many different translations as possible" [...] (p. xxii). The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear (particularly when translating regulated verse, or lǜshi), and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works (Hawkes writes that [...] "his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation"—p. ix). One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese. His are free translations, which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection, and secondly to [...] "translate out" [...] the references in those works which he does select.|$|E

The team created the top-down portions to allow Jason to shoot in all directions and to enable them to [...] "express large bosses that really had an impact". They did not want to design the gameplay in a linear progression; instead they drew inspiration from and were influenced by Nintendo's Metroid to create a game that allowed players to freely move between levels. According to Iwata: [...] "We wanted the player to experience the feeling of excitement that comes from discovering something after endeavoring through a difficult search, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> composed a map that allowed the player to move freely between different areas. We really put a great deal of thought into that element of the game design and, I mean this in the best possible way, but we wanted the player to have to struggle." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background. French had starred in the BBC's EastEnders, while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in Brookside. Griffin had also appeared in ITV's Coronation Street. Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen {{have come out of}} soaps in the past few years. There is a fantastic amount of talent on those shows." [...] This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former Brookside actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, Star Wars actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and Family Affairs star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later roles were awarded to comedian Adrian Edmondson, former film actress Patsy Kensit, and Jesus of Nazareth star Powell. When Jane Asher was cast in the recurring role of Lady Byrne in 2007, Inside Soap magazine asked Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out [...] "well-known-names". She responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them.

500|$|While non-Chinese analysts {{generally}} {{agree that}} the CCP has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CCP itself disagrees. Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CCP's formal commitment to Marxism {{with the introduction of}} the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> talk about a 'socialist market economy' with Chinese characteristics." [...] The attainment of true [...] "communism" [...] is still described as the CCP's and China's [...] "ultimate goal". While the CCP claims that China is in the primary stage of socialism, party theorists argue that the current development stage [...] "looks a lot like capitalism". Alternatively, certain party theorists argue that [...] "capitalism is the early or first stage of communism." [...] Some have dismissed the concept of a primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism. According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a China analyst, [...] "When I first heard this rationale, I thought it more comic than clever—a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics.

500|$|As the Cold War set in, the {{alliance}} with the Communists became increasingly damaging for the RDA. The French colonial administration showed itself increasingly hostile toward the RDA and its president, whom the administration called a [...] "Stalinist". Tensions reached their height {{at the beginning of}} 1950, when, following an outbreak of anti-colonial violence, almost the entire PDCI leadership was arrested; Houphouët-Boigny managed to slip away shortly before police arrived at his house. Although Houphouët-Boigny would have been saved by his parliamentary immunity, his missed arrest was popularly attributed to his influence and his prestige. In the ensuing chaos, riots broke out in Côte d'Ivoire; the most significant of which was a clash with the police at Dimbokro in which 13 Africans were killed and 50 wounded. According to official figures, by 1951 a total of 52 Africans had been killed, several hundred wounded and around 3,000 arrested (numbers which, according to an opinion reported by journalist Ronald Segal in African Profiles, are certainly underestimated). In order to defuse the crisis, Prime Minister René Pleven entrusted the France's Minister for Overseas Territories, François Mitterrand, with the task of detaching the RDA from the PCF, and in fact an official alliance between the RDA and Mitterrand's party, the UDSR, was established in 1952. Knowing he was at an impasse, in October 1950, Houphouët-Boigny agreed to break the Communist alliance. Asked in an undated interview why he worked with the communists, Houphouët-Boigny replied: [...] "I, a bourgeois landowner, I would preach the class struggle? That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> aligned ourselves with the Communist Party, without joining it." ...|$|E
500|$|Zak Penn, {{who wrote}} {{a draft of the}} first film in 1996, said the film would follow up Hulk, but {{stressed}} it would be more tonally similar to the TV show and Bruce Jones' run on the comic. He compared his script to Aliens, which was a very different film from Alien, but still in the same continuity. He included two scenes from his 1996 script: Banner jumping from a helicopter to trigger a transformation, and realizing he is unable to have sex with Betty. After the studio rejected a treatment by another screenwriter in 2006, Penn wrote three drafts before departing in early 2007 to promote his film The Grand. Norton, that April, began discussions to play Banner, and arranged a deal that included him as both an actor and a writer, with a screenplay draft he was contractually obligated to turn in within a month. He did so, and continued to polish his draft as late as halfway through principal photography. In November 2006, a June 13, 2008 release date was set. Leterrier acknowledged the only remaining similarity between the two films was Bruce hiding in South America, and that the film was a unique reboot, as generally audiences would have expected another forty-minute origin story. There were previous discussions to set the first act in Thailand. Leterrier felt audiences were left restless waiting for the character to arrive in Ang Lee's film. Feige commented, [...] "we didn't want to tell the origin story again, because we thought people were so familiar with it, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> didn't tell that... One reason we made Incredible Hulk was to get Hulk into the [...] canon." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, but I know I will not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past."
