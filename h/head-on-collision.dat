40|$|Discussing the {{limitations}} on the validity of classical electrodynamics, we show that present day laser pulse technology applied to <b>head-on-collisions</b> with relativistic electrons generates fields strong enough to permit experimentation at the limits of validity of the Lorentz force, {{and the development of}} experimental tests of Mach's principle. We also discuss more distant opportunities for exploring the nature of laws of physics and the vacuum structure. We then conclude that the predictions of quantum electrodynamics in the presence of critical fields are not completely satisfactory and argue that the study of Laser materialization into particle pairs opens a new domain of quantum electrodynamics.

5000|$|In his prime, Andrews was {{regarded}} as arguably the most bruising, powerful running back in the NFL. Ronnie Lott would later state that a <b>head-on-collision</b> he had with Andrews during a game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Falcons on December 19, 1982 was the hardest hit that he had received during his NFL career. In addition to leading the NFL in yards from scrimmage in 1981, Andrews also {{finished in the top}} four in that category three other times. Despite the brevity of his career, Andrews is still the Falcons' all-time yards from scrimmage leader with a total of 8,633. He was named as the Falcons Player of the Year in both 1981 and 1983. [...] To celebrate his career, his number 31 was retired in 2004 by the Falcons. Andrews was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{treating}} the arteries as a thin walled, prestressed elastic tube {{and the blood}} as an incompressible viscous fluid of variable viscosity, we have studied the interactions of two nonlinear waves, in the long wave approximation, {{through the use of}} extended PLK perturbation method, and the evolution equations are shown to be the Korteweg-deVries-Burgers equation. The results show that, Up to O(is an element of(3 / 2)), the <b>head-on-collision</b> of two nonlinear progressive waves is elastic and the nonlinear progressive waves preserve their original properties after the collision. The phase functions for each wave are derived explicitly and it is shown that they are not straight lines anymore, they are rather some curves. Publisher's Versio...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the null geometry of a multiple black hole event horizon {{in terms of}} a conformal rescaling of a flat space null hypersurface. For the prolate spheroidal case, we show that the method reproduces the pair-of-pants shaped horizon found in the numerical simulation of the <b>head-on-collision</b> of black holes. For the oblate case, it reproduces the initially toroidal event horizon found in the numerical simulation of collapse of a rotating cluster. The analytic nature of the approach makes further conclusions possible, such as a bearing on the hoop conjecture. From a time reversed point of view, the approach yields a description of the past event horizon of a fissioning white hole, which can be used as null data for the characteristic evolution of the exterior space-time.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{based on a}} one {{dimensional}} model, we consider the <b>head-on-collision</b> of nonlinear electron-acoustic waves in a plasma composed of a cold electron fluid, hot electrons obeying a trapped/vortex-like distribution, and stationary ions. The analysis {{is based on the}} use of extended Poincare, Lighthill-Kuo method [C. H. Su and R. M. Mirie, J. Fluid Mech. 98, 509 (1980); R. M. Mirie and C. H. Su, J. Fluid Mech. 115, 475 (1982) ]. It is shown that, for the first order approximation, the waves propagating in opposite directions are characterized by modified Korteweg-de Vries equations. In contrary to the results of previous investigations on this subject, we showed that the phase shifts are functions of both amplitudes of the colliding waves. The numerical results indicate that the waves with larger amplitude experience smaller phase shifts. Such a result seems to be plausible from physical considerations. Publisher's Versio...|$|E

"Safety is of {{paramount}} importance to manufacturers of roadway vehicles. Although {{in the past few years}} much progress has been made in the field of passenger safety in cars, there is still a strong need for the design of a more crashworthy vehicle in a frontal collision. Therefore, a vehicle crash test performance and how well the vehicle protects the front seat passengers in a <b>head-on-collision</b> is an essential part of the design of the vehicle. Over the past twelve years, the modeling of components and crash analysis of entire vehicles have become increasingly significant. In this thesis, a Ford Taurus model is analyzed in a frontal full-width and offset impact. This thesis describes the comparison of structural damage on a vehicle colliding with rigid pole as compared to the same vehicle model colliding with a barrier. The reason for selecting a rigid pole was to consider the worst-case scenario. The NHTSA has rules and regulations for barrier crashes; however it does not have any standards for pole crashes. In reality, there are many pole related vehicle crashes every year. Pole crashes involve vehicles colliding with utility and traffic light poles. Our purpose was to study the intrusion and injury values for the pole test and compare it with the barrier testing method of NHTSA. These simulations are carried under the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The simulations are obtained using LS-DYNA 3 D crash code. The rigid barrier, deformable barrier and pole are modeled in MSC/PATRAN. The accelerations at various points are recorded. The occupant compartment intrusions are compared between pole and barrier. Finally the responses of an occupant for the crash tests are studied in Mathematical Dynamical Models (MADYMO) by placing the dummy inside the dyna model. The dummy is placed in the car using extended coupling. A hybrid III 50 th percentile male dummy model is used to study the occupant responses. The finite element shoulder and lap belts are modeled in MADYMO. The head accelerations are plotted and the HIC values are calculated. For the crash test the occupant foot injury during compartment intrusion is evaluated by calculating the tibia index and tibia forces. The barrier and the pole test results are compared and the results showed that the intrusions and injury values are more severe in the case of pole impact and in off-set crash there is a severe leg injury...|$|E
