2500|$|The Spanish {{and local}} Macabebe {{soldiers}} broke into loud laughter seeing the kneeling Duman in a feverish frenzy of emotion. [...] But unknown to them, Fr. Vicente Lapus {{was standing right}} behind the closed church door listening and watching everything through the small cracks. (This was how Payumu's prayer was recorded by Padre Lapus for posterity). The impatient Spanish lieutenant barked: “Puñeta! Todo esto lo que haces es ya de masiado! Levantate!” (Goddammit! This is all simply getting too much! Stand up!). Knowing no Spanish, Duman remained kneeling down and was weeping in utter hopelessness feeling abandoned to certain death by the Apu. [...] Without warning, a local soldier <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and forcefully pulled him up, yelling: “Puta naida mo! Ticdo na ca canu! Panaca ning alte! (Son of a bitch! Stand up now! You thunderstrucked!). Losing his balance, Duman fell to the ground. The guards pulled him up and brusquely pushed him forward to the execution spot, which was the corner church wall before reaching the present sacristy door.|$|E

60|$|The {{second day}} {{was like the}} first one, though their toil was if {{anything}} more arduous still, and {{on the evening of}} the fourth they came, worn out, dripping, and dejected, to a spot where the valley narrowed in. A strip of forest divided the rock from the river on the opposite shore, but between them and it a confusion of froth and foam swirled down, while the hillsides seemed to vibrate with the roar of the rapid. One glance sufficed to show that the crossing was wholly impossible for either beast or man. On their side of the river a wall of rock hemmed the little party in, and even Seaforth wondered, while Okanagan growled half-aloud, when Alton, knee-deep in water, plodded steadily on. There was not more than another hour's daylight, and Seaforth remembered that the gorge extended for a league or so, while the flood had spread across it in front of them, but he knew his comrade and said nothing. Presently he slipped from a boulder, and sank almost shoulder-deep in a whirling pool, but somebody <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> and after a breathless flounder he felt the shingle under him and the froth lapped only to his knee. Then they crawled amidst the driftwood which washed up and down beneath them, tearing garments and lacerating limbs, until they stood once more panting on dry shingle, with a broad stretch of froth before them, and the light growing dim.|$|E
50|$|In an altercation he {{had with}} Jean-Paul Marat, who fired a pistol at him from his pocket, Viennet <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and demanded he meet him for a duel at the bois de Boulogne - Marat {{declined}} the invitation.|$|E

500|$|The Radioactive Man {{commercial}} for Laramie cigarettes that Bart and Lisa watch {{at the convention}} is a takeoff of The Flintstones starring in Winston cigarette television commercials which aired during the 1960s. When Bart begs Mrs. Glick not to apply iodine to <b>his</b> wounded <b>arm,</b> she <b>grabs</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> and the scene shifts to their silhouettes as Bart screams, mirroring a scene in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind.

50|$|The version {{handed down}} by the Uys family {{as well as others}} that were present at the battle differs - {{according}} to them Dirkie Uys and another youngster were lagging behind the rest of the fleeing rescue party when they had to cross a stream with thick patches of reeds on its banks. While they were crossing it, a party of Zulus attacked them.

5000|$|Beatty himself {{recalled}} the episode: [...] "In some patricidal attempt {{to stand up}} to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it." [...] Biskind describes how [...] "Kazan <b>grabbed</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours."

She tearfully explains to Elias that Lukas's death was not his fault and she begs her son to set her free so they can both move on from the tragedy.

50|$|The {{church is}} the final resting place for Count Vratislav of Mitrovice. He was accidentally buried alive in the tomb. The tomb was created by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach. There is also a mummified forearm {{to the right of}} the tomb entrance, dating back over 400 years. The arm is the arm of a jewel thief who tried to steal from the high altar, which has a statue of the Virgin Mary.

Harada pulled her off the pilot, who then shot Ben Kanahele three times: in the groin, stomach, and upper leg.
