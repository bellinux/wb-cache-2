500|$|In a November 2013 {{interview}} with Q, Lorde expressed frustration about [...] "certain things about music": [...] "There {{are a lot}} of shock tactics these days. People trying to outdo each other, which will probably culminate in two people fucking on stage at the Grammys." [...] Following the release of Pure Heroine, she also described herself as a [...] "sex-positive" [...] person, elaborating:People like to paint me in a certain way, but I'm a hugely sex-positive person and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> anyone getting naked. For me personally I just don't think it really would complement my music in any way or help me tell a story any better. It's not like I have a problem with dancing around in undies—I think you can use that stuff in a hugely powerful way. It just hasn't felt necessary for me.|$|E
500|$|Negatively, Mika was {{included}} in Complexs list of the [...] "lamest" [...] Street Fighter characters, reasoning [...] "Street Fighter has never been shy with the gorgeous ladies, but they've always had full-figured back stories {{to go along with}} their full-figured backsides. Rainbow Mika on the other hand is the most blatant example of mysogynistic [...] character design seen in the series." [...] Todd Ciolek from Anime News Network declared Mika as [...] "the worst Street Fighter character," [...] reasoning [...] "every little detail about her annoyed me, from the stupid boob-hearts on her costume to the way she whomped opponents with her butt—and rubbed it after she hit the ground." [...] At Paste, Eric Van Allen criticized her outfit by stating [...] "Even by Street Fighter standards, this amount of gratuitous flesh is rather ridiculous." [...] However, this opinion is not shared between all critics, with Nadia Oxford of USgamer finding Mika to be an example of positive female gender representation, writing [...] "I can say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against,</b> er, voluptuous women in games. Or even scantily-clad women", and that [...] "My problem has always been women characters whom I'm expected to take seriously while they slay dragons/wander the desert/travel the frozen wastes while baring their midriff through the majority of their journey", and that she enjoys Mika's [...] "silly" [...] and [...] "goofy" [...] design.|$|E
2500|$|He continued: [...] "Let me {{be clear}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> homosexuals, or any other group, {{promoting}} their agenda through normal democratic means." [...] The majority's [...] "invention of a brand-new 'constitutional right'", he wrote, showed it was [...] "impatient of democratic change".|$|E
5000|$|In the 2000 Presidential election, Kristol {{supported}} John McCain. Answering {{a question}} from a PBS reporter about the Republican primaries, he said, [...] "No. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Governor Bush. <b>I</b> was inclined to prefer McCain. The reason I was inclined to prefer McCain was his leadership on foreign policy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you would," [...] he commented, simply. [...] "But {{just then}} I was too angry {{to talk to}} anybody. And so I cleared out on board my own ship and stayed there, {{not knowing what to}} do and wishing you all at the bottom of the sea. Don't mistake me, Mrs. Travers; it's you, the people aft, that I wished at the bottom of the sea. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the poor devils on board, They would have trusted me quick enough. So I fumed there till--till. [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|All told {{then we had}} {{a rather}} nondescript and poor pack of hounds; and the fact {{discouraged}} me. I wanted to hunt the bad cinnamons and the grizzly sheep-killers, with which this rim-rock country was infested. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the acorn-eating brown or black bears. And with this pack of hounds I doubted that we could hold one of the vicious fighting species. But there was now {{nothing to do but}} try. No one could tell. We might kill a big grizzly. And the fact that the chances were against us perhaps made for more determined effort. I regretted, however, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not secured a pack of trained hounds somewhere.|$|R
2500|$|Describing his religion, Rice {{stated in}} a 1982 interview, [...] "Technically I'm Church of England, {{which is really}} nothing. But I don't follow it. I wouldn't say I was a Christian. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> it." [...] Conversely, he also stated that he adapted the biblical stories of Joseph and Jesus to musicals because [...] "I'd always rather take a true story over an untrue one." ...|$|E
2500|$|A November 8, 2004, cartoon {{depicted}} {{mentally disabled}} children as classroom teachers {{in an attempt}} to make an analogy to American voters who reelected Bush, drawing complaints from advocates for the disabled and led to his cartoons being dropped from The Washington Posts website. Rall responded in his blog saying: [...] "I regret hurting people who <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against.</b> I do want to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable, and I think I failed in that with this cartoon. Not to mention that the cartoon failed—too many people got bogged down in the analogy and the main point got lost." ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> my husband--it {{was quite}} {{unreasonable}} to leave him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care how}} soon they go, Hawtrey. You {{know what my}} hopes are about Dorothy, and I feel pretty {{confident}} that Armstrong has altogether different views on the matter. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> him personally; I admit {{that he is a}} downright good fellow. Every one knows he has a good estate, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> him, except that I see he is doing his best to upset my special plans.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DOWEY. 'I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> the Surreys and the R.H.A. and the Buffs; {{but they}} are just {{breeches}} regiments, I understand.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If you please, sir," [...] {{said the}} same gentle voice, [...] "I had sooner that the lady should stay. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Mr. Thurnall, God knows. He has rather {{something}} against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I am in earnest. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> {{you as a}} man, but I {{have this}} against you as an officer--that you have not carried out that order, {{and if you do}} not report me I must report you. And I will.' ...|$|E
2500|$|If the Japanese {{decided to}} open a {{cultural}} center across from Pearl Harbor, that would be insensitive. If the Germans opened a Bach choral society across from Auschwitz, even after all these years, {{that would be an}} insensitive setting. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Islam. <b>I</b> just think: Why there? ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Squier {{talked about}} the {{experience}} as [...] "an MBA course in how a video can go totally wrong." [...] The video misrepresents who I am as an artist. I was a good-looking, sexy guy. That certainly didn't hurt in selling records. But in this video I'm sort of pretty boy. And I'm preening around a room. People said [...] "He's gay." [...] Or [...] "He's on drugs." [...] It was traumatizing to me. <b>I</b> mean, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> gays. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a lot of gay friends. But like it or not, {{it was more of}} a sticky point then. While he is still angry at Ortega, who he believes purposely misled and exploited him, he is philosophical about the video. [...] "The scars aren't that deep ... It's a bad part of a good life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I {{knew what}} was going to be done, of course. But why should I kill these warders? <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> them. But <b>I</b> was afraid of the others. Whatever happened, I could not escape from them. I sat alone on the stump of a tree with my head in my hands, sick at heart at the thought of a freedom that could be nothing but a mockery to me. Suddenly I was startled to {{perceive}} the shape of a man on the path near by. He stood perfectly still, then his form became effaced in the night. It must have been the chief warder coming to see what had become of his two men. No one noticed him. The convicts kept on quarrelling over their plans. The leaders could not get themselves obeyed. The fierce whispering of that dark mass of men was very horrible.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{there is}} to be {{discovered}} about Mr. Scarlett Trent, he can find out! But, Ernestine, I want you to understand this! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the man, and although I dislike him heartily, I think it is madness to associate him in any way with your father's death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; I am not {{thinking}} of individuals exactly. His want of generosity is to large masses,--to a party, to classes, to a people; whereas his generosity is for mankind at large. He assumes the god, affects to nod, and seems to shake the spheres. But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> him. He has asked me here to-night, and has talked to me most familiarly about Ireland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Notwithstanding which,' added Mr. Bounderby, 'if {{he can be}} laid hold of any sooner, {{he shall}} have an earlier {{opportunity}} of clearing himself. As to you, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> you; what you came and told me {{turns out to be}} true, and I have given you the means of proving it to be true, and there's an end of it. I wish you good night all! I must be off to look a little further into this.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes. That was undeniable. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> it. <b>I</b> {{could not}} <b>have</b> {{suggested}} a better arrangement, but I {{was not quite}} easy in my mind. Esther, Esther, why not? Esther, think! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> it," [...] said Oldbuck: [...] "it was {{not unusual}} to hide {{treasure}} in the tombs of the deceased--many instances might be quoted of that from Bartholinus and others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's a comical old fellow," [...] said Scrooge's nephew, [...] "that's the truth; {{and not so}} {{pleasant}} as {{he might}} be. However, his offences carry their own punishment, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say I think so, John. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> them. I don't {{believe they}} could come down at night without being heard; I feel sure they could not get into the shop without that stiff bolt making a noise. Still, as it is {{possible}} they may be concerned in the matter, I think that, now we have it in good train for getting {{to the bottom of}} it, it would be well to keep the matter altogether to ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{have made}} him happier," [...] she declared, {{correcting}} herself. [...] "He has no conception of what real happiness is. He thinks he is happy,-he doesn't need me. He'll be much more--contented without me. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> him. I was to blame for marrying him, I know. But I have only one life to live, and I can't throw it away, Peter, I can't. And I can't believe that {{a woman and a}} man were intended to live together without love. It is too horrible. Surely that isn't your idea of marriage!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Captain Reuben," [...] James Standing said, [...] "as I said before, {{it makes}} no {{difference}} to me where we go. If the Spaniards catch us there, they will cut our throats to a surety, if they can; but if you are ready to take your chance of that, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> it. I feel as if I am taken aback a bit, just now, as it comes new to me--my own fancy being that you intended to trade with the Turkish ports and islands, and had taken a strong crew on board to beat off any pirates that they might meet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{commands}} {{shall be}} obeyed, Miss Hannay. I {{did not know}} that Bathurst was a protege of the Major's {{as well as of the}} estimable Doctor, or <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> said <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Kate, {{after all}} he has done for us, of course <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> it; and I don't suppose you would mind, if <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> Still, <b>I</b> do think you might have done better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} not sold {{yourself}} for British gold, and for British acres, and for British rank, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> it," [...] said Miss Wallachia Petrie that same evening to her friend Caroline Spalding.|$|R
60|$|THE INCA [lifts {{his eyebrows}} pityingly; shrugs his shoulders; then, with indulgent {{paternal}} contempt]. Excellent lads, madam. Very honest affectionate creatures. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> them. Pongo imitates farmyard sounds--cock crowing {{and that sort}} of thing--extremely well. Lulu plays Strauss's Sinfonia Domestica on the mouth organ really screamingly. Chips keeps owls and rabbits. Spots motor bicycles. The Corsair commands canal barges and steers them himself. The Piffler writes plays, and paints most abominably. Jack Johnson trims ladies' hats, and boxes with professionals hired for that purpose. He is invariably victorious. Yes: they all have their different little talents. And also, of course, their family resemblances. For example, they all smoke; they all quarrel with one another; and they none of them appreciate their father, who, by the way, is no mean painter, though the Piffler pretends to ridicule his efforts.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing {{that resembles}} it. At a future time I will examine what man calls {{his mind and}} give you the details of that chaos, then you will see and understand. Men {{have nothing in common}} with me--there is no point of contact; they have foolish little {{feelings}} and foolish little vanities and impertinences and ambitions; their foolish little life is but a laugh, a sigh, and extinction; and they have no sense. Only the Moral Sense. I will show you what I mean. Here is a red spider, not so big as a pin's head. Can you imagine an elephant being interested in him--caring whether he is happy or isn't, or whether he is wealthy or poor, or whether his sweetheart returns his love or not, or whether his mother is sick or well, or whether he is looked up to in society or not, or whether his enemies will smite him or his friends desert him, or whether his hopes will suffer blight or his political ambitions fail, or whether he shall die in the bosom of his family or neglected and despised in a foreign land? These things can never be important to the elephant; they are nothing to him; he cannot shrink his sympathies to the microscopic size of them. Man is to me as the red spider is to the elephant. The elephant has nothing against the spider--he cannot get down to that remote level; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> man. The elephant is indifferent; I am indifferent. The elephant would not take the trouble to do the spider an ill turn; if he took the notion he might do him a good turn, if it came in his way and cost nothing. I have done men good service, but no ill turns.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{so would}} any other {{practical}} man!" [...] said Witherby. [...] "And that's just where Mr. Clayton and I differed. Well, I needn't allude to him any more," [...] he added leniently. [...] "What I wish {{to say is}} this, Mr. Hubbard. I am overworked, and I feel the need {{of some sort of}} relief. I know that I have started the Events in the right line at last,--the only line in which it can be made a great, useful, and respectable journal, efficient in every good cause,--and what I want now is some sort of assistant in the management who shall be in full sympathy with my own ideas. I don't want a mere slave,--a tool; but I do want an independent, right-minded man, who shall be with me for the success of the paper the whole time and every time, and shall not be continually setting up his will against mine on all sorts of doctrinaire points. That was the trouble with Mr. Clayton. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> Mr. Clayton personally; he is an excellent young man in very many respects; but he was all wrong about journalism, all wrong, Mr. Hubbard. I talked with him a great deal, and tried to make him see where his interest lay. He had been on the paper as a reporter from the start, and I wished very much to promote him to this position; which he could have made the best position in the country. The Events is an evening paper; there is no night-work; and the whole thing is already thoroughly systematized. Mr. Clayton had plenty of talent, and {{all he had to do}} was to step in under my direction and put his hand on the helm. But, no! I should have been glad to keep him in a subordinate capacity; but I had to let him go. He said that he would not report the conflagration of a peanut-stand for a paper conducted on the principles I had developed to him. Now, that is no way to talk. It's absurd." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> him," [...] Captain Forster said; [...] "but {{he was a}} poor {{creature}} at school, and I do {{not think}} that there was any love lost between us. Did you know him before you came here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to say <b>against</b> him,--not a word.

6000|$|We {{are moving}} {{steadily}} southward-getting {{further and further}} down under the projecting paunch of the globe. Yesterday evening we saw the Big Dipper and the north star sink below the horizon and disappear from our world. No, not [...] "we," [...] but they. They saw it--somebody saw it--and told me about it. But it is no matter, I was not caring for those things, I am tired of them, any way. I think they are well enough, but one doesn't want them always hanging around. My interest was all in the Southern Cross. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen that. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard about it all my life, and it was but natural that I should be burning to see it. No other constellation makes so much talk. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>against</b> the Big Dipper --and naturally couldn't have anything against it, since it is a citizen of our own sky, and {{the property of the}} United States--but I did want it {{to move out of the}} way and give this foreigner a chance. Judging by the size of the talk which the Southern Cross <b>had</b> made, <b>I</b> supposed it would need a sky all to itself.|$|R
