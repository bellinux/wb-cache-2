5|$|Because the {{affected}} area is extremely remote, distributing the relief supplies was difficult. Reaching some villages would require a five-hour <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> unpaved roads, some of which had collapsed or had been covered by landslides during the earthquake.

5|$|A Phoenix {{municipal}} bond election in March 2006 provided $2 {{million to the}} project, marking {{the first time the}} zoo has received public funds in its history. On 8 June 2006, then-zoo director Jeff Williamson announced a major fund-raising <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> the next 10 years to update the zoo's infrastructure and many of its aging exhibits. The zoo needs to raise $70 million to complete the project. In 2009, a shorter term goal is to raise $20 million by 2012 to pay for a number of improvements that are already under way.|$|E

Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving , enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> sand.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia replaced Brownwho {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings with the all rounder Loxton, {{who had made}} an unbeaten 47 against Surrey and 159 not out against Gloucestershire. England made 363 after electing to bat. On the second day, Australia were in trouble when Hassett came in at 2/13. Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter was beaten in flight by Jack Young. Aiming to break Young's restrictive leg side bowling, Hassett charged down the pitch and lofted a drive for four. However, in attempting a similar lofted <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> cover, he mishit the ball, which was caught by Cyril Washbrook at wide mid-off. This left Australia at 3/82 and they eventually made 221 to avoid the follow on by eight runs.|$|E
5|$|May {{brought on}} the {{part-time}} spin of Brian Close and 15 runs came in two overs, helping Davidson {{to feel more}} at ease. At the time, Allen had bowled 25 maidens in 37 overs. Davidson responded to the situation by hitting Allen out of the attack. In Allen's 10th over for the day, Davidson took 20 runs. He lofted an off <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> the boundary for six, and drove through the covers for four from both {{the front and back}} foot. Davidson then hit the bowler out of the stadium onto the adjacent railway lines. Fred Trueman came on and struck Davidson on the foot with a yorker. Davidson responded with a three and a cut for four that brought up Australia's 400. He ended with a hard-hitting 77 not out, after a final wicket partnership of 98 in 102 minutes. This extended Australia's lead to 256 on the last day and gave them hope of stopping England from winning the match. England looked to be heading towards victory with seven wickets in hand and less than 100 runs required, but a Benaud-inspired collapse saw Australia home by 54 runs. Davidson knocked Brian Statham's off stump out of the ground to end the match and ended with 2/50. It was Australia's first victory at Old Trafford since 1902 and sealed the series.|$|E

25|$|Bullet {{deflector}} plates were installed over the rear fenders. The idea behind these plates {{was that the}} tank could <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> a trench, and the rear sponson machine guns could then fire onto the plates; the bullets would deflect into the trench or the area directly behind the tank. Like the sponson machine guns themselves, the {{deflector plates}} {{turned out to be}} useless. However, the idea was used again on M5 light tanks in the Normandy campaign.|$|E

25|$|As well as {{destroying}} the village the RUR and {{men from the}} Royal Engineers collected around fifty men from al-Bassa and blew some of them up with explosion under a bus. Harry Arrigonie, a policeman who was present said that about twenty men were put onto a bus; those who tried to escape were shot and then {{the driver of the}} bus was forced to <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> a powerful land mine buried by the soldiers which completely destroyed the bus, scattering the mutilated bodies of the prisoners everywhere. The other villagers were then forced to bury the bodies in a pit.|$|E

25|$|Construction soon began, but {{it would}} take until 1909 for the bridge to be {{completed}} due to delays from the collapse of an incomplete span during a windstorm, and from labor unrest, which included an attempt to dynamite one span. The bridge opened for public use on March 30, 1909, having cost about $18 million and 50 lives. There was a ten-cent toll to <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> the bridge. The bridge's ceremonial grand opening was held on June 12, 1909. At the time, it was the fourth longest bridge in the world. The grand opening included a fireworks display. The bridge was then known as the Blackwell's Island Bridge, from an earlier name for Roosevelt Island.|$|E

With the game out of reach, Riley led the Bears on a drive lasting {{less than a minute}} that ended in a 2-yard touchdown pass to Verran Tucker with a minute left to play. An attempt at an onside kick was recovered by Oregon State, and Canfield took two straight knees to end the game.|$|E

25|$|Mexican potters {{generally}} use local clays, digging it up {{themselves or}} paying someone {{to bring it}} by donkey or truck. The kind of temper used varies on location, from cattail fluff in Metepec, to sand in Acatlán or kapok in Ameyaltepec to give the clay the right consistency and it keep the final product from cracking. In some cases feldspar is used. The clay comes in chunks, which must be dried and then crushed, using a rolling stone or flail. Some potters in Metepec put the chunks {{on the street in}} front of their house and let the cars <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> them. Another way to remove impurities and use the finest is to disperse the clay in water, with impurities and rougher sediment falling to the bottom.|$|E
25|$|For a while, India {{looked to}} {{threaten}} their worst all out score in ODI cricket of 54 against Sri Lanka, but Bond and Adams were taken {{off and the}} other bowlers just couldn't threaten. A well-paced partnership between Yadav and Pathan in fact threatened to turn the match around, but Bond came back, breaking up the partnership with a typical fast bowler's ball outside off stump to Pathan, who edged to McCullum behind the stumps. Four balls earlier, Bond had dropped Pathan off his own bowling. With {{the end of the}} partnership – worth 118 runs, eight off the Indian record – that broke Yadav's resistance, and he was out attempting a lofted <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> Craig McMillan, who could hold a simple catch to end the game.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{trucks and}} tanker trucks can cause {{expensive}} road damage such as cracked pavement and potholes on roads not rated for heavy traffic.

Damage includes crushing of drain pipes, potholes, rutting, and pavement fatigue failure. The cost of these repairs are often {{much higher than the}} Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is allowed to charge for road use. In addition to causing road damage, when heavy trucks and tankers <b>drive</b> <b>over</b> farmland, they compact the subsoil, which increases runoff and decreases crop productivity for years. Ecologists also have concerns about the ecological impact on forests when trees are cut down to make way for access roads. Ornithologists have documented declining populations of woodland birds.|$|E
