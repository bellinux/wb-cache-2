40|$|The {{past two}} decades have seen an {{explosion}} in engineering technology, {{due in large part}} to <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> tools. It is obvious that engineers need to learn to use these tools, and most engineering schools have included some introduction to <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> in their curricula. We would insist that it is equally important for engineers to learn the principles upon which these tools are based. Such knowledge allows engineers to play an active role in the development of new tools, and to formulate realistic expectations about future developments in <b>design</b> <b>automation.</b> Because different fields of engineering require radically different types of tools, we have concentrated our efforts in the area of electronic <b>design</b> <b>automation.</b> We identify three major areas of electrical <b>design</b> <b>automation,</b> physical <b>design</b> <b>automation,</b> simulation, and high-level synthesis. These choices were made based on the importance of the areas, and the availability of educational materials. We have developed course requirements for each area, and provide a list of important topics within each area. For each of the areas, we identify textbooks and other educational materials. We also provide recommendations for laboratory exercises, and provide pointers to course materials on the world wide web. At our institution, we teach a single course in <b>design</b> <b>automation,</b> with the major topic changing from year-to-year. While this style of course offering meets our needs, we recognize that other institutions may wish to offer a single comprehensive course in the area. To this end, we have formulated requirements for a single survey course in <b>design</b> <b>automation,</b> with topics taken from the three major areas. At the present time, we provide sufficient materials for a simulation course in <b>design</b> <b>automation.</b> This includes several handouts which can be combined into a textbook, laboratory exercises, some overheads, and an extensive software package that can be used as a basis for design projects. These materials are under continual development, and will eventually be expanded into other areas of electrical <b>design</b> <b>automation.</b> This paper and the references to which it points, can give educators a place to start in developing their own courses in <b>design</b> <b>automation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Part 8 : Knowledge Creation and ManagementInternational audienceImplementing <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> {{systems to}} {{automate}} repetitive and time consuming design tasks enables engineer-to-order manufacturers to perform custom engineering in minimum time. To maintain a <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> system, regular updating of design information and knowledge is necessary. Consequently, {{there is a}} need of principles and methods to support capturing and structuring associated knowledge, specially, design rationale. In this paper a method for capturing, structuring, and accessing to design rationale in order to support maintenance of <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> systems is presented. The method is tested through a <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> system that develops FEA (finite element analysis) models automatically.

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>automation</b> {{can be a}} {{powerful}} tool in the continuous endeavour to cut lead times, workloads, and, ultimately, costs in order to become more competitive in an increasingly globalised market. Identifying a need for <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> is, consequently, not difficult. What becomes a lot more difficult is identifying the actual need, i. e. the type, scope, and format of the system implementation, as well as the actual design tasks and activities to be automated. There is currently a need for structured and systematic approaches for the realisation and implementation of <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> systems. This research work is aimed at identifying such approaches, methods, and aids. It also addresses the importance of identifying the exact tasks that are to be automated. This has to be done in order to find the tools and implementations that are best suited for solving the tasks, something that is especially important for companies whose resources and economy might not allow them to invest in a system with functionality that vastly exceeds their actual needs. In this work, the design process is discussed from an automation perspective. Following this is a presentation of a framework of <b>design</b> <b>automation.</b> This framework has the purpose of serving as a common base for discussions about <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> as well as support in the setting up of initial system specifications. This is followed by the introduction of a set of criteria of design system characteristics, to be used for planning for <b>design</b> <b>automation.</b> These criteria, and descriptions of their use for system implementation and evaluation, constitute the main results of this work. The contribution of the set of criteria is a systematic approach to identifying <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> needs and setting up final system specifications. It provides implementers with general questions to answer about potential, need, scope, and format of system implementations. Further, it leads to weighing desired system characteristics in order to find the right balance between system complexity and functionality. Finally, some realisation and implementation issues are addressed. The set of criteria is complemented by guidelines for system implementation supporting some of the criteria. A <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> system based on the presented criteria and <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> framework is also presented. This system is evaluated by its users who give their views of systems performance related to the criterias level of fulfilment. The main conclusion of this work is that the set of criteria is {{a powerful}} tool for planning and evaluating <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> systems. Together with the presented framework, they also provide a structured and systematic approach to identifying the actual needs of <b>design</b> <b>automation</b> and setting up system specifications...|$|R
