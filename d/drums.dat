5|$|Huge <b>drums</b> are {{arranged}} in rows {{in front of the}} palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers, who dance on the <b>drums.</b> Sasankan is impressed with Chandralekha's performance but, unknown to him, Veerasimhan's soldiers are hiding inside the <b>drums.</b> As the dance ends, they rush out and attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan confronts Sasankan, and their lengthy sword fight ends with Sasankan's defeat and imprisonment. Veerasimhan releases his parents and becomes the new king, with Chandralekha as his queen.|$|E
5|$|In Constantinople, <b>drums</b> with {{twelve or}} {{fourteen}} sides were popular {{beginning in the}} 11th century. The 11th century rock-cut churches of Cappadocia, such as Karanlik Kilise and Elmali Kilise in Göreme, have shallow domes without <b>drums</b> due to the dim natural lighting of cave interiors.|$|E
50|$|In {{almost all}} West African <b>drumming</b> {{ensemble}}s, a lead <b>drum</b> or master <b>drum</b> leads the group. The master <b>drummer</b> tells the ensemble when {{to play and}} when to stop, he also plays signals telling the other players to change the tempo or the <b>drumming</b> pattern. In some West African <b>drumming</b> ensembles, the master <b>drummer</b> is to play the main theme of the piece and improvise. In Ewe <b>drumming,</b> the master <b>drummer</b> does <b>drum</b> dialogue with the kidi. It enriches the kidi phrase by filling in the empty spaces on the kidi’s part. The master <b>drum</b> can also improvise.|$|R

5|$|Steel <b>drums</b> are a distinctively Trinidadian {{ensemble}} {{that evolved}} from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by {{pieces of metal}} used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these <b>drums,</b> and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel <b>drums</b> spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched {{part of the culture}} of Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
5|$|The {{areas of}} Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula {{experiences}} rapid growth and sharing of musical instruments {{once they were}} united by Islamic culture in the seventh century. Frame <b>drums</b> and cylindrical <b>drums</b> of various depths were immensely important in all genres of music. Conical oboes {{were involved in the}} music that accompanied wedding and circumcision ceremonies. Persian miniatures provide information on the development of kettle <b>drums</b> in Mesopotamia that spread as far as Java. Various lutes, zithers, dulcimers, and harps spread as far as Madagascar to the south and modern-day Sulawesi to the east.|$|E
5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in Port Moresby {{for the bulk}} storage of petroleum products, so they were shipped and distributed in 44-gallon <b>drums,</b> as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon <b>drums</b> developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon <b>drums</b> were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable <b>drums</b> were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty <b>drums</b> being returned to Australia in November.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other <b>drum</b> controllers, the Power Gig: Rise of the SixString AirStrike <b>drum</b> kit {{does not}} feature {{discrete}} <b>drum</b> pads. Instead, it simulates <b>drum</b> hit via motion-tracking of the <b>drum</b> sticks. Like Rock Band kits, the Power Gig: Rise of the SixString AirStrike <b>drum</b> kit {{is set up}} for four <b>drum</b> pads.|$|R
50|$|A moving <b>drum</b> hoist, or {{traveling}} <b>drum</b> hoist, is {{a variation}} on the traditional <b>drum</b> hoist. Moving <b>drum</b> hoists effectively eliminate the fleet angle between <b>drum</b> and block by shifting the <b>drum</b> along its axis as it spins. The amount of shift per <b>drum</b> revolution is equal to the pitch of the <b>drum's</b> helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving <b>drum</b> hoists can combine <b>drum</b> and head block into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.|$|R
2500|$|An {{electronic}} <b>drum</b> module is {{an electronic}} or digital music device in an electronic <b>drum</b> kit {{that serves as}} the central processing unit and sound module. The <b>drum</b> module creates or produces the <b>drum</b> kit sounds or other sounds selected by the <b>drummer.</b> By itself, a <b>drum</b> module cannot play or sound <b>drum</b> beats. It only produces <b>drum</b> sounds when a performer strikes electronic <b>drum</b> pads or acoustic <b>drum</b> kit instruments that have electronic [...] "triggers" [...] (or sensors) attached to them. When the electronic <b>drum</b> pads or trigger-equipped instruments are struck, this sends a signal to the <b>drum</b> module, which produces the corresponding electronic <b>drum</b> sound (or other sound). Even when <b>drum</b> pads and/or triggers are connected to a <b>drum</b> module, the <b>drum</b> module by itself does not make any audible sound. Like other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, the <b>drum</b> module only outputs an electronic signal. The performer can hear this signal by connecting headphones to the <b>drum</b> module (i.e., for individual practice) or by plugging the <b>drum</b> module into a amplifier and loudspeaker or PA system for audible practice or live performances. The <b>drum</b> module's output signal can also be patched into an audio console for concerts or sound recording. The nomenclature varies (see below). For example, electronic <b>drum</b> modules are called [...] "percussion sound modules" [...] in the case of Roland Corporation, or sometimes simply modules. A common colloquial term for this device is <b>drum</b> brain. (see below).|$|R

2500|$|Furthermore, an {{electronic}} <b>drum</b> module {{is not to}} be confused with a <b>drum</b> machine, which is an earlier innovation. Similar to electronic <b>drum</b> modules, <b>drum</b> machines reproduce <b>drum</b> sounds and programmable sequences of <b>drum</b> patterns. However, they are essentially limited to this purpose. [...] "Drum machines" [...] were introduced in the 1980s as an accompaniment device, essentially, an [...] "artificial drummer". In contrast, {{an electronic}} <b>drum</b> module is designed to be an integral part of an electronic <b>drum</b> kit—an interactively playable device, played (usually live) by an actual <b>drummer</b> as part of his or her electronic <b>drum</b> kit.|$|R
5|$|Musical accompaniment may be {{as simple}} as {{clapping}} hands and stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, <b>drums</b> and talking <b>drums,</b> flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.|$|E

25|$|The {{smallest}} {{and largest}} <b>drums</b> without snares, such as octobans and gong <b>drums,</b> are sometimes considered toms.
