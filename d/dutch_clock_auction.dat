We employ experiments with South American subjects who are bank professionals or business students. The main result is the characterization of book building as a pricing method that mostly benefits the investor {{at the expense of the}} issuer and the selling shareholders. The competitive IPO, on the other hand, was the method that gave the best results for the issuer and selling shareholders, at the expense of investors. The competitive IPO, however, showed more dispersion of initial returns and evidence of the "bait-and-switch " strategy, which may be disguised in book building offers but is clearly exposed in the competitive IPO. Issuers could benefit from regulation or private contracting that favor the competitive IPO if its procedure discourages "baiting-and-switching". Moving towards the competitive IPO may not be in the interest of underwriters and their clients...|$|E

In deriving their strategy, bidders anticipate changes in their reference point due to updated information about others' values (i. e., the own winning probability) {{during the course of}} the auction, and make optimal binary decisions at each price (approve or quit in the English auction and wait or bid in the Dutch auction). First, we solve for personal equilibrium profiles, i. e., profiles of bids that contain for each bidder a bidding strategy that is optimal given the others' bidding strategies and the reference point induced by the own and others' strategies. Second, we consider locally preferred personal equilibrium (LPPE) profiles, i. e., personal equilibrium profiles where no bidder can locally find a better personal equilibrium given the others' fixed strategies by varying his reference point via considering different own strategies. The expected revenue in the Dutch auction is higher than in the English auction in the respective unique LPPE profiles. The difference is mainly driven by the aversion to losing the item in the Dutch auction...|$|R

The package <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> is a simple dynamic auction in which bidders bid on packages of lots. Most importantly, the auction allows alternative technologies that require the spectrum to be organized in different ways to compete in a technology‐neutral auction. In addition, the pricing rule and information policy are carefully tailored to mitigate gaming behavior. An activity rule based on revealed preference promotes price and assignment discovery throughout the clock stage of the auction. Truthful bidding is encouraged, which simplifies bidding and improves efficiency. Experimental tests and early auctions confirm the advantages of the approach. (JEL D 44, C 78, L 96.

40|$|Chapter 1 : Efficient Design of an Auction with Discrete Bid Levels This paper studies one of auction design issues: {{the choice}} of bid levels. Full {{efficiency}} is generally unachievable with a discrete auction. Since {{there may be more}} than one bidder who submits the same bid, the auction cannot completely sort bidders by valuation. In effort to maximize efficiency, the social planner tries to choose the partition rule-a rule dictating how type space is partitioned to group bidders who submit the same bid together-to maximize efficiency. With the efficient partition rule, we implement bid levels with sealed-bid and <b>clock</b> <b>auctions.</b> We find that the efficient bid levels in the sealed-bid second-price auction may be non-unique and efficient bid increments in a <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> with highest-rejected bid may be decreasing. We also show that revealing demand is efficiency-enhancing even in the independent private valuation setting where price discovery is not important. Chapter 2 : Pricing Rule in a <b>Clock</b> <b>Auction</b> We analyze a discrete <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> with lowest-accepted bid (LAB) pricing and provisional winners, as adopted by India for its 3 G spectrum auction. In a perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the provisional winner shades her bid while provisional losers do not. Such differential shading leads to inefficiency. An auction with highest-rejected bid (HRB) pricing and exit bids is strategically simple, has no bid shading, and is fully efficient. In addition, it has higher revenues than the LAB auction, assuming profit maximizing bidders. The bid shading in the LAB auction exposes a bidder to the possibility of losing the auction at a price below the bidder's value. Thus, a fear of losing at profitable prices may cause bidders in the LAB auction to bid more aggressively than predicted assuming profit-maximizing bidders. We extend the model by adding an anticipated loser's regret to the payoff function. Revenue from the LAB auction yields higher expected revenue than the HRB auction when bidders' fear of losing at profitable prices is sufficiently strong. This would provide one explanation why India, with an expressed objective of revenue maximization, adopted the LAB auction for its upcoming 3 G spectrum auction, rather than the seemingly superior HRB auction. Chapter 3 : Discrete Clock Auctions: An Experimental Study We analyze the implications of different pricing rules in discrete <b>clock</b> <b>auctions.</b> The two most common pricing rules are highest-rejected bid (HRB) and lowest-accepted bid (LAB).

Despite this free riding problem, in almost all cases, the item is ex post efficiently assigned.

The experiment shows minimal free riding in the <b>clock</b> <b>auction,</b> but as predicted, when a single regular bidder is left competing with the “entrant ” he bids up to his value plus the externality.

We formulate the problem as a combinatorial call auction and present a portfolio of three solution approaches that trade off economic properties, such as allocative efficiency, incentive compatibility, and fairness in allocation, with computational efficiency. The first is an efficient solution that maximizes social welfare. For markets where having a commodity price is critical, we add fairness constraints to the efficient model. Finally, for markets that require real-time fast solution techniques, we propose a time sensitive fair Grid (tsfGRID) heuristic. Notably, while incentive compatibility is not guaranteed by tsfGRID, computational results comparing it with the efficient solution technique indicate {{that there are no}} significant differences in the expected revenue and operational allocative characteristics. ^ In the second study, we design a market-based <b>clock</b> <b>auction</b> model that is able to allocate grid resources and discover separate prices for the different computing resources in the event of stochastic demand as opposed to the first study where the demand was assumed to be deterministic.
