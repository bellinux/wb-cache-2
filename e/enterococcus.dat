40|$|The use of {{antimicrobial}} {{agents in the}} modern farm industry has created a reservoir of resistant bacteria in food animals. Foods of animal origin are often contaminated with <b>enterococci</b> {{that are likely to}} contribute resistance genes, virulence factors, or other properties to <b>enterococci</b> IN humans. The potential hazard to human health from antimicrobial-resistant <b>enterococci</b> in animals is questioned by some scientists because of evidence of host specificity of <b>enterococci.</b> Similarly, the occurrences of specific nosocomial clones of <b>enterococci</b> in hospitals have lead to the misconception that antimicrobial-resistant animal <b>enterococci</b> should be disregarded as a human health hazard. On the basis of review of the literature, we find that neither the results provided by molecular typing that classify <b>enterococci</b> as host-specific organisms nor the occurrence of specific nosocomial clones of <b>enterococci</b> provide reasons to change the current view that antimicrobial-resistantenterococci from animals pose a threat to human health. On the contrary, antimicrobial resistance genes appear to spread freely between <b>enterococci</b> from different reservoirs, irrespective of their apparent host association. <b>Enterococci</b> cause many serious and life-threatening infections, including bloodstream infections.

40|$|Abstract Background Vancomycin {{resistant}} <b>enterococci</b> are {{a frequent}} cause of nosocomial infections and their presence among farm animals is unwanted. Using media supplemented with vancomycin {{an increase in}} the proportion of samples from Swedish broilers positive for vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> has been detected. The situation at farm level is largely unknown. The aims of this study were to obtain baseline knowledge about environmental contamination with vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> in Swedish broiler production and the association between environmental contamination and colonisation of birds. Methods Environmental samples were taken before, during and after a batch of broilers at three farms. Samples were cultured both qualitatively and semi-quantitatively for vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci.</b> In addition, caecal content from birds in the batch following at each farm was cultured qualitatively for vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci.</b> Results The number of samples positive for vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> varied among the farms. Also the amount of vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> in the positive samples and the proportion of caecal samples containing vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> varied among the farms. Still, the temporal changes in environmental contamination followed a similar pattern in all farms. Conclusion Vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> persist in the compartments even after cleaning and the temporal changes in environmental contamination were similar among farms. There were however differences among farms regarding both degree of contamination and proportion of birds colonized with vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci.</b> The proportion of colonized birds and the amount of vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> in the compartments seems to be associated. If the factor(s) causing the differences among farms could be identified, {{it might be possible to}} reduce both the risk for colonisation by vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> of the subsequent flock and the risk for spread of vancomycin resistant <b>enterococci</b> via the food chain to humans. </p...|$|R

In the Eastern Cape Province E. coli and <b>enterococci</b> were detected in 7 and 4 of the 15 RHRW tanks, respectively. <b>Enterococci</b> were detected only from one river whereas E. coli was detected in all three rivers; in spring water neither <b>enterococci</b> nor E. coli were detected.
