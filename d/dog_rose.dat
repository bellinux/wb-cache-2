5|$|Hedgerows of {{hawthorn}} and blackthorn, {{which form}} {{the boundaries between}} the fields, are the principal habitat in these cultivated areas. They support many species of wild flowers, insects and birds, including <b>dog</b> <b>rose,</b> purple foxglove and wild violet as well as wrens, blackbirds and song thrushes.|$|E
5|$|The {{fieldfare}} is omnivorous. Animal food in {{the diet}} includes snails and slugs, earthworms, spiders and insects such as beetles and their larvae, flies and grasshoppers. When berries ripen in the autumn these are taken in great number. Hawthorn, holly, rowan, yew, juniper, <b>dog</b> <b>rose,</b> Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Berberis are all relished. Later in the winter windfall apples are eaten, swedes attacked {{in the field and}} grain and seeds eaten. When these are exhausted, or in particularly harsh weather, the birds may move to marshes or even the foreshore where molluscs are to be found.|$|E
5|$|Invasive weeds are {{prevalent}} in, {{and damaging}} to, the park. Species common in other formerly occupied {{parts of the}} foothills are also common in the park. Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, blackberries, common gorse (Ulex europaeus) and <b>dog</b> <b>rose</b> (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} plants {{growing in the}} park, {{including}} fruit trees, <b>dog</b> <b>roses,</b> margarites, medick and knautia. These plants attract several butterflies, for example the many-plumed moth, the painted lady and Lycaenidae.|$|R

50|$|It was {{developed}} around 1825 by Johanna Carter, who taught it {{to a group}} of about 15 women and girls. It used white cotton thread on white cotton fabric, and predominantly floral motifs. The plants featured were those that were found around the town of Mountmellick, and included blackberries, oak, fern, <b>dog</b> <b>roses</b> and shamrocks.|$|R
5|$|The Whiskers are a {{successful}} group of meerkats that own a two-square-mile {{area in the}} Kuruman River Reserve. The group came into existence in 1998, with four Young Ones females and two Lazuli rovers - reinforced with a wild meerkat who had been released nearby (instead of the potjie) from Van Zylsrus. Holly and Argon took dominance till 2000. After Holly died Risca took dominance with Beetle. She evicted some females who formed the Asphodel and Hobgoblin groups. Eleven Vivian rovers emigrated into Whiskers in 2001. Izit won dominance over Basil, despite Basil being older. Basil left to join to Lazuli. Risca and Izit lost dominance and left to form the Gattaca. Vialli and Zaphod became the next dominant pair. After Vialli died, Flower won dominance in 2002. Yossarian overthrew Zaphod taking male dominance but Zaphod overthrew him sometime after. Flower and Zaphod reign then on. The group split Yossarian and Super Furry Animal taking dominance in the splinter till Baddiel overthrew her sister. The Whiskers reunited and Flower and Zaphod took back dominance. Flower evicted Kinkaju and Mozart with two other females who formed the Starsky. Flower succumbed to a snake bite in January 2007. Her daughter Rocket <b>Dog</b> <b>rose</b> to power after her. The Whiskers split in two and formed the Aztecs. After Rocket Dog died in 2008 and Ella established dominance. Five Whiskers males emigrated into the Lazuli kicking out Thundercat who soon joined the Whiskers. The group recently recovered after a low in numbers. Many Whiskers formed or joined other groups. Some males have joined the Whiskers rivals the Lazuli and Commandos. While many groups were formed by Whiskers members such as the two largest group in the KMP today, the Baobab and Kung Fu. With every move recorded on camera by Cambridge University, the Whiskers became famous as {{the stars of the}} hit television series, Meerkat Manor (2005).|$|E
25|$|According to {{tradition}} (already attested {{at the end}} of the 13th century), one night St. Francis, feeling the temptation to abandon his way of life, rolled naked in the bramble thorns in an attempt to overcome doubt and temptation. In contact with his body, the bramble bushes turned into dog roses without thorns. Since then, the <b>dog</b> <b>rose</b> cultivar Rosa canina assisiensis has been grown in the garden.|$|E
25|$|On May 1, 1561, King Charles IX of France {{received}} a lily {{of the valley}} as a lucky charm. He decided to offer a {{lily of the valley}} each year to the ladies of the court. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became custom to give a sprig of lily of the valley, a symbol of springtime, on May 1. The government permits individuals and workers' organisations to sell them tax-free on that single day. Nowadays, people may present loved ones either with bunches of lily of the valley or <b>dog</b> <b>rose</b> flowers.|$|E
50|$|The galls of {{the rose}} gall wasp (Diplolepis rosae) are also {{distinctive}} and are known as bedeguars or robin's pincushions. These are found on the shoots of <b>dog</b> <b>roses</b> and have a length of up to 5 cm with red, long-haired outgrowths. Inside the galls are several chambers, which may be occupied by larvae.|$|R
50|$|The wine is cherry red in colour with an aroma {{typical of}} the grape and ‘reminiscent of <b>dog</b> <b>roses</b> and scents of red berries.’ The flavour is sweet and {{aromatic}} with characteristic tannins. It is made in both lightly (frizzante) and fully sparkling (spumante) versions; the regulations also permit it to be made as a still wine.|$|R
50|$|Wild Dogs is an American {{heavy metal}} band from Portland, Oregon, formed loosely in 1981 by {{original}} members Jeff Mark, Danny Kurth, Matt McCourt, and Pete Holmes. The band has since released six albums, three live albums and one DVD. Wild <b>Dogs</b> <b>rose</b> to {{local and regional}} recognition in the 1980s as a pioneer of metal in the Pacific Northwest, followed by international recognition {{after the release of}} their second album.|$|R

500|$|The {{park has}} a dense forest area, with about 90% area covered by forests mostly of the mixed {{deciduous}} forests. The plants and tree species reported from this forest, are: [...] ash (Fraxinus), beech (Fagus), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), lime (Tilia), maple (Acer campestre), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), and many more. The forest's conifer vegetation consists of: European black pine (Pinus nigra), Norway spruce (Picea abies), Oregon pine (Pseudotsuga menziesii), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), [...] and spruce (Picea). The [...] shrub species reported are: <b>dog</b> <b>rose</b> (Rosa canina), the European Cornel (Cornus mas), the hawthorn (Crataegus), and the hazel (Corylus). The open {{area of the}} park is covered with several species of bush and grass. Other plant species reported are 14 types of orchid (Orchidaceae) and more than 250 species of herbal plants. The Management Plan for the park lists 550 species of vascular plants (excluding mosses).|$|E

50|$|The old {{mill pond}} above the hamlet has been {{restored}} by the Northumberland National Park Authority. Blackbirds, wrens and thrushes are often seen in the hedge banks along the lane to Longknowe, and the roadside verges contain a colourful variety of flowering plants, including <b>dog</b> <b>roses,</b> St John's wort, stitchwort and bloody cranesbill. Nearby is a sheepwash, where Kilham's shepherds increased {{the value of the}} fleeces by washing their sheep's wool before it was clipped.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{the island}} {{has been a}} sheep farm {{for more than a}} century, careful {{management}} has preserved its varied habitat and mature tussac grows in replanted coastal paddocks. [...] The island contains one of the few substantial stands of trees in the Falklands. There is however, a true wood at Hill Cove. None of the species are endemic, but they include such exoticisms as Monterey cypress trees, and New Zealand cabbage palms. The night herons nest within these trees. The gardens also include other introduced plants such as fuchsias, lupins, and <b>dog</b> <b>roses.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As {{with many}} Mediterranean regions, Abruzzo's {{vegetation}} {{is characterized by}} the presence of different Mediterranean ecosystems. The coast and the surrounding areas are characterized by the presence of typical plants of Mediterranean shrubland, such as myrtle, heather and mastic, while in the hilly areas other species grow, including olive, pine, willow, oak, poplar, alder, arbutus, broom, acacia, capers, rosemary, hawthorn, licorice and almond trees, interspersed with oak trees. At elevations between [...] there is sub-montane vegetation, mainly characterized by mixed forests of oak and turkey oak, maple and hornbeam; shrubs include <b>dog</b> <b>rose</b> and red juniper. Elevations between [...] are dominated by beech trees. In the Apennine Mountains at elevations above [...] species include alpine orchid, mountain juniper, silver fir, black cranberry and the Abruzzo edelweiss.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the north}} and centre of the county the {{substrate}} is the rocks of the Chalk Group, which form the Hampshire Downs and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Thames valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is Pilot Hill, which reaches a height of 286m (938ft), and lies {{on the border with}} West Berkshire. Butser Hill near Petersfield is the second highest point at 271 metres (889ft) and lies in the South Downs National Park. The highest village in Hampshire at between 235-240m above sea level is Ashmansworth, located between Andover and Newbury. [...] The downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects. A large area of the downs is now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Itchen and Test are trout rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. Nestled in a valley on the downs is Selborne, and the countryside surrounding the village was the location of Gilbert White's pioneering observations on natural history. Hampshire's county flower is the <b>Dog</b> <b>Rose.</b>|$|E

60|$|Nazinred did not {{discover}} {{all this}} at once, being too much {{excited by the}} unexpected visit to note trifling details. Besides, prompt action was necessary, for the four dogs, on becoming aware of what was transacting outside, made a united and clamorous dash at the foe. Two of them, being too valorous, ran close up to the bears, who seemed to regard them with haughty surprise. Another movement and the two <b>dogs</b> <b>rose</b> into {{the air with a}} yell in unison, and fell back upon the snow, where they lay motionless. The other two, learning wisdom from experience, kept back and barked furiously.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dog</b> <b>roses,</b> the Canina {{section of}} the genus Rosa (20-30 species and subspecies, which occur mostly in Northern and Central Europe), have an unusual kind of meiosis that is {{sometimes}} called permanent odd polyploidy, although it can occur with even polyploidy (e.g. in tetraploids or hexaploids). Regardless of ploidy level, only seven bivalents are formed leaving the other chromosomes as univalents. Univalents are included in egg cells, but not in pollen. Similar processes occur in some other organisms. Dogroses are most commonly pentaploid, i.e. five times the base number of seven chromosomes for the genus Rosa, but may be tetraploid or hexaploid as well.|$|R
50|$|While the {{boundaries}} of the Rosaceae are not disputed, there is not general agreement as to how many genera it contains. Areas of divergent opinion include the treatment of Potentilla s.l. and Sorbus s.l.. Compounding the problem is that apomixis is common in several genera. This results in an uncertainty in the number of species contained in each of these genera, due to the difficulty of dividing apomictic complexes into species. For example, Cotoneaster contains between 70 and 300 species, Rosa around 100 (including the taxonomically complex <b>dog</b> <b>roses),</b> Sorbus 100 to 200 species, Crataegus between 200 and 1,000, Alchemilla around 300 species, Potentilla roughly 500, and Rubus hundreds, or possibly even thousands of species.|$|R

5000|$|Port Patterson on the {{southwest}} coast {{is known for its}} gardens, which have a tropical feel, and has a small shop/grocery. It has been settled continuously for over a hundred years. The main house, occupied by the McGills, dates to 1938, and is a single-storey building, which has been extended over the years. There is also a wool shed, cow shed and several red-roofed houses made from weatherboard. Two of these are rented out to holiday makers, who often come from West and East Falkland within the islands themselves. The gardens also include introduced plants such as fuchsias, lupins, and <b>dog</b> <b>roses,</b> and some trees including Monterey cypress trees, and New Zealand cabbage palms.|$|R
60|$|Walters knit {{his brows}} in perplexity, {{and glanced at}} his master who slept on utterly worn out. A silent pause followed, lasting some minutes.

25|$|The gorges in the island, {{such as the}} Daal of Lumbister {{provide an}} {{important}} environment {{for some of the}} few trees on the island, since they are untouched by sheep grazing. Before human colonisation, it appears that Yell was wooded to some degree, at least with dwarf trees and shrubs. In the gorge at the head of Gloup Voe, <b>dog</b> <b>roses</b> and honeysuckle can be found. As the peat preserves old plants and pollen to some degree, due to its anaerobic nature, it is possible to get some sense of the former vegetation of the island. For example, it is known that 40,000 years ago, before the advent of the last Ice Age, and probably any human habitation, that oak, Scots pine and Mediterranean heathers were growing here. The remains of these plants have been preserved in layers of ancient peat, which were in turn buried by the boulder clay left by glacial moraines.|$|R

50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>roses,</b> the Caninae {{section of}} the genus Rosa, have around 20-30 species and subspecies, which appear {{in a variety of}} shapes and occur mostly in Northern and Central Europe. The rose that grows on the Saint Mary Cathedral belongs to the Rosa canina and it shows the {{specific}} features of a canina, being a deciduous shrub normally ranging in height from one to three metres; however occasionally it can climb if given support. The stems are covered with small, sharp, hooked spines to assist it in climbing. The leaves have between five and seven leaflets. The flowers are usually pale pink, fragrant, four to six centimetres in diameter with five petals, and develop into oval 1.5-2 centimetre red-orange coloured hips. The fruit is noted for its high vitamin C level and is used to make tea and marmalade. The rose hips are used in traditional folk medicine as a remedy for inflammatory-related diseases.|$|R

6000|$|All these dispositions duly made, at 10 A.M. on the 29th December we mounted our animals, and, {{guided by}} Mad Said, trotted round the {{northern}} {{side of the}} Wilensi table-mountain down a lane fenced with fragrant <b>dog</b> <b>roses.</b> Then began the descent of a steep rocky hill, {{the wall of a}} woody chasm, through whose gloomy depths the shrunken stream of a large Fiumara wound like a thread of silver. The path would be safe to nought less surefooted than a mule: we rode slowly over rolling stones, steps of micaceous grit, and through thorny bush for about half an hour. In the plain below appeared a village of the Gerad's Midgans, who came out to see us pass, and followed the strangers to some distance. One happening to say, [...] "Of what use is his gun?--before he could fetch fire, I should put this arrow through him!"
