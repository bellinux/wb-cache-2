2500|$|The PT Cruiser {{is noted}} for its {{exterior}} design reminiscent of 1930s styling, executed by Bryan Nesbitt, and its interior design featuring a high-roof, high <b>h-point</b> seating, and flexible cargo and passenger configurations [...] a multi-level cargo shelf as well as fold, tumble and removable rear seating.|$|E
2500|$|The body {{featured}} a drag coefficient of 0.35, with a frontal area of [...] giving aerodynamic resistance of [...] All Kalos iterations featured high <b>H-point</b> seating within a relatively narrow, short and high-roofed body that combined a long wheelbase with short front (...) and rear ( [...] , hatchback) overhangs {{to maximize the}} outward visibility, interior space and maneuverability for the vehicle's footprint. Rear seat H-points are higher in all body types, giving the car theatre seating.|$|E
50|$|Buses, minivans, SUVs and CUVs {{generally}} have higher <b>H-points</b> (relative {{to the road}} surface and the vehicle interior floor) than sedans, though certain sedans feature higher <b>H-points</b> than most, e.g., the Ford Five Hundred. Sports cars and vehicles with higher aerodynamic considerations, by contrast, may employ lower <b>H-points</b> relative to the road surface. When an automobile features progressively higher <b>H-points</b> at each successive seating row, the seating is called stadium seating, as in the Dodge Journey, and Ford Flex.|$|R
40|$|N-type Bi 100 -xSbx alloys {{have the}} highest {{thermoelectric}} figure of merit (zT) of all materials below 200 K; here we investigate how filling multiple valence band pockets at T and <b>H-points</b> of the Brillouin zone produces high zT in p-type Sn-doped material. This approach, theoretically predicted to potentially give zT> 1 in Bi, was used successfully in PbTe. We report thermopower, electrical and thermal conductivity (2 to 400 K) of single crystals with 12 <x< 37 and polycrystals (x= 50 - 90), higher Sb concentrations than previous studies. We obtain a 60 % improvement in zT to 0. 13. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The one-box design {{eliminated}} B-pillars and featured an aluminium structure, aluminium panels for {{the greenhouse}} {{and a full}} sunroof of strengthened heat-reflecting glass. The interior featured four seats each with built-in seatbelts and Bridge of Weir leather. [...] To facilitate access to the rear seats, two long doors featured a double parallel-opening hinge system (marketed as [...] "double-kinematic") that maximized access with minimal outswing of the doors. Front side windows lowered automatically when either of the front seats folded forward to further facilitate entry to the rear two seats. Windows featured power-deployable sunshades, and the <b>H-points</b> of the rear two seats were higher than the forward two seats, giving the Avantime [...] "theater seating." [...] The luggage compartment featured a retaining system using retractable straps, and all Avantimes featured a two-tone look created by the exposed aluminium of the greenhouse. The windows and panoramic sunroof could open automatically via a single, headliner mounted control, to give the Avantime an 'open air' mode.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>H-point</b> (or hip-point) is the theoretical, {{relative}} {{location of}} an occupant's hip: specifically the pivot point between the torso and upper leg {{portions of the}} body [...] - [...] as used in vehicle design, automotive design and vehicle regulation. The <b>H-point</b> can be measured relative to other features, e.g. <b>h-point</b> to vehicle floor (H30) or <b>h-point</b> to pavement (H5): a vehicle said to have a [...] "high H-point" [...] may have an <b>H-point</b> that is [...] "high" [...] relative to the vehicle floor, the road surface, or both.|$|E
5000|$|Technically, the {{measurement}} uses the hip joint of a 50th percentile male occupant, viewed laterally, and is highly relevant to {{national and international}} vehicle design standards such as global technical regulations (GTR). For example, a vehicle design standard known as the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J1100 Interior Measurement Index sets parameters for such measurements as H30 (<b>H-point</b> to vehicle floor); H5 (<b>H-point</b> to pavement surface), H61 (<b>H-point</b> to interior ceiling) and H25 (<b>H-point</b> to window sill).|$|E
5000|$|A {{design feature}} of the Montego {{includes}} its overall height to add interior space to the vehicle. To appeal to buyers of both sedans and sport-utility vehicles, Ford raised the viewpoint of the driver. Marketed as Command Seating, the Montego features high <b>H-point</b> seating (the location of the occupants hip-point relative to the road or the vehicle floor); its <b>H-point</b> {{is closer to the}} ground than that of a sport utility vehicle, but higher than a typical sedan, easing entry and exit. Also, the distance from the <b>H-point</b> {{to the floor of the}} vehicle is reflective of more upright seating. At its press launch, Ford said the Five Hundred's <b>H-point</b> is up to four and a half inches higher than its competitors. The Montego also features theater seating, where second row seats are higher: in the front row, the distance between the <b>H-point</b> and the heel point, where the occupant's foot touches the floor, is 12.7 inches [...] - [...] in the second row the distance between the <b>H-point</b> and the heel point is 15.7 inches.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} the {{electronic}} properties of graphite have produced conflicting results regarding {{the positions of the}} different carrier types within the Brillouin zone, and the possible presence of Dirac fermions. In this paper we report a comprehensive study of the de Haas-van Alphen, Shubnikov-de Haas and Hall effects in a sample of highly orientated pyrolytic graphite, at temperatures in the range 30 mK to 4 K and magnetic fields up to 12 T. The transport measurements confirm the Brillouin-zone locations of the different carrier types assigned by Schroeder et al. : electrons are at the K-point, and holes are near the <b>H-points.</b> We extract the cyclotron mass and scattering time for both carrier types from the temperature- and magnetic-field-dependences of the magneto-oscillations. Our results indicate that the holes experience stronger scattering and hence have a lower mobility than the electrons. We utilise phase-frequency analysis and intercept analysis of the 1 /B positions of magneto-oscillation extrema to identify the nature of the carriers in graphite, whether they are Dirac or normal (Schrodinger) fermions. These analyses indicate normal holes and electrons of indeterminate nature...|$|R
50|$|Vehicle {{interior}} ergonomics {{are integral}} to an automotive design education. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has adopted tools for vehicle design, including statistical models for predicting driver eye location and seat position {{as well as}} an <b>H-point</b> mannequin for measuring seats and interior package geometry. See SAE J86 for a description of the <b>H-point</b> machine. <b>H-Point</b> machines have been built by Technosports of Livonia, Michigan. Occupant posture-prediction models are used in computer simulations and form the basis for Crash test dummy positioning.|$|E
5000|$|Focus {{engineers}} {{developed a}} new interior packaging for the car's class, with a computer-modeled interior, long wheelbase, tall doors, raised roofline, increased passenger and cargo volume, raised rear seating and raised <b>H-point</b> front seating providing higher sight lines and increased rear footroom. James R. Healey, writing for USA Today, said [...] "Focus is bigger inside than cars much larger outside." [...] Ford later marketed the high <b>H-point</b> seating as Command Seating, noting that [...] "the higher the <b>H-Point,</b> the higher you ride in the car, and in some cases, the more comfortable you feel behind the wheel".|$|E
5000|$|Second row <b>H-point</b> is 1.6 {{in higher}} than the first row; third row 0.6 in (17 mm) higher still.|$|E
5000|$|Featuring a high seating <b>h-point</b> and a {{coefficient}} of drag of 0.34, the small van used a front engined, front-wheel drive layout based on the Lancia Gamma platform with a Lancia SOHC 2.5 litre flat-4 engine and Bosch L-Jetronic fuel injection.|$|E
50|$|SUVs {{are known}} for high ground clearance, upright, boxy body, and high <b>H-point.</b> This can make them more likely to roll over due to their high center of gravity. Bodies of SUVs have {{recently}} become more aerodynamic, but the sheer size and weight keeps their fuel economy poor.|$|E
5000|$|The PT Cruiser {{is noted}} for its {{exterior}} design reminiscent of 1930s styling, executed by Bryan Nesbitt, and its interior design featuring a high-roof, high <b>h-point</b> seating, and flexible cargo and passenger configurations [...] - [...] a multi-level cargo shelf as well as fold, tumble and removable rear seating.|$|E
5000|$|The X3 was {{conceived}} {{to combine the}} agility of a compact model with the driving experience of the company's X5. The X3 featured an upright, high <b>H-point</b> seating configuration, marketed as [...] "command seating". Styling exhibited interacting concave and convex surfacing, characteristic for the company at the time along with a reinterpreted Hofmeister kink.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to a Taurus station wagon, the Freestyle featured forward-facing third-row seating (similar to the Ford Explorer and Ford Expedition). Although designed with ground clearance between a sedan and a small SUV, the Freestyle featured what Ford described as [...] "command seating," [...] seating with a higher <b>H-point,</b> to increase driver visibility and ease of entry and exit.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the early}} 2000s {{there had been}} a global trend toward higher H-points {{relative}} to the road surface and the vehicle's interior floor. Referring to the trend in a 2004 article, The Wall Street Journal noted an advantage: [...] "the higher the <b>H-Point,</b> the higher you ride in the car, and in some cases, the more comfortable you feel behind the wheel".|$|E
5000|$|Using unibody {{construction}} {{typical of}} passenger vehicles {{instead of the}} body-on-frame design of light trucks and the original SUVs, the crossover combines SUV features [...] - [...] such as a tall interior, high <b>H-point</b> seating, high ground-clearance, and all-wheel-drive [...] - [...] with those of an automobile [...] - [...] including independent rear suspension, car-like handling, and lighter weight and better fuel economy than trucks or truck-based vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|As {{with the}} {{location}} of other automotive design [...] "hard points," [...] the <b>H-point</b> has major ramifications in the overall vehicle design, including roof height, aerodynamics, visibility (both within the vehicle and from the vehicle into traffic), seating comfort, driver fatigue, ease of entry and exit, interior packaging, safety, restraint and airbag design and collision performance. As an example, higher H-points can provide more legroom, both {{in the front and}} back seats.|$|E
50|$|The X1 {{offers a}} 420-litre cargo volume, which can {{increase}} to 1350 litres of storage space with the seats folded. For comparison, the 3-Series Touring (E91) has 460 and the X3 (E83) has 480 litres. The backrest {{in the rear}} is adjustable in 11 steps and can be divided in the ratio 40:20:40. The vehicle offers adaptive cruise control, seating positions with modestly raised <b>H-point</b> seating (marketed as Semi Command Sitting position) and Performance Control.|$|E
5000|$|The Amazon {{shared the}} wheelbase, tall posture and high <b>H-point</b> seating of its predecessor, the PV and was offered in two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and five-door wagon body styles. In 1959 Volvo became the world's first {{manufacturer}} to provide front seat belts as standard equipment [...] - [...] by providing them on all Amazon models, including the export models [...] - [...] and later {{becoming the first}} car featuring three-point seat belts as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|The body {{featured}} a drag coefficient of 0.35, with a frontal area of 2.16 m2 giving aerodynamic resistance of 0.74 m2. All Kalos iterations featured high <b>H-point</b> seating within a relatively narrow, short and high-roofed body that combined a long wheelbase with short front (81 cm) and rear (49 cm, hatchback) overhangs {{to maximize the}} outward visibility, interior space and maneuverability for the vehicle's footprint. Rear seat H-points are higher in all body types, giving the car theatre seating.|$|E
50|$|A {{sport utility}} vehicle or {{suburban}} utility vehicle (SUV) is a vehicle classified as a light truck, but operated as a family vehicle. SUVs are similar to a large station wagon or estate car, though typically featuring tall interior packaging, high <b>H-point</b> seating, high center of gravity, high ground-clearance and especially four- or all-wheel-drive capability for on- or off-road ability. Some SUVs include the towing capacity {{of a pickup truck}} with the passenger-carrying space of a minivan or large sedan.|$|E
5000|$|As FCAs first {{entry in}} the mini-MPV market, the Ideas {{exterior}} was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro, its interior was designed by Fiats Centro Stilo, and its platform is shared with the second-generation Fiat Punto. The Idea is noted for its centrally located instrument cluster, high <b>H-point</b> seating, and flexible seating [...] - [...] including reclining, sliding and folding rear seats. Its seating design uses biometric principles developed by Antonio Dal Monte at the Italian National Olympic Committees sport medicine institute ...|$|E
5000|$|Consistent {{with its}} 3+1 name, the Trepiùno's {{packaging}} concept combines an overall short length with high <b>h-point</b> seating [...] - [...] and a seating configuration where {{the front passenger}} can slide forward toward a reconfigurable dashboard with an inward-folding collapsable glovebox [...] - [...] thus enabling sufficient room for one full-size rear passenger along with a fourth, strictly occasional, [...] "emergency" [...] child seat behind the driver [...] - [...] or enabling a pure 3-seat or 2-seat vehicle by folding one or both rear seats.|$|E
50|$|The minivan {{combines}} a high-roof, five-door one- or two-box hatchback body configuration with a mid-size platform, engine and mechanicals; car-like handling and fuel economy; unibody construction; front-wheel or all-wheel drive and greater height than sedan or station wagon counterparts. The design offers higher <b>h-point</b> seating, {{two or three}} rows of seating, easy passenger and cargo access with sliding wide-opening rear doors and large rear hatch, and a re-configurable interior volume with seats that recline, slide, tumble, fold flat or allow easy removal—enabling users to reprioritize passenger and cargo volumes.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} reduced button clutter {{by adding}} a 7-inch touchscreen with haptic feedback, an additional 8-inch screen is also standard. To reduce interior noise an acoustic (PVB layered) windshield, acoustic front door glass and thicker rear glass are used as well as triple sealed door openings. Advance package models include further noise reduction using a thicker carpet base layer and front fender liners. The seating <b>H-point</b> has been reduced and the steering gear ratio is 9% quicker for a more sporty feel. The MDX rides lower reducing its center of gravity.|$|E
5000|$|The Fortwo {{is noted}} for its 2.69 m overall length, high <b>H-point</b> seating, offset {{passenger}} and driver seats (in {{the first and second}} generation, the passenger seat is 15 centimetres further rearward than the driver’s), [...] automated manual transmission (1st and 2nd generation), De Dion tube rear suspension, low CO2 emissions (119 grams per kilometre, North America, 1.0 Liter), two-part rear hatch, interchangeable plastic body panels and prominent steel hemispherical safety-cell, which is marketed as the Tridion cell and is often provided in a contrasting color to the vehicle's body panels.|$|E
5000|$|The mini-MPV {{combines}} a tall, high-roof five-door one- or two-box hatchback body configuration with a supermini's platform, engines and mechanicals [...] - [...] {{in order to}} provide the interior volume, packaging and comfort of a larger C-segment vehicle within a B-segment footprint.

5000|$|Based on {{a variant}} of the GM Fiat Small Platform, the 500L uses Fiat's Multiair {{variable}} valve timing engine technology and cab forward architecture: a packaging concept that prioritizes interior room. With a total passenger and cargo volume of 121.1 cubic feet, the 500L features high <b>H-point</b> seating, tall roof and greenhouse, split front (A) pillar with glass and polycarbonate rear (D) pillar [...] - [...] and a reconfigurable interior design marketed as Cargo Magic Space which includes a three-level rear cargo floor panel, fold-flat front passenger seat as well as for-aft sliding, fold and tumble, reclining rear seating.|$|E
5000|$|The Forester was {{introduced}} at the Tokyo Motor Show in November 1995 as the Streega concept, and {{made available for}} sale February 1997 in Japan, and to the US market in 1998. The Forester {{was one of the}} first emerging crossover SUVs. It was built in the style of a car, but had a taller stance, higher <b>h-point</b> seating, and an all-wheel drive drive train. Subaru advertising employed the slogan [...] "SUV tough, Car Easy". It used the Impreza platform but with the larger 2.5-liter DOHC EJ25D four-cylinder boxer engine from the Outback, making [...] at 5600 rpm and 162 lbft Nm of torque at 4000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|A {{key feature}} driving {{the use of}} the tall body design was the upward {{movement}} of the <b>H-point</b> (hip point). As with the first-generation Ford Focus, the seats of the Five Hundred were positioned relatively high from the floor, providing an upright seating position and improved visibility, access, and egress. In addition, the rear seat was positioned higher than the front seats. While visibility was one factor behind the higher seating position, safety was another as well. Under the front seats, a hydroformed cross-car steel beam is welded in between the B-pillars (directly below an identical beam above the B-pillars), designed as part of a side-impact safety design derived from Side Impact Protection System (SIPS) from Volvo.|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the main}} design {{objectives}} for car interiors are comfort and safety. These aspects are both determined by the seating position of the occupant. Seat manufacturers use the SAE Three-Dimensional <b>H-Point</b> Machine™ to measure seating positions to design, audit, and benchmark seats. The seating positions measured with the <b>H-Point</b> Machine {{form the basis of}} a seat design, including comfort and safety aspects. Currently, the seat design process is largely based on prototype testing, which makes this process time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, there is a large demand for efficient design tools that enable an optimal combination of seating comfort and safety aspects. Numerical modeling provides an efficient means to optimally combine various seat design characteristics prior to prototype testing, thereby reducing design costs and time-to-market. Therefore, the ability to predict the <b>H-point</b> and the corresponding comfort and safety aspects {{in the early stages of}} the seat design process is extremely valuable to car and seat manufacturers. This paper presents a numerical model of the commonly used SAE Three-Dimensional <b>H-Point</b> Machine™. The model was developed using a combination of multibody and finite element (FE) techniques. The applicability of the <b>H-Point</b> Model was verified in two steps. Firstly, tests in which the <b>H-Point</b> Machine was placed on a block of foam were simulated. The measured position of the <b>H-Point</b> Machine was compared to that predicted by the model. After this, the <b>H-Point</b> Model was used together with a full FE seat model to predict the <b>H-point</b> of an actual car seat. The predictions with the <b>H-Point</b> Model were also compared with similar simulations with a FE model of the human pelvis. The FE pelvis model provides a more realistic prediction of the seating posture of a real human, since the deformation of the flesh is incorporated in this model. Based on the simulations, it can be concluded that the <b>H-point</b> can be accurately predicted with the numerical approach presented in this paper. The level of accuracy was found to greatly depend on how accurate the seat foam is modeled (e. g. mesh density, foam characteristics) ...|$|E
