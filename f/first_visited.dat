5|$|Gauguin <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> Tahiti in 1891, and {{attracted}} by the beauty of Tahitian women undertook a set of sculptural mask-like portraits on paper. They evoke both melancholy and death, and conjure the state of faaturuma (brooding or melancholy); imagery and moods later used in the Oviri ceramic. Gauguin's first wood carvings in Tahiti were with a guava wood that quickly crumbled and have not survived.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{total number}} of new {{attendant}} patients diagnosed as having atopic dermatitis at our dermatology outpatient clinic during the 7 year period from 1989 to 1995 was 10 156. Patients from each year during this period were divided into eight age groups. The birth month and the month of <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> for each age group was obtained in average of 7 years. Only for subjects aged < 1 year was there a definite tendency for higher birth numbers in autumn and lower birth numbers in spring. The percent birth rate for subjects < 1 year of age was significantly higher in October and November and significantly lower in March and May {{in comparison with the}} expected percent birth rates calculated on the basis of birth months of the Japanese population. Similarly, patients aged < 1 year, 1 – 2 and 3 – 5 years showed a tendency for higher numbers of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> in spring and, in addition, patients aged < 1 year showed a tendency for smaller numbers of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> in summer. At school and college ages, between 6 and 20 years of age, a steep increase of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> was observed in March and a smaller increase of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> was observed between July and August. We investigated whether the distribution of birth month for subjects aged < 1 year was statistically significant. The percent <b>first</b> <b>visiting</b> month was significantly higher in March and April and lower between July and October in comparison with the expected percentage <b>first</b> <b>visiting</b> month. We speculated that the uneven distribution of birth month was a reflection of a more marked distortion observed in the distribution of the month of <b>first</b> <b>visit.</b> The mean age at <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> (6. 24 months) explains the difference between <b>first</b> <b>visiting</b> month and birth month. There were no definite social reasons for {{the increase in the number}} of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> in spring for subjects aged < 1 year. Therefore, the uneven distribution of the month of <b>first</b> <b>visit</b> for subjects aged < 1 year could probably be the result of climatic effects...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSome {{adolescents}} {{have special}} health care needs. Privacy concerns, unawareness or ethnical/cultural factors are barriers to women visiting obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs). The utilization of OB/GYN services by adolescent girls is seldom reported. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the pattern and consequences of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> to OB/GYNs by adolescent girls within the National Health Insurance in Taiwan. MethodsFrom the 1 -million cohort dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database spanning from 1996 to 2007, adolescent girls visiting OB/GYNs for the first time were identified. The characteristics of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> were analyzed. Their follow-up visits and admissions within 1 year after their <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> to OB/GYNs were traced. ResultsIn 2006, only 5. 8 % (n = 2, 682) of 46, 582 adolescent girls in our study cohort had their <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> to OB/GYNs: 46. 7 % with diagnoses of menstrual disorders and 14. 8 % with diagnoses related to inflammatory or infectious diseases of the genital organs. The examination most frequently ordered was pregnancy test (for 19. 9 % of these <b>first</b> <b>visits).</b> Very few (0. 4 %) <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> were for preventive services. Among the infrequent admissions (85 admissions of 75 girls) to obstetric/gynecology wards within 1 year after <b>first</b> <b>visits,</b> the majority (74 of 85 admissions) were pregnancy-related. ConclusionThe leading motivating factor for <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> to OB/GYNs by adolescent girls was menstrual disorders. The majority of subsequent admissions were pregnancy-related, indicating that adolescent pregnancy deserves further attention...|$|R

5|$|John Sherman {{was born}} in Lancaster, Ohio on May 10, 1823 to Charles Robert Sherman and his wife, Mary Hoyt Sherman, the eighth of their eleven children. John Sherman's grandfather, Taylor Sherman, a Connecticut lawyer and judge, <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> Ohio {{in the early nineteenth}} century, gaining title to several parcels of land before {{returning}} to Connecticut. After Taylor's death in 1815, his son Charles, newly married to Mary Hoyt, moved the family west to Ohio. Several other Sherman relatives soon followed, and Charles became established as a lawyer in Lancaster. By the time of John Sherman's birth, Charles had just been appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|On 6 and 7 May 1945, Navy divers {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} wreck to recover the captain's safe and the papers within, but failed. Recreational divers <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> the site in 1953. In 1960 a recreational diver brought up a body from the wreck. This provoked former navy admirals and clergy to petition the US government for restrictions on disturbing the dead. The German crewman was buried with full military honors in Newport, Rhode Island. At least two recreational divers have died from exploring the wreckage.|$|E

The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} is now the state of California was <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> by Europeans when Spanish {{explorer}} Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo visited there in 1542.

5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words were exchanged, although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E
5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E

5|$|In October 1783, the Virginia Legislature {{authorized}} Scott {{to commission}} superintendents and surveyors {{to survey the}} lands given to soldiers for their service in the Revolutionary War. Enticed by glowing reports of Kentucky by his friend, James Wilkinson, he arranged for a cabin to be built for him near the Kentucky River, although the builder apparently laid only the cornerstone. Scott <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> Kentucky in mid-1785. Traveling with Peyton Short, one of Wilkinson's business partners, he came to Limestone (present-day Maysville, Kentucky) via the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers. Scott and Short then traveled overland to the Kentucky River to examine the land they would later claim. Scott's stay in Kentucky was a short one; he had returned to his farm in Virginia by September 1785.|$|E
5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to The Soul of the Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had painted in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger <b>first</b> <b>visited</b> the region.

More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E
