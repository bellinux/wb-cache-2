5|$|In {{another story}} further {{upstream}} the Yangtze, the baiji {{was the daughter}} of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river. Before they were drowned, the daughter was transformed into a dolphin, and the general a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave in, in exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, {{a more liberal}} {{political}} climate in Bohemia encouraged Smetana to return permanently to Prague. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> into the musical life of the city, primarily {{as a champion of}} the new genre of Czech opera. In 1866 his first two operas, The Brandenburgers in Bohemia and The Bartered Bride, were premiered at Prague's new Provisional Theatre, the latter achieving great popularity. In that same year, Smetana became the theatre's principal conductor, but the years of his conductorship were marked by controversy. Factions within the city's musical establishment considered his identification with the progressive ideas of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner inimical {{to the development of a}} distinctively Czech opera style. This opposition interfered with his creative work, and might have hastened a decline in health that precipitated his resignation from the theatre in 1874.|$|E

As a lawyer Arrúe assisted in Aránzazu congress of 1968, vital for building the unified Basque language. In 1969, when Euskaltzaindia’s legal standing was challenged, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> into massive lawyer’s work, resulting in forming its firm juridical basis in 1972.|$|E

He farmed out the alcabala (sales tax) to improve its collection. He reorganized the public treasury and required strict accounting of the viceroyalty's income and expenses. He reestablished commerce and the postal service, which had been interrupted by the war with the insurgents.

25|$|Diogenes Laërtius {{records the}} legend that Empedocles died by {{throwing}} himself into Mount Etna in Sicily, {{so that the}} people would believe his body had vanished and he had turned into an immortal god; the volcano, however, threw back one of his bronze sandals, revealing the deceit. Another legend maintains that <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> into the volcano to prove to his disciples that he was immortal; he believed {{he would come back}} as a god after being consumed by the fire. Horace also refers the death of Empedocles in his work Ars Poetica and admits poets the right to destroy themselves.|$|E

25|$|In the 17th century {{another great}} effort at a general reform was made, {{promoted}} by the pope and the king of France; the general chapter elected Richelieu (commendatory) abbot of Cîteaux, thinking he would {{protect them from the}} threatened reform. In this they were disappointed, for <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> wholly on the side of reform. So great, however, was the resistance, and so serious the disturbances that ensued, that the attempt to reform Cîteaux itself and the general body of the houses had again to be abandoned, and only local projects of reform could be carried out.|$|E
25|$|Seduced {{at first}} by the new ideas of the Revolution, <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> into a {{political}} career by becoming an aristocratic member of the bailliage of Melun in 1789.

The Assembly was assigned the task of drawing {{up a list of}} grievances to be submitted to the King and naming a deputy to the States-General.

25|$|During this period, whilst pondering {{a project}} to give public {{readings}} for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital, to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His 'Drooping Buds' essay in Household Words earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders {{to have been the}} catalyst for the hospital's success. Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, and <b>he</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> into the task, heart and soul. Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing—one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised £3,000.|$|E

25|$|Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti {{was born}} on May 13, 1792. He was the ninth child born in Senigallia into the noble family of Girolamo dei conti Ferretti, and was baptized {{on the same day}} of his birth with the name of Giovanni Maria Giambattista Pietro Pellegrino Isidoro. He was educated at the Piarist College in Volterra and in Rome. As a {{theology}} student in his hometown Sinigaglia, in 1814 he met Pope Pius VII, who had returned from French captivity. In 1815, he entered the Papal Noble Guard but was soon dismissed after an epileptic seizure. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> at the feet of Pius VII, who elevated him and supported his continued theological studies.|$|E
25|$|Larramendi {{faced an}} {{extremely}} {{difficult task of}} re-building command structures. <b>He</b> <b>threw</b> <b>himself</b> {{into a series of}} hectic meetings with provincial and regional leaders, incessantly touring the country; in some cases, like Catalonia or Valencia, he faced also bitter personal conflicts. Apart from that, as a lawyer he successfully kept fighting off the Mellistas when struggling for El Correo. His first major initiative was launching the project of a grand Carlist assembly; it materialized in November 1919 as Magna Junta de Biarritz. The event was a success as it consolidated the party and helped it to re-gain momentum, even though in none of 3 major issued debated - re-organization, financial problems and marriage of Don Jaime - any key decision was adopted.|$|E
