40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{an analysis}} of an Integral Compressed Air Wind Turbine (ICWT), in which energy is extracted from a slow-moving renewable source {{through the use of}} compressed air. This concept is particularly applicable to large offshore wind turbines, and can be readily integrated with compressed air energy storage methods. The ICWT has a very large rotor with <b>free</b> <b>pistons</b> travelling within the rotor blades, inducting and compressing air to high pressures {{at each end of the}} stroke. The compressed air can be stored and expanded when the energy is required, solving the intermittency issue of wind energy. By gathering energy along the rotor blades, rather than at the hub, it also avoids the very high torques associated with extremely large turbines. This thesis investigates optimal control strategies for ICWTs. Firstly, an initial model of the system using coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is constructed to simulate a single piston pair of an ICWT system. This framework utilises several `modes' which the system passes through in the course of each stroke, with movement between modes controlled by simple algorithms. Calculations of potential and required energy are developed to allow basic control of the valve timings. The simulation is then extended to include thermal modelling of the walls of the compression tube, using orthonormal polynomials. A long-duration instance of the model is used to identify steady-state values for the orthonormal parameters, which demonstrates that the wall temperatures would remain within 15 K of the ambient temperature. One possible solution to the high temperatures caused by the near-adiabatic conditions of the compression is added to the model; namely, the injection of water droplets to the cylinder at the start of the compression stage. A method to efficiently simulate a phase transition in MATLAB is developed and implemented, allowing {{an analysis of}} the optimum mass balance of water to be injected to reduce the exhausted air temperature. An appendix examines several of the assumptions built into the model, in particular the rigidity of the components and variations in the rotational velocity of the rotor due to Coriolis and gravitational forces. Two valve control schemes are developed and implemented into the model; firstly, a simple proportional and derivative controller, which acts according to a rule dictating a gradual reduction in the energy surplus. This option proves to be limited in the degree to which it can avoid wasting compressed air. A second scheme, involving a simple version of sliding-mode control with two controllers operating at different timescales, is instead developed and shown to be significantly more effective at improving the system efficiency. Finally, an optimisation study is carried out on the `kick' stage, in which stored compressed air is used to accelerate the piston before compression. A large dataset of simulations allows for the specification of a set of optimum parameters based on a balance between power extraction from the rotating frame and net power generation...|$|R
5000|$|Another way of {{understanding}} the difference between [...] and [...] is that [...] applies if work is done to the system which causes a change in volume (such as by moving a piston so as to compress {{the contents of a}} cylinder), or if work is done by the system which changes its temperature (such as heating the gas in a cylinder to cause a piston to move). [...] applies only if [...] - that is, the work done - is zero. Consider the difference between adding heat to the gas with a locked piston, and adding heat with a <b>piston</b> <b>free</b> to move, so that pressure remains constant. In the second case, the gas will both heat and expand, causing the piston to do mechanical work on the atmosphere. The heat that is added to the gas goes only partly into heating the gas, while the rest is transformed into the mechanical work performed by the piston. In the first, constant-volume case (locked piston) there is no external motion, and thus no mechanical work is done on the atmosphere; [...] is used. In the second case, additional work is done as the volume changes, so the amount of heat required to raise the gas temperature (the specific heat capacity) is higher for this constant pressure case.|$|R
