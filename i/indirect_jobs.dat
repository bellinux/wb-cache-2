2500|$|Government ministers {{hoped to}} use the gas profits to bolster the sagging Bolivian economy and claimed {{the money would be}} {{invested}} exclusively in health and education. Opponents argued that under the current law, the exportation of the gas as a raw material would give Bolivia only 18% of the future profits, or US$40 million to US$70 million per year. They further argued that exporting the gas so cheaply would be the latest case of foreign exploitation of Bolivia's natural resources, starting with its silver and gold from the 17th century. They demanded that a plant be built in Bolivia to process the gas and that domestic consumption had to be met before export. As Le Monde puts it, [...] "two reasons plead for the industrial exploitation of the gas, which the multinational companies now have the capacities of doing. The first is related to the necessity of satisfying the Bolivians' energy needs. The second demonstrates the interest of exporting a more profitable product rather than selling raw material". According to the French newspaper, only La Paz, El Alto, Sucre, Potosí, Camiri and Santa Cruz are now connected to the gas network; making an interior network which would reach all Bolivians would cost $1.5 billion, notwithstanding a central gas pipeline to link the various regions together. According to Carlos Miranda, an independent expert quoted by Le Monde, the best industrialisation project is the petrochemical complex proposed by the Brazilian Braskem firm, which would create 40 000 direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>jobs</b> and cost $1.4 billion.

Conversely, in a design environment engineering changes are unavoidable and need to be effectively coordinated because they may become costly for a company in product recalls and reputational damage. They can however be viewed as a cost benefit as contributors to optimisation of product quality. In this study, engineering changes were examined as enablers to collaborative product design where the study was undertaken in the land systems sector of defence in South Africa. The sector is faced with defence cuts resulting in direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>job</b> losses across the supply chain. An exploratory study was conducted where the constraints to design performance were evaluated. The applicability of the data and process orientated information exchange models were explored on the extent they influence the speed of engineering changes.

The industrialization of the primary production within the agricultural sector is a strategic action towards adding value to the great exported volume allowing economic growth while boosting development and social welfare. Using Welfare Economics as a theoretical background, this study analyzes the socio-economic gains resulted from the biodiesel production chain, their distribution in regional and individual terms and the role of this industry as a driver to increase social welfare in Argentina. The recent development of the biodiesel industry has contributed to a general improvement of the society´s welfare adding an extra value to the great existing volume of soybean oil, by an average of USD 94 per produced ton in 2010. Moreover, although it is not a labor intensive industry, it has also contributed to the reduction of the unemployment rate creating direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>job</b> positions.
