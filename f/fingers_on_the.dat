5|$|Nemo {{stays with}} his father, who later becomes disabled. He {{works in a}} shop and spends his free time at home at the typewriter, writing a science fiction story about a journey to Mars. At a school dance, he meets Elise and falls in love. A few days later, Nemo goes to Elise's house but sees her with her 22-year-old boyfriend. Frustrated, he speeds away on his motorcycle, has an {{accident}} and is hospitalized in a vegetative state. Though he can perceive the world through his senses, Nemo cannot move or speak. He detects his parents' reunion at his bedside. Nemo tries to remember the movement of his <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> typewriter keyboard and eventually manages to lift a finger as this story line comes to a close.|$|E

25|$|Dinosaurs {{exhibit a}} pattern of the {{reduction}} and loss of <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lateral side of the hand (digits III, IV and V). The primitive function of the dinosaur hand is grasping with a partially opposable thumb, rather than weight-bearing.

25|$|The drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French chanterelle(s), Hungarian dallamhúr(ok)) are {{stopped with}} tangents {{attached}} to keys {{that change the}} vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a Pythagorean temperament, but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with equal temperament most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, {{it is possible to}} tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.|$|E
25|$|Guards {{initially}} {{laughed at}} the claims of ghosts by inmates but as time progressed some {{were reported to have}} experienced unusual activity themselves, including feeling cold spots, unseen <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of their neck, and crying in the night. The first Warden of Alcatraz, James A. Johnston, was reputed to have heard a woman sobbing while conducting tour of the prison. Occupants of the prison reported seeing prisoners from the early military prison in 19th century garb walking the corridors in A-Block which would disappear when approached by the guards, and one member of staff reputedly saw a gang of Native American prisoners marching around in a circle before vanishing. Phantom gunfire, cannon blasts and fire alarms going off on their own accord have all been reported. The Warden's House, now a burnt out shell since the Occupation of Alcatraz, is also reputed to be haunted; {{during the time of the}} penitentiary, several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove. A phantom lighthouse has also been said to have emerged from the fog of San Francisco bay.|$|E

2500|$|One {{aspect of}} James Jamerson's upright playing that carried {{over to the}} {{electric}} bass guitar, {{was the fact that}} he generally used only his right index finger to pluck the strings while resting his third and fourth <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chrome pickup cover. Jamerson's index finger even earned its own nickname: [...] "The Hook". Another aspect of Jamerson's upright playing which carried over was his use of open strings, a technique long used by jazz bass players, to pivot around the fretboard which served to give his lines a fluid feeling.|$|E

2500|$|In 1802, Otto {{attempted}} {{to impress the}} Prince of Wales—probably {{with a view to}} obtaining an invitation to dine with him at the Royal Pavilion, which was the pinnacle of social achievement in Brighton—by erecting a statue of him at Royal Crescent. He commissioned a sculptor called Rossi to do the work; he used Coade stone, ceramic stoneware manufactured by Eleanor Coade in London. The statue was reportedly unable to withstand the weathering effects of sea-spray and strong wind: by 1807, the <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sculpture's left hand had been destroyed, and soon afterwards the whole right arm dropped off. The statue began to be mistaken for Lord Nelson, and the Prince was reportedly so displeased that he forbade Otto's name to be mentioned in his presence. The dilapidated statue— tall on a [...] plinth—was removed in 1819. The gardens in front of the crescent, in which the statue stood, passed into the ownership of the Brighton Corporation after the 1884 Brighton Improvement Act was passed.|$|E

5000|$|The Death's Touch sign is a hand {{position}} used in The Saga of Darren Shan series.

The sign itself translates to the saying, [...] "Even in death, may you be triumphant". The sign first appears in the fifth book, Trials of Death, when Darren must take the Trials of Initiation. The vampires in the mountain direct the sign towards him to wish him good luck.|$|R
2500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews upon release. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{called it}} [...] "a touching ballad", where [...] "any trace of disco or glam" [...] is muted by her [...] "costentatiously squeaky <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> guitar strings". NME Emily Mackay {{wrote about the}} song, saying it was [...] "a leavetaking song of great, simple beauty, more tenderly affecting than anything Gaga's done before, showcasing the emotive power rather than the force of that great voice." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the track a positive review in comparison to other ballads on the album, stating that the song [...] "boasts a sublime hook and a relatively restrained vocal performance". Patrick Bowman from Idolator said, [...] "'Joanne' is definitely {{the best example of}} the 'real and personal' aesthetic Gaga has been talking up ahead of the album's release, full of pretty guitar picking and arguably her best vocal." [...] Marc Snetiker from Entertainment Weekly believed that it was [...] "Gaga's most disarming and original ballad in years".|$|E
2500|$|Glock pistols {{are made}} in five form factors, all modeled after the {{original}} full-sized Glock 17. [...] "Standard" [...] models are designed as full-sized duty firearms with a large magazine capacity. [...] "Compact" [...] models are slightly smaller with reduced magazine capacity and lighter weight, while maintaining a usable grip length. [...] "Subcompact" [...] models are designed for easier carry, and being lighter and shorter, are intended {{to be used with}} two <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grip below the trigger guard, and lack an accessory rail like the larger, after generation two, Glock models. The [...]45 ACP and 10mm Auto models have bigger, wider slides and are slightly larger than the smaller-chambered pistols and are available in the subcompact models Glock 29 (10mm) and Glock 30 (.45 ACP). Glock produces three models of single-stack [...] "Slimline" [...] subcompact pistols, the Glock 36 in [...]45 ACP, the Glock 42 in [...]380 ACP, and the Glock 43 in 9 x19 mm. [...] "Competition" [...] versions have longer barrels and slides, adjustable sights, an extended slide and magazine release.|$|E
2500|$|The {{left hand}} determines the {{sounding}} {{length of the}} string, and thus the pitch of the string, by [...] "stopping" [...] it (pressing it) against the fingerboard with the fingertips, producing different pitches. As the violin has no frets to stop the strings, as is usual with the guitar, the player must know exactly where to place the <b>fingers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strings to play with good intonation (tuning). Beginning violinists play open strings and the lowest position, nearest to the nut. Students often start with relatively easy keys, such as A Major and G major. Students are taught scales and simple melodies. Through practice of scales and arpeggios and ear training, the violinist's left hand eventually [...] "finds" [...] the notes intuitively by muscle memory. The player must correct the intonation by ear. After determining that a fingered note is too sharp, the player must subtly make the note flatter by making an alteration of the finger angle (or {{in the case of}} being significantly sharp, moving the finger to a flatter, and thus correct, pitch). If the player determines that a fingered note is too flat, the pitch is raised by altering the finger position.|$|E
