5|$|In 1956, VAT {{became the}} {{representative}} for Ansaldo S.A. and Kämper-Motoren GmbH. Ansaldo offered <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> between 100hp and 8,000hp intended for marine and industrial applications. Kämper products delivered between 14hp and 150hp.

5|$|Required {{power was}} put up {{by a pair of}} {{afterburning}} Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 turbojets, fed from intakes mounted high above the wings to avoid ingesting spray.

A total of 45 F-4As were built and none saw combat and most {{ended up as}} test or training aircraft. The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom, the F-4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ-72 radar (pulse only), a Texas Instruments AAA-4 Infra-red search and track pod under the nose, an AN/AJB-3 bombing system and powered by J79-GE-8,-8A and -8B <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> 10,900lbf (48.5kN) dry and 16,950lbf (75.4kN) afterburner (reheat) with the first flight on 25 March 1961. 649 F-4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF-121 Pacemakers receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar.|$|E

5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. The He 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp. <b>Engines</b> <b>of</b> suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it {{to rely on the}} BMW VI or 132s.|$|E
5|$|An unusual {{fault with}} the first <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the class was fore-and-aft vibration, strong enough to prompt {{passengers}} to complain and to cause fire-irons stowed in a longitudinal compartment {{on top of the}} tender to work their way forward into the cab. The passengers' complaints were dealt with by reducing the tension in the drawbar spring.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann {{said the}} German pilots {{themselves}} still learned from their enemy. Oil freezing in the DB 605 <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the Bf109G-6s made them difficult {{to start in}} the extreme cold of the Russian winter. A captured Soviet airman showed them how pouring fuel into the aircraft's oil sump would thaw the oil and enable the engine to start on the first try. Another solution, also learned from the Soviets, was to ignite fuel under the engine.|$|E

5|$|Race {{stewards}} initially {{imposed a}} 10-place penalty on Coulthard and Barrichello, for changing their engines prior to qualification. Since 2006, the <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> Formula One cars {{are required to}} last for two races. However, after further investigation they rescinded Coulthard's penalty, as he had retired from the previous race and his change had been made {{before the start of}} the race weekend. Barrichello's penalty stood.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in ceramics and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball bearings made of silicon nitride ceramic are used in performance bearings. A representative example is use of silicon nitride bearings in the main <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the NASA's Space Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{is one of}} {{the wealthiest}} regions in the United States, due, primarily, to the {{economic}} power <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. The Bay Area city of Pleasanton has the second-highest household income in the country after New Canaan, Connecticut. However, discretionary income is very comparable {{with the rest of the}} country, primarily because the higher cost of living offsets the increased income.|$|E

5|$|The {{supply of}} the DB 600 {{remained}} extremely limited as production was soon switched over to the fuel-injected DB 601, which was reserved for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighters. Therefore, production versions of the basic Do 17M model airframe were fitted with the new Bramo 323A-1 Fafnir <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> 670kW (900hp), which gave reasonable performance and raised the bomb load to 1,000kg (2,200lb). The resulting Do 17 M-1 was produced in small numbers and operated until 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one of the <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were {{able to get out of}} the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued.|$|E
5|$|This was a bold venture. Planning for the Saint-Etienne railway {{preceded the}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1830, {{which was used}} as the {{prototype}} by other pioneering railways, so many new technical problems had to be solved. In fact the steep section from Rive-de-Gier to Saint-Etienne was beyond the power of steam traction <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the day.|$|E

5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, agriculture, timber, and {{ranching}} were the leading economic <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> Texas. This was changed by the boom, which led to rapid industrialization. Though refineries were initially concentrated around the Beaumont and Houston areas, refining operations gradually grew throughout the state {{by the end of the}} 1920s. By 1940, the value of petroleum and natural gas produced in Texas exceeded the value of all agricultural products in the state. The state's GDP grew from approximately $119 million ($ in today's terms) in 1900 to approximately $29 billion ($ in today's terms), a more than 240-fold increase. The U.S. GDP as a whole grew by less than 24 times during the same period.|$|E
5|$|German {{ground forces}} {{crossed the border}} at 05:15 on 6 April, and the Reich Minister of Propaganda, Reichsleiter Joseph Goebbels, {{announced}} the declaration of war at 06:00. Yugoslav anti-aircraft defences caused a false alarm when they reported the approach of an air raid {{from the direction of}} Romania at 03:00, but listening posts on the Romanian border had actually heard the aircraft <b>engines</b> <b>of</b> the Romanian-based Fliegerführer Arad warming up well before they took off. The VVKJ's 51st Fighter Group at Zemun had been alerted before dawn, and when reports began to be received about Luftwaffe attacks on VVKJ airfields, the first patrol was sent into the air. At first, no aircraft could be seen approaching Belgrade.|$|E
