60|$|To {{revert to}} Mr Bloom who, {{after his first}} entry, had been {{conscious}} of some impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits of that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not pity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and outrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello was an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that seemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen <b>gibbosity,</b> {{born out of wedlock}} and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the world, which the dint of the surgeon's pliers in his skull lent indeed a colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of creation's chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them with the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the cost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold with) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit the tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost all forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of experience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious retreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring nought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever (as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the tree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any condition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful occasions. To conclude, while from the sister's words he had reckoned upon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little alleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an ordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy {{as well as to the}} bounty of the Supreme Being.|$|E

5000|$|All the {{currently}} known geometric microliths {{share the same}} fundamental characteristics [...] - [...] only their shapes vary. They were all made from blades or from microblades (nearly always of flint), using the microburin technique (which implies {{that it is not}} possible to conserve the remains of the heel or the conchoidal flakes from the blank). The pieces were then finished by a percussive retouching of the edges (generally leaving one side with the natural edge of the blank), giving the piece its definitive polygonal form. For example, in order to make a triangle, two adjacent notches were retouched, leaving free the third edge or base (using the terminology of Fortea). They generally have one long axis and concave or convex edges, and it is possible for them to have a <b>gibbosity</b> (hump) or indentations. Triangular microliths may be isosceles, scalene or equilateral. In the case of trapezoid geometric microliths, on the other hand, the notches are not retouched, leaving a portion of the natural edge between them. Trapezoids can be further subdivided into symmetrical, asymmetrical and those with concave edges. Lunate microliths have the least diversity of all and may be either semicircular or segmental.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{gibberellic}} acid (GA 3), {{in the presence}} of EDDHA, on the flowering and <b>gibbosity</b> of Ltmna gibba G 3 was studied. At 10 ppm and at higher concentrations of GA 3 the EDDHA-effect, i. e. profuse flowering and conspicuously gibbous fronds, was completely nullified. In several species of the Lemnaceae (Duckweeds) specific chelating agents have been shown to affect flowering (cf. review 1). In Lemna gibba G 3, a long-day plant, EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) and EDDHA (ethylenediamine-di-o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) induce or significantly enhance flowering under long-day conditions (1 - 6). In this duckweed, EDDHA also markedly influences <b>gibbosity,</b> a swelling of the lower side of the fronds.

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{describe}} {{the results of a}} hypopressive gymnastics (HG) program applied to 3 children with idiopathic scoliosis. Three children (ages ranging from 8 to 15 years) suffering from idiopathic scoliosis were recruited for this study. Thoracic or thoracolumbar curves showed between 15 ° and 40 ° Cobb degrees. The evolutionary character of the curves had been confirmed. A study of different clinical and radiological parameters was carried out to compare the measurements before and after (3 months later) the application of a 5 HG daily exercises programme: A radiological study of the spine was carried out to compare the measurements of the vertebral rotation. A radiological study, a plumb line and a measuring tape were used to assess the vertebral tilt in this study. A Scoliometer was used to measure the deformation of the rib cage (<b>gibbosity).</b> The most significant results were: a trend to reach stabilisation in the vertebral tilt and rotation, and stabilisation of <b>gibbosity,</b> which probably might improve the respiratory function of these subjects.

Patient and methodsA case report on a 16 -year-old boy suffering from knee pain and presenting with bilateral genu varum and mild scoliosis. At the initial evaluation (T 0), the intercondylar space was 7 cm and the Cobb angles for the right lumbar curve and left thoracic curve were 18 ° and 13 °, respectively. The boy was treated with Postural Reconstruction®, a neuromuscular physiotherapy intervention using facilitation/inhibition techniques. The outcomes used to quantify the effect of 6 months (T 1), 12 months (T 2) and 26 months (T 3) of treatment were pain levels, the intercondylar space, the lumbar <b>gibbosity</b> and the lumbar and thoracic Cobb angles.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reproducibility {{of basic}} {{research}} investigations in homeopathy is challenging. This study investigated if formerly observed effects of homeopathically potentised gibberellic acid (GA 3) on growth of duckweed (Lemna gibba L.) were reproducible. METHODS: Duckweed was grown in potencies (14 x- 30 x) of GA 3 and one time succussed and unsuccussed water controls. Outcome parameter area-related growth rate {{was determined by}} a computerised image analysis system. Three series including five independent blinded and randomised potency experiments (PE) each were carried out. System stability was controlled by three series of five systematic negative control (SNC) experiments. <b>Gibbosity</b> (a specific growth state of L. gibba) was investigated as possibly essential factor for reactivity of L. gibba towards potentised GA 3 in one series of potency and SNC experiments, respectively. RESULTS: Only in the third series with gibbous L. gibba L. we observed a significant effect (p = 0. 009, F-test) of the homeopathic treatment. However, growth rate increased {{in contrast to the}} former study, and most biologically active potency levels differed. Variability in PE was lower than in SNC experiments. The stability of the experimental system was verified by the SNC experiments. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Gibbosity</b> seems to be a necessary condition for reactivity of L. gibba to potentised GA 3. Further still unknown conditions seem to govern effect direction and the pattern of active and inactive potency levels. When designing new reproducibility studies, the physiological state of the test organism must be considered.
