5|$|The {{first such}} effort, Cosgrove Hall's {{animation}} of The Invasion episodes 1 and 4, was released to DVD alongside the surviving episodes in November 2006.

Despite the DVD's success, the sales were not high enough to offset the animation cost for any future collaboration.|$|E
5|$|As the Dalek discovers Rose, {{the video}} feeds to the Vault are lost, and the Doctor {{immediately}} sets off {{to try to}} get back into the Vault. The Dalek tries to kill Rose but it cannot, having found compassion from Rose's DNA. The Dalek is urged to kill van Statton, but Rose instead convinces to spare his life. She follows the Dalek as it makes its way to the highest part of the Vault and destroys the roof, exposing the area to natural sunlight that the Dalek basks <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> arrives and prepares to kill the Dalek, but Rose stops him, convincing him the Dalek has developed emotions. However, the Dalek is unable to cope with them, and it asks Rose to orders its own self-destruction to end its pain. Rose reluctantly agrees, and the Dalek shortly implodes thereafter.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for being so far behind.|$|E

5|$|Following the purges and {{subsequent}} recoveries, gaps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons. Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials; although two stories are missing just one episode each (The Tenth Planet, Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3), other stories are lost altogether. Patrick Troughton's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected; of the fourteen stories comprising {{his first two}} seasons, only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete, and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been <b>in,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
