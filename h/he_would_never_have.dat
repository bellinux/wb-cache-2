5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in the prayers of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E
5|$|In April, 1972 he was reassigned {{from the}} SAC to TAC {{and to the}} 42nd Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (42 TEWS), 388th Tactical Fighter Wing, at Korat, Thailand. He was {{familiar}} with targeting both SAC missiles and SAC airplanes, {{was one of the}} most knowledgeable missile and electronic counter-measures experts in Vietnam, and it is likely that his situation was quickly reported to U.S. intelligence services. Very few Americans remained on the ground in Vietnam, and the NVA made it a point to track particularly valuable personnel, even in Thailand. The North Vietnamese were probably supported by the Russians with decrypting American message traffic and they likely knew exactly who had parachuted into their midst. This ability was likely enabled by the then unknown American spy CWO John Anthony Walker, who had given the Soviets a radio cipher card and other high-value intelligence. Hambleton's capture would be a terrific blow to American airpower around the world and a huge prize for the North Vietnamese and indirectly, the Soviets. Hambleton said after the war that he felt sure if he were captured that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been taken to Hanoi.|$|E
25|$|Czech writer Arnošt Lustig recounts in {{his book}} 3x18 that Joseph Heller told him that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> written Catch-22 had he not first read The Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek.|$|E
5|$|Many people {{weighed in}} on the {{decision}} on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising {{the integrity of the}} game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> done it without Bascom's blessing.|$|R

25|$|Novak {{has said}} {{repeatedly}} {{that he was not}} told, and that he did not know, that Plame was – or had ever been – a NOC, an agent with Non-Official Cover. He has emphatically said that had he understood that she was any sort of secret agent, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> named her.|$|E
25|$|While {{it seemed}} {{baffling}} that a player of his quality {{was allowed to}} leave any Superleague team, Turner noted in 2012, had he not departed Irish shores, temporarily as it happened, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> enjoyed {{what he describes as}} his most enjoyable experience away from Ireland: winning the Swiss Division Two league title and MVP honors in 2004–05 with Vacallo. In 18 games for Vacallo, he averaged a league-leading 30.8 points, 12.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 5.5 steals and 2.8 blocks per game.|$|E

The archive forms {{part of the}} permanent legacy of Motion's time as Poet Laureate. He states that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been able to raise the £2000000 needed to launch the library without his position. The project was initially funded by the National Lottery, government grants and private donors in conjunction with work by Jean Sprackland.|$|E

50|$|Lolita {{polarized}} contemporary critics, but is well-received today. Kubrick later commented, however, {{that if he}} {{had realized}} how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, <b>he</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> made the film.|$|R
5000|$|Mel's Diner {{closed in}} 1985, {{and despite his}} cheapness over the years, he gave his beloved waitresses a $5,000 {{farewell}} bonus, along with the famous cow creamers on the tables. Also, Mel was touched when Tommy stated that {{had it not been}} for Alice working there, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a second father, which Mel had become to him. Mel reciprocated the sentiments by stating [...] "and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> a kid to raise." ...|$|R
25|$|While {{there were}} many rumours of his and his opponent's participation, it was finally {{announced}} that Hari would face MMA Heavyweight Alistair Overeem in a K-1 rules match on K-1's New Year's Eve extravaganza Dynamite!! 2008. Hari lost the fight by a left hook KO at 2:02 in the first round. After the match, Hari commented {{that this would be}} the last time he would participate in the Dynamite!! series, and that he would stick to stand-up fighting so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> an MMA rules match with Overeem.|$|E
25|$|In {{one scene}} Hassan is {{attacked}} {{and it is}} suggested that he is raped. The filmmakers wanted Ahmad to take off his pants for the shooting, but his father refused to let him do that. The boy has said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> taken the role had he known Hassan would be raped. Reports vary on whether he and his family were properly informed in advance. The scene has now been depicted in a less harrowing manner than originally planned, and there is no nudity in it. Nevertheless, a body double was used to show the boy's pants being tugged slightly down.|$|E
25|$|Attlee {{remained}} as Leader of the Opposition when the Second World War {{broke out in}} September 1939. The ensuing disastrous Norwegian Campaign {{would result in a}} motion of no confidence in Neville Chamberlain. Although Chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged that it became clear a coalition government would be necessary. Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E
6000|$|Gus came {{trotting}} up on {{a spirited}} sorrel, leading two other well-pointed horses, saddled, champing their bits.

5000|$|V. [...] "Schöne Wiege meiner Leiden" [...] — The narrator bids {{farewell}} to the town in which he first saw his beloved and laments that he ever met her, as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> then <b>never</b> <b>have</b> become so miserable as he is now. In E major.|$|R
5000|$|In {{midst of}} FAB5's plan to expose Harshad, Nandini begins to doubt Manik's reasons for {{breaking}} up with her as his behaviour starts contradicting his words. She confronts him {{and in a moment}} of weakness, he admits that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> broken up with if it was not for Dhruv. This angers Nandini and she accuses Manik of being selfish for not considering her feelings and tells him that she wants nothing more to do with him whilst he apologises and begs for her forgiveness after realising what he did to her was wrong.|$|R
25|$|In 1966 the {{coalition}} of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) fell and a grand coalition between CDU/CSU and SPD was formed {{under the leadership of}} CDU Chancellor Kiesinger. The welfare state was considerably expanded, while social spending was almost doubled between 1969 and 1975. Changes were made to income maintenance schemes which met some of the SPD’s long-standing demands, and many other social reforms were introduced, including the equalising of wages and salaries between white-collar and blue-collar employees, the continuation of wage and salary payments, a law to promote employment, and a vocational training law. Although these measures were largely due to the efforts of the CDU minister Hans Katzer, it is arguable that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> been able to push his programme through the cabinet (let alone envisage it) without the SPD.|$|E
25|$|The {{next morning}} the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. Útgarða-Loki appears, has his {{servants}} prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, Útgarða-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor {{says that he is}} unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E
25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in {{when he showed up}} at his door in Harlem asking for a place to stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E
60|$|The old soldier wrote a {{characteristic}} letter. In the first place, he told James that he regarded {{him as a}} fool, for mixing up in an affair {{in which he had}} no concern whatever. Then he congratulated him on the fact that circumstances had broken the chain from which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> otherwise <b>have</b> freed himself.|$|R

500|$|The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings, {{published}} by Ballantine Books on October 12, 1978, still {{referred to the}} sequel in the book's inside cover jacket. Bakshi states that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> made the film if he had known what would happen during the production. He {{is quoted as saying}} that the reason he made the film was [...] "to save it for Tolkien, because I loved the Rings very much." ...|$|E
500|$|The final witness was Handel Booth himself. Booth {{stated that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{asked for a}} ten-percent {{commission}} on the Birmingham contract, {{and that he had}} never claimed he could influence government ministers. Hastings showed the jury that both of these statements were lies, first by showing the piece of paper Booth had scribbled the [...] "Birmingham contract" [...] memo on and then by showing a telegram from Booth to Gruban in which Booth claimed that he [...] " [...] already spoken to a Cabinet Minister and high official".|$|E

When {{the creator of the}} World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee, was asked for an example of a popular use of the internet that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> predicted, <b>he</b> answered [...] "Kittens". A 2014 paper argues that cats' [...] "unselfconsciousness" [...] is rare in an age of hyper-surveillance, and cat photos appeal to people as it lets them imagine [...] "the possibility of freedom from surveillance", while presenting the power of controlling that surveillance as unproblematic. Time magazine felt that cat images tap into viewers nature as [...] "secret voyeurs".|$|R
500|$|In his {{interview}} with Spielberg on Inside the Actors Studio, James Lipton suggested Close Encounters had another, more personal theme for Spielberg: [...] "Your father was a computer engineer; your mother was a concert pianist, and when the spaceship lands, they make music together on the computer", suggesting that Roy Neary's boarding the spaceship is Spielberg's wish {{to be reunited with}} his parents. In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made Close Encounters when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> had Neary leave his family and go on the mother ship.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} meeting, {{options for the}} {{disposition}} of the Jews and their property were discussed. Jews would be segregated into ghettos or encouraged to emigrate, and their property would be seized in a programme of Aryanization. Compensation for seized property would be low, if any was given at all. Detailed minutes of this meeting and other documents were read out at the Nuremberg trial, proving his knowledge of and complicity with the persecution of the Jews. He told Gilbert that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> supported the anti-Jewish measures if he had known {{what was going to}} happen. [...] "I only thought we would eliminate Jews from positions in big business and government," [...] he claimed.|$|E
500|$|Kove {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make the film biographical, based on a story her father told her: he had dreamed of being an artist, and made an appointment with an art teacher to ask if he was good enough {{to make it in the}} art world. However, he stood at the top of the stairs and decided not to go, eventually deciding to go to architecture school (as his parents wanted) where he met his wife. Kove's inspiration was drawn from the fact that her existence seemed to hinge on that decision, because [...] "if the artist had said, 'Oh, you must paint,' you know, then in all likelihood <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> met my mother, and, you know, that would have been it for my chances." [...] However, Kove felt the story was too personal, and rewrote it to be fictional.|$|E
50|$|Despite their {{occasional}} conflicts, Joram and Camber {{still enjoy}} {{a very close}} relationship throughout the series. Neither of them agrees {{with all of the}} other's decisions and rationale, but their familial love remains strong through all of their troubles. In the later novels, Joram is forced to re-evaluate his opinion on his father's sanctity, a process that strikes to the core of Joram's personality as both a son and a priest. Although Joram initially opposes Camber's canonization because he knows it is based on a lie, Camber's mysterious appearances after his death leave Joram with no choice but to finally acknowledge his father as a saint. In both King Javan's Year and The Bastard Prince, he openly expresses his belief in his father's sainthood, a confession that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> made in the earlier novels.|$|R

50|$|Philip {{ensured that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again <b>have</b> {{trouble with the}} Church by {{promoting}} Raymond Bertrand de Got, archbishop of Bordeaux, as the next Pope. The papal concave was evenly divided between French and Italian cardinals, but the latter acquiesced and de Got became Pope Clement V.
