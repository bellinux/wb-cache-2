Abstract: We propose {{a new approach to}} the pricing and hedging of contingent claims under transaction costs in a general incomplete market in discrete time.

40|$|Evidence based {{medicine}} supports {{net benefit}} maximising therapies and strategies in processes of health technology assessment (HTA) for reimbursement and subsidy decisions internationally. However, translation of evidence based medicine to practice is impeded by efficiency {{measures such as}} cost per case-mix adjusted separation in hospitals, which ignore health effects of care. In this paper we identify a correspondence method that allows quality variables under control of providers to be incorporated in efficiency measures consistent with maximising net benefit. Including effects framed from a disutility bearing (utility reducing) perspective (e. g. mortality, morbidity or reduction in life years) as inputs and minimising quality <b>inclusive</b> <b>costs</b> on the cost-disutility plane is shown to enable efficiency measures consistent with maximising net benefit under a one to one correspondence. The method combines advantages of radial properties with an appropriate objective of maximising net benefit to overcome problems of inappropriate objectives implicit with alternative methods, whether specifying quality variables with utility bearing output (e. g. survival, reduction in morbidity or life years), hyperbolic or exogenous variables. This correspondence approach is illustrated in undertaking efficiency comparison at a clinical activity level for 45 Australian hospitals allowing for their costs and mortality rates per admission. Explicit coverage and comparability conditions of the underlying correspondence method are also shown to provide a robust framework for preventing cost-shifting and cream-skimming incentives, with appropriate qualification of analysis and support for data linkage and risk adjustment where these conditions are not satisfied. Comparison on the cost-disutility plane has previously {{been shown to have}} distinct advantages in comparing multiple strategies in HTA, which this paper naturally extends to a robust method and framework for comparing efficiency of health care providers in practice. Consequently, the proposed approach provides a missing link between HTA and practice, to allow active incentives for evidence based net benefit maximisation in practice...|$|R

40|$|Insect {{societies}} {{are vulnerable to}} exploitation by workers who reproduce selfishly rather than help to rear the queen's offspring. In most species, however, only {{a small proportion of}} the workers reproduce. Here, we develop an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model to investigate factors that could explain these observed low levels of reproductive exploitation. Two key factors are identified: relatedness and policing. Relatedness affects the ESS proportion of reproductive workers because laying workers generally work less, leading to greater <b>inclusive</b> fitness <b>costs</b> when within-colony relatedness is higher. The second key factor is policing. In many species, worker-laid eggs are selectively removed or `policed¿ by other workers or the queen. We show that policing not only prevents the rearing of worker-laid eggs but can also make it unprofitable for workers to lay eggs in the first place. This can explain why almost no workers reproduce in species with efficient policing, such as honeybees, Apis, and the common wasp, Vespula vulgaris, despite relatively low relatedness caused by multiple mating of the mother queen. Although our analyses focus on social insects, the conclusion that both relatedness and policing can reduce the incentive for cheating applies to other biological systems as well...|$|R
40|$|Brood parasites may be favoured over host nestlings due to {{variation}} in the honesty of their begging signals. Begging behaviour of great spotted cuckoo nestlings and their host magpie nestlings was recorded when controiiing food need, Cuckoo begging effort was dishonest {{as an indicator of}} nutritional need, whilst magpie begging was not. Cuckoos begged for longer and emitted more calls at a higher rate irrespective of the degree of food deprivation, although in contrast to magpies, cuckoos ate food in relation to their need. Energetic and predation costs are unlikely to account for these differences. Differences in indirect <b>inclusive</b> fitness <b>costs</b> can explain the more intensive begging by cuckoos. Magpie parents given a choice favoured larger nestlings and those begging more intensively. Cuckoos obtained more food and a larger share than magpies of a similar size. Magpies therefore received less food {{in the presence of a}} cuckoo, and cuckoos received a similar share irrespective of their size. Lack of relatedness to their magpie hosts therefore allows cuckoos to exploit a set of adaptive rules in the host parents and manipulate them into providing the latter with preferential care.

Hence, mechanisms that allow a tadpole to recognize and modify its behavior toward kin may reduce the <b>inclusive</b> fitness <b>costs</b> of cannibalism. Alternatively, ecological factors may cause preferential treatment of kin to be too costly to be favored by selection. We tested these two predictions in the Green Poison Frog, Dendrobates auratus. The effect of kinship on larval cannibalism was examined {{through a series of}} kin-discrimination trials. The behavior of large tadpoles was observed when presented with two small, tethered tadpoles, one a clutchmate and one an unrelated tadpole. In these simultaneous presentation tests, tadpoles displayed a significant preference for attacking kin. In a series of timed trials, pairs of unequally sized tadpoles were placed together in containers. The majority (70 %) of large tadpoles took less than 24 hr to consume the small tadpole. Kinship did not affect the survival time of the small tadpole. Our results are consistent with observations that D. auratus is an indiscriminate predator. As conspecifics may be serious competitors, their swift elimination would be an advantage, particularly in the small, nutrient-poor poolsused by this species...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{species have}} evolved {{characteristic}} patterns of age-specific mortality across their life spans. If these mortality profiles {{are shaped by}} natural selection they should reflect underlying variation in the fitness effect of mortality with age. Direct fitness models, however, do not accurately predict the mortality profiles of many species. For several species, including humans, mortality rates vary considerably before and after reproductive ages, during life-stages when no variation in direct fitness is possible. Variation in mortality rates at these ages may reflect indirect effects of natural selection acting through kin. To test this possibility we developed a new two-variable measure of inclusive fitness, which we term the extended genomic output or EGO. Using EGO, we estimate the inclusive fitness effect of mortality at different ages in a small hunter-gatherer population with a typical human mortality profile. EGO in this population predicts 90 % {{of the variation in}} age-specific mortality. This result represents the first empirical measurement of inclusive fitness of a trait in any species. It shows that the pattern of human survival can largely be explained by variation in the <b>inclusive</b> fitness <b>cost</b> of mortality at different ages. More generally, our approach can be used to estimate the inclusive fitness of any trait or genotype from population data on birth dates and relatedness...|$|R
40|$|Laying eggs in nests of {{unrelated}} conspecific pairs to parasitize their {{parental care}} is a common phenomenon in birds. In blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus such conspecific brood parasitism (CBP) has never {{been reported in the}} literature. However, in a situation where breeding density was extremely high, we found six nests to be parasitized with eggs of conspecific females. Natural selection may favour elevated competitiveness of parasite young, since the negative consequences of increased sibling competition are incurred on the unrelated host parents and siblings, and therefore do not act as <b>inclusive</b> fitness <b>costs</b> for the parasites. Parasitizing females could achieve such a competitive advantage for their offspring by laying larger eggs or eggs with higher concentrations of testosterone in the yolk. We analyzed these parameters of the six parasitized nests, but did not find that parasite eggs differ systematically in these aspects from host eggs, nor that parasite eggs showed resemblance to host eggs. We suggest that a shortage of available nest sites caused some females to use CBP as a best-of-a bad job strategy, but that either the occurrence of CBP is too rare to lead to strong selection for egg adjustments or that parasitizing females are unable to do so. ...|$|R
