40|$|We {{examine the}} {{seasonal}} behavior of ozone {{by using measurements}} from various instruments including ozonesondes, Aura Microwave Limb Sounder, and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II. We find that the magnitude of <b>the</b> annual variation <b>in</b> ozone, {{as a percentage of the}} mean ozone, exhibits a maximum at or slightly above the tropical tropopause. The maximum is larger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>tropics</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>tropics,</b> and <b>the</b> annual maximum of ozone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>tropics</b> occurs 2 months later than that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>tropics,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to usual assumption that <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> can be treated as a horizontally homogeneous region. The seasonal cycles of ozone and other species in this part of the lower stratosphere result from a combination of the seasonal variation of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the seasonal variation of tropical and midlatitude mixing. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere, the impacts of upwelling and mixing between <b>the</b> <b>tropics</b> and midlatitudes on ozone are in phase and additive. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere, they are not in phase. We apply a tropical leaky pipe model independently to each hemisphere to examine the relative roles of upwelling and mixing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern and southern tropical regions. Reasonable assumptions of the seasonal variation of upwelling and mixing yield a good description of the seasonal magnitude and phase <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> southern and northern <b>tropics.</b> <b>The</b> differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tracers and transport between the northern and southern tropical stratospheres suggest that the paradigm of well-mixed tropics needs to be revised to consider latitudinal variations within <b>the</b> <b>tropics...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thermal and {{dynamical}} {{structure of}} the tropical atmosphere which emerged from the numerical integration of our general circulation model with a simple hydrologic cycle is analyzed in detail. According {{to the results of}} our analysis, the lapse rate of zonal mean temperature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model <b>Tropics</b> is supermoist-adiabatic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower troposphere, and is sub-moist-adiabatic above the 400 -mb. level in qualitative agreement with thc observed features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>Tropics.</b> <b>The</b> flow field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model <b>Tropics</b> also displays interesting features. For example, a zone of strong convergence and a belt of heavy rain develops around the equator. Synoptic-scale disturbances such as weak tropical cyclones and shear lines with strong convergence develop and are reminiscent of disturbances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> actual tropical atmosphere. The humid towers, which result from moist convective adjustment and condensation, develop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central core of the regions of strong upward motion, sometimes reaching the level of the tropical tropopause and thus heating the upper tropical troposphere.
