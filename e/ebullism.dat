500|$|On ascent from a dive, {{inert gas}} {{comes out of}} {{solution}} in a process called [...] "outgassing" [...] or [...] "offgassing". Under normal conditions, most offgassing occurs by gas exchange in the lungs. If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body.

50|$|Humans {{and animals}} exposed to vacuum will lose {{consciousness}} {{after a few}} seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes, but the symptoms are not nearly as graphic as commonly depicted in media and popular culture. The reduction in pressure lowers the temperature at which blood and other body fluids boil, but the elastic pressure of blood vessels ensures that this boiling point remains above the internal body temperature of 37 °C. Although the blood will not boil, the formation of gas bubbles in bodily fluids at reduced pressures, known as <b>ebullism,</b> is still a concern. The gas may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Swelling and <b>ebullism</b> can be restrained by containment in a flight suit. Shuttle astronauts wore a fitted elastic garment called the Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS) which prevents <b>ebullism</b> at pressures as low as 2 kPa (15 Torr). Rapid boiling will cool the skin and create frost, particularly in the mouth, {{but this is not a}} significant hazard.|$|E
5000|$|Cold or {{oxygen-rich}} atmospheres {{can sustain}} life at pressures {{much lower than}} atmospheric, {{as long as the}} density of oxygen {{is similar to that of}} standard sea-level atmosphere. The colder air temperatures found at altitudes of up to 3 km generally compensate for the lower pressures there. Above this altitude, oxygen enrichment is necessary to prevent altitude sickness in humans that did not undergo prior acclimatization, and spacesuits are necessary to prevent <b>ebullism</b> above 19 km. [...] Most spacesuits use only 20 kPa (150 Torr) of pure oxygen. This pressure is high enough to prevent <b>ebullism,</b> but decompression sickness and gas embolisms can still occur if decompression rates are not managed.|$|E
5000|$|The key {{concerns}} {{for a human}} without protective clothing beyond Earth’s atmosphere are the following, listed roughly in the descending order of mortal significance: <b>ebullism,</b> hypoxia, hypocapnia, decompression sickness, extreme temperature variations and cellular mutation and destruction from high energy photons and (sub-atomic) particles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ebullism,</b> the {{formation}} of bubbles in body fluids due to reduced ambient pressure, is the most severe component of the experience. Technically, <b>ebullism</b> is considered to begin at an elevation of around 19 km or pressures less than 6.3 kPa (47 mm Hg), known as the Armstrong Limit. Experiments with other animals have revealed an array of symptoms that could also apply to humans. The least severe {{of these is the}} freezing of bodily secretions due to evaporative cooling. But severe symptoms such as loss of oxygen in tissue (anoxia), followed by circulatory failure and flaccid paralysis in about 30 seconds. The lungs also collapse (atelectasis) in this process, but will continue to release water vapour leading to cooling and ice formation in the respiratory tract.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ebullism</b> is the {{formation}} of gas bubbles in bodily fluids due to reduced environmental pressure, for example at high altitude. It occurs because a system of liquid and gas at equilibrium will see a net conversion of liquid to gas as pressure lowers, for example, liquids reach their boiling point at lower temperatures when the pressure on them is lowered.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>ebullism</b> include {{bubbles in}} the {{membranes}} {{of the mouth}} and eyes, swelling of the skin, and bubbles in the blood. Blood circulation and breathing may be impaired or stopped. The brain tissue may be starved of oxygen because of blockage of arteries, and the lungs may swell and hemorrhage. Death results unless recompression is rapid enough to reduce the bubbles before tissue damage occurs.|$|E
5000|$|To prevent <b>ebullism,</b> a pure oxygen (O2) {{atmosphere}} {{was used in}} early space flights to eliminate nitrogen in the blood. There are major fire hazards associated with using pure O2 as a breathing gas, which was central {{to the death of}} three astronauts in a fire during a ground test with Apollo 1. Nonetheless NASA continued to use a nominally pure oxygen atmosphere throughout the Apollo Program but switched to air for the follow-on Space Transport System [...] "Space Shuttle". Russian cosmonauts used pure oxygen before changing to a higher-pressure nitrox mixture, leading to incompatibility problems in 1975 on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Space suits are often pressurized to several psi lower than stations' capsules or shuttles and since they still use pure O2, an acclimation period is common in the airlock to remove nitrogen and other gases from the bloodstream.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of May 1, 1966, Piantanida donned a bright orange {{pressure}} suit and parachute harness. Secured inside a styrofoam-insulated gondola {{about the size of}} a portable toilet, he began his ascent for a planned super-sonic free fall from over 120,000 feet. However, ground controllers listening to the communications link with the Strato Jump III were startled by the sound of a whoosh of rushing air and a sudden, cut-off call over the radio to abort. Piantanida's suit had depressurized at about the 57,000-foot mark. Ground controllers immediately jettisoned the balloon at close to 56000 ft - higher than the cruising altitude for commercial jets - and for twenty-five minutes Piantanida's gondola parachuted to the ground. Piantanida barely survived the descent, having suffered massive tissue damage due to <b>ebullism,</b> and the lack of oxygen left him brain damaged and in a coma from which he never recovered. Piantanida died four months later at the Veterans Hospital in Philadelphia, on August 29.|$|E
5000|$|Few {{humans have}} {{experienced}} these four conditions. In 1960, Joseph Kittinger experienced localised <b>ebullism</b> during a 31 km ascent in a helium-driven gondola. His right-hand glove failed to pressurise {{and his hand}} expanded to roughly twice its normal volume [...] accompanied by disabling pain. His hand took about 3 hours to recover after {{his return to the}} ground. Two other people were decompressed accidentally during space mission training programs on the ground, but both incidents were less than 5 minutes in duration, and both victims survived. International Space Station and Space Shuttle astronauts regularly work in Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMUs or space suits) that are at pressures less than 30% of the spacecraft to facilitate mobility, without experiencing noticeable decompression sickness. However, EMUs are pressurized with pure oxygen as to maintain an oxygen partial pressure equivalent with the 1 atm nitrogen-dominated ISS atmosphere. Significant prebreathing and decompression procedures are required when donning an EMU in order to avoid decompression sickness.|$|E

40|$|Exposure of {{unprotected}} {{humans to}} altitudes above 63, 000 ft results in <b>ebullism.</b> <b>Ebullism</b> {{occurs when the}} vapor pressure of tissues {{is less than the}} ambient pressure and the tissues spontaneously 'boil'. This may result in rapid unconsciousness, cardiac vaporlock, pulmonary collapse, cerebral anoxia, and sometimes even death. Potential places for this include EVA accidents in space, aircraft experiencing rapid decompression at high altitudes with cabin or pressure suit failure, and accidents during pressure suit training exercises. The pathophysiology of <b>ebullism</b> was studied in the 40 's to 60 's using animal models. There is one report of a prolonged, unprotected human exposure and several anecdotal of unprotected short term exposures to near vacuum. In addition to pulmonary and neurologic concerns, unprotected exposure of the head may result in freezing of the corneal surface of the eye. Surface eye freezing may impair vision and significantly impact mission completion. At this time, little data are available on the effectiveness of conventional treatment protocols, such as hyperbaric oxygen, for <b>ebullism</b> induced injuries. Research is needed to assess the efficacy of other adjunctive therapies such as high frequency ventilation and cerebral protective drugs that are still under development...|$|E
40|$|Spaceflight {{carriers}} run {{a constant}} risk {{of exposure to}} vacuum. Above 63, 000 ft (47 mmHg), the ambient pressure falls below the vapor pressure of water at 37 C, and tissue vaporization (<b>ebullism)</b> begins. Little is know about appropriate resuscitative protocols after such an <b>ebullism</b> exposure. This study identified injury patterns and mortality rates associated with <b>ebullism</b> while verifying effectiveness of traditional pulmonary resuscitative techniques. Male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to 87, 000 ft for periods of 40 to 115 sec. After descent, those animals that did not breathe spontaneously were given artificial ventilation by bag and mask for up to 15 minutes. Those animals surviving {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups [...] hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), ground-level oxygen (GLO 2), and ground-level air (GLAIR). The HBO group was treated on a standard treatment table 6 A while the GLO 2 animals received O 2 for an equivalent length of time. Those animals in the GLAIR group were observed only. All surviving animals were humanely sacrified at 48 hours. Inflation of the animal's lungs after the exposure was found to be difficult and, at times, impossible. This may be due to surfactant disruption at the alveolar lining. Electron microscopy identified a disruption of the surfactant layer in animals that did not survive initial exposure. Mortality was found to increase with exposure time: 40 sec [...] 0 percent; 60 sec [...] 6 percent; 70 sec [...] 40 percent; 80 sec [...] 13 percent; 100 sec [...] 38 percent; 110 sec [...] 40 percent; and 115 sec [...] 100 percent. There was no difference in the delayed mortality among the treatment groups (HBO [...] 15 percent, GLO 2 [...] 11 percent, GLAIR [...] 11 percent). However, since resuscitation was ineffective, the effectiveness of any post-exposure treatment was severely limited. Preliminary results indicate that reuscitation of guinea pigs following <b>ebullism</b> exposure is difficult, and that current techniques (such as traditional CPR) may not be appropriate...|$|E
