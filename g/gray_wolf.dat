5|$|A {{study of}} the cranial {{measurements}} and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive temporalis muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf.</b> Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger {{than those of the}} <b>gray</b> <b>wolf,</b> and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf,</b> and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.|$|E
5|$|In Alaska, the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. The <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> seen in Kentucky in modern times.

40|$|Two {{species of}} wolves occur in North America, <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> (Canis lupus) and red wolves (Canis rufus). During the 1800 s, <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> ranged over the North American {{continent}} {{as far south}} as central Mexico. <b>Gray</b> <b>wolves</b> occupy boreal forests and forest/agricultural edge communities in Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northern Michigan. Mech (1970) reported that <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> prey mainly on large animals including white-tailed deer, mule deer, moose, caribou, elk, Dall sheep, bighorn sheep, and beaver. <b>Gray</b> <b>wolves</b> are highly social, often living in packs of two to eight or more individuals.

5|$|The <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> has interbred {{extensively}} {{with the}} eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves. Unlike {{the red and}} eastern wolf, the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> does not readily interbreed with coyotes. Nevertheless, coyote genetic markers {{have been found in}} some wild isolated <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> populations in the southern United States. <b>Gray</b> <b>wolf</b> Y-chromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes. In tests performed on a Texan canid of ambiguous species, mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote–gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican <b>gray</b> <b>wolf.</b> In 2013, a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination, making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves. At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species. Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolf-like phenotypes, {{to the point of being}} mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} North American wolf populations coincided with {{increasing}} human populations {{and the expansion}} of agriculture. By the start of the 20th century, the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA, excepting some areas of the Appalachians and the northwestern Great Lakes Region. In Canada, the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 1870 and 1921, and in Newfoundland around 1911. It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 1850 and 1900. The gray wolf's decline in the prairies began with the extermination of the American bison and other ungulates in the 1860s–70s. From 1900–1930, the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada, because of intensive predator control programs aimed at eradicating the species. The <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> was exterminated by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 1960, except in Alaska and northern Minnesota. The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s, particularly in southwestern Canada, because of expanding ungulate populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting. This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada. Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s, mostly by poisoning. This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid-1970s.|$|E

50|$|In 2010, a study {{compared}} the mitochondrial genome for dogs, <b>gray</b> <b>wolves,</b> and coyotes. The phylogenetic tree {{generated from the}} sequences indicated that the coyotes clustered together, the Tibetan wolves clustered together, and dogs and the other <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> clustered together. This finding indicates that the dog descended from <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> but excludes the Tibetan wolf. In 2011, a genetic {{study found that the}} Tibetan wolf might be an archaic pedigree within the wolf species. In 2013, a major study looked at the DNA sequences of dogs and wolves and was intending to include 2 Tibetan wolves but then:excluded two aberrant modern wolf sequences from this analysis since their phylogenetic positioning suggests only a distant relationship to all extant <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> and their taxonomic classification as a member of Canis lupus or a separate sub-species is a matter of debate.|$|R

5|$|Although wolf-dog {{hybridization}} in Europe {{has raised}} concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf's purity, genetic tests show that introgression of dog genes into European <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> populations does {{not pose a}} significant threat. Also, as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide, the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestor}} {{of the golden}} jackal {{is believed to be}} the extinct Arno river dog that lived in Mediterranean Europe 1.9million years ago. It is described as being a small, jackal-like canine. Genetic studies indicate that the golden jackal expanded from India at the end of the last ice age around 20,000 years ago. The oldest golden jackal fossil is 20,000 years old and was found at the Ksar Akil rock shelter near Beirut, Lebanon. The oldest golden jackal fossils in Europe were found in Greece and are 7,000 years old. There are seven subspecies of the golden jackal. The golden jackal is not closely related to the African black-backed or side-striped jackals, being instead more closely related to the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf,</b> coyote, African golden wolf, and Ethiopian wolf. It is capable of producing fertile hybrids with both the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> and the African golden wolf. Dog-jackal hybrids called Sulimov dogs are in service at the Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow where they are deployed by the Russian airline Aeroflot for scent-detection.|$|E

5|$|The coyote is {{typically}} {{smaller than the}} <b>gray</b> <b>wolf,</b> but has longer ears and a relatively larger braincase, {{as well as a}} thinner frame, face, and muzzle. The scent glands are smaller than the gray wolf's, but are the same color. Its fur color variation is much less varied than that of a wolf. The coyote also carries its tail downwards when running or walking, rather than horizontally as the wolf does.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> is {{the second}} most {{specialised}} member of the genus Canis, after the Ethiopian wolf, as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey, its more gregarious nature, and its highly advanced expressive behavior. It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species, such as the eastern wolf, coyote, and golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids. It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds, and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene, colonizing North America on at least three separate occasions during the Rancholabrean. It is a social animal, travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair, accompanied by the pair's adult offspring. The <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> is typically an apex predator throughout its range, with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it. It feeds primarily on large ungulates, though it also eats smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> {{was once}} one of the world's most widely {{distributed}} mammals, living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15°N latitude in North America and 12°N in India. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the United States. In modern times, the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75°N to 12°N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, because of the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population, it is classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|Yellowstone {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the finest megafauna wildlife habitat in the lower 48 states. There are almost 60 species of mammals in the park, including the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf,</b> coyote, the threatened Canadian lynx, and grizzly bears. Other large mammals include the bison (often referred to as buffalo), black bear, elk, moose, mule deer, white-tailed deer, mountain goat, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, and cougar.|$|E
5|$|A few {{animal species}} {{are the result}} of hybridization. The Lonicera fly is a natural hybrid. The American red wolf appears to be a hybrid of the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> and the coyote, {{although}} its taxonomic status has been a subject of controversy. The European edible frog is a semi-permanent hybrid between pool frogs and marsh frogs; its population requires the continued presence of {{at least one of the}} parent species. Cave paintings indicate that the European bison is a natural hybrid of the aurochs and the steppe bison.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation is the {{evolutionary}} process whereby an organism becomes {{better able to}} live in its habitat or habitats. Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition {{have been shown to}} greatly influence <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> craniodental plasticity, which is an adaptation of the cranium and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gray</b> <b>wolves</b> {{typically}} dominate other canid {{species in}} areas where they both occur. In North America, incidents of <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> killing coyotes are common, particularly in winter, when coyotes feed on wolf kills. Wolves may attack coyote den sites, digging out and killing their pups, though rarely eating them. There are no records of coyotes killing wolves, though coyotes may chase wolves if they outnumber them. Near identical interactions have been observed in Eurasia between <b>gray</b> <b>wolves</b> and golden jackals, with the latter's numbers being comparatively small in areas with high <b>wolf</b> densities. <b>Gray</b> <b>wolves</b> {{are the most important}} predator of raccoon dogs, killing large numbers of them {{in the spring and summer}} periods. Wolves also kill red, arctic and corsac foxes, usually in disputes over carcasses, sometimes eating them. In Asia, they may compete with dholes, though there is at least one record of a lone wolf associating with a pair of dholes in Debrigarh Wildlife Sanctuary.|$|R

5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles.

Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the <b>gray</b> <b>wolf.</b>|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages from a common ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent <b>gray</b> <b>wolf</b> populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
