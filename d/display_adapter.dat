5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to begin work}} on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with assistance from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, {{deciding to}} price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the coin acceptors, joysticks, wiring, and casing. Pitts build the computer hardware and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the coin acceptors were sourced from jukebox manufacturer Rowe International, and the joysticks found at a military surplus store as remainders from B-52 bomber controls. The code for the game {{was based on a}} version of Spacewar running on a PDP-10 in the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, but modified with additional features.|$|E
25|$|One {{technique}} used on early IBM XT computers was to install additional RAM into the video memory address range {{and push the}} limit up {{to the start of}} the Monochrome <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA). Sometimes software or a custom address decoder was required for this to work. This moved the barrier to 704 KB (with MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (with CGA).|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Amstrad {{entered the}} IBM PC-compatible arena with the PC1512 system. In {{standard}} Amstrad livery and priced at £399 {{it was a}} success, capturing more than 25% of the European computer market. It was MS-DOS-based, but with the GEM graphics interface, and later Windows. In 1988 Amstrad attempted {{to make the first}} affordable portable personal computer with the PPC512 and 640 models, introduced a year before the Macintosh Portable. They ran MS-DOS on an 8MHz processor, and the built-in screen could emulate the Monochrome <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> or Color Graphics Adapter. Amstrad's final (and ill-fated) attempts to exploit the Sinclair brand were based on the company's own PCs; a compact desktop PC derived from the PPC 512, branded as the Sinclair PC200, and the PC1512 rebadged as the Sinclair PC500.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{stumbling}} block was thatdespite being a fully compliant MS-DOS systemit was not {{compatible with the}} IBM PC at the hardware level. This was a problem because MS-DOS was rarely used as {{anything more than a}} simple program loader; complex software (spreadsheets, Flight Simulator, etc.) could only obtain acceptable performance by direct manipulation of the hardware. Wang used a 16-bit data bus instead of the 8-bit data bus used by IBM, arguing that applications would run much faster since most operations required I/O (disk, screen, keyboard, printer). With this 16-bit design, Wang used peripheral hardware devices, such as the Wang PC <b>display</b> <b>adapter,</b> that were not compatible with their counterparts in the IBM PC line. This meant that the vast library of software available for the IBM PC could not be directly run on the Wang PC. Only those programs that were either written specifically for the Wang PC or ported from the IBM PC were available. A basic word processing package developed by Wang and Microsoft's Multiplan spreadsheet were the two commonly marketed software products. Lotus 1-2-3 and dBase II were also available. This dearth of application software led to the early demise of the original Wang PC, and it was replaced by an Intel 80286 based product that was fully plug compatible with the IBM PC. The unique system software was available at extra cost.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the first}} IBM PC was {{designed}} in 1980, it included a [...] "peseta symbol" [...] "Pts" [...] in the ROM of the Monochrome <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> (MDA) and Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) video output cards' hardware, with the code number 158. This original character set chart {{later became the}} MS-DOS code page 437. [...] Some spreadsheet software for PC under MS-DOS, as Lotus 1-2-3, employed this character as the peseta symbol in their Spanish editions. [...] Subsequent international MS-DOS code pages, like code page 850 and others, deprecated this character in favour of some other national characters.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> was {{installed}} on the model 5570-S, {{also known as the}} first Micro Channel machine in PS/55, had a compatibility problem with PS/2. From the model 5550-S released in 1988, the <b>Display</b> <b>Adapter</b> II {{was installed}} that had been resolved PS/2 compatibility. In the boot sequence, <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> enabled VGA on the motherboard and the video signal was output through MCA connector and <b>display</b> <b>adapter.</b> When using Japanese DOS, VGA was disabled and <b>display</b> <b>adapter</b> switched the video signal from VGA to own graphics chip. In addition, 256 color mode (1024x768 pixels in 256 of 262,144 colors) was supported.|$|E

50|$|Software making {{extensive}} use of special hardware devices, like high-end <b>display</b> <b>adapters,</b> needs special API or newer device drivers. A good example is DirectX, which {{is a collection of}} APIs for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming, on Microsoft platforms.|$|R
50|$|Notably, the <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> {{of early}} {{personal}} computers stored tables of bitmapped font characters in ROM. This usually {{meant that the}} text display font could not be changed interactively. This {{was the case for}} both the CGA and MDA adapters available with the IBM PC XT.|$|R
5000|$|Modern <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> have {{dedicated}} calibrating CLUTs, {{which can}} be loaded once with the appropriate gamma-correction look-up table in order to modify the encoded signals digitally before the DACs that output voltages to the monitor.

50|$|To {{enhance and}} {{modernize}} the Aster CT-80 {{the company also}} designed three alternative video <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> to supplement or replace the TRS-80 compatible video card, (due to the modular nature of the Aster {{it was simply a}} matter of changing the video card, and/or CPU card to upgrade the system).|$|R
50|$|All these <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> have text modes {{in which}} each {{character}} cell contains an 8-bit character code point (see details), giving 256 possible values for graphic characters. All 256 codes were assigned a graphical character in ROM, including the codes from 0 to 31 that were reserved in ASCII for non-graphical control characters.|$|R
50|$|Character {{sizes and}} {{graphical}} resolutions for the extended VESA-compatible Super VGA text modes are manufacturer-dependent. Also on these <b>display</b> <b>adapters,</b> available colors can be halved from 16 to 8 when a second customized character set is employed (giving a total repertoire of 512 —instead the common 256— different graphic characters simultaneously {{displayed on the}} screen).|$|R

50|$|Also, the {{spreading}} of Highcolor and True Color capabilities of <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> providing thousands {{and millions of}} colors, along with faster CPUs and accelerated graphic cards, cheaper RAM, storage devices up to {{an order of magnitude}} larger (from megabytes to gigabytes) and larger bandwidth for telecom networking at lower cost helped to create an environment in which the common user was able to run complicated GUIs which began to favor aesthetics.|$|R
50|$|However, OEM code pages do not {{necessarily}} reside in ROM, but include so called prepared code pages, (aka downloadable character sets or downloadable fonts), character sets loaded as raster fonts into the font RAM of suitable <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> (like NEC APC, HP 100LX/200LX/700LX, Persyst's BoB Color Adapter, Hercules' HGC+, InColor and Network Plus with RAMFONT, and IBM's MCGA, EGA, VGA, etc.) and printers as well. Hence, the group of OEM code pages is a superset of hardware code pages.|$|R

50|$|Indexed color graphic modes for <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> {{have the}} 16- or 256-color limit imposed by hardware.

50|$|What {{separates}} Lira 512 {{from most}} of the other XT compatibles is that keyboard is included just above in the same case (together with the 3.5’’ floppy drive), which made it similar in appearance to the original Atari ST or the Amiga 500. Lira has two <b>display</b> <b>adapters</b> (monochrome Hercules compatible and color CGA compatible), where the active video adapter is chosen by the back-panel switch.
