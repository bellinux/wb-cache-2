This was particularly difficult, as not only had he to overcome the prejudices, he had to work especially hard since it was only people who owned land who could vote.

The type of human sacrifice included victims being hacked in pieces, dismembered, exposed to the elements and carnivores before being deposed in trash.

Moss was expected to be the most watched contestant of the NFL Combine, but he did not show up. Rumors swirled that the reason for his absence was to avoid the drug test. Moss opted to work out at the Marshall pro day, where scouts from nearly every NFL team came to watch him work out. Moss turned in a legendary performance, running the 40 yard dash in just 4.25 seconds, despite running into the wind. He also posted a 39-inch vertical leap while catching nearly every pass thrown. Scouts for the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 8th overall pick and were greatly interested in Moss, told owner Jerry Jones that Moss was the greatest individual prospect they had ever seen.|$|E

Young people also may not realise that all their information and browsing can and may be tracked while visiting a particular site, {{and that it is}} up to them to protect their own privacy. They must be informed about all these risks. For example, on Twitter, threats include shortened links that lead one to potentially harmful places. In their e-mail inbox, threats include email scams and attachments that get them to install malware and disclose personal information.

25|$|Richardson {{was chosen}} to tour Australia in 1897/1898, but this was where his {{successful}} years ended. Richardson was always a heavy drinker, but around this time the habit became unmanageable and his weight began increasing, thus reducing his speed and stamina. He produced one great performance on the disappointing 1897/1898 tour with eight wickets for 94 in the first innings of the fifth Test, {{but as soon as}} he returned to England his decline was plain <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Indeed, in the first two months of the season Richardson accomplished almost no performance of note, and even when he improved from the beginning of July onwards, Surrey could no longer rely on him to bowl over after over on the extremely true Oval pitches; his body could no longer carry the workload of previous years. In a few games late in the season at the Oval, against Yorkshire (when Surrey inflicted that county's biggest defeat) and Warwickshire (when he took a career-best 15 for 83 on a pitch offering no help), he appeared as potent as the bowler of 1897. Nevertheless, his haul of wickets in the County Championship fell from 237 to 126 and their cost from about 14 runs per wicket to over 21.|$|E

25|$|In early August 1836, the vizier of the Herzegovina Eyalet, Ali Pasha Rıdvanoğlu, {{attacked}} Grahovo, a town on Montenegro's northern frontier {{that had}} long been claimed by the Montenegrins. Its Christian inhabitants, still Ali Pasha's feudatories, had refused to pay the haraç, an Ottoman poll tax on non-Muslims. Ali Pasha's forces overran the town, burned {{it to the ground}} and took countless Christians hostage; the rebels appealed to Njegoš for help. As honour demanded, Njegoš sent a force led by his teenaged brother Joko and his nephew Stevan to rescue the hostages while Ali Pasha was in Gacko waiting for reinforcements to address the Montenegrin advance. The Montenegrins had assembled a force of several hundred warriors led by Joko, Stevan and eight Petrović chiefs. They were initially successful in rescuing one of the imprisoned clan leaders and his followers, but were overwhelmed by the combined forces of Ali Pasha, Trebinje's Osman Pasha-beg and the cavalry reinforcements of Smaïl-aga Čengić. The Turks made use of a feigned retreat to lure the Montenegrins into a trap, surrounded them and used reinforcements to cut off their lines of retreat. More than forty of the Montenegrin warriors were hacked to death in the ensuing chaos, including Stevan and all eight Petrović chiefs. Joko was killed by Smaïl-aga himself, and his severed head was impaled on a spike <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Njegoš responded by launching a counter-attack near Grahovo and fought the Ottomans to a standstill. Grahovo's inhabitants fled to the Austrian-held territory on the Adriatic coast, but after being refused sanctuary, they were forced to return to the ruined town, swear an oath of loyalty to the Sultan and beg for forgiveness from the vizier. Consequently, they refused to avenge the deaths of the Petrovićes for fear of Ottoman retaliation.|$|E

In response, the Senate decreed him [...] "title of the first name", which meant his name would be listed first in all official documents, and acclaimed him as [...] "the greatest Augustus".

500|$|After Joseph Smith's death, the Egyptian {{artifacts}} were in {{the possession}} of his mother, Lucy Mack Smith, and she and her son William Smith continued to exhibit the four mummies and associated papyri to visitors. Two weeks after Lucy's death in May 1856, Smith's widow, Emma Hale Smith Bidamon, her second husband Lewis C. Bidamon, and her son Joseph Smith III, sold [...] "four Egyptian mummies with the records with them" [...] to Abel Combs on May 26, 1856. Combs himself later sold two of the mummies, along with some papyri, to the St. Louis Museum in 1856. Upon the closing of the St. Louis Museum, these artifacts were purchased by Col. John H.

Upon learning of her termination, Benchley tendered his own resignation. Word of it was published in Time by Alexander Woollcott, who was at a lunch with Benchley, Parker, and others.
