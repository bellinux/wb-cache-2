An entrepreneur solicits initial financing for a project from competing uninformed <b>financiers.</b> Once the project is undertaken, but before its returns are realized, the entrepreneur can solicit additional financial contracts from competing <b>financiers.</b> It is assumed that these <b>financiers</b> can observe all previously signed contracts and that the seniority of claims is respected {{in the case of}} bankruptcy; however, the entrepreneur is never committed not to sell junior claims to competing <b>financiers.</b> Copyright 1995 by The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} relationship between <b>financiers</b> and agents such as entrepreneurs operating small businesses who require finance {{to carry out their}} projects. It shows how the wealth agents invest in their projects and who has the power to set terms determine the financial contracts agents sign, who has ultimate control over projects, and how efficiently they are carried out. ^ Agents and <b>financiers</b> choose among three contracts: non-voting equity, voting equity, and debt. Non-voting equity simply gives <b>financiers</b> a share in returns from the project; voting equity and debt also give <b>financiers</b> the power to terminate agents 2 ̆ 7 finance. Under debt, <b>financiers</b> terminate agents 2 ̆ 7 loans if they fail to make timely payments—a simple but crude rule for termination. Under voting equity, <b>financiers</b> set performance standards, monitor agents, and decide whether to fire them. This ties dismissal to a more accurate assessment of agents 2 ̆ 7 effort, but subjects agents to <b>financiers</b> 2 ̆ 7 non-contractible choice of performance standards and may require costly monitoring. Whereas prevention of “shirking” by agents is the standard problem in theories of the firm, I show that agents may respond to termination threats by overworking. ^ When agents set the terms, the wealthiest agents issue non-voting equity, the less wealthy issue debt, and the least wealthy issue voting equity or cannot obtain finance. When <b>financiers</b> set terms, they demand voting equity from some agents who would have issued non-voting equity if they had set the terms. This may explain why <b>financiers</b> in highly concentrated financial systems take control of firms that would remain independent in a more competitive system. ^ Both agents and <b>financiers</b> set terms to maximize their own rents, even if this reduces the project 2 ̆ 7 s value. This contradicts traditional microeconomics, in which control rights are irrelevant, and models of incomplete contracts in which contracts are designed to maximize efficiency. ^ The efficiency of projects generally increases the more agents invest in them, but can decrease when agents set terms for voting equity. If agents are relatively wealthy, the efficiency of the project is greater when agents set the terms; if they are less wealthy, efficiency is greater when <b>financiers</b> set terms. ...|$|R

40|$|We model {{technological}} and financial innovation as reflecting the profit maximizing decisions {{of individuals and}} explore the implications for economic growth. We start with a Schumpeterian endogenous growth model where entrepreneurs can earn monopoly profits by inventing better goods. <b>Financiers</b> arise to screen potential entrepreneurs. A novel feature of the model is that <b>financiers</b> can engage in the costly and risky process of inventing better processes for screening entrepreneurs. Successful financial innovators screen entrepreneurs better than other <b>financiers,</b> generating monopoly rents. A particular screening process becomes less effective as technology advances. Consequently, technological innovation and economic growth will eventually stop unless <b>financiers</b> innovate. Rather than stressing the level of financial development, we highlight the vital role of financial innovation in supporting economic growth...|$|R
