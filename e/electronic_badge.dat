40|$|Innovative work is {{gradually}} shifting towards collaborative efforts by larger, multidisciplinary teams, making team efficacy {{an increasingly important}} field of study. Researchers in this field have mainly focused on laboratory experiments, which may not fully capture the complex situations that teams encounter in real life. The alternative, field studies, are difficult to maintain and often require significant time to produce results. In this thesis we propose a methodology that bridges the gap between these two settings [...] the laboratory and the field. By combining a new, affordable <b>electronic</b> <b>badge</b> that captures vocalization data with an innovative setting [...] the Hackathon [...] we create a new environment for studying team performance. This methodology reduces the duration and maintenance burden of such studies, and offers new opportunities for examining the effects of interventions on teamwork. The preliminary results from our studies show a variety of individual and team behaviors that can be captured in Hackathons using badges, such as participation, the parity of contribution to group discussions, the level of turn taking, and the frequency and duration of meetings. In a Hackathon, we measure these behaviors throughout the entire life cycle of each team, observe how they change in response to different shocks, and study how well the team members collaborate and perform as a team. by Oren Lederman.

Over two weeks, {{subjects were asked to}} respond using a button on their badges (1) every two hours (Time task); (2) whenever they were in a particular room (Place task). In addition, whenever they thought about the task, they were asked to indicate this with their badges. Although subjects thought about the Time task more, they forgot to respond more often than in the Place task. In the Time task, there was a marked absence of thoughts about the task following successful remembering. When subjects remembered the Place task, thoughts increased with proximity to the target location. In both tasks, thoughts about intentions occurred more in places such as stairwells than in locations where people tended to settle.

The badge can also present feedback to the wearer, so that users may be guided to people will similar interests and so may have more effective conversations. The smart badge system is based on an inference system which uses a Bayesian network. Evaluation of the system was challenging because there were no completed badges that could be used. To overcome this, we developed a simulation of crowd behaviour in a conference setting. We tuned the parameters of the model using several test situations and the final simulated behavior appeared realistic. Compared to other smart badge systems, our work is unique because it is able to enhance conversation by the real time inference of common ideas or interests of the conversion participants.

40|$|RadioActive is an {{innovative}} education project {{that has developed}} and implemented a radical technology-enabled pedagogy to promote the inclusion, engagement and informal learning of excluded people, or those at-risk of exclusion, across Europe. It does this through harnessing primarily internet radio and also social media, or, as our motto states: "RadioActive 101 : Learning through radio, learning for life!" The project developed, implemented and is sustaining a pan-European Internet Radio platform, incorporating Web 2. 0 ideas and features. This is linked to innovative community based pedagogies to address inclusion, employability and active citizenship in an original and exciting way, whilst recognising informal learning through <b>electronic</b> Open <b>badges.</b> The consortium was led by the University of East London (UK), with other partners from Portugal (CIMJ), Germany (UKL), the UK (Pontydysgu), Romania (ODIP) and Malta (KIC). These partners have direct links and ongoing collaborations with 13 primary Associate Partner organisations and a network of 39 mostly grass-roots organisations that facilitate access to the RadioActive 101 participants, or 'radio-activists' as we define them. So the Associate Partners perform and deliver RadioActive 'on the ground' and are the vehicle for the learning experiences required for their production. These represent a particularly diverse range of groups and this was deliberate {{to allow us to}} test and refine our model, and show that it potentially works with virtually all excluded groups, and across Europe. We actively developed, implemented and ran five national RadioActive 'stations' (or hubs) that are accessible via the European Support Hub (ESH). Through making the radio shows the target groups (schools, vocational education, Higher Education, informal and adult education) are developing digital competencies and employability skills 'in vivo' that are transferable to the 21 st Century workplace. These competencies and skills align with six of the EU Key Competencies for Lifelong Learning and we have developed a progression and accreditation model linking the key competencies to RadioActive activities and performances that are recognised through Open <b>electronic</b> 'badges'. These <b>badges</b> provide concrete recognition measures and represent proficiencies that are relevant to further education or employment in particular related to the knowledge and creative and digital industries. Evaluation findings were obtained through conducting a phased evaluation incorporating a full in depth ‘prototype’ evaluation in the UK during year one, a similar evaluation in Portugal and a smaller one in Germany in year two, that were followed by a broader and larger international survey of radio-activists (subjects) {{towards the end of the}} project. All these showed particularly positive and interesting results, such as the delivery of additional impact and value beyond the informal learning of technical and employability skills. Additionally, we found improvements in confidence, self-esteem and general self-efficacy of individuals, plus additional improvements in groups and organisations. It appears that once our excluded groups developed the confidence and competence to perform activities they often thought were beyond them, they seem then empowered, to learn many other things and to develop a number of key competencies. At the European and national levels we have produced an extensive amount of dissemination activities to make the RadioActive Europe project public and well known, and also won two additional funding awards towards the end of the project. Other exploitation activities include embedding locally and internationally, with the latter being realised through the establishment of an international Foundation that will also support and advise about funding models to support further expansion at the European level...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundBecause of a presumably {{increased}} {{incidence of}} long-term malignancy in interventional cardiologists, radiation {{exposure of the}} operator (ORE) during coronary interventions is of rising concern. A few studies comparing femoral to radial or right to left radial access have been published, but no data comparing the three access sites are available to our knowledge. PurposeWe sought to compare ORE by right femoral (RFA), right radial (RRA) and left radial (LRA) access during percutaneous catheterization for diagnostic coronary angiography (CA) with or without coronary angioplasty (PCI). MethodsFrom September 2014 to February 2015, all consecutive patients undergoing elective or emergency CA/PCI were prospectively included. Selection of the access site was left to {{the discretion of the}} cardiologist. ORE was measured using individual <b>electronic</b> radiation dosimeter <b>badges</b> positioned externally on the sternum. Radioprotection materials and equipment was similar for all procedures. Primary endpoint was ORE quantified as cumulative dose (CD) per dose-area product (DAP), in order to adjust for the administered radiation dose. ResultsIn total 692 consecutive procedures, 386 CA (56 %) and 306 PCI (44 %) were performed, 380 (55 %) via RFA, 232 (34 %) via RRA and 80 (11 %) via LRA. The CD was lower in the RFA (6. 9 ± 11. 8 ∞Sv vs. RRA 26. 4 ± 54. 1 μSv, p< 0. 001, vs. LRA 9. 9 ± 18. 5 μSv, p< 0. 001). There was no difference in the DAP between LRA and RRA (34. 4 ± 23. 8 Gycm 2 vs. 40. 3 ± 28. 5 Gycm 2, p= 0. 13). The RFA demonstrated higher levels (55. 3 ± 64. 3 Gycm 2) compared to both RRA (p= 0. 03) and LRA (p< 0. 01). The adjusted ORE was significantly lower in the RFA (0. 17 ± 0. 27 ∞Sv/ Gycm 2) compared to the RRA (0. 62 ± 0. 69 ∞Sv/Gycm 2, p< 0. 001) or the LRA group (0. 30 ± 0. 36 ∞Sv/Gycm 2, p< 0. 001), as was for the LRA compared to the RRA (p< 0. 001). ConclusionsThe RFA in CA and PCI is associated with significantly lower ORE when compared to the RRA or LRA. The LRA is associated with significantly lower ORE when compared to the RRA...|$|R
