500|$|The RTC {{secured a}} new {{retractable}} screen by October 2010, from a New Windsor–based entertainment supplier, {{to replace the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>screen</b> that had obscured access to the Theatre's [...] stage. The new screen opened the stage by , allowing live acts. Under the Cacchios, the screen had been replaced once a decade, with an engineer performing maintenance once every six months. Eight Behringer stereo surround sound speakers and two subwoofers were installed in the building in December 2010. By February 2011, the RTC also added a digital projector, a stage thrust, a server for digital programming, and a new phone system. The group announced plans to add a concession stand, an additional server, and an uninterruptible power supply. The group also intended to move the ticket booth outside during warm months.|$|E
2500|$|The Platypus has the {{extended}} plywood skinned ES-60 wing, {{built around a}} single spar. The leading edge is unswept but the straight trailing edges have forward sweep that increases on the outer, aileron-carrying, panels. [...] There are airbrakes mounted just aft of the spar on the inner panels. These wings were mid-mounted onto a new GRP fuselage. [...] This has a maximum width of 1.20m (3ft11in) to accommodate the side by side seating but narrowed in pod and boom style, particularly in plan, behind the wings. The cockpit has a two-piece <b>fixed</b> <b>screen</b> extending almost to the nose and is accessed via a rear hinged, bulged canopy. [...] The pod includes a fixed, faired, centre-line two wheel undercarriage, with a brake-equipped mainwheel under the wings and a smaller nosewheel.|$|E
2500|$|Bohr's {{response}} was to illustrate Einstein's idea more clearly using the diagram in Figure C. (Figure C shows a <b>fixed</b> <b>screen</b> S1 that is bolted down. Then try to imagine one that can slide up or down along a rod instead of a fixed bolt.) Bohr observes that extremely precise knowledge of any (potential) vertical motion of the screen is an essential presupposition in Einstein's argument. In fact, if its velocity in the direction X before {{the passage of the}} particle is not known with a precision substantially greater than that induced by the recoil (that is, if it were already moving vertically with an unknown and greater velocity than that which it derives {{as a consequence of the}} contact with the particle), then the determination of its motion after the passage of the particle would not give the information we seek. However, Bohr continues, an extremely precise determination of the velocity of the screen, when one applies the principle of indeterminacy, implies an inevitable imprecision of its position in the directionX. [...] Before the process even begins, the screen would therefore occupy an indeterminate position at least to a certain extent (defined by the formalism). Now consider, for example, the point d in figure A, where the interference is destructive. It is obvious that any displacement of the first screen would make the lengths of the two paths, a–b–d and a–c–d, different from those indicated in the figure. If the difference between the two paths varies by half a wavelength, at point d there will be constructive rather than destructive interference. [...] The ideal experiment must average over all the possible positions of the screen S1, and, for every position, there corresponds, for a certain fixed point F, a different type of interference, from the perfectly destructive to the perfectly constructive. The effect of this averaging is that the pattern of interference on the screen F will be uniformly grey. Once more, our attempt to evidence the corpuscular aspects in S2 has destroyed the possibility of interference in F, which depends crucially on the wave aspects.|$|E

In these two situations, the ratio is minimized for values of the coupling parameters that depend on screening, and for temperatures that in turn depend on density and material. In this context, we also examine Rosenfeld arguments relating transport coefficients to excess reduced entropy for Yukawa one-component plasmas. For these caseswe show that this ratio is always above the lower-bound conjecture derived from string theory ideas...|$|R

We investigate the effect of varying the screening parameter of the exchange potential on various material properties such as the band gap. The Thomas Fermi screening scheme in which the screening parameter varies with an average valence electron density leads to a weak dependence of the band gap on valence electron density, so that a <b>fixed</b> <b>screening</b> parameter {{could be applied to}} heterogeneous systems like surfaces, interfaces and defects...|$|R

Fahrenheit's instrument may have been seen by German physician Johann Nathanael Lieberkühn who introduced the instrument in England, where optician John Cuff improved it with a stationary optical tube and an adjustable mirror. In 1774 English instrument maker Benjamin Martin introduced his [...] "Opake Solar Microscope" [...] for the enlarged projection of opaque objects. He claimed it [...] "not only magnifies the natural Appearance or Size of Objects of every Sort, but at the fame time throws such a Quantity of Solar Rауs upon them as to make all their Colour appear vastly more vivid and strong than to the naked Eye; and their Parts so expanded and distinct upon a <b>fixed</b> <b>Screen,</b> that they are not only viewed with the utmost Pleasure, but may be drawn with the greatest ease by any ingenious Hand." ...|$|E
