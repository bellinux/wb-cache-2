25|$|William Rausch and {{his wife}} Olga Rausch bought this {{property}} in 1894, but did not build a house on it until 1906. At that time, they erected a native limestone house, with a central gable and jig-cut <b>decorative</b> <b>trim.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{house has}} eight large rooms, {{each with a}} fireplace framed by a wooden geometric trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The four large rooms {{on the first floor}} open from either side of the center hallway. They contain simple wide wood trim, including skirting boards and door frame moldings with [...] "subtly demarcated corners". The house's living and dining rooms have wide, wooden dado rails. Most of the wooden <b>decorative</b> <b>trim</b> is painted white, and the walls are plaster. The lone exception is the room serving as an office and den, which has dark stained wooden trim and interior brick structural walls (exposed by the removal of its plaster during the 1960s). All rooms have the original wide plank wooden floors. The second floor has four bedrooms, with closets on either side of a fireplace and simple wood skirting boards and door frames.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} an export version {{introduced}} in January 1969, the Suzuki Fronte 500 with the engine enlarged to 475cc. This was only built in De Luxe trim. The 500 produces [...] at 6000rpm, four more than does the original 360 export version. In May 1969 the Fronte received its first real facelift. The dashboard was modernized by two square gauges instead of a large oval one, the ignition key was moved from the dashboard to the steering column and the two-tone interior was changed to simply black. Externally, the <b>decorative</b> <b>trim</b> pieces in the front grille and on the air inlets at the rear were replaced by real grilles. First gear was also synchronized, unlike on earlier cars. In July 1969 the Fronte S appeared, which offered the SS equipment but with the more economical 25PS engine. Another facelift took place in April 1970, when the grille became more ornate and the sporting version was rebaptized [...] "SSS". Marketing materials referred to this version as the [...] "New Fronte". Two new engines of [...] were installed, while the original 25PS version was discontinued. The more powerful version was installed in the Hi-Super DX and S versions. Production ended in October 1970, {{in advance of the}} succeeding [...] "Stingray" [...] Fronte.|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} {{of the church is}} very intact and the clear finish to internal lining boards and painted <b>decorative</b> <b>trim</b> appears to be that applied when the building was first constructed.

The attic also had two semi-round windows under the front gable.|$|R
25|$|Trim (naqyutkaun in Cup'ig) on parka, hat, and boot is <b>decorative</b> <b>trimming</b> {{elements}} such as patchwork pieces or tassel. Parka trim pieces made primarily of white and black skin of caribou or reindeer, also now largely replaced by calfskin. The fur of the wolf and wolverine are utilized by the Alaska Natives for parka trimming. Wolverines have a somewhat higher basal metabolic rate than other animals their size, which means their internal fire burns a little hotter. To help hold in heat, they wear a long, luxuriously thick coat. Trappers prize this fur because the texture of wolverine hair also keeps it from absorbing moisture. Used widely as trim on parka hoods, cuffs and collars, it readily sheds frost that would otherwise build up from steaming breath.|$|R
50|$|Galloon is a <b>decorative</b> woven <b>trim</b> {{sometimes}} {{in the form of}} a braid and commonly made of metallic gold or silver thread, lace, or embroidery. Galloon is used in the trim of military and police uniforms, ecclesiastical dress, and as trim on textiles, drapery, and upholstery.|$|R

50|$|In {{the winter}} of 2006, {{conservation}} work started, stabilizing {{the interior of the}} towers and steeples. The following year, work on the foundations was started; completed in 2008, the Church is now supported by in-ground concrete footings, which replace the old river rock. In some places where the original wood beams supporting the church were rotted, the ends of the beams were trimmed, and new wood inserted. When the front porch was removed, the long support beam under the front of the Church was found to be full of dry rot - easily 4 to 5 inches of the 16 inch timber had been destroyed. In order to complete the work before winter, a concrete bearing wall was installed under the front of the church. The two towers on the east and west are also now supported by concrete foundations. The building is now on a stable foundation, but deterioration of the envelope, towers, and <b>decorative</b> <b>trims</b> continue.|$|R

50|$|In the 1860s and the 1870s, {{a number}} of Saint Paul {{businessmen}} built elaborate limestone houses along the bluff. These houses are long gone, but several old brick houses remain, and brick and stone are evident throughout the Dayton's Bluff historic district in foundations and in chimneys. Stone, brick, and concrete were also used for lintels, sills, and <b>decorative</b> <b>trim.</b> Wood building products, including siding, shingles, and <b>decorative</b> <b>trim</b> were used extensively by the nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century builders of Dayton's Bluff. Many of the historic windows of Dayton's Bluff have a double-hung sash and a vertical orientation. Most of the houses and rowhouses built in the Dayton's Bluff Historic District before 1920 had unenclosed front porches. The porch usually stretched across the full width of the front facade, {{but in some cases}} only covered the entry. A great variety of machine-made trim was added to even the simplest wooden houses of Dayton's Bluff, while iron, cast iron, terra cotta, tile, and brick also can be seen.|$|E
