5|$|On 14 January 1985, Hun Sen was {{appointed}} Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and began {{peace talks with}} the factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea. Between 2–4 December 1987, Hun Sen met with Sihanouk at Fère-en-Tardenois in France to discuss the future of Kampuchea. Further talks occurred between 20–21 January 1988, and Hun Sen offered Sihanouk a position within the Kampuchean Government {{on the condition that}} he returned to Kampuchea straightaway. However, Sihanouk did not accept the offer, even as preparations were made in Phnom Penh to receive him. Despite that failure, Hun Sen’s Kampuchean Government was able to persuade Cheng Heng and In Tam, both ministers in Lon Nol’s regime, to return to Kampuchea. In the first major step towards restoring peace in Kampuchea, representatives of the CGDK and the PRK {{met for the first time}} at the First Jakarta Informal Meeting on 25 July 1988. In that meeting, Sihanouk proposed a three-stage plan, which called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire,</b> a UN peacekeeping force to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the integration of all Kampuchean armed factions into a single army.|$|E
5|$|Operation Dracula was a {{complete}} success, as Japanese forces had actually vacated Rangoon several days prior to the amphibious landing; 36th Indian Infantry Brigade was able to occupy the city without encountering any Japanese opposition. Shortly after Rangoon's occupation Japanese forces called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire,</b> and plans for the amphibious landing in Western Malaya and an advance into Singapore were cancelled. Instead, British and Commonwealth forces landed unopposed and liberated those areas, and also temporarily occupied Thailand. On 3 May the composite battalion moved to Sadainghmut, and two days later, leaving one company behind, it was transferred to Rangoon where it conducted anti-looting operations and also searched for Japanese stragglers remaining in the city. It left the city on 16 May and travelled to India by ship, where it rejoined 44th Indian Airborne Division. It had been the division's first major airborne operation. The 2nd Air Commando Group's C-47s, which had transported the parachute battalion, returned to Kalaikunda and then moved to Comilla. The 317th Tactical Control Squadron {{spent the next two}} weeks supplying XV Corps who were engaged with Japanese forces northeast of Rangoon and returned to Kalaikunda on 19 May. The group's fighter squadrons provided air cover for Rangoon until 9 May when they too returned to home station.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{settlement}} emboldened the Hungarians, {{who decided}} that Moscow could be defied. A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October {{turned into a}} popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy. Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and even fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire</b> and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance. Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union. However, on 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, {{and the next morning}} that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions {{for the rest of his}} life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.|$|E

[...] "Faced with the bitter fact that up to now the calls <b>for</b> <b>an</b> immediate <b>cease-fire</b> in that martyred region have been disregarded, I feel impelled to renew my pressing appeal to that effect, asking everyone to offer their real contribution to the construction of a just and lasting peace." [...] Pope Benedict donated two ambulances and emergency medical supplies to Caritas in Lebanon.|$|R

25|$|The United States began {{withdrawing}} {{troops from}} Vietnam in 1970, {{with the last}} troops returning in January, 1973.

25|$|Internationally, {{the level}} of support which Pakistan {{received}} was limited at best. Iran and Turkey issued a joint communiqué on 10 September which placed the blame on India, backed the United Nations' appeal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire</b> and offered to deploy troops for a UN peacekeeping mission in Kashmir.

In 1803, Mamluk leaders Ibrahim Bey and Osman Bey al-Bardisi wrote to the Russian consul-general, asking him to mediate with the Sultan {{to allow them to}} negotiate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire,</b> and a return to their homeland Georgia. The Russian ambassador in Constantinople refused however to intervene, because of nationalist unrest in Georgia that might have been encouraged by a Mamluk return.|$|E

25|$|Saddam {{reached out}} to other Arab governments for cash and {{political}} support during the war, particularly after Iraq's oil industry severely suffered {{at the hands of}} the Iranian navy in the Persian Gulf. Iraq successfully gained some military and financial aid, as well as diplomatic and moral support, from the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United States, which together feared the prospects of the expansion of revolutionary Iran's influence in the region. The Iranians, demanding that the international community should force Iraq to pay war reparations to Iran, refused any suggestions <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire.</b> Despite several calls for a ceasefire by the United Nations Security Council, hostilities continued until 20 August 1988.|$|E
25|$|On June 22, the IDF {{launched}} an operation {{to capture the}} highway.

Israeli long-range artillery targeted Syrian strongpoints to the north. Israeli armored forces with artillery support attacked Syrian positions along the highway, {{with the objective of}} driving them from the highway {{all the way back to}} the edge of the Bekaa Valley. With air and artillery support mostly limited to targets north of the highway, the fighting was fierce, especially to the south. By the end of the day, Israel accepted an American request <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>cease-fire</b> and halted its offensive, but the cease-fire collapsed the following day and the fighting resumed. As the Israelis pushed forward, and managed to trap a large Syrian force, Syrian defenses began to collapse. For the first time in the war, Syrian troops began to break and run.

Israel rejected the plan on December 10, 1969, calling it “an attempt to appease [...] at the expense of Israel.
