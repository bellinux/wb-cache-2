30|$|Amongst the {{proposed}} schemes for watermark embedding, spread spectrum (SS) and quantization based methods [2, 3] {{are the two}} main broad categories. In SS embedding, an additive or multiplicative watermark is added into the <b>host</b> <b>signal.</b> The quantization based schemes are implemented by quantizing the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> to the nearest lattice point. In this article, we focus on spread spectrum embedding schemes originally proposed by Cox et al. [4]. At the receiver side, a blind detection scheme is employed, since the original image is generally not available and thus is treated as a noise source. There are two main approaches of SS embedding: the additive spread spectrum watermarking and the multiplicative spread spectrum (MSS) watermarking. In additive SS [5, 6], the watermark is spread over the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> uniformly while in MSS [7, 8], the watermark spreads according {{to the content of}} the <b>host</b> <b>signal.</b> In order to reduce the noise effect of the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> in additive SS, Malvar and Florencio [9] proposed the improved spread spectrum (ISS), a new modulation technique exploiting the side information at the encoder to reduce the effect of <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> and improve the decoding performance [10]. Recently, the authors have proposed an embedding scheme incorporating the SS and ISS schemes which employs the correlation between the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> and the signature code to improve the decoding performance [11].|$|E

40|$|Data hiding using {{quantization}} {{has revealed}} {{as an effective}} way of taking into account side information at the encoder. When quantizing more than one <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> samples there are two choices: 1) using the Cartesian product of several one-dimensional quantizers, as made in Scalar Costa Scheme (SCS); or 2) performing vectorial quantization. The second option seems better, as rate-distortion theory affirms that higher dimensional quantizers yield improved performance due to better sphere-packing properties. Although the embedding problem does resemble that of rate-distortion, no attacks or <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> characteristics are usually considered when designing the quantizer in this way. We show that attacks worsen {{the performance of the}} a priori optimal lattice quantizer through a counterexample: the comparison under Gaussian distortion of hexagonal lattice quantization against bidimensional Distortion-Compensated Quantized Projection (DC-QP), a data hiding alternative based in quantizing a linear projection of the <b>host</b> <b>signal.</b> Apart from empirical comparisons, theoretical lower bounds on the probability of decoding error of hexagonal lattices under Gaussian <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> and attack are provided and compared to the already analyzed DC-QP method...|$|E

40|$|Rates of {{reliable}} transmission of hidden information are derived for watermarking problems involving parallel Gaussian sources, {{which are often}} used to model host images and audio signals. Constraints are imposed on the average squared-error distortion that can be introduced by the information hider and by the attacker. When distortions are measured {{with respect to the}} original host data, the optimal attack is the cascade of a bank of minimum-mean-squarederror estimators for the host data and a bank of Gaussian test channels. The solution to the watermarking game involves an optimal allocation of distortions by the information hider and by the attacker to the di#erent channels. While the resulting maxmin optimization problem is nonconcave with respect to the maximizing variable, we present a reparameterization that maps the original problem into a convex programming problem with separable cost function and separable constraints. A fast algorithm is given for computing the optimal solution. For each channel we derive analytical expressions for two asymptotic regimes: weak and strong <b>host</b> <b>signals.</b> Finally we extend these results to the class of stationary Gaussian <b>host</b> <b>signals</b> with bounded, continuous spectral density.

The embedding is designed to achieve efficient trade-offs among the three conflicting goals of maximizing information-embedding rate, minimizing distortion between the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> and composite signal, and maximizing the robustness of the embedding. Quantization indexmodulation (QIM) methods are a class of watermarking methods that achieve provably good rate-distortion-robustness performance. Indeed, QIM methods exist that achieve performance within a few dB of capacity {{in the case of}} a (possibly colored) Gaussian <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> and an additive (possibly colored) Gaussian noise channel. Also, QIM methods can achieve capacity with a type of postprocessing called distortion compensation. This capacity is independent of <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> statistics, and thus, contrary to popular belief, the information-embedding capacity when the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> is not available at the decoder is the same as the case when the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> is available at the decoder. A low-complexity realization of QIM called dither modulation has previously been proven to be better than both linear methods of spread spectrum and nonlinear methods of low-bit(s) modulation against square-error distortionconstrained intentional attacks.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} information embedding where the encoder modifies a white Gaussian <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> in a power-constrained manner to encode a message, and the decoder recovers both the embedded message and the modified <b>host</b> <b>signal.</b> This partially extends the recent work of Sumszyk and Steinberg to the continuous-alphabet Gaussian setting. Through a control-theoretic lens, we observe {{that the problem is}} a minimalist example of what is called the "triple role" of control actions. We show that a dirty-paper-coding strategy achieves the optimal rate for perfect recovery of the modified host and the message for any message rate. For imperfect recovery of the modified host, by deriving bounds on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in recovering the modified <b>host</b> <b>signal,</b> we show that DPC-based strategies are guaranteed to attain within a uniform constant factor of 16 of the optimal weighted sum of power required in <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> modification and the MMSE in the modified <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> reconstruction for all weights and all message rates. When specialized to the zero-rate case, our results provide the tightest known lower bounds on the asymptotic costs for the vector version of a famous open problem in decentralized control: the Witsenhausen counterexample.

40|$|Abstract: Steganography is {{a method}} for hiding {{information}} in a <b>host</b> <b>signal.</b> The <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> can be a still image, speech or video and the message signal that is hidden in the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> can be a text, image or an audio signal. In this paper, a steganography method is proposed in which information hiding in the least significant bits (LSBs) of wavelet coefficients and also direct message replacement in wavelet subbands are performed. In this method, the <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> is segregated into several subbands through discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Then, the given subbands are compared with hearing threshold and the subbands which have lower or equal energy compared to the mentioned hearing threshold are utilized for steganography. To retrieve steganography information, inverse wavelet transform is used. The experimental results show that we can reach an average hiding capacity of 34. 5 % over different music and speech signals.

Improvements are possible {{when considering the}} <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> as side-information to the watermark encoder. Costa showed that, in a specific case, <b>host</b> <b>signal</b> interference can be avoided completely. The scalar Costa scheme, which operates on structured codebooks based on scalar quantizers, performs relatively close to the ideal Costa scheme in terms of maximum rate of reliable communication (capacity) over a channel with AWGN attack. The concept of amplitude limited channels in conjunction with repetition of the signal constellation is also known in the communications community by the name modulo channel, which has been studied into great detail. Starting from the modulo channel, which implies a constraint on the amplitude in the receiver, we model the watermarking scenario based on scalar quantizers. The capacity of this model is presented and compared to the theoretical results for SCS watermarking {{in the case of}} AWGN attacks.
