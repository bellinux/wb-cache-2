I think Matt and I would like some of it to be even faster, but sometimes people who've heard the pilot say things like, [...] "It's almost too much." [...] I really like that. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> it's something you kind of need to hear twice to catch everything.

[...] It was reported they met after Jenkins sang [...] "Time to Say Goodbye" [...] with Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli on an episode of Strictly Come Dancing, broadcast on 21 October 2007.

500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor {{would not be}} up for playing a character who is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a clich√©. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> the director was thinking outside of the box. For me, it was an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't {{get up in the morning}} thinking about killing people. He's sad about it.

500|$|Judas Priest's [...] "Dissident Aggressor" [...] is {{the first}} cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman {{described}} the track as [...] "more just {{like one of those}} odd songs {{that a lot of people}} didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks in our history, in my book. I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there."

I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E

While creating the track Cruz stated that he originally had wanted American singer Lady Gaga to feature on the track alongside himself. Following a meeting with Dr. Luke, Cruz agreed to switch to then upcoming singer Kesha. Luke had been working with Kesha and Cruz found Kesha's voice to be distinctive and opted to switch to her featuring on the track. Cruz commented on his decision, stating: [...] "I was thinking about Lady Gaga at first, then I went to a meeting with Dr. Luke and {{he was telling me}} about this new girl he was working with. She hadn't done 'Tik Tok' or anything like that at that point. But I just thought she sounded really cool. A very unique-sounding voice. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> with artists, that as soon as you hear them on a song on the radio, you know immediately who that is without having to be told. She looked really sexy, and I just thought she was talented. Her voice was awesome.

I just loved that quality about it." ...|$|E

500|$|As well {{as being}} tragic, Dot is scripted as a comic character. Brown has {{discussed}} the humour she incorporates into her performances: [...] "I think Dot would be awfully boring if she weren't a bit comic [...] I always thought I had to put an edge on it, an edge of comedy, which just means doing it more seriously than you would do. If {{you want to play}} comedy then {{you have to be very}} intense about it [...] very, very serious." [...] Some of Dot's catchphrases are used for humour, such as [...] "Ooh I say!", uttered when she is [...] "stuck for words". In 2004, Brown discussed the origin of the saying: [...] "It was written once in the script and I quite enjoyed it, so I used to say it occasionally when it wasn't in the scripts. It was useful because it could be said in all different ways. Dot's very straight-laced, so it helped to express her horror at what went on." [...] Brown revealed in 2008 that she has tried to cut down the use of this, along with the mispronunciation of her employer, Mr Papadopolous, as she has become a little embarrassed by them now they are so known. Mr. Papadopolous is the owner of the launderette where Dot works. In a long-running joke, Dot has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, or varying other mispronunciations. Brown has said she enjoys playing the comical aspects of Dot, stating, [...] "She's not dreadfully funny but she's amusing and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> because it lightens it up a bit." ...|$|E

It's a really quick record, but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> element to it. I like the sparseness of the songs and the way that Brendan pulled us together and made us play as good as we could." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn't or couldn't have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun." [...] Vedder stated, [...] "The new record feels good so far‚Äîreally strong and uptempo, stuff we can sink our teeth into", and added that the band's live performances inspired the album's sound: [...] "At one of our gigs, without flashpots and electricity, there's only so much room for those difficult listening songs. That's one reason we kept the arrangements lean." [...] The singer cited Guided by Voices as a reference in creating the shorter and faster songs of Backspacer. Gossard said that Backspacer is [...] "what we could have done for the last five records, in terms of re-engaging with the roots of why this band works", and that [...] "there's plenty of ballads, too... and there's some shifts in how Jeff and Matt and I are all relating‚ÄîI think this record's got a chance to sound significantly different." [...] Ament said, [...] "There's a couple of great things that Ed brought in that could be real departures for us. Whatever wave Ed caught with [...] Into the Wild has taken him to different places." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band.

McCartney {{and the band}} recorded the songs [...] "You Tell Me", [...] "Only Mama Knows", [...] "Vintage Clothes", [...] "That Was Me", [...] "Feet in the Clouds", [...] "House of Wax", [...] "The End of the End", and [...] "Whole Life". However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> track‚Äì now, what is wrong with it?' And it might be something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire‚Äîjeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I‚Äôd rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
