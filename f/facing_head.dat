500|$|Facing {{the major}} Russian offensive, the II Brigade of the Polish Legions was {{deployed}} out of Kostiuchnówka, at Gruziatyn and Hołzula. The I Brigade held the lines advancing down the Polish Hill, Kostiuchnówka village; the III Brigade, positioned to its left, held the lines near the Optowa village; the Piłsudski's Redoubt {{was the most}} advanced Polish position, just about [...] <b>facing</b> <b>head</b> on the most advanced Russian redoubt, called the [...] "Eagle's Nest". Further down the Polish Hill the Hungarian 128th Honvédség Brigade took positions opposite the Polish right flank, the Hungarian 11th Cavalry Division opposite the left flank. Two Polish fall-back lines were drawn beyond {{the first line of}} defense: one drawn through the Polish Forest and the Engineer's Forest, and the second one through the villages of Nowe Kukle, Nowy Jastków, the camp of Legionowo and Nowa Rarańcza. The Polish Legions at Kostiuchnówka numbered from 5,500 to 7,300 (6,500 infantry and 800 cavalry), with forty-nine machine guns, fifteen mortars and twenty-six artillery units. The Russian forces, composed of the most part of the 46th Corps (primarily the 110th and 77nd Infantry Division), numbered 23,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry and were backed up by a larger artillery force consisting of 120 units.|$|E

5000|$|Horizontal {{boring mill}} Large, {{accurate}} bed horizontal mills that incorporate many features from various machine tools. They are predominantly {{used to create}} large manufacturing jigs, or to modify large, high precision parts. They have a spindle stroke of several (usually between four and six) feet, and many are equipped with a tailstock to perform very long boring operations without losing accuracy as the bore increases in depth. A typical bed has X and Y travel, and is between three and four feet square with a rotary table or a larger rectangle without a table. The pendant usually provides between four and eight feet of vertical movement.

40|$|Shock wave induced {{brain injury}} remains {{a field of}} {{research}} that has great consequences for the rehabilitation of soldiers and civilians that are exposed to an explosion. As such, for the research {{to be successful in}} developing strategies to mitigate the effects of these injuries, appropriate research methods need to be developed. Animal models are currently employed to understand the brain 2 ̆ 7 s response to a shock wave exposure. Unfortunately no criteria have been established that indicates in what way the mechanical inputs that the cells in an animal 2 ̆ 7 s brain are subjected to are similar to a human. The purpose of this dissertation was to investigate these biomechanical responses. To address this question, the biomechanical responses of the rat, pig, and post mortem human subject were analyzed. Each of the species was exposed to multiple shock waves within a shock tube. Skull strain was measured using strain gages and intracranial pressure was measured using fiber optic pressure sensors. The effect of orientation was also addressed for the cadaver and the porcine. The results of the project indicate that for all three species, as the incident shock wave amplitude increases, the peak strain and ICP also increases. Also, the response of the head is unique to orientation. A front <b>facing</b> <b>head</b> will respond differently than a side <b>facing</b> <b>head.</b> The relationships between skull strain and ICP were also demonstrated. Skull flexure has a dominate effect on the ICP response. Additionally key characteristic waveforms describing the skull surface and ICP wave dynamics were identified. Overall this project provides much needed information in the field of blast biomechanics. The results of the study indicate that each species will experience pressure wave profiles in the brain partially by means of skull flexure. And that the intracranial pressure environment is dependent on intensity, orientation of the head, and species being tested. It is possible that the responses of each species can be simplified into relative contributions of the identified waveforms. This research provides a basis for further studies that will either investigate methods for mitigating the effects of shock wave exposure or investigating brain cell response to pressure waveforms that are generated within the brain when exposed to a shock wave...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the winter}} Olympic sport of Skeleton, sliders sprint and load {{themselves}} onto the sled <b>facing</b> <b>head</b> forwards. The slider uses primarily {{their shoulders and}} torso to apply control to {{the direction of the}} sled as it progressively gains speed during its descent. These small control course keeping maneuvers alongside more severe use of toe tapping onto the ice will help determine the eventual trajectory of the sled. It is therefore of interest to consider for a possible trajectory what control actions will determine the fastest descent time and in particular what metrics should be examined. In this paper a three degree-of-freedom simulation has been developed to analyse the influence of different control strategies on the descent time of a bob-skeleton. A proportional-derivative (PD) controller is used to steer the simulation down a representation of the Igls ice-track. Parametric variations of the simulation's performance were analysed and compared to identify possible correlations for controllers assist the design of an optimal controller. Analysis of the results have identified positive correlations between descent time, transverse distance travelled and energy dissipation establishing that the fastest descent time is achieved by minimising the energy lost through the descent...|$|E

40|$|Department of Educational Management Policy & Curriculum Studies, 92 p. The LB 2970. K 4 N 93 2013 The {{study was}} {{influenced}} by increased concern by the Head teachers and other stakeholders of the increased myriad administrative challenges encountered in Management of pupils following an enactment of Children Act 200 1, which banned corporal punishment in all schools in 200 1 and also the provision of Free Primary Education (FPE) in public primary schools in 2003. The study sought to establish the following study objectives; determine the challenges public primary school head teachers encounter {{in the management of}} pupils' welfare; assess whether there are' adequate resources in schools to facilitate the proper learning of pupils; find out the strategies used by head teachers to overcome the challenges of indiscipline among pupils; examine the strategies used by head teachers to overcome challenges related to the lack of resources. A sample of ten public primary schools from a population of forty two schools was randomly selected for the study. The 'respondents were head teachers from the selected (sampled) schools. The data collection was done by the use of questionnaires while data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. From the findings, the study concluded that majority of the head teachers had never attended any training on school administration The head teachers faced administrative challenges in management of the pupils which included lack of parents' cooperation in provision of pupils' requirements for learning as parents believed that everything was catered for in the free primary education programme, high school dropout rates, high teacher pupil ratio, high teaching load, inadequate textbooks and other learning resources, lack of adequate classrooms and furniture and poor sanitation. The study recommends that the government and other stakeholders should address the bottlenecks in the implementation of school policies like hiring of more teaching staff, building more schools which are major administrative challenges <b>facing</b> <b>head</b> teachers in pupils management. Finally, the study recommends that the government and other stakeholders should offer continuous training to the head teachers on pupil management to keep them up-to qate. with skills that will assist them to run their schools effectively.
