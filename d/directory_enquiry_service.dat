50|$|The pricing {{structure}} for UK <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> was reformed by Ofcom on 1 July 2015. Call charges consist of an Access Charge and a Service Charge. The Access Charge is set and retained by the caller's landline or mobile provider. The Service Charge is {{set by the}} <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> but it is collected by the caller's phone provider and then {{passed on to the}} <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2017, soaring {{call costs}} for <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>services</b> {{including}} 118118 and 118500 prompted an Ofcom review of 118 services.|$|R
50|$|Until 2002, the {{domestic}} <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> within the UK {{had been reached}} by dialling 192 from a landline. The service had been run solely by BT. In December 2002, the market was opened up by Oftel for new providers to run additional <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>services</b> in competition. BT's 192 service moved to 118 500, and dialling 192 ceased working in August 2003. New providers used 118 118, 118 247, 118 855 and many others. Nowadays {{there are more than}} a hundred such providers and more than 130 different tariffs.As with 09xx premium rate numbers, the usage of 118 xxx <b>directory</b> <b>enquiry</b> numbers was regulated by ICSTIS (later PhonepayPlus).|$|R
50|$|In a caller-pays model, as with voice-based <b>directory</b> <b>enquiry</b> <b>{{services}},</b> {{the caller}} pays {{each time they}} access the service. Caller-pays voice-based local mobile search services are common outside North America, but {{have been slow to}} emerge in the USA due to regulatory restrictions.|$|R
5000|$|... 118 118 is {{primarily}} {{seen as a}} <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service,</b> but provides {{a wider range of}} services, not only providing numbers to users but also train times, cinema listings and directions. Another number provided by the company, 118811, charges a fixed-rate £1.00.|$|R
5000|$|Numbers {{starting}} with [...] "118" [...] were designated for commercial <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> when the fixed priced 40p British Telecom <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> on 192 and 142 was discontinued. The different 118 numbers were allocated by lottery. Originally Surrey-based Leaf Telecom was allocated the 118118 number; The Number UK Ltd paid a reported £2 million to acquire it.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>services</b> stand {{accused of}} {{inappropriate}} methods of promoting their services, effectively scamming people into calling. Various unallocated geographic and non-geographic numbers play an announcement directing callers {{to call a}} particular <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> number for help. People may hear this message when they mis-dial a wanted number or may appear to have missed {{a call from the}} unallocated number and hear this message if they call back.|$|R
5000|$|The song {{deals with}} the singer's {{difficulties}} in speaking to {{the object of his}} strong affections. The lyrics are ambiguous as to whether this is a real person or an automated voice on the <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service.</b> A parody of this song was recorded by a satirical group entitled [...] "Farlig Fredag" [...] (Meaning [...] "Harmful Friday").|$|R
50|$|Domestically, {{there are}} also a number of special service numbers such as 100 for the operator, 123 for the {{speaking}} clock and 155 for the international operator, as well as 118 AAA for various <b>directory</b> <b>enquiry</b> <b>services,</b> and 116 AAA for various helplines. For some services, the number you call will depend on which operator you use to connect the call. 112 and 999 work for calling the emergency services. These numbers cannot be called from abroad.|$|R
50|$|Robertson and his {{business}} partner Jonathan Bushby renamed their company (then known as Timeload) as FreePages and set itself up as a rival <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> a few months later. In February 1996 the firm was listed on the AIM stock market following a reverse takeover of Blagg plc. In 1998 Robertson stepped down as CEO of FreePages and sold out of the company, leaving it {{under the direction of}} Robert Bonnier, a Dutch financier who had joined FreePages in February 1995.|$|R
25|$|Common {{practice}} in the Northern Ireland Civil Service, Derry City Council, and in communication throughout business and other organisations within Northern Ireland, when responding to {{a letter from a}} correspondent from the city or county, is to reply using the same nomenclature as the initial communication. Therefore, a letter addressed Derry will be replied to an address in Derry, while a letter addressed from Londonderry will be returned to an address in Londonderry. When the UK <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> was demonopolised in 2003, Oftel guidelines specifically required addresses using either name to be accessible.|$|R
5000|$|A number {{offering}} a <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> {{allowing people to}} request to be put through to a mobile phone number was established in June 2009. 118 800 proved to be controversial, however, when {{it was revealed that}} it was making available 15 million mobile numbers that it had bought from market researchers. Its website was suspended within weeks of its launch so that the company could re-engineer the site to enable the large number of ex-directory requests to be handled more efficiently. [...] the 118800.co.uk site remains non-functional.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Flanagan's agent lodged a {{complaint}} with the Advertising Standards Authority claiming that a television commercial for <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> 118 118 was using his [...] "out out" [...] catchphrase and skit. The skit, performed on Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow, is {{based on the idea that}} people have different levels of going out, with [...] "out out" [...] referring to a big night out. The commercial featured an animated character using the phrase in a nightclub setting. The ASA acknowledged the similarity but said it was beyond its remit to take action.|$|R
40|$|In 2003, the UK `liberalised' its {{telephone}} <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> {{with the}} aim of introducing competition so as to improve quality and lower costs. Unfortunately the results did not match expectations. Proliferation of numbers led to consumer confusion and high price firms with no discernible quality advantages but which employed heavy advertising came to dominate the market. Consumer and total welfare appear to have declined. This example raises important questions for regulators. In particular, with limits on information and rationality, it may sometimes be better to limit choice but increase competition to supply that choice.

5000|$|The 118 118 {{advertising}} {{was originally}} launched using {{the two men}} dressed as athletic runners. Used with the catchphrase [...] "Got Your Number!", the runners' characters featured in a high-profile advertising and PR campaign leading up to deregulation in August 2003, when the original 192 directory number was switched off. This slogan has fallen into disuse by the marketing department of 118 118 because of the expansion of <b>service</b> beyond <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> alone, but has lived on {{in the minds of}} the public. The use of the runners' characters is particularly noted for the legal action threatened, but never acted on, by 1970s record-breaking runner David Bedford. 118 118 responded to this by stating that their inspiration was partly the late American runner Steve Prefontaine. Bedford subsequently briefly worked for 118 500, a rival <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> provided by BT.|$|R
5000|$|MacIntyre {{was born}} on 8 April 1971 on Mull. He {{wanted to be a}} {{musician}} from a young age and grew up listening to his uncle's covers band. He formed a covers band of his own called Trax, later renamed Love Sick Zombies, while still at Tobermory Primary School. He was influenced by his art teacher at Tobermory High School, and considered going to art school. He also attended Oban High School. [...] In the late 1980s he and his brother moved to Glasgow, where he attended Glasgow Caledonian University, trained with Queen's Park F.C., worked for a stockbroker, and then for telephone company BT's 192 <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> <b>service</b> for three years.|$|R

50|$|Yellow Pages {{launched}} its iconic J. R. Hartley adverts in 1983, {{and became a}} separately identified business within the BT Group after BT was privatised in 1984. The red fronted Business Pages launched in 1985 in Bristol and South Wales, and the telephone <b>directory</b> <b>enquiries</b> information <b>service</b> Talking Pages was piloted in Brighton and Bristol from 1987, which then became known as 118 24 7 after 2003. The group launched Yell.com, its UK local search engine, in 1996 and acquired YellowBook USA in 1999 for $665 million.|$|R
25|$|These {{services}} offer users {{recommendations on}} {{what they should do}} next. An example would be recommending a user a similar ringtone to the one that s/he has just browsed for. They operate, in a mobile context, in a similar way to the recommendation engines provided by internet retail shops such as Amazon.com. An example of real usage is the <b>Directory</b> <b>Enquiries</b> (DQ) <b>service</b> operated by Orange in the UK. Callers to the Orange landline DQ service are given the business and residential numbers they have requested verbally by an operator. In addition, Orange sends the information in text format to the users mobile phone. The information contains a text reminder of the requested information as well as links to local businesses, services and other interesting information in the local area that the user has searched on.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} European countries, {{among them the}} UK and Spain, have opened up their <b>Directory</b> <b>Enquiry</b> <b>Services</b> (DQs) market to competition. In Spain, both local and foreign firms {{challenged}} the incumbent as of April 2003. The latter raised its rivals' costs and forced quality downgrading by providing an inferior quality version of the (essential) input, namely the subscribers database. We illustrate {{how it is possible}} to quantify the effect of the practice in a situation where an entrant has no previous history in the market. We use the UK experience to construct the relevant counterfactual, that is, the but-for scenario. After controlling for relative prices and advertising intensity, we find that one of the foreign entrants achieved a Spanish market share substantially below what it would have obtained in the absence of abuse. While the case was taken to Court {{and the nature of the}} abuse was recognized, the amount of damages awarded was limited to evidence of invoice-based inflated input costs, while estimates derived from construction of the but-for scenario were dismissed. This initial ruling was upheld on appeal. At the time of writing, an appeal had been lodged with the Tribunal Supremo (highest Appeal Court) regarding the quantum of damages. We believe that the limited amount of damages probably reflects a mixture of an overly conservative attitude towards damage awards, coupled with a lack of understanding of the underlying economic reasoning of the case, as well as of the quantitative evidence presented by the aggrieved party. ...|$|R
