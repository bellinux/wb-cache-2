50|$|At {{the very}} {{beginning}} of her career in mathematics and geodesy Geodesy, Dr. Fischer had quickly taught herself the basics of geodetic tables, datums Datum (geodesy), transformations, gravity studies, astronomy, long lines, <b>flare</b> <b>triangulation,</b> and guided missile ballistics. Her updates to geodetic science helped determine the parallax of the moon. Irene Fischer was also intrigued by research into post glacial uplift, and her geoid studies went hand in hand with investigations of the lingering effects of the last ice age.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the time of occurrence of gamma flares {{at different points in}} space is considered. This problem arises in the localization of sources of gamma <b>flares</b> by the <b>triangulation</b> method using several spacecraft. A study is made of different methods for determining the time at which the flare reaches the spacecraft and algorithms are given for estimating their accuracy. Results of processing the model information are also given...|$|R
