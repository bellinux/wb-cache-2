500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of {{the musical}} {{performances}} in the episode, calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] the highlight of an otherwise [...] "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them {{to fall into the}} habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once. It sounds harsh, but I could have completely done without the episode. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they needed filler just to showcase the [...] "Physical" [...] video." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E

6000|$|He {{looked for}} a moment as if she were really failing him. [...] "Then you won't meet them?" [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had {{developed}} an unexpected personal prudence.|$|E
60|$|The prince {{dropped his}} eye-glass and glanced toward his hostess. For a moment their eyes met. Louise's lips were faintly curled. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a {{challenge}} had passed between them.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> around 10 km {{long and}} takes 4 to 5 hours to walk. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> {{dangerous}} as beautiful.|$|R

60|$|They {{dragged out}} and beheld {{for the first}} time the grim, bone-handled, {{triangular}} Afghan knife. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> long as Lew.|$|R
60|$|She {{had never}} met a man before who {{understood}} just how a girl can feel the slow obtuseness of his sex. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had found her out at something.|$|E
60|$|Then he {{told her}} {{the budget of the}} day. His life-story, like an Arabian Nights, was told night after night to his mother. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were her own life.|$|E
60|$|His {{own heart}} was tenderly oppressed, not with desire, {{but with the}} memory of desire. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in his faded melancholy he were sorry for the {{disappointment}} of some one else.|$|E
60|$|Algernon. My dear fellow, {{the way you}} {{flirt with}} Gwendolen <b>is</b> {{perfectly}} disgraceful. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> bad as the way Gwendolen flirts with you.|$|R

60|$|He turned {{deliberately}} round. He {{was not in}} {{the least}} comfortable. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> though she could see through his tweed shooting-jacket into that inner pocket.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{had struck}} her. She recoiled. Instantly {{suspicion}} awoke in her; swiftly it {{drew to a}} conviction that he had but sought to trick her by a pretended penitence.|$|E
60|$|Dave spoke deliberately, {{weighing}} every word. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was registering a vow. The others saw a look {{of determination}} settle on his face, and {{knew that he would}} do as he said.|$|E
60|$|Therefore it was I {{sprang up}} very {{suddenly}} {{in the greatest}} alarm when a white man stood before me, having approached so silently that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had come up through the very earth.|$|E
60|$|We went promptly. A {{letter from}} the Story Girl's father was always an event; and to hear her read <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> good as hearing her tell a story.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, please, aunt, don't call me Thomas; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{a dreadful}} name; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> bad as Tommy. Please call me Tom. I am always called Tom by every one." ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr Crimble cast {{a strange}} {{look at her}} face. He was close to her, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had whispered, [...] "Fanny." [...] But {{there was no time}} for further discussion. Dr Phelps, gloved and buttoned, was already at the door.|$|E
60|$|Jerry Muskrat, Peter Rabbit, Bobby Coon, and {{the other}} little people of the Green Forest watched him with the {{greatest}} interest and curiosity.

60|$|Something {{seemed to}} have {{destroyed}} their look of mutual distrust. The plump, sleek hand of the lady with the Roman nose curved convulsively; and this movement corresponded to the feeling agitating Shelton's heart. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> hand and heart feared to be asked for something.|$|E

5000|$|Elisabeth Kirkby, Number 96 cast-member {{and former}} NSW Politician said [...] "Brooke's {{performance}} was memorising.

6000|$|Lord Julian bowed. [...] "I take it I {{have the}} honour to address Colonel Bishop, Deputy-Governor of Jamaica." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> his lordship were giving the Colonel {{a lesson in}} deportment. The Colonel {{accepted}} it, and belatedly bowed, removing his broad hat. Then he plunged on.|$|E
6000|$|... "And don't {{you believe}} him? Don't you believe me?" [...] She was more plaintive than ever. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she called heaven to witness what manner of husband {{she was forced}} to endure.

6000|$|He {{was amazed}} {{afterwards}} {{to think how}} simply and quietly he had met it. [...] "Not yet."
