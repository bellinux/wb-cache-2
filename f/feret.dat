With Eileen Bennett Whittingstall they were crowned the mixed victors. Cochet became the Danish Covered Courts champion {{for the first time}} after defeating Danish national champion Einer Ulrich in Copenhagen. He won the mixed contest as well with Simone Barbier. He was invited by his hometown club F.C. Lyon to an interclub match with German Uhlenhorster Klipper. Cochet won all three of his matches. In the Moncean Club of Paris he partnered Paul <b>Féret</b> and Colette Rosambert and swept the doubles and mixed doubles respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 France was {{overrun by}} Nazi Germany {{and for a}} brief period of time Cochet fell into war captivity. After his release he wasn't allowed to leave the country. He {{launched}} his own sporting goods store in Paris and lived on a farm in the outskirts. He gave tennis broadcasts, and accepted the Vichy government's offer to head its youth tennis program and after that to become a sports commissioner, who organized sport programmes for the deported French armament workers. In December 1940 the first open tennis tournament, combining amateur and professional players, was organized in Paris where Cochet lost to Paul <b>Féret.</b> In December 1941 he regained his amateur status granted by the French Tennis Association. This was in line with the sports policy of the Vichy regime which opposed professionalism. The policy was administered by Borotra who had been appointed General Commissioner for Education and Sports in August 1940.|$|E

LEFI is defined as the longest direct path {{from one end to the}} other within the particle contour and is adapted to non-spherical particles. Particle size distribution (PSD) is described as mass-weighted volume distribution. Shape parameters (sphericity) were used to differentiate air bubbles from particles. Data is expressed in medians (interquartile range), if not otherwise specified.|$|R
30|$|Interestingly, CD 11 b+ cell <b>Feret’s</b> {{diameter}} in TBI {{was bigger}} than that in pMCAo. In TBI, most of the lesion core is lost and sampling included wider border areas where hypertrophic microglia sit. We did not detect significant differences in area, perimeter, and <b>Feret’s</b> diameter between pMCAo or TBI and naïve cortex. Steady-state microglia in naïve mice have thin ramifications that, due to the microscope resolution limit, could have been excluded from the identified objects. Moreover, the bidimensional acquisition of the images fails to properly include ramifications belonging to different focal planes. These technical limits could lead to underestimation of area, perimeter, and <b>Feret’s</b> diameter in steady-state microglia of naive animals, resulting in a lack of sensitivity. It should be mentioned that naïve and not sham-operated animals were {{used in this study}} potentially raising the issue on the surgery versus injury effect. In previous works, we constantly observed M/M activation based on CD 11 b immunoreactivity, by comparing each model with proper sham-operated mice, thus confirming an injury effect and showing negligible impact of the surgical procedure on cortical and striatal M/M activation ([11] for tMCAo; [19] for pMCAo; unpublished submitted data for TBI). The focus {{of the present study was}} the comparison of M/M morphology in the three models and we choose an unperturbed condition as a common control group.|$|R

They teamed up for the doubles where they couldn't convert two match points against Hillyard and Vladimir Landau, which backfired on them and lost in five sets. In mixed doubles Rogers and Elizabeth Ryan found their winning form against Phyllis Satterthwaite and Erik Worm and became mixed champions. In the Parc Imperial L.T.C. de Nice Rogers had an easy victory over Edmond Lotan and in the mixed doubles he and Mrs. Marjollet defeated Mikhail Sumarokov-Elston and Mrs. Franke. At Gallia L.T.C. de Cannes Rogers faced Jacques Brugnon for the championship, and Brugnon was triumphant in a five-set match although he gave Rogers two zero-sets.

40|$|Abstract Background Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is an {{inherited}} degenerative neuromuscular disease characterised by rapidly progressive muscle weakness. Currently, curative treatment is not available. Approaches for new treatments that improve muscle strength {{and quality of}} life depend on preclinical testing in animal models. The mdx mouse model is the most frequently used animal model for preclinical studies in muscular dystrophy research. Standardised pathology-relevant parameters of dystrophic muscle in mdx mice for histological analysis have been developed in international, collaborative efforts, but automation has not been accessible to most research groups. A standardised and mainly automated quantitative assessment of histopathological parameters in the mdx mouse model is desirable to allow an objective comparison between laboratories. Methods Immunological and histochemical reactions were used to obtain a double staining for fast and slow myosin. Additionally, fluorescence staining of the myofibre membranes allows defining the minimal <b>Feret’s</b> diameter. The staining of myonuclei with the fluorescence dye bisbenzimide H was utilised to identify nuclei located internally within myofibres. Relevant structures were extracted from the image as single objects and assigned to different object classes using web-based image analysis (MyoScan). Quantitative and morphometric data were analysed, e. g. the number of nuclei per fibre and minimal <b>Feret’s</b> diameter in 6 [*]month old wild-type C 57 BL/ 10 mice and mdx mice. Results In the current version of the module “MyoScan”, essential parameters for histologic analysis of muscle sections were implemented including the minimal <b>Feret’s</b> diameter of the myofibres and the automated calculation of the percentage of internally nucleated myofibres. Morphometric data obtained {{in the present study were}} in good agreement with previously reported data in the literature and with data obtained from manual analysis. Conclusions A standardised and mainly automated quantitative assessment of histopathological parameters in the mdx mouse model is now available. Automated analysis of histological parameters is more rapid and less time-consuming. Moreover, results are unbiased and more reliable. Efficacy of therapeutic interventions, e. g. within the scope of a drug screening or therapeutic exon skipping, can be monitored. The automatic analysis system MyoScan used in this study is not limited exclusively to dystrophin-deficient mice but also represents a useful tool for applications in the research of other dystrophic pathologies, various other skeletal muscle diseases and degenerative neuromuscular disorders. </p...|$|R

We also provide evidence of the involvement of different populations in local inflammatory events, with macrophages replacing microglia into the lesion core when reperfusion does not occur.

40|$|Abstract — Particle size {{distribution}} (PSD) affects properties of particulate materials {{and is used}} for denoting their quality and performance. Among many techniques available to measure PSD, many are quite often offline methods and are time consuming. Also methods like sieving involve, handling of the material physically and electromagnetically, which is healthy, if avoided for certain materials. Thus {{the need for an}} online PSD analyzer and the advent of digital image processing has rendered the drift for innovation of image based particle analyzers. Also this method is purely inferential as the particles are not handled physically or electromagnetically as in cases like sieve analysis or tomography. In general, PSD estimation is based on considering a single parameter of the particle profile. Irregularities in analyzed particles increase the error in PSD estimation. Hence, two parameters, equivalent area diameter and <b>Feret's</b> diameter are included for the estimation to reduce the estimation error...|$|R
