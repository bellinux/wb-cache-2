40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted {{to one of the}} most urgent {{problems}} of Central Asian economies in transition, i. e. external debt and its sustainability within systemic transformation process. On the basis of vast current statistical data the problems of structure and dynamics of external debt are analysed and some policy recommendations are made. Basic transfer equations and two-gap models are used as tools to measure external debt. The paper attempts to find solutions considering both specific causes of the external debt itself and debt problems via related balance of payments issues. In conlcusion, it emphasized the necessity to deal with external debt through policies in all spheres of debt management, foreign trade and the flow of international financial resources implemented simultaneously. It proves that only the cumulative effect of all measures will allow the rather complex and persistent character of external debt to be overcome.

The macroeconomic imbalances characterizing the recent evolution of these economies are different from country to country as a result of diverse factors such as the excess demand magnitude at the onset of the crisis, the importance and structure of the commercial flows, the <b>external</b> financial <b>indebtedness</b> or the different contribution of the economic sectors to the economic growth. Also, the {{monetary and}} fiscal measures implemented before and after the onset of the crisis are important. In particular, in the countries with a fixed exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policy measures have been limited by the additional constraint of maintaining the confidence in the domestic currency. In countries such as Hungary and Romania which have an inflation targeting regime, the interest rate reductions have also been limited by the liquidity problems on the interbank market as well as by a high level of the inflation rate that existed in these economies at the onset of the crisis. financial and economic crisis, economic growth, fiscal policy, liquidity problems...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} illicit financial flows, this method measures a country's {{source of funds}} (inflows of capital) against its recorded use (outflows and/or expenditures of capital).

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims at {{presenting}} a non-linear dynamic model to evaluate at {{theoretical and empirical}} level the relationship between <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> and economic growth in emerging countries. For this intent, it is presented a post-keynesian endogenous growth model in which: i) desired rate of capital accumulation {{is supposed to be}} a non-linear function of <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> as share of capital stock; ii) there is an endogenous country risk premium, which {{is supposed to be a}}n increasing (linear) function of the <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> (as a share of capital stock); iii) there is a fixed exchange rate regime and perfect capital mobility in the sense of Mundell and Fleming. The main theoretical result of the model is the existence of two long-run equilibrium positions, one of them with a high level of <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> (as a ratio of capital stock) and a low profit rate and the other with a low level of <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> and a high profit rate. This means that an “excessive ” <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> can result in a stagnant growth due to its negative effect over the rate of profit. To test the effects of <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> over the rate of economic growth in emerging economies, it is estimated a dynamic panel which evaluates if external savings has an effective negative impact over the income per capita path of emerging countries. The empirical test of demand-led growth equations with a dynamic panel for 73 emerging countries confirms the potential negative effects of external savings over the long-run rate of growth of the countries in the sample.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop an econometric model of early warning system (EWS) for {{predicting}} currency crises in EU candidate countries. Using actual quarterly panel data for three EU candidate countries (Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey) in the period January 2005 - June 2010, we estimate a binomial logit model, which accurately predicts potential episodes of outbreak of currency crisis. In addition, we find that real GDP growth rate, participation in an IMF loan program, current account and fiscal balance and short-term <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> are the most significant common predictors of currency crises across EU candidate countries. These results imply implementing policy measures aimed at raising the growth potential of the domestic economies of EU candidate countries, monitoring their short-term <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness,</b> improving their external competitiveness, cutting public spending and increasing the confidence of residents and non-residents in their domestic banking sectors...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between external debt and poverty. A number of observers have argued that high <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> is {{a major cause of}} poverty. Using the first-differenced general method of moments (GMM) estimator, the paper models the impact of external debt on poverty, measured by life expectancy, infant mortality, and gross primary enrollment rates, while duly taking into account the impact of external debt on income. The paper thus endeavors to bring together the literature that links external debt with income growth and poverty. The main conclusion is that once the effect of income on poverty has been taken into account, <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> indicators have a limited but important impact on poverty.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the article is twofold. Firstly, it aims at proposing a Post-Keynesian {{interpretation}} of hyperinflation. The theoretical building includes elements suggested by Post-Keynesians {{as well as by}} structuralists. The accent is put on the role played by a foreign currency in domestic comportments during high inflation periods. Besides, a definition of hyperinflation is suggested: hyperinflation could be seen as a substitution by a foreign currency of a domestic currency. This substitution, violent in its final step, is built gradually. Hyperinflation is caused by a violent distributive conflict which generates a strong inflation, by indexation, by an <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> denominated in a foreign currency and by self-fulfilling prophecies. Secondly, this theoretical framework is confronted to economic facts observed in Argentina from the 1970 ’s to the 1989 hyper-inflationist spurt. The historical political economy analysis allows the spotting of the following sequence: the distributive conflict is highly violent, reshaped several times from the 1970 ’s onwards. It provokes the development of institutional arrangements (indexation), while the dollar becomes more and more important within the economy. This phenomenon is encouraged by the implementation of an original exchange rate regime {{at the end of the}} 1970 ’s, in a context of liberalization of the economy. The impossibility to stabilize the exchange rate during the 1980 ’s in a context of <b>external</b> <b>indebtedness</b> makes possible the arising of hyperinflation. It is finally activated by speculation on the exchange rate level and a run on the foreign reserves...|$|E
