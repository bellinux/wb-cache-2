40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a project dealing with the structural characteristics of a silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) -dominated stand (including Norway spruce, European larch, European beech, hornbeam, etc. as secondary tree species), 25 years old and naturally regenerated by uniform shelterwood cuttings. In spring 2012, three research & demonstration plots (RDP 1, 2, and 3) of 450 sq. m, 400 sq. m and 300 sq. m were established. In RDP 1 and RDP 2 cleaning-respacing interventions with different silvicultural objectives and intensities were carried out while RDP 3 was kept as control. In all plots, potential <b>final</b> <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> (between 400 and 489 trees/ha), mostly of silver fir, were selected based on the vigour-quality-spacing criteria. The main results of the field measurements and office analyses are as follows:- owing to the exceptional regeneration potential of silver fir, as well as its high shade-tolerance, the initial stocking of living trees was over 10, 000 stems in all plots. After intervention the stocking varies between 1, 350 trees/ha in RDP 2 and 10, 032 trees/ha in control plot;- following intervention stand basal area was reduced to 10. 87 sq. m/ha (RDP 2) and 20, 25 sq. m/ha (RDP 1); basal area shows the maximum value in control plot (31. 65 sq. m/ha);- the mean diameter ranges between 5. 60 cm (control plot) and 10. 19 cm (RDP 2);- the mean height is less variable than the mean diameter and ranges between 7. 56 m (control plot) and 8. 42 m (RDP 2);- the mean slenderness index h/d is the highest (over 130) in control plot and lowest (96) in RDP 2;- the variability of potential <b>final</b> <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> in terms of their mean diameter, mean height and mea...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{literature}} {{review of the}} free-growth system, which may have potential for the rehabilitation of some poorly-performing pole-stage broadleaf stands. It involves releasing of a selected number of good quality stems from crown competition {{as a basis for}} the <b>final</b> <b>crop.</b> Generally, only stems with crowns adjacent to the potential <b>final</b> <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> are removed. The aim is to increase diameter growth of the selected stems and thereby shorten the rotation length needed to achieve a given diameter. The treatment may result in a greater incidence of epicormic shoots, particularly in oak (Quercus spp.). To maintain stem quality, epicormics may need to be removed, which may make the free-growth system uneconomic. There is, however, some evidence to believe that {{this may not be the}} case. In addition, the free-growth system may also be applicable in species less prone to epicormics, such as ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.). The free-growth system may prove to be a useful system for the rehabilitation of poorly performing pole-stage broadleaf stands and, with the advent of Chalara ash dieback (caused by Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus V. Queloz et al.) in Ireland, may gain greater use for its ability to reduce rotation lengths. peer-reviewedCOFOR...|$|R
40|$|Black alder is a scattered, {{widespread}} and short-lived species that thrives in low-lying damp and riparian places. It has a use in flood control, stabilization of riverbanks and in {{functioning of the}} river ecosystems. To thrive, precipitation must exceed 1500 mm if access to groundwater is not possible. Alders are unusual among European trees in that they fix nitrogen. To regenerate naturally, alder requires high levels of both light and moisture, usually achievable only on disturbed sites. Growth rates up to ages 7 – 10 are very fast but then slow rapidly. Sixty to seventy years is the maximum rotation for growing timber if heart rot is to be avoided. Maximum mean annual increments range from 4 to 14 m 3 ha– 1 year– 1. Alder wood is used for energy, as fibre for paper and particle board and, most profitably, in joinery as solid wood or veneer. Logs {{must be at least}} 3 m long and ideally 50 – 60 cm diameter.

40|$|Oak {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{valuable}} noble hardwood species in Europe. The production of high-quality wood is associated with long rotations and high labour costs. The aim of this thesis was to quantify and model the effects of some silvicultural practices, mainly thinning, on crown size, volume growth and stem quality on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), to provide a scientific basis to modify contemporary oak silviculture. The response pattern of specific silvicultural practices was tested in nine long-term thinning experiments and one operational stand located in Northern Europe. Results showed that pruning led to an overall increase in the total production of new epicormic shoots, which decreased with increasing height along the stem and with decreasing stand density. This suggests that early, heavy thinning combined with high pruning at regular intervals may help shorten the rotation length. A set of models for predicting crown radius was presented, based on different levels of predictor variables that offer flexibility in terms of data availability. The models can be used, for example, to calculate the average area potentially available for <b>final</b> <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> and therefore the potential number of trees at the end of the rotation. Models for individual tree volume were fitted separately for predicting total and stem volume, whilst accounting for thinning practice. Results showed an increase in prediction accuracy in comparison to similar models available in the literature. Stand volume growth was analysed and modelled in relation to age, thinning practice and site. The highest growth was for unthinned stands, decreasing with increasing thinning grade. Volume growth of 50 potential future <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> ha- 1 increased with increasing thinning grade at all ages, demonstrating a positive effect of thinning on the growth of selected <b>crop</b> <b>trees.</b> The results lend support to the concept of <b>crop</b> <b>tree</b> silviculture based on early initiated, heavy thinning for the 'best' trees at regular intervals...|$|R
40|$|In {{northern}} England {{and southern}} Scotland 240, 000 hectares or {{two-thirds of the}} productive woodland area are spruce, mainly Sitka spruce. A continuing theme for the Border Group has been the relation between {{quality and quantity of}} timber production in spruce, particularly Sitka spruce. It is gener-ally accepted that the aim for Sitka spruce should be to produce a good general purpose timber. The most recent meeting discussed the results of a sawmill conversion of logs from Sitka spruce stands grown under different silvicultural regimes. Sitka spruce is intrinsically one of the lighter and weaker timbers and, to ensure that at least 80 per cent of the sawn timber is suitable for structural grades, crops should be grown within current standard silvicultural regimes with particular attention paid to the moulding of the first 6 to 8 metres of the stem which provides more than half the sawn timber. The trees should be light-branched and have the highest possible timber density. Attention must be given from planting to the thicket stage and through to final felling to the production of crops grown uniformly within their yield classes. In the higher yield classes pruning up to 5 metres may be necessary on <b>final</b> <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> to maintain the strength and grade of timber rather than to provide 'clears'. More information is required on the log sizes required for maximum sawmill recovery of chosen end products. A regional sales grading system of sawlogs should be introduced...|$|R

The experiment was conducted at Clarksville Horticultural Experimental Station (Michigan State Univ.) on 9 -year-old ‘Imperial Gala’ apple trees on M- 9 (n = 36). During the summer (20 June) after June drop, yield was adjusted according to different number of fruit per trunk cross sectional area (TCSA) to obtain three crop load levels: high (13. 5 fruit/TCSA), medium (7. 1 fruit/TCSA), and low (2. 1 fruit/TCSA). Each crop load level was defoliated (25 %) three times during the season (8 July, 25 and 19 Aug.) leaving three thinned trees for each level of crop load un-defoliated as control treatment. Spur canopy daily assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), fruit growth and shoot length were measured at weekly intervals after crop load adjustment until harvest, and 1 week before harvest (14 Sept.), Chl and nitrogen leaf content was also determined. A in high <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> was not affected by defoliation at any time, however in medium and low <b>cropping</b> <b>trees</b> there was an increase from 5 % to 20 % at each time after 3 days from defoliation.

40|$|This paper reports early {{effects of}} stump height {{on the growth}} and natural pruning of {{potential}} <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> after pre-commercial thinning of a young stand of naturally regenerated beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) in Denmark. The experiment comprises five treatments based on combinations of three grades of pre-commercial thinning and three stump heights. Treatments include the unthinned control, thinning only of whips and wolf trees (using low stumps), and thinning for potential <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> using low, medium or high stumps. All treatments were replicated three times. Stump heights averaged 10, 90 or 230 cm, respectively. Pre-treatment stem number (live trees) varied from 17, 500 to 41, 000 per ha. In the potential <b>crop</b> <b>tree</b> treatment, post-treatment stem number ranged from 4, 750 to 9, 500 per ha. Following two growth seasons, the quantity of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the rate of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the diameter growth of potential <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> increased with decreasing stump height, the increase in stand height did not depend on stump height or post-treatment stem number, and the natural pruning of potential <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> increased with increasing stump height.

In Hawaii, the main native hardwood species with commercial value is Acacia koa (koa), but lack of successful examples of koa plantation forestry hinders private investment. Financial models, which have been offered to encourage investment, assume that a particular minimum volume of merchantable wood will be harvested at rotation age. No {{studies have been done}} to determine the appropriateness of the assumed volumes for koa plantations. Three 18 - to 28 -year-old koa plantations were studied to determine butt-log size, crown class and <b>crop</b> <b>tree</b> potential. Estimates of present and future merchantable sawtimber volume were made for each plantation. Results indicate that most existing plantation koa trees fork so close to the ground that they will produce little to no merchantable wood. Projected sawtimber yields from <b>crop</b> <b>trees</b> in these plantations at age 45 years are 10, 15 and 90 m 3 /ha, which are below the 135 m 3 /ha yield used in the most recent financial analysis of returns on investment in koa forestry.
