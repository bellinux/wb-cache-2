40|$|Abstract. Nanocomposites {{with high}} density {{polyethylene}} (HDPE) /nanoclay/bamboo flour were fabricated by melt compounding. Their thermal behaviors and degradation kinetics of the composites with different clay contents were characterized through dynamic and <b>isothermal</b> <b>Thermogravimetric</b> (TG) <b>analysis.</b> It {{was found that the}} use of nanoclay improved the thermal stability of the composites.

It seems that there is no much difference in the thermal behaviors between HDPE/nanoclay/bamboo systems with and without the addition of compatibilizer. The activation energy values varied very little for different clay contents in the composites.

Four synthetic slag mixtures with chemical compositions covering typical industrial practice were subjected to high cooling rates, by copper wheel spinning and moderately high cooling rates, by quenching in water. Both copper wheel granulation and water quenching are effective ways of stabilisation. Stabilised slags consist predominantly of lamellar -dicalcium silicate grains and Mg,Ca-silicates, which form the matrix at low basicity and are segregated along the grain boundaries at high basicities. <b>Isothermal</b> calorimetry and <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> indicate that hydration of the stabilised slag is taking place {{with the development of}} foil-like structures being typical for calcium silicate hydrates.

Some films on nichrome displayed preferred orientations of (113) and (116) normal to substrate surfaces, while films deposited on silica showed no preferred orientation. Films deposited on nichrome seemed denser than those on silica as the grains clustered together to provide a ‘cauliflower’ appearance.

40|$|The {{influence}} of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) addition {{on the performance}} of cement paste is investigated. Our mechanical tests show an increase in the flexural strength of ~ 30 % with only 0. 2 % volume of the as-received CNCs with respect to cement. However, the strength decreases at the high concentration region due to the agglomeration of CNCs. The ultrasonication is performed to disperse the CNCs and a maximum strength improvement of up to 50 % is achieved. The relationship between the dispersion of CNCs and the strength of the cement paste is examined with rheological measurements. <b>Isothermal</b> calorimetry and <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysis</b> show that the degree of hydration (DOH) of the cement paste is increased when CNCs are used. The first mechanism that explains the increased hydration is the steric stabilization, which is supported by rheological, heat flow rate measurements, microscopic imaging, and nanoindentation. A second mechanism is proposed as short circuit diffusion (SCD) to explain the increased hydration. SCD appears to increase cement hydration by increasing the transport of water from outside the hydration product shell (i. e., through the high density CSH) on a cement grain to the unhydrated cement cores. The DOH and flexural strength are measured for cement pastes with water reducing agent and CNC to verify this theory. Our results indicate that SCD is more dominant than steric stabilization...|$|R
