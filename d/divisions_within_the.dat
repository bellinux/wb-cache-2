5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Bradley {{was able}} to {{capitalize}} both on <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party {{over the issue of}} Free Silver and on the presence of a strong third-party candidate, Populist Thomas S. Pettit, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.|$|E
5|$|In fall of 1946, the {{division}} was reactivated in the U.S. Army Reserve as the 100th Airborne Division in Louisville, Kentucky. This distinction {{as one of}} the few airborne <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army was brief; in 1952 {{the division}} was once again redesignated the 100th Infantry Division. It would change names again in 1955, this time to 100th Division (Replacement Training). It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division (Institutional Training). Its mission became to teach basic, advanced, and common training skills to soldiers from the Army's active, reserve, and National Guard components.|$|E

5|$|The 1660 Restoration {{was popular}} in Scotland since it ended the Union and an {{expensive}} military occupation, although ironically it was welcomed in England {{for the same}} reasons. Scottish Parliamentary elections installed a Royalist majority which passed a series of acts giving greater power to the Crown, the most significant being the Rescissory Act of March 1661. This returned Scotland to the constitutional position of 1633, restoring the legal system and Parliament but imposing the Episcopalian structure on the Kirk rejected in 1638. Many were prepared to accept this since continuing <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Presbyterian Kirk made it seem impossible they could create a unified church.|$|E
5|$|This Counter-Reformation {{offensive}} happened somewhat mysteriously in a country, {{where there}} were no religious wars and the state had not cooperated with the Catholic Church in eradicating or limiting competing denominations. Among the factors responsible, low Protestant involvement among the masses, especially of peasantry, pro-Catholic position of the kings, low level of involvement of the nobility once the religious emancipation had been accomplished, internal <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Protestant movement, and the rising intensity of the Catholic Church propaganda, have been listed.|$|E

5|$|After D-Day, Allied troops {{crossed the}} Belgian {{frontier}} on 1 September 1944. German forces {{did little to}} oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference. Although the King {{was no longer in}} the country, his Political Testament was presented to the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The text reignited the <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Government which had been largely hidden since earlier in the war.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 he {{was elected}} as Woleu-N'Tem's {{representative}} for Gabon's Territorial Assembly. He was re-elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, {{in the absence of}} an absolute majority, on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable for inclusion in the government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, {{following}} the reemergence of Germany and their occupation of Czechoslovakia, the British army {{increased the number}} of <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Territorial Army by duplicating existing units. On paper, the division was recreated as the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, a duplicate of the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division; it formed in September. It was never deployed overseas as a division, having been restricted to home defence duties around the United Kingdom. In 1944, it was disbanded and its units were either deployed or broken up to reinforce the 21st Army Group in Normandy during Operation Overlord. The 38th Division was recreated on 1 September 1944 as the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division, a training formation that took over the role previously occupied by the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division. In this form, the division completed the training of recruits, who were then dispatched overseas as reinforcements. At the end of the war, the division was again stood down.|$|E

5|$|Republican William S. Taylor {{was elected}} to succeed Bradley in the {{contentious}} 1899 gubernatorial election. When Democratic nominee William Goebel and his running mate J. C. W. Beckham challenged the election results, Bradley formed part of the legal team for the Republicans. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which found {{in favor of the}} Democrats. Despite {{being a member of the}} state's minority party, Bradley {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate in 1907. Again, <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party played a role in his election. Bradley's opposition to Prohibition made him more palatable to some Democrats than their own candidate, outgoing Governor Beckham. Beckham refused to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate, and after two months of balloting, four Democratic legislators crossed party lines and elected Bradley. Bradley had a largely undistinguished career in the Senate. On the day he announced he would not seek re-election to his Senate seat, he was involved in a streetcar accident. He died from his injuries on May 23, 1914.|$|E
5|$|In 376, the Goths, {{fleeing from}} the Huns, {{received}} permission from Emperor Valens (r. 364–378) {{to settle in}} the Roman province of Thracia in the Balkans. The settlement did not go smoothly, and when Roman officials mishandled the situation, the Goths began to raid and plunder. Valens, attempting {{to put down the}} disorder, was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople on 9 August 378. As well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north, internal <b>divisions</b> <b>within</b> <b>the</b> empire, especially within the Christian Church, caused problems. In 400, the Visigoths invaded the Western Roman Empire and, although briefly forced back from Italy, in 410 sacked the city of Rome. In 406 the Alans, Vandals, and Suevi crossed into Gaul; {{over the next three years}} they spread across Gaul and in 409 crossed the Pyrenees Mountains into modern-day Spain. The Migration Period began, when various peoples, initially largely Germanic peoples, moved across Europe. The Franks, Alemanni, and the Burgundians all ended up in northern Gaul while the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes settled in Britain, and the Vandals went on to cross the strait of Gibraltar after which they conquered the province of Africa. In the 430s the Huns began invading the empire; their king Attila (r. 434–453) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451, and Italy in 452. The Hunnic threat remained until Attila's death in 453, when the Hunnic confederation he led fell apart. These invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the Western Roman Empire.|$|E
