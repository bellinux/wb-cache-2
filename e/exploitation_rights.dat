After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman Coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the <b>exploitation</b> <b>rights</b> were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.|$|E

Since no agreement on allocation of <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> is done, they are in a non-cooperative competition situation. This paper first puts forth a multi-stage dynamic decision-making model of mineral resources corresponding to different technology levels of the running units, and then gives the optimal decision-making on exploitation and the ideal allocation of <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> by a special case of this model, which can lead to the maximum profit over the exploitation term of the mine resources...|$|R

The second category is called copyrights related to personality. These two categories of copyright {{can not be separated}} by exact borderline - economic rights in copyright include economic component, and vice versa. Economic rights in copyright are rights which have economic importance for their right holder. Economic rights in copyright can be divided into two main categories: <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> (in wide sense) and other economic <b>rights</b> in copyright. <b>Exploitation</b> <b>right</b> in wide sense include <b>exploitation</b> <b>right</b> and right of granting licence to other person. The aim of my thesis is to analyse and summarize contemporary situation of a legislation regulating economic rights in copyright and institutes relating to them. The thesis is composed of six chapters. The purpose of Chapter One is to explain what is a content of copyright and to briefly describe economic rights in copyright and copyrights related to personality in two parts of this Chapter. Chapter Two of the thesis is called economic rights in copyright. This chapter is subdivided into five parts.

These rights are neither absolute nor immune from constitutional amendments. They have been aimed at overturning the inequalities of pre-independence social practices. Specifically, they resulted in abolishment of un-touchability and prohibit discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. They forbid human trafficking and unfree labour. They protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and administer their own educational institutions.|$|R
