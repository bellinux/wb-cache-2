40|$|As {{a part of}} {{a project}} to develop an {{ultrasonic}} multiviewing transducer which is capable of providing sufficient information for flaw reconstruction, results have been obtained that address certain phases of the required signal processing routine. It is well known that individual ultrasonic transducers show a considerable variation in signal responses. Inasmuch as the multiviewing transducer uses a sparse array of individual transducers arranged in a particular geometry, it becomes important that signal processing routines be developed and applied which overcome these variabilities. There are, of course, several possible sources of variability in transducer performance. These include those of measurement (<b>diffraction,</b> <b>attenuation</b> and effects associated with imperfect deconvolution processes), and those due to fabrication (transducer design, materials, reproducibility of fabrication techniques, etc.).

40|$|The {{so-called}} Localized Waves (LW), and the "Frozen Waves" (FW), {{have arisen}} significant {{attention in the}} areas of Optics and Ultrasound, because of their surprising energy localization properties. The LWs resist the effects of diffraction for large distances, and possess an interesting self-reconstruction (self-healing) property, after obstacles with size smaller than the antenna's; while the FWs, a sub-class of theirs, offer the possibility of arbitrarily modeling the field longitudinal intensity pattern inside a prefixed interval, for instance 0 < z < L, of the wave propagation axis. More specifically, the FWs are localized fields "at rest", that is, with a static envelope (within which only the carrier wave propagates), and can be endowed moreover with a high transverse localization. In this paper we investigate by simulated experiments, various cases of generation of ultrasonic FW fields, with frequency f_o = 1 MHz in a water-like medium, taking account of the effects of attenuation. We present results of FWs for distances up to L= 80 mm, in attenuating media with absorption coefficients alpha in the range 70 < alpha < 170 dB/m. Such simulated FW fields are constructed by using a procedure developed by us, via appropriate finite superpositions of monochromatic ultrasonic Bessel beams. We pay due attention to the selection of the FW parameters, constrained by the tight restrictions imposed by experimental Acoustics, and to some practical implications of the transducer design. The energy localization properties of the Frozen Waves can find application even in many medical apparatus, such as bistouries or acoustic tweezers, and for treatment of diseased tissues (in particular, for the destruction of tumor cells, without affecting the surrounding tissues; besides for a safe kidney stone shuttering, etcetera).

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to discuss a {{numerical}} method for handling strongly non-linear effects in the (very) near field of a plane or curved axially-symmetrical ultrasonic transducer. The resolution of the method allows details which are smaller than the wavelength of a higher harmonic to be accounted for. For modern ultrasonic equipment as used in medical diagnostics (and particularly for lithotripters), the nonlinear effects play an important role. In a number of devices, they considerably affect the measured characteristics of the ultrasonic field and are therefore worth studying in detail. In its present form, the method models the propagation of steady-state ultrasonic fields in a thermoviscous fluid. The acoustic field is propagated along the axis of symmetry with substeps that account for <b>diffraction,</b> <b>attenuation,</b> and nonlinearity. The diffraction substep {{involves the use of}} the Helmholtz-Huyghens integral for the pressure applied to equally spaced planes which are perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. Implementation of this integral for two arbitrary consecutive reference planes leads to a transfer matrix of size N*N which does not depend on the specific problem under study. If the radial pressure distribution in one plane is represented by a vector of size N, then the pressure in the next plane is obtained as this vector multiplied by the transfer matrix. The nonlinear and attenuation substeps are based on the frequency domain solution of the Burgers equation. The method is tested by comparison with exact solutions in the two limiting cases of linear diffraction and nonlinear plane-wave propagation. A comparison with measurements performed on the nonlinear field of a focused 1. 0 MHz source is given. (orig.) 56 refs.

40|$|Models {{and methods}} for {{investigation}} of reverberations in nonlinear imaging techniques {{are presented in}} this thesis. Four independent papers provide insight on nonlinear propagation effects, a theoretical description of reverberations {{and the effects of}} reverberations on conventional and second-harmonic ultrasound imaging. Two papers, Paper A and C, describe methods used to investigate nonlinear distortion and reverberations, whereas Paper B and D concentrate on acoustic phenomena and performance of conventional and second-harmonic imaging. Paper A provides a comparison of Field II, the Texas code and Abersim; three freely available simulation tools. If analytic solutions exist, these are used as gold standards for the comparison, and when they do not; high resolution Field II or Texas code simulations are defined to be the gold standard. The comparison suggests that Abersim performs equivalent or better than the two other methods in solving <b>diffraction,</b> <b>attenuation</b> and nonlinear distortion. In Paper B, the effects of transmit beamforming and safety regulations on second-harmonic generation at two different frequencies are investigated. The safety regulations are imposed through a limitation of the maximum mechanical index of the transmit beam. Abersim is used as the simulation tool. The results suggest that the two frequencies perform equivalently when the transmit beamforming is equal in terms of wavelengths and the medium has a linear-in-frequency attenuation. Nonlinear frequency dependent attenuation and heterogeneous effects are suggested to be the main cause of the reduced improvements of second-harmonic imaging at higher frequencies. Paper C presents a time-domain Spectral Element Method for nonlinear propagation in a finite spatial domain. The method is shown to perform well when compared with analytic plane wave solutions and in a two-dimensional comparison with Abersim. The Spectral Element Method is suggested to be accurate for heterogeneous media, but this is not investigated or verified. The last paper concentrate on reverberations. A mathematical description of reverberations is presented along with a classification system. The main results state that reverberations always act in reciprocal pairs, and that secondharmonic suppression of reverberations is a combined effect of transmit beam intensity and a reverberation weight filter presented in the paper. The thesis provides insight on the description of reverberations and how they can be investigated. The influence of reverberations on ultrasound imaging is suggested to be more severe in applications where the object of interest is fully submerged in heterogeneous tissue. Deeper understanding of ultrasound acoustics may lead to new nonlinear imaging techniques where the noise contribution can be separated from the first-order echo. In turn, this might provide better gray scale images and ultrasound diagnoses. </p...|$|E

Absolute velocity measurements on steel specimens were found to be subject to random scatter related to minor compositional variations; this limits the utility of absolute velocity measurements for microstructural NDE.

"December 2011 "A polycrystalline metal's grain size affects its mechanical properties; therefore, the ability to effectively and easily monitor grain size during a manufacturing process is critical. Conventional destructive tests utilized for estimating grain size or mechanical properties are expensive and time consuming. Past research has shown some success in nondestructively estimating a metal's mean grain size using attenuation coefficient measurements acquired from ultrasound. Within this research, a water immersion, pulse-echo mode of ultrasonic testing is employed to estimate the mean grain diameter of 5 thin copper-alloy samples using attenuation coefficient measurements. The attenuation coefficients were estimated via spectral analysis of interface reflections. The interface reflections were corrected for reflection and transmission effects, beam field <b>diffraction,</b> and water <b>attenuation</b> effects. An experimental diffraction correction approach and an inverse water attenuation filter accounted for <b>diffraction</b> and water <b>attenuation,</b> respectively. A Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation algorithm was implemented to generate correlation models needed for grain diameter estimation.

40|$|Grain-size {{distribution}} {{is a fundamental}} tool for interpreting sedimentary units within depositional systems. The techniques assessed {{in this study are}} commonly used to determine grain-size distributions for sand-dominated sediments. However, the degree of consistency and differences in interpretation when using a combination of grain-size methods have not yet been assessed systematically for sand-dominated fluvial sediments. Results obtained from laser <b>diffraction,</b> X-ray <b>attenuation</b> and scanning electron microscopy grain-size analysis techniques were compared with those obtained from the traditional sieve/hydrometer method. Scanning electron microscopy was shown to provide an inaccurate quantitative analysis of grain-size distributions because of difficulties in obtaining representative samples for examination. The X-ray attenuation method is unsuitable for sand-dominated sediments because of its upper size range of only 300 μm. The consistently strong correlation between the laser diffraction results and the sieve/hydrometer results shows that these methods are comparable for sand-dominated fluvial sediments. Provided that sample preparation is consistent, the latter two methods can be used together within a study of such sediments while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. These results indicate that data for sand-dominated fluvial sediments gained from the long-established sieve/hydrometer method can be compared with confidence to those obtained by modern studies using laser diffraction techniques...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{acoustic}} nonlinearity parameter β are frequently made for {{early detection of}} damage in various materials. The practical implementation of the measurement technique has been limited to the through-transmission setup for determining the nonlinearity parameter of the second harmonic wave. For the purpose of practical applications, a pulse-echo measurement technique is more desirable which enables the single-side access of test components. The issue with using the second harmonic wave reflected from the stress-free interface is that such a boundary destructively alters the nonlinear generation process and consequently {{makes it difficult to}} obtain the reliable results of β. In this work, we employ a focused beam theory to modify the phase reversal at the stress-free boundary, and consequently enhance the second harmonic generation during its back-propagation toward the initial source position. We first confirm this concept through experiment by using a spherically focused beam at the water-air interface, and measuring the reflected second harmonic and comparing with a planar wave reflected from the same stress-free or a rigid boundary.

40|$|A {{simulation}} method for forward propagation of acoustic pressure pulses {{in a medium}} with three-dimensional (3 D) spatially-variable acoustic properties is presented. The intended application is to study aspects of ultrasound imaging of soft biological tissue. The forward wave propagation is modelled by a one-way wave equation. The equation describes tissue exhibiting nonlinear elasticity and arbitrary frequency-dependent attenuation. A numerical solution to the equation is found by means of first-order accurate operator splitting and propagation along the spatial depth coordinate. Thus <b>diffraction,</b> nonlinearity and <b>attenuation</b> are solved independently at each propagation step, rendering their relative importance easy to monitor. The method is seen to yield an accurate simulation of the wave propagation when compared to numerical solutions of the full wave equation and experiments in a water tank.

However, the in-service inspection is usually done {{in a short time}} during the outages in limited accessibility, which sets the need for efficient inspection procedure. Primary circuit components are made from austenitic stainless steel and designed mechanical integrity and corrosion resistance in mind. While material properties of austenitic stainless steel promote these aspects they reduce the capability of ultrasonic testing, due to scattering, <b>diffraction</b> and <b>attenuation</b> of ultrasound. In order to validate an inspection method and to train inspectors, reference points are needed. However, there are not enough real flaws available to be used for these purposes. For this reason artificial flaws must be used. Artificial flaws must reflect same or similar reflection indication so it {{can be used as a}} reference point.

At larger angles, focusing and aberrations caused a lack of agreement; the model needs further refinement in this case. For shear waves, {{it was found that the}} frequency for optimum flaw detection in the presence of material noise is lower than that for longitudinal waves; lower frequency measurements are currently in progress. The {{measurement model}} was then used to make preliminary predictions of the best experimental measurement technique for the detection of cracks located under cylindrically curved surfaces...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} {{that may be}} used in the tomographic imaging of structural and geotechnical systems. X-ray tomography and ultrasonic imaging are two of the extreme techniques as functions of resolution and costs. On one hand, X-ray tomography allows the collection of high-resolution images in small specimens that may be removed from the structure. The application of X-rays in the field is not recommended due to cost and safety issues. On the other hand, ultrasonic testing may be used in the field to obtain stiffness images with lower resolution due to problems of high <b>attenuation,</b> <b>diffraction</b> and scattering around aggregates and inclusions. However the cost of ultrasonic testing is much lower than X-ray imaging systems. This paper presents experimental results of X-ray and ultrasonic tomographic imaging of concrete cylindrical specimens prepared with low-density and velocity and high-density and velocity inclusions. These specimens present the extremes of contrast for the two techniques. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results show that the results from each technique are complementary: X-ray tomography may be efficiently used for the collection of advanced model parameters while ultrasonic imaging may be used for the QC/QA of structural and geotechnical elements in the field...|$|R
40|$|Ray tracing is a {{technique}} based on the numerical simulation of geometrical optics and the uniform theory of diffraction, two well-known approximate methods for estimating a high-frequency electromagnetic field, based on the ray theory of field propagation. Radio-wave propagation prediction models based on ray tracing {{play an important role}} in wireless network planning, as they take into account diverse physical phenomena such as reflection, <b>diffraction</b> and foliage <b>attenuation</b> and are considered critical for the analysis of long term evolution (LTE) systems, which requires a detailed description of the wireless channel. A major practical drawback of these models is that they can easily become very computationally expensive, as the required level of accuracy and the corresponding areas of study increase. In this paper, a parallel ray tracing algorithm for radio-wave propagation prediction based on the electromagnetic theory of images is presented. The implementation of the algorithm is based on the message passing interface (MPI). The decomposition of the problem is conducted by partitioning the image tree, while dynamic load balancing techniques are employed by means of the master-worker and the work-pool patterns. The performance of the parallel implementation is studied for different problems and task assignment schemes, showing that high speedups can be achieved. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
