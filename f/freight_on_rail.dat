30|$|The {{implications}} for the rail freight sector, in terms of wagon fleet capacity and capability in general, are significant, as is the availability of infrastructure (e.g. line capacity and train paths) to accommodate the much higher expected demands. Recently, a Strategic Freight Network (SFN) has {{been put in place}} to benefit the British rail freight industry. This facilitates opinion gathering from stakeholder groups that include ports, shipping lines, manufacturing, logistics service providers, retailers, quarrying, construction and British rail freight service users. The SFN is a rolling programme of planned investment in infrastructure to allow the efficient operation of longer, larger and more freight trains, to meet the forecast growth in demand (Network Rail 2010 p. 35). The SFN consists of a series of linked schemes, with a rolling programme of investment in more productive locomotives, wagons and terminals, aimed to improve the performance, economic efficiency and capacity of <b>freight</b> <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> (Network Rail 2013 c). The current research recommends that, in combination with this freight forecast, similar action be taken at the European level and SHIFT 2 RAIL ([URL] has kicked off its journey towards this.|$|E

50|$|In the United States only FRA-compliant DMU {{systems are}} {{permitted}} <b>on</b> <b>freight</b> <b>rail</b> corridors.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{extraordinary}} support programs {{initiated by the}} European Union and other national authorities, the percentage of overall freight traffic moved by train is in steady decline.

Attracting a higher share of <b>freight</b> traffic <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> requires a more efficient freight handling in railway yards, which includes technical innovations as well as the development of suited decision support systems.

40|$|In this work, exposure-response {{relationships}} for annoyance due {{to freight}} and passenger railway vibration exposure in residential environments are developed, so as {{to better understand the}} differences in human response to these two sources of environmental vibration. Data for this research come from a field study comprising interviews with respondents and measurements of their vibration exposure (N[*]=[*] 752). A logistic regression model is able to accurately classify 96 % of these measured railway vibration signals as freight or passenger based on two signal properties that quantify the duration and low frequency content of each signal. Exposure-response relationships are then determined using ordinal probit modeling with fixed thresholds. The results indicate that people are able to distinguish between {{freight and passenger}} railway vibration, and that the annoyance response due to freight railway vibration is significantly higher than that due to passenger railway vibration, even for equal levels of exposure. In terms of a community tolerance level, the population studied is 15 [*]dB (re 10 − 6 m[*]s− 2) more tolerant to passenger railway vibration than freight railway vibration.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} and understand the role of the attitudinal factors involved in annoyance reported due to railway vibration. Many non-acoustical factors have been identified with various degrees of association with annoyance due to noise exposure. In particular, attitudinal factors have shown a large effect on noise annoyance reporting. However, the novelty of this work lies in the examination of attitudinal factors on vibration annoyance reporting. This is achieved using data from case studies comprised of face-toface interviews (N= 931) and internal vibration measurements collected within the study “Human Response to Vibration in Residential Environments ” by the University of Salford. The effect on vibration annoyance of sensitivity to vibration, property damage concern and expected vibration levels is investigated using multivariate modelling and ordinal logistic regression. The conclusions are that attitudinal factors including property damage concern and the individual’s opinion on future vibration levels are related to vibration annoyance, while no significant relationship is seen between self-reported vibration sensitivity and overall annoyance.

5000|$|The <b>rails</b> reached Morrisville <b>on</b> December 31, 1872, {{the same}} year that the depot {{building}} was completed. Although the Portland and Ogdensburg's system was reorganized in 1880, by 1884 the station was popular enough to warrant a 24 by 55 ft extension {{in the form of the}} Depot Restaurant. The Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad leased its central Vermont section of rails to the Maine Central Railroad in 1888 (who subsequently leased the line to the Boston and Maine Railroad). In 1900 a poolroom was added to the Morrisville Depot's east side. The Maine Central's lease <b>on</b> Morrisville's <b>rails</b> was held until 1927, when the Maine Central decided to renew only as far west as St. Johnsbury. Passenger railway service declined in the early 1930s, and the Depot Restaurant closed.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to apply a new {{categorisation}} algorithm to an existing database of case stud- ies in order to investigate its effectiveness in sorting unknown train vibration signals into freight and passenger train categories for exposure-response analysis. Relatively little work has been performed on the human response to vibration from railway transportation when compared with response to air-borne noise. Data for this work comes from case studies comprising face-to-face interviews and vibration measurements collected within the University of Salford study "Human Response to Vi- bration in Residential Environments". There are indications within this database that the annoyance response due to freight and passenger trains may be significantly different. The novelty of this work, therefore, is the use an algorithm that separates freight and passenger train vibration signals in order to further analyse the exposure-response relationships due to passenger trains and freight trains sep- arately. This is achieved by analysing the individual vibration signals and separating them based on signal properties that are shown to be significantly different for passenger and freight trains. Initial estimates of exposure response relationships are then constructed using ordinal probit modelling. Initial exposure response-relationships developed using data categorised by the algorithm are pre- sented and the relative success of this method is discussed. The implications of these findings for the potential expansion of <b>freight</b> traffic <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> are discussed.

When it opened in November 1919, the village had 6 stores, a grist mill, several potato {{shipping}} operations {{and was one of the}} busiest points for <b>freight</b> <b>on</b> the CPR <b>rail</b> lines in Carleton County. The high hopes for success at Debec however were never fully realized. By 1922 the Manager was reporting that [...] "Low prices of farm produce and losses last season in potatoes are the chief causes of the large reduction in current account and savings balances. Farmers were obliged to borrow much more heavily this year than last." [...] Another factor contributing to the poor showing of the branch was the competition from banks in Houlton, where interest rates of 4% were offered on deposits (compared with 3% offered by The Bank of Nova Scotia). Farmers of the area were depositing their money in Houlton banks and doing all their regular shopping there as well." [...] The bank branch was closed in May 1925 and accounts were transferred to the Woodstock Branch. The great depression and tougher times still were just ahead.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for <b>freight</b> volume <b>on</b> <b>rail</b> and road, traffic has {{increased}} significantly in the past years leading to {{an increasing number of}} heavy vehicles in the traffic flows and greater exploitation of their loading capacities. Because of environmental considerations there is also a tendency to further enhance the admissible loads in the design of new heavy vehicles (e. g. by increasing axle loads or using road trains). This all may affect the safety, serviceability and durability of existing bridges. Bridge authorities are therefore interested in agreed methods to assess the safety and durability of existing bridges and to make appropriate provisions for more refined maintenance methods, possible restriction of traffic, bridge-rehabilitation or substitution of old bridges by new ones where necessary. For steel bridges including the old riveted ones there are numerous approaches to such assessments, partly standardized by national codes or recommendations. In the light of the development of the European single market for construction works and engineering services there is thus a need to harmonize them and to develop agreed European technical recommendations for the safety and durability assessment of existing structures. These recommendations should follow the principles and application rules in the Eurocodes and provide a scheme with different levels of analysis: a basic level with general methods and further levels with higher sophistication that call for specific expertise.

The focus is on gaining a deeper understanding of opportunities for reducing GHGs, and particularly on the shift of freight from road to rail. Transport of processed food along the Cape Town-Gauteng corridor is used as a case study. Decision makers considered include the freight owners and those responsible for decisions around the vehicle fleet. In the model, decision makers respond to a number of aspects of system performance, including cost, system reliability and taxes. These aspects inform their decision to shift <b>freight</b> <b>on</b> or off <b>rail,</b> or to invest in efficiency interventions. Decisions made in one year impact on overall system performance, which may change a decision maker?s actions in the following year.
