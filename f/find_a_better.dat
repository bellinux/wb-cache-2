5|$|Chamakh {{was born}} in Tonneins, a small town near the Garonne River, to Moroccan parents, and {{was raised in the}} nearby commune of Aiguillon. His father, El Mostafa Chamakh, was a former footballer in Morocco and played for club Difaâ Aïn Sbaâ in Casablanca. In 1979, he left Morocco to locate more {{favorable}} living conditions and to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job. After settling in France and finding work as a stonemason, the elder Chamakh brought his family over soon after. Chamakh's younger brother Yassin owns a café. Chamakh has stated that when he goes back home, he often waits tables to help out his brother.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E

5|$|In 1872, Children of Israel {{purchased}} land on Adams Avenue, {{with the}} intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets. By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today $). The Byzantine Revival structure had an impressive façade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a Star of David. The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free. That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.|$|E
5|$|Williams, a 29-year-old Liverpool {{businessman}} and promoter, had sent his leading group, Derry and the Seniors (later known as Howie Casey and the Seniors) to Hamburg, {{where they were}} enjoying success, and wanted to send an additional group. He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams' offer down, as did Gerry and the Pacemakers. Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960, after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool, and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings. He booked them into Bruno Koschmider's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960, but {{said that he was}} not impressed with them as a musical group, and hoped to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> act to follow them.|$|E

25|$|The {{scarcity}} of Indian {{women in the}} Caribbean {{may not have been}} completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many Coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.|$|E
25|$|Despite the low {{production}} rate, Mitchell Energy owner George P. Mitchell {{was convinced}} that he could <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> way to produce gas from the Barnett. Mitchell persevered for years {{in the face of}} low production rates in his initial wells, low gas prices, and low profitability. Industry commentators have written that few, if any, other companies would have continued drilling well after well in the Barnett Shale. Mitchell is widely credited with personally making a success of the Barnett Shale, and thus creating the gas production boom in the Barnett, and, when other companies imitated his techniques, many other shale-gas and tight-oil successes in the US and other countries.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates best-price clauses as a {{strategic}} devise to facilitate collusion in a dynamic duopoly game. Best-price clauses guarantee rebates on the purchase price if <b>a</b> customer <b>finds</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> price after his purchase. Two different price clauses are distinguished: "most favored customer" and "meet or release. " I examine the collusive potential of both clauses in a finite-horizon duopoly model with homogeneous durable goods. In each period, new consumers enter the market. I show that in this context, meet-or-release clauses have a greater anticompetitive potential than most-favored-customer clauses. ...|$|R

An Irish Boundary Commission was set up to redraw the border between the new Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, but it remained unchanged in return for financial concessions, and the British and Irish governments agreed to suppress its report. The Council of Ireland never functioned as hoped (as an embryonic all-Ireland parliament), as the new governments decided to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> mechanism in January 1922.|$|E
25|$|All of Alger's novels {{have similar}} plots: a boy struggles to escape poverty through {{hard work and}} clean living. However, {{it is not always}} the hard work and clean living that rescue the boy from his situation, but rather a wealthy older gentleman, who admires the boy as a result of some {{extraordinary}} act of bravery or honesty that the boy has performed. For example, the boy rescues a child from an overturned carriage or finds and returns the man's stolen watch. Often the older man takes the boy into his home as a ward or companion and helps him <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job, sometimes replacing a less honest or less industrious boy.|$|E
25|$|Unger turns this {{question}} {{from one of}} general principles {{to one of the}} enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> one or fail at self-affirmation. The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.|$|E

25|$|The fearful stayed home. The actual {{migrants}} looked beyond {{fears of}} the unknown. Their chief motivation to move west was to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> economic life than the one they had. Farmers sought larger, cheaper and more fertile land; merchants and tradesman sought new customers and new leadership opportunities. Laborers wanted higher paying work and better conditions. As settlers move West, they have to face many challenges along the way, such as the lack of wood for housing, bad weather like blizzards and droughts, and tornadoes that rain down snakes, fish and frogs, {{as well as the}} occasional range disputes. Homesteaders have to build their homes with sod, which were called as Sod Houses. One of the greatest plague that hit the homesteaders was the 1874 Locust Plague which devastated the Great Plains. These challenges hardened these settlers in taming the frontier.|$|E
25|$|In early wine history, the amphora was {{the vessel}} {{of choice for}} the storage and {{transportation}} of wine. Due to the perishable nature of wood material {{it is difficult to}} trace the usage of barrels in history. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that ancient Mesopotamians used barrels made of palm wood to transport wine along the Euphrates. Palm is a difficult material to bend and fashion into barrels, however, and wine merchants in different regions experimented with different wood styles to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> wood source. The use of oak has been prevalent in winemaking for at least two millennia, first coming into widespread use {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire. In time, winemakers discovered that beyond just storage convenience, wine kept in oak barrels took on properties that improved it by making it softer and, in some cases, better-tasting. Robert Mondavi is credited with expanding the knowledge of winemakers in the United States about the different types of oak and barrel styles through his experiments in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
