In 1983 a Special General Meeting was held where it was decided that membership would be open to the community at large thus becoming a community based credit union rather than an industrial credit union. Subsequently, five branches were opened at Toukley, Toronto, Morisset, Swansea and Wyong.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the {{assessment}} of Electronic Communication (<b>ElCom)</b> requires the modelisation of the disinct communication processes that may occur between individuals and organisations. With this purpose, some theoretical references are first explored for the possible modelisation of communication, and in particular: studies of knowledge transfer between individuals and organisations; theories of communication based on linguistic research; and recent organisation studies of communication processes. Some key elements are drawn from those different fields in oder to build an assessment framework for <b>ElCom</b> technologies.

The low-lying Kenyan coast is vulnerable to these hazards, therefore modeling their eff ects is necessary for understanding their socio-economic impacts. A Decision Support Tool (DST) was developed to study the hydrodynamics along the Kenyan coast. The bathymetry grid for the DST was created using Arc View GIS from nau cal charts. MIKE 21 Hydrodynamic Module (HD) Demo version was used to organize the bathymetry and enforce boundary condi ons for <b>ELCOM</b> simula on.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the process of inter-organizational {{knowledge}} transfer and on the potential of Electronic Communication systems (<b>ElCom).</b> First, the different forms of knowledge exchanged by firms are classified. Then, different models are proposed of inter-organizational communication, in order to describe each particular kind of knowledge transfer process. As a result, it is argued that, although today various <b>ElCom</b> applications are available, a universal communication tool is far from being available, so that different applications may be necessary for any specific communication need of the users. In particular, since the most critical challenge is represented by tacit communication, it is discussed that the development of <b>ElCom</b> systems for such kind of communication depends on the availability {{of a wide range of}} tools for carrying a large variety of contents. At the same time, any effective solution requires customizing in accordance with the specific needs...|$|E

40|$|Studying and {{understanding}} the hydro-environmental characteristics of the Arabian Gulf has received growing interest {{over the past few}} decades. This is mainly attributed to the strategic importance of the area, since it has been utilised to transport most of the oil production from the Gulf states. Over the last five decades, rapid industrial coastal development also has taken place around the Gulf. Development has brought desalination, power and petroleum refining plants. Coastal developments and industrial and domestic sewage discharges have contributed to the total nutrient levels in the Gulf, which have enhanced unwanted algal growth in various coastal areas. More recently, climate change has brought flooding to the Gulf states and frequent dust storms, which have increased various environmental issues, such as sediment transport and nutrient sorption processes, also in the shallow regions of the Gulf. In the current study the geographic dispersion of numerical tracers and flushing characteristics, in terms of residence time, of the Gulf have been investigated. The study has revealed that dispersion of numerical tracers is chiefly controlled by tides in the Gulf, while winds had limited effects. The residence time in the Gulf was predicted to be almost 3 years using <b>ELCOM.</b> Kuwait Bay was also investigated in terms of the governing hydrodynamics using <b>ELCOM.</b> Similar to the Gulf, the study revealed that the Bay was chiefly driven by tides {{and to a lesser extent}} by winds. Detailed studies of temperature, using the same model, showed that temperatures varied seasonally in the Bay. In terms of salinity, investigations have shown that the Shatt Al Arab has an apparent effect on the Bay's salinity, particularly in the northern areas. The maximum residence time of the Bay was calculated to be 57 days near al Jahra using <b>ELCOM.</b> The main model refinements were conducted on including the phosphorus source terms in TRIVAST, based on experimental investigations in a hydraulics flume channel. The refinements included the addition of new source terms accounting for the adsorption of phosphorus to suspended sediments and bed sediments. Model investigations have shown that the model refinements improved the model predictions of phosphorus levels, with phosphorus being the limiting nutrient during high suspended sediment events in Kuwait Bay. In general, good water quality predictions in Kuwait Bay were achieved using both ELCOM-CAEDYM and TRIVAST. Predictions have shown that the Shatt Al-Arab waterway has significant effects of the water quality of the Bay. Better hydrodynamic predictions were achieved using <b>ELCOM</b> than TRIVAST for the Gulf and the Bay. This was due to the additional mathematical terms included in <b>ELCOM,</b> including, in particular, the terms representing tidal forces that were calculated from the gravitational potential.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report {{is the basis for}} a portion of the author?s dissertation research. On a grand scheme, this research will enhance the effectiveness of hydrodynamic modeling and data development for Texas waterbodies, as well as for TMDL modeling in the United States. As of yet, this work is unfunded, which allows the author great flexibility in his choice of subject, project, and timeframe. However, the search for funding is far reaching and constant. The results {{presented in}} this report will likely {{serve as the basis for}} future funding proposals. The purpose of this project was ultimately to develop a hydrodynamic model of Corpus Christi Bay along the Gulf Coast of Texas. Field data has shown that seasonal hypoxia occurs near the benthic environment within the southern section of the bay near the interface with Laguna Madre. Previous modeling studies have not identified the causes of this hypoxia. However, the previous modeling attempts were 2 D in nature and used simplified inputs and boundary conditions. A sophisticated 3 D model incorporating a wide range of environmental variables will likely reveal those factors leading to the hypoxia. In order to develop such a model, much environmental and spatial data needed to be collected. This data includes information on regional wind patterns, tidal data, river inflow data, and weather data. It also was necessary to develop a methodology for bathymetry data generation using the ArcView/ArcGIS software, to develop a methodology for adjusting the bathymetry to include changes, and to develop a methodology for linking the generated bathymetry into the <b>ELCOM</b> hydrodynamic model. It was also necessary to develop a methodology for displaying and processing the <b>ELCOM</b> model results in the ArcView/ArcGIS system. Such a representation will be useful in disseminating the model results in a form that will allow a greater number of users to view, manipulate, and make decisions based on this data. Finally, the robustness of the <b>ELCOM</b> model needed to be ascertained. Hydrodynamic models should produce accurate results with any set of spatially consistent input data. To test the robustness of the <b>ELCOM</b> model, model runs were to be developed with spatial input data identical in every way, except for the data orientation with respect to the model grid. A methodology for creating, comparing, and displaying results in various spatial orientations needed to be developed and tested. For this purpose, Lavaca Bay was used as the study area. Lavaca Bay contains two approximately linear features in its bathymetry that would suggest the data orientation might affect the model results. The author hoped that working on this project would provide him with insight into all aspects of the hydrodynamic modeling process. Although modeling results were not obtained, the basis for future modeling efforts was firmly developed. This project also generated ideas for other avenues of research which might be included in the author?s dissertation. These ideas are presented in the final section of this report...|$|E
