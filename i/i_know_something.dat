500|$|In November 2009, in an {{interview}} with MTV News, Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna's then-upcoming fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, [...] "the record we have is great. It's a special record, so for it not to make it, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> had to click. It's all good. I think the project's gonna be great no matter what." [...] Talking for the same publication, Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song, [...] "She's calling me up saying, 'Where are the files?' That's one thing you don't hear often from artists on her level." [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake, while the production was done by StarGate. In {{an interview}} for HitQuarters, Hale explained that she got into the project that's to a phone call she received from Dean. She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical, while Dean and StarGate did most of the music. When asked what's the inspiration behind the song she stated, [...] "Oh love, love, love! And it’s sexy – it started as a real sexy track and then you put something sexy over it." ...|$|E
500|$|At 4:30pm Pacific Time, Nixon, Chotiner, and Rogers were {{discussing}} where {{the public should}} be told to send their responses to the speech, when a Dewey aide telephoned for Nixon. Reluctantly, suspecting {{the reason for the}} call, Chotiner brought Nixon to the phone to speak with the New York governor. Dewey told Nixon that Eisenhower's aides were unanimous that Nixon must resign, though Dewey did not agree, and that Nixon was to so state {{at the end of his}} telecast. Nixon asked what the general wanted him to do. Dewey hedged, stating that he had not spoken with the presidential candidate himself, but that the word had come from such close aides to Eisenhower that the demand had to represent the general's view. The candidate replied that it was very late for him to change his remarks; Dewey assured him he need not do so, but simply add at the end his resignation from the ticket and his insistence that Eisenhower accept it. The governor suggested he even announce his resignation from the Senate and his intent to run in the special election which would follow—the two-time losing presidential candidate was sure Nixon would be returned with a huge majority, thus vindicating him. Nixon remained silent for some time, and when Dewey asked him what he would do, the senator told him that he did not know, and if Eisenhower's aides wanted to find out, they could watch just like everyone else. Before slamming down the receiver, Nixon added, [...] "And tell them <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about politics, too!" ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> {{about this}} {{socialism}} stuff," [...] mused Mr. Wrenn, with tilted head, examining the burnt-umber {{edges of the}} sunset.|$|R
60|$|And {{the moment}} she said it <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> was going to happen. You know that pre-what-d'you-call-it you get sometimes? Well, I got it then.|$|R
2500|$|The novel [...] "allowed him to exorcise {{some of his}} demons, mostly {{centered}} on {{his relationship with his}} father, which was stormy and sometimes violent." [...] Carr will not reveal specific details of his family history, but he has said, [...] "It's safe to assume that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>something</b> about family violence...." [...] and he told New York magazine, [...] "I'm the only kid in my family who never tried to kill himself...I kind of figured somebody else {{was going to kill me}} anyway." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah {{too much}} has been imagined!" [...] she {{answered}} simply. [...] "It was only a word of warning. It was {{to tell you to}} go. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> painful was coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got brother Jarge's girl to {{look after}} me now. She'll see I don't break barracks or do what I hadn't ought to. Why, darn my skin, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> was amiss! ...|$|R

60|$|Somewhat to my anxiety it was {{afternoon}} before I {{arrived in}} town. For my life I {{could not have}} told why <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> had happened since my last visit, but I certainly felt it; and was proportionately curious and anxious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Zane, {{please tell}} me about last night. When papa came home to supper he was pale and very nervous. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> had happened. But he would not explain, which made me all the more anxious. Won't you {{please tell me}}?" ...|$|R
