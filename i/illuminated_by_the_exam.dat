40|$|We {{describe}} {{a process for}} compositing a live performance of an actor into a virtual set wherein the actor is consistently <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> virtual environment. The Light Stage used in this work is a two-meter sphere of inward-pointing RGB light emitting diodes focused on the actor, where each light can be set to an arbitrary color and intensity to replicate a real-world or virtual lighting environment. We implement a digital two-camera infrared matting system to composite the actor into the background plate of the environment without affecting the visible-spectrum illumination on the actor. The color reponse {{of the system is}} calibrated to produce correct color renditions of <b>the</b> actor as <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> environment. We demonstrate moving-camera composites of actors into real-world environments and virtual sets such that the actor is properly <b>illuminated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> environment into which they are composited...|$|R
