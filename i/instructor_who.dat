5|$|Beginning in 1872, Rainilaiarivony {{worked to}} {{modernize}} the army {{with the assistance of}} a British military <b>instructor,</b> <b>who</b> was hired to recruit, train and manage its soldiers. Rainilaiarivony purchased new local and imported firearms, reintroduced regular exercises and reorganized the ranking system. He prohibited the purchasing of rank promotions or exemptions from military service and instituted free medical care for soldiers in 1876. The following year Rainilaiarivony introduced the mandatory conscription of 5,000 Malagasy from each of the island's six provinces to serve five years in the royal army, swelling its ranks to over 30,000 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Underwater diver {{training}} is normally {{given by a}} qualified <b>instructor</b> <b>who</b> {{is a member of}} one of many diver training agencies or is registered with a government agency.

5|$|Ramona Ramirez is {{introduced}} the Marsdens' Spanish nanny, originally a minor character that {{was intended to}} only be in the programme for only 2 episodes believing that the Mardens' would regularly replace their son's carer. She subsequently became a series regular and an important supporting character and friend to the main 6 characters eventually appearing in all 5 series of Cold Feet's original run and appeared in nearly every episode. Ramona was developed to be the complete opposite of the typically English Karen and David. David finds her continental personality annoying but Karen enjoys it. Ramona's role in Series 2 developed beyond just child-caring—in Episode 2, she bribes David for £30 to cook dinner for his former boss. By Series 3, she has a major storyline where she dates Pete. In Series 4, she gets caught up in Karen and David's deteriorating marriage and briefly quits to work for their neighbours, and to work part-time at a strip club. In Series 5, she dates Lee, a fitness <b>instructor</b> <b>who</b> is the catalyst of Pete and Jo's break-up when he sleeps with Jo.|$|E
30|$|We studied {{undergraduate}} biology <b>instructors</b> <b>who</b> taught large (50 + students) biology {{courses and}} who described using active-learning instruction.

Capturing this variation is important to determine if the components of pedagogical knowledge are common across college biology instructors, or whether there is variation in pedagogical knowledge.|$|R

5|$|Rico's {{choice is}} taken poorly by his parents, and he leaves {{with a sense}} of estrangement. He is {{assigned}} to the Mobile Infantry, and moves to Camp Arthur Currie (named for Arthur Currie who rose through the ranks to General in WWI) on the Canadian prairie for his training under Sergeant Charles Zim. The training is extremely demanding. Rico receives combat training of all types, including simulated fights in armored suits. A fellow recruit is court-martialled, flogged, and dismissed for striking a drill <b>instructor</b> <b>who</b> was also his company commander. Jean V. Dubois, who taught Rico's History and Moral Philosophy in school, sends Rico a letter, revealing that he is a Mobile Infantry veteran himself. The letter helps Rico stay motivated enough not to resign. Rico himself is given five lashes for firing a rocket during a drill with armored suits and simulated nuclear weapons without checking to see that no friendlies were within the blast zone, which in combat would have resulted in the death of a fellow soldier. Another recruit, who murdered a baby girl after deserting the army, is hanged by his battalion after his arrest by civilian police. Eventually, after further training at another camp near Vancouver, Rico graduates with 187 others, of the 2009 who had begun training in that regiment.|$|E
