5|$|Hardy, {{along with}} his brother Jeff and friends, started their own federation, the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Shortly after Hardy sent in a tape for the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) Amateur Challenge using the ring name <b>High</b> <b>Voltage,</b> a tag team named <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> began {{competing}} in WCW, causing Hardy to change his name to Surge. A few years later, it was revealed to him by Chris Kanyon that the tape had been kept in the WCW Power Plant, watched multiple times, and that the name <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> was blatantly stolen from it. Beginning in 1994, The Hardys wrestled for several North Carolina-based independent circuit promotions and adapted a number of alter-egos. As The Wolverine, Hardy captured the New England Wrestling Alliance (NEWA) Championship in May 1994. As <b>High</b> <b>Voltage,</b> he teamed with Venom to claim the New Frontier Wrestling Association (NFWA) Tag Team Championship in March 1995. A month later, <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> defeated the Willow for the NFWA Championship.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{conceived}} by <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> founder Kerry J. Ganofsky, creative expertise from The Lego Group assisted <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> in the game's development after Lego Media agreed to begin production. It received {{a mix of}} high and low scoring reviews from critics, who were divided on the game's graphics, construction system, driving gameplay and other design aspects. Two sequels developed by Attention to Detail, called Lego Racers 2 and Drome Racers, were released in 2001 and 2002, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|... very <b>high</b> <b>voltages</b> — {{adapters}} {{are available}} which form a voltage divider with the meter's internal resistance, allowing measurement into {{the thousands of}} volts. [...] However, very <b>high</b> <b>voltages</b> often have surprising behavior, aside from effects on the operator (perhaps fatal); <b>high</b> <b>voltages</b> which actually reach a meter's internal circuitry may internal damage parts, perhaps destroying the meter or permanently ruining its performance.|$|R
50|$|Most {{commutator}} motors {{are limited}} to about 1,500 volts because <b>higher</b> <b>voltages</b> {{give rise to a}} risk of arcing across the commutator. Repulsion motors can be used at <b>higher</b> <b>voltages</b> because the rotor circuit is not electrically connected to the supply.|$|R
5|$|The {{concept for}} Lego Racers was {{initially}} created by <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> Software founder Kerry J. Ganofsky, {{with the idea}} of players being able to build and race cars created with Lego bricks. After a year of development, Lego Media began production of the game, hiring Ganofsky's company to develop it. Lego Media and other facilities within The Lego Group collaborated with <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> Software during the production of the game.|$|E
5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (usually 34.5 kV) {{power collection system}} and communications network.

5|$|Saints Row IV was {{released}} in several summative editions. The Game of the Century edition included 20 downloadable content sets and {{was released}} May 9, 2014. The National Treasure Edition included 29 downloadable content sets and was released on July 8, 2014. <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> Software ported the game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One {{with all of its}} downloadable content as Saints Row IV: Re-Elected. It was announced in late August 2014 alongside , a standalone Saints Row IV expansion developed by Volition in conjunction with <b>High</b> <b>Voltage.</b> Both were released in North America on January 20, 2015, and worldwide three days later, both separately and bundled together. The release included new features such as voice commands. A Linux port was presented in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current is achieved, can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an insulating material).|$|E
5|$|Hydro-Québec's {{electricity}} transmission system {{is an international}} power transmission system centred in Quebec, Canada. The system pioneered the use of very <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> 735kV alternating current (AC) power lines that link the population centers of Montreal and Quebec City to distant hydroelectric power stations like the Daniel-Johnson Dam and the James Bay Project in northwestern Quebec and the Churchill Falls Generating Station in Labrador.|$|E

5000|$|Voltage {{is defined}} so that {{negatively}} charged objects are pulled towards <b>higher</b> <b>voltages,</b> while positively charged objects are pulled towards lower voltages. Therefore, the conventional current in a wire or resistor always flows from <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> to lower voltage. Current can flow from lower <b>voltage</b> to <b>higher</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{but only when}} a source of energy is present to [...] "push" [...] it against the opposing electric field. This is the case within any electric power source. For example, inside a battery, chemical reactions provide the energy needed for ion current to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.|$|R
5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} {{the forerunner of}} the electric clock, the electrostatic clock. It was powered with dry piles, a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> battery with extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with the weather. He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable {{across a range of}} meteorological conditions.|$|E
5|$|In a wind farm, {{individual}} turbines are interconnected with {{a medium}} voltage (often 34.5 kV), {{power collection system}} and communications network. In general, a distance of 7D (7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm. At a substation, this medium-voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> electric power transmission system.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is used in}} <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> {{power cables}} as {{sheathing}} material to prevent water diffusion into insulation; this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out.

5|$|Lego Racers is a Lego-themed racing {{video game}} {{developed}} by <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> Software {{and published by}} Lego Media. The game was initially released on July 31, 1999, for Microsoft Windows, and was later released on October 12, 1999, for the Nintendo 64, on December 17, 1999, for the PlayStation and on December 29, 2000, for the Game Boy Color.|$|E
5|$|Most Solar {{parks are}} ground mounted PV systems, {{also known as}} {{free-field}} solar power plants. They can either be fixed tilt or use a single axis or dual axis solar tracker. While tracking improves the overall performance, it also increases the system's installation and maintenance cost. A solar inverter converts the array's power output from DC to AC, and connection to the utility grid is made through a <b>high</b> <b>voltage,</b> three phase step up transformer of typically 10kV and above.|$|E
5|$|The Hammond organ's {{technology}} {{derives from}} the Telharmonium, an instrument created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill. The telharmonium used revolving electric alternators which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires. The instrument was bulky, because the alternators had to {{be large enough to}} generate <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> for a loud enough signal. The Hammond organ solved this problem by using an amplifier.|$|E
50|$|Modern stepper {{controllers}} {{drive the}} motor with much <b>higher</b> <b>voltages</b> than the motor nameplate rated voltage, and limit current through chopping. The usual setup {{is to have}} a positioning controller, known as an indexer, sending step and direction pulses to a separate <b>higher</b> <b>voltage</b> drive circuit which is responsible for commutation and current limiting.|$|R
5000|$|A weatherhead {{termination}} is {{only used}} at low voltages (up to 600 volts), since <b>higher</b> distribution <b>voltages</b> require more insulation between conductors and metal enclosures. <b>Higher</b> <b>voltage</b> connections are made through a pothead.|$|R
50|$|The upper laser {{level is}} excited {{efficiently}} by electrons {{with more than}} 11 eV, best energy is 15 eV. The electron temperature in the streamers only reaches 0.7 eV. Helium due to its higher ionisation energy and lack of vibrational excitations increases the temperature to 2.2 eV. <b>Higher</b> <b>voltages</b> increase the temperature. <b>Higher</b> <b>voltages</b> mean shorter pulses.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the high-voltage batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> systems.|$|E
5|$|They {{sold over}} 1.3million CDs in the US during 2007 despite not having {{released}} {{a new album}} since 2000 at that point. Additionally, the group's commercial success continues to flourish despite their choice to refrain from selling albums in digital online formats for many years. However, in November 2012, the entire catalogue (excluding the TNT album and the Australian versions of the <b>High</b> <b>Voltage,</b> Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap and Let There Be Rock albums) became available on the iTunes Store.|$|E
5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, <b>High</b> <b>Voltage,</b> in 1975. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist Mark Evans {{was replaced by}} Cliff Williams in 1977 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.|$|E
