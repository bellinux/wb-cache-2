50|$|There are {{two common}} types of {{large-scale}} pellet mills: flat <b>die</b> mills and <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is {{introduced to the}} top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the <b>die.</b> In the <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R

40|$|Vaporization {{of liquid}} {{droplets}} containing particles {{has been studied}} extensively for its applications in combustion, thermal coating, ink-jet printing, spray cooling, drug delivery, and surface patterning. Droplets containing solid particles show a preferential solute-migration during drying process. Recently we carried out experiments with vaporizing droplet suspended in an acoustic levitator. In this work, we present detailed study of a laser irradiated droplet containing nanosilica particles. Infrared and High speed imaging of the heating process for different concentrations of nanosilica revealed an interesting solute migration pattern. Further investigation with Particle Image Velocimetry shows presence of strong recirculation within the levitated droplet. It also reveals that with increasing viscosity of the liquid {{the strength of this}} recirculation decreases. Due to the droplets rotation about the levitator axis, a centrifugal force also dominated the flow field within the droplet. High speed imaging shows that initial stage of heating is dominated by sharper diameter reduction. At the end of this stage the droplet takes a bowl shape. Next stage, which is termed as structure formation shows different characteristics for higher and lower concentrations. For nanosilica concentration of less than 1. 3 %, the bowl shape remains unaltered with further heating. On the other hand, for concentration greater than 1. 9 %, due to stronger centrifugal effect than recirculation, the particles migrate towards the equator plane creating <b>horizontal</b> <b>ring</b> structure. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>ring</b> very soon starts oscillating about the levitator axis. This creates an imbalance of forces resulting in reorientation of the ring. Thus a vertical ring is created...|$|R

Two different moulding dies were used: one with a circular hole with the diameter of 3 mm and one with a ring hole with the inner diameter of 5 mm. During the extrusion process, the temperature of the cylinder ranged from 80 to 130 °C and the screw speeds applied were: 100 and 130 rpm. For the application of the <b>ring</b> <b>die,</b> it was observed that regardless of the speed of the screw, the use of the raw material of higher moisture content led to the production of materials with higher solubility. As a result, the obtained materials revealed solubility at a level of 40 %.

A statistical analysis showed a significant impact of moisture of the raw material on the WSI of starch foams used irrespective of the other parameters of the extrusion-cooking process.
