40|$|Asexual organisms, often {{perceived}} as evolutionary dead ends, can be long-lived and geographically widespread. We propose that epigenetic mechanisms {{could play a}} crucial role in the evolutionary persistence of these lineages. Genetically identical organisms could rely on phenotypic plasticity to face environmental variation. Epigenetic modifications could be the molecular mechanism enabling such phenotypic plasticity; they can be influenced by the environment and act at shorter timescales than mutation. Recent work on the asexual vertebrate Chrosomus eos-neogaeus (Pisces: Cyprinidae) provides broad insights into the contribution of epigenetics in genetically identical individuals. We discuss the extension of these results to other asexual organisms, in particular those resulting from <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations.</b> We finally develop on the evolutionary relevance of epigenetic variation in the context of heritability...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{introgression}} usually {{results from}} spontaneous hybridization among closely related exotic and native species, {{and thus can}} significantly impact the genetic structure of native species, especially on endangered species. It is believed that no interspecies reproductive barriers exist within Liriodendron spp. Theendangered status of Liriodendron chinense in China {{is compounded by the}} potential risk of <b>interspecific</b> introgressive <b>hybridization</b> resulting from the frequent introduction of L. tulipifera and by the extensive planting of hybrid Liriodendron within the past decade. Here, we report a possible trend of <b>interspecific</b> introgressive <b>hybridization</b> in the genus Liriodendron. We sampled five mixture plantations with L. chinense, L. tulipifera, and hybrid Liriodendron from southeastern China. In each plantation, 19 – 130 adults and 60 – 117 naturally regenerated seedlings or open-pollinated progeny were sampled. The mating pattern of Liriodendron was examined using parentage analysis based on 11 EST-SSR loci, and the extent of introgressive hybridization was estimated in terms of an introgression coefficient derived from parentage-offspring regressioncoefficients of allele frequencies. We found evidence of <b>interspecific</b> introgressive <b>hybridization</b> in all five plantations of Liriodendron, although the orientation and extent of gene introgression differed among plantations. Furthermore, for any species, we found that the extent of gene introgression was positively related to its population size.

50|$|The drive {{behind the}} {{production}} of new Leucadendron cultivars is {{the production of}} a constant supply of new and improvedd quality products that are available initially from South Africa only. The Leucadendron genus is common amongst consumers due to its colourful bracts and long lasting vase life. Leucadendron hybrids are produced through <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization.</b> Crosses made within the same subsection are generally more viable in the hybridization of Leucadendrons with the quantity of seed set relative to the taxonomic relatedness of the species. Intersectional hybridization produces hybrids that show a unique set of characteristics which are favoured by consumers. One example of a hybrid produced by two Leucadendron genera is the cultivar Rosette, a hybrid between L. laureolum and L. elimense. This interspecific hybrid is however completely sterile due to autopolyploidy and thus have no use in further cultivation. The main aim of <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> is to produce large quantities of progeny seed from the best interspecific hybrid parents.|$|E

This work presents considerations on genetic variability in elephant grass germplasm and the main methodologies used to assess this variability.

40|$|<b>Interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> {{have been}} made between {{herbaceous}} and climbing species of Clematis to obtain compact plants with big flowers. After achenes harvesting, embryos have been extracted and cultivated in vitro. This cultural method improves clearly the germination rate (+ 50 %). Certain zygotic embryos give callus from which embryonic structures like somatic embryos appear. To confirm this, histological preparations of somatic and zygotic embryos {{have been made}}. The two types of embryos were embedded in technovit 7100 resin and prepared for microscopical observations as described by Chevalier et al. (1994). The so called embryonic structures have been confirmed as being somatic embryos. Cells and nucleus measurements {{in different parts of}} these two types of embryos indicate differences in cellular activity. Obtaining several somatic embryos from one zygotic embryo is interesting for the breeder since they may be a source of increased variability. This must be confirmed through the field observation of those plants. This opportunity might be also used as a facility for the development of mutagenesis...|$|R
40|$|Chromosome {{number and}} meiotic {{behavior}} were evaluated in 36 Brazilian accessions {{of the grass}} Paspalum (which had never previously been analyzed) to determinate which accessions might be useful in <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations.</b> The analysis showed that one accession of Paspalum coryphaeum was diploid (2 n = 2 x = 20) and one accession of Paspalum conspersum hexaploid (2 n = 6 x = 60), the remaining 34 accessions being tetraploid (2 n = 4 x = 40). The pairing configuration was typical for the ploidy level i. e. in the diploid, chromosomes paired as 10 bivalents, in tetraploids as bi-, tri- and quadrivalents, and in hexaploid as 30 bivalents. A low frequency of meiotic abnormalities (less than 10 %) was observed in the diploid, hexaploid and some tetraploid accessions, {{although the majority of}} tetraploid accessions showed a high frequency of meiotic irregularities.

50|$|However, {{reproducing}} {{or other}} self-maintaining, population-forming species known or suspected {{to be of}} hybrid origin are ranked using the same methodology and notation as for other species. For example, many fertile polyploid species of ferns formed by <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> followed by chromosome doubling. Some of these hybrid-derived species are quite rare (ranked G1), but others are so widespread, abundant, and secure as to deserve a G5 rank.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} among all the Pachyrhizus species. The traits of the Andean bean, of most interest are tuber quality, growth habit, and early maturity.

Nevertheless, negative secondary effects, such as reduced seed set and reduced germination rates, have been observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{hybridization}} {{of these}} species prevents healthy males from forming whereas males do exist in both parent species (see Sexual differentiation). Parthenogenesis allows the resulting all-female population to reproduce and thus evolve into a unique species capable of reproduction.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} outcomes of <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> in Drosophila is hybrid male sterility. Genetic dissection of this reproductive barrier has revealed {{that the number of}} responsible factors is very high and that these factors are frequently engaged in complex epistatic interactions. Traditionally, research strategies have been based on contrasting introgressions of chromosome segments that produce male sterility with those that allow fertility. Few studies have investigated the phenotypes associated with the boundary between fertility and sterility. In this study, we cointrogressed three different X chromosome segments from Drosophila mauritiana into D. simulans. Hybrid males with these three segments are usually fertile, by conventional fertility assays. However, their spermatogenesis shows a significant slowdown, most manifest at lower temperatures. Each of the three introgressed segments retards the arrival of sperm to the seminal vesicles. Other small disturbances in spermatogenesis are evident, which altogether lead to an overall reduction in the amount of motile sperm in their seminal vesicles. These results suggest that a delay in the timing of spermatogenesis, which might be brought about by the cumulative action of many different factors of minor segment, may be the primary cause of hybrid male sterility...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{is aimed at}} understanding mechanisms of Phaseolus embryogenesis. Indeed, <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> between the recurrent species, P. vulgaris, and the two donor species, P. coccineus and P. polyanthus, reveal incompatibility barriers, particularly when the donor parents are used as female, a condition favouring the introgression of desired genes in the breeding process. Crosses between P. vulgaris, as paternal genotype, and the two other species lead to abortion of immature embryos, usually at the globular or early heart-shaped developmental stages, with most embryos aborting 3 - 6 days after pollination. Causes of early embryo abortion in several reciprocal interspecific crosses were studied through histological examinations. When the donor parent (P. coccineus or P. polyanthus) is used as female, early nutritional barriers are related to a deficient endosperm or suspensor development, while in reciprocal crosses, endothelium proliferation and, in some extent, hypertrophy of the vascular elements might {{be the cause of}} early embryo abortion. (Baudoin et al, 1992; Lecomte, 1997; Geerts, 2001). Our specific objective is to identify genes involved in embryogenesis and whose disruption can cause the degeneration of interspecific embryos.

50|$|Taxonomists {{differ on}} the number of Hosta species; there may be as many as 45. Accordingly, the list of species given here may be taken loosely. The genus may be broadly divided into three subgenera. <b>Interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> occurs since all the species have the same {{chromosome}} number (2n = 2x = 60); except H. ventricosa which is a natural tetraploid that sets seed through apomixis. Many cultivated hostas formerly described as species have been reduced to cultivars; these often have their names conserved, and retain Latin names which resemble species names (e.g., Hosta 'Fortunei').|$|E
50|$|Species of Phytophthora {{have been}} shown to have evolved by the <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> of two {{different}} species from the genus. When a species is introduced into a new environment, it causes episodic selection. The invading species is exposed to other resident taxa, and hybridization may occur to produce a new species. If these hybrids are successful, they may outcompete their parent species. Thus, P, ramorum is possibly a hybrid between two species. Its unique morphology does support this. Also, three sequences studied to establish the phylogeny of Phytophthora: ITS, cox II and nad 5, were identical, supporting P. ramorum having recently evolved.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{belongs to}} a {{problematic}} group of orchids. D. fuchsii is very variable in flower colour and flower morphology, plant height and the scent of flowers. This {{is due to the}} ease of introgression (the transfer of genetic material from one sympatric species to another, only partially isolated from the first, through <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> and repeated backcrossing to a parental species), the ability of these plants to adapt quickly and easily to habitat and different substrates and possibly other causes. As a result, a multitude of forms have been defined for this plant. The World Checklist of Kew Gardens lists over 25 varieties, of which 7 are recognized as valid.|$|E
40|$|Blackleg, {{caused by}} Leptosphaeria maculans, {{is one of}} the most {{economically}} important diseases of Brassica napus worldwide. Two blackleg resistance genes, LepR 1 and LepR 2, from B. rapa subsp. sylvestris (BRS) were previously identified. To transfer LepR 1 and LepR 2 from BRS into B. napus, <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> were made between the two species to form allotriploids. Analysis of microsatellite markers in two BC 1 populations, WT 3 BC 1 and WT 4 BC 1, indicated that segregation fit a 1 : 1 ratio for BRS and non-BRS alleles on the A-genome linkage groups N 2 and N 10, the locations of LepR 1 and LepR 2, respectively. However, recombination frequencies in the allotriploid BC 1 populations were at least twice those in the amphidiploid. The number of C-genome chromosomes in the BC 1 plants was determined through marker analysis, which indicated averages of 5. 9 and 5. 0 per plant in the WT 3 BC 1 and WT 4 BC 1 populations, respectively.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of fortuitous pollination on <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> of the plum rootstock Myrobalan with the apricot cultivars 'Moniquí' and 'Moniquí Borde' was assessed in this work. Progeny was originated through hand pollination of emasculated flowers of three Myrobalan clones, without bagging, in 1998 and 1999. Fruit set {{was low and}} variable among years (1. 8 - 8. 0 %), but higher than the level of accidental pollination measured with emasculated and non-pollinated flowers (1. 2 %). Molecular characterization of the progeny was performed with three SSR markers showing that only 28 % of the seedlings, obtained by in vitro germination and culture of immature embryos, were hybrids. This represents a lower percentage than expected, and is explained here by the low viability of hybrid embryos and seedlings. The use of molecular markers is {{discussed in terms of}} a convenient method for an early identification of putative hybrids in breeding programs with low setting crosses, where the proportion of non-hybrids is magnified.

5000|$|The {{evolution}} of aerobic fermentation likely involved multiple successive molecular steps, {{which included the}} expansion of hexose transporter genes, copy number variation (CNV) and differential expression in metabolic genes, and regulatory reprogramming. [...] Research is still needed to fully understand the genomic basis of this complex phenomenon. Many crabtree-positive yeast species are used for their fermentation ability in industrial processes {{in the production of}} wine, beer, sake, bread, and bioethanol. [...] Through domestication, these yeast species have evolved, often through artificial selection, to better fit their environment. [...] Strains evolved through mechanisms that include <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization,</b> horizontal gene transfer (HGT), gene duplication, pseudogenization, and gene loss.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> {{barriers}} can also arise {{as a result}} of the adaptive divergence that accompanies allopatric speciation. This mechanism has been experimentally proved by an experiment carried out by Diane Dodd on D. pseudoobscura. A single population of flies was divided into two, with one of the populations fed with starch-based food and the other with maltose-based food. This meant that each sub population was adapted to each food type over a number of generations. After the populations had diverged over many generations, the groups were again mixed; it was observed that the flies would mate only with others from their adapted population. This indicates that the mechanisms of reproductive isolation can arise even though the interspecific hybrids are not selected against.|$|E

A recent study of these morphospecies (typological species) claims that previous studies had shown that body colour in these slugs {{may be influenced by}} their diet, and the genital differences were not confirmed by subsequent multivariate morphometric analyses.Analysis of alloenzyme and albumen gland proteins had given conflicting results.Also that evidence of <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridization</b> in places where these predominantly self-fertilizing slugs apparently outcross contradicted their status as biological species.

40|$|Cultivated {{sugarcane}} genotypes (Saccharum spp.) {{are derived}} from complex <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> between the species S. spontaneum and S. officinarum. To analyse this complex genome, we have investigated the potential of sugarcane microsatellite sequences as genetic markers {{in terms of their}} abundance, variability and ability to detect polymorphisms. From an enriched sugarcane genomic DNA microsatellite library, primer sets were designed and synthesized for over 200 microsatellite sequences. These were tested over five Saccharum genotypes. The number of alleles recorded per marker ranged between 2 and 12 (mean of 8). Markers that showed polymorphism had a Polymorphism Information Content (or PIC, where a value of 0 =monomorphic and 1 =highly polymorphic) value between 0. 48 and 0. 8 (mean of 0. 72). Fluorescently labelled primers for eight of these microsatellite markers were tested on a population of 20 sugarcane cultivars. Results indicated the ability of these markers to accurately fingerprint genotypes, predict relationships, be used in genetic mapping and assist in selecting specific, genetically diverse parents for use in introgression. However, these genomic DNA derived microsatellites transferred poorly to related genera. By comparison, sugarcane microsatellites derived from expressed sequence tag sequences had a low PIC level when tested within cultivars, but a significantly higher level of polymorphism when applied to progenitor and related species...|$|R
40|$|Evolutionary {{variations}} generating phenotypic adaptations and novel taxa {{resulted from}} complex cellular activities altering genome content and expression: (i) Symbiogenetic cell mergers producing the mitochondrion-bearing ancestor of eukaryotes and chloroplast-bearing ancestors of photosynthetic eukaryotes; (ii) <b>interspecific</b> <b>hybridizations</b> and genome doublings generating new species and adaptive radiations of higher plants and animals; and, (iii) interspecific horizontal DNA transfer encoding {{virtually all of}} the cellular functions between organisms and their viruses in all domains of life. Consequently, assuming that evolutionary processes occur in isolated genomes of individual species has become an unrealistic abstraction. Adaptive variations also involved natural genetic engineering of mobile DNA elements to rewire regulatory networks. In the most highly evolved organisms, biological complexity scales with “non-coding” DNA content more closely than with protein-coding capacity. Coincidentally, we have learned how so-called “non-coding” RNAs that are rich in repetitive mobile DNA sequences are key regulators of complex phenotypes. Both biotic and abiotic ecological challenges serve as triggers for episodes of elevated genome change. The intersections of cell activities, biosphere interactions, horizontal DNA transfers, and non-random Read-Write genome modifications by natural genetic engineering provide a rich molecular and biological foundation for understanding how ecological disruptions can stimulate productive, often abrupt, evolutionary transformations...|$|R

Copulation {{was observed in}} all crosses between Caenorhabditis species; however, none resulted in the generation of stable hybrid populations. No copulation was observed in crosses between Caenorhabditis males and Rhabditis or Pelodera females, even when congeneric females were present, suggesting that Caenorhabditis males are able to selectively recognize congeneric females by a short-range stimulus. All pairwise combinations of Caenorhabditis species were isolated to some degree by gametic mechanisms; 7 of 12 combinations were cross infertile and 5 of 12 were cross-fertile but had low brood sizes. In cross-fertile combinations, most hybrid embryos were inviable and arrested prior to gastrulation. Only in crosses of C. briggsae males to C. sp. v females did any hybrids survive embryogenesis. Most of these C. briggsae/C. sp. v hybrids arrested during larval development, and the few that reached adulthood invariably were female.
