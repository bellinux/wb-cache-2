5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup <b>deadlines</b> for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed <b>deadlines</b> and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E
5|$|On June 12, 2015, Chief U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. {{approved}} and signed the consent decree. The {{signing of the}} agreement starts the clock for numerous <b>deadlines</b> that must be met {{in an effort to}} improve the department's handling of use-of-force incidents.|$|E

50|$|<b>Deadline</b> is {{a special}} case of batch. A <b>deadline</b> run looks {{just like any other}} batch run except that a <b>deadline</b> time is {{specified}} on the @RUN or @START control statement. The <b>deadline</b> time is used in conjunction with the maximum SUPS (time estimate) on the control statement. A <b>deadline</b> job runs at normal batch priorities unless or until it appears that it could miss its <b>deadline</b> time. Then the more the mismatch between time until the <b>deadline</b> and remaining SUPS, the higher the priority. While <b>deadline</b> can’t totally shut off transactions and has no effect on real time, it can effectively shut off most other processing in the system if necessary to achieve its goal.|$|R

5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting <b>deadlines,</b> while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|On 1 May 2012 a 30,000 euro funding {{campaign}} was started to finance additional development projects. On {{the end of}} the year approximately 50% of the funding goal was achieved and it was decided to continue the funding campaign without <b>deadlines.</b> The money went to ReactOS Deutschland e.V.. As the tax law in Germany for this form of a registered voluntary association (Eingetragener Verein) makes it problematic to pay developers directly, indirect possibilities like stipends were evaluated.|$|E
5|$|After {{reading an}} issue of the Tank Girl comic she had {{received}} as a gift, Talalay obtained permission from <b>Deadlines</b> publisher Tom Astor to direct a film adaptation. She selected Catherine Hardwicke to be the production designer, and worked closely with Martin and Hewlett during {{the making of the}} film. Tank Girl was filmed primarily in White Sands, New Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona. The film's critically praised soundtrack was assembled by Courtney Love, and the Rippers' makeup and prosthetics team was headed by Stan Winston. Winston's studio wanted to work on the project so much that they cut their usual prices in half {{in order to meet the}} film's budget.|$|E

50|$|The {{main goal}} of the <b>Deadline</b> {{scheduler}} is to guarantee a start service time for a request. It does so by imposing a <b>deadline</b> on all I/O operations to prevent starvation of requests. It also maintains two <b>deadline</b> queues, {{in addition to the}} sorted queues (both read and write). <b>Deadline</b> queues are basically sorted by their <b>deadline</b> (the expiration time), while the sorted queues are sorted by the sector number.|$|R
50|$|Next, Hahn {{produced}} and directed <b>Deadline,</b> starring Steve Talley and Academy Award nominee Eric Roberts. <b>Deadline</b> {{is adapted from}} Mark Ethridge's novel Grievances. Filming took place in middle Tennessee in January and February 2011. <b>Deadline</b> was released in theaters nationwide in 2012 beginning with its world premiere in Nashville on February 15. <b>Deadline</b> was released domestically on DVD and Video on Demand on July 17, 2012. Foreign distribution is handled by Curb Entertainment, which is releasing <b>Deadline</b> worldwide.|$|R
5|$|Image {{provided}} David Brothers {{to serve}} as the series' editor. Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing <b>deadlines,</b> Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark wanted to work with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E
5|$|Jane's Attack Squadron {{was first}} {{conceived}} by Looking Glass employee Seamus Blackley as Flight Combat, a combat-based sequel to Flight Unlimited. The company continued designing the game after Blackley {{was fired in}} 1995, and it entered production under Electronic Arts in 1998. The team experienced problems with <b>deadlines</b> and funding during development, with the game eventually being heavily redesigned and renamed Jane's Attack Squadron {{at the request of}} the publisher. These issues contributed to Looking Glass's bankruptcy and closure in 2000. In 2001 and 2002, the game was acquired and finished by Mad Doc Software, a company in part composed of former Looking Glass employees.|$|E
5|$|Polikarpov {{was arrested}} and imprisoned by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of {{industrial}} sabotage when neither the I-6 nor the I-5 projects met their stipulated <b>deadlines,</b> and this delayed the first flight of the I-6 until 30 March 1930. The second prototype was completed shortly thereafter and both aircraft appeared in that year's May Day fly-past over Moscow. Both aircraft likely used imported engines before they were replaced by the Soviet-built copy of the Jupiter, the Shvetsov M-22. One I-6 crashed on 13 June 1930 after the test pilot bailed out, without justification, {{in the opinion of}} the Soviet aviation historian Vadim B. Shavrov.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 1988, {{in and around}} Los Angeles, California. Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With <b>deadlines</b> looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{authorities}} {{announced an}} indefinite curfew in Sector G-6 of Islamabad, where Lal Masjid is located. The army received orders to shoot anyone leaving the mosque with weapons. The government offered Rs. 5,000 (equivalent to $50 USDs or £41 GBP), plus a free education, to anyone exiting the mosque unarmed. Women inside the mosque were also offered safe passage to their homes. Successive <b>deadlines</b> were extended, as mosque leaders allowed some students to surrender, requiring security forces to renegotiate extensions. Government authorities announced the first {{deadline for the}} occupants of Lal Masjid to surrender unconditionally as 15:30 Pakistan Standard Time (PST), and it was pushed back to 16:00, 18:00, 19:30 and then 21:30.

5|$|The {{opening of}} the Green Line was {{significantly}} delayed, however, when in May 1990 WMATA fired the contractor building the Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations. Mergentime/Perini Joint Venture, the contractor working on the stations, had violated its contract with WMATA by reducing the workforce on the project, not meeting project <b>deadlines,</b> and permitting unsafe working conditions to persist. Mergentime/Perini denied the accusations. Although similar problems plagued Mergentime/Perini's work on the Navy Yard station, WMATA did not fire the joint venture company from that project. WMATA said that the problems would delay the Green Line's opening until at least the late spring of 1991.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months after}} the single's release, the Smiths {{recorded}} the song again during aborted sessions for their debut album with producer Troy Tate. This version was recorded a tone lower than the original in the key of F# minor, and features a shorter introduction. The Smiths recorded the song again with producer John Porter in October at Manchester's Pluto Studios. Morrissey rejected {{this version of the}} song. Due to impending <b>deadlines,</b> the version that ultimately appeared on the band's first album The Smiths was a remix of the original master recording from the Strawberry Studios session. For this version, Porter increased the separation between Marr's guitar tracks and Morrissey's vocals, emphasised drummer Mike Joyce's drum beat, pushed Rourke's bass back in the mix, and created a more dramatic opening and conclusion to the song.|$|E
5|$|When {{high levels}} of {{phosphorus}} and mercury were discovered in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set <b>deadlines</b> for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{a slow and}} perfectionist composer, Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary. Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight <b>deadlines.</b> He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced. Of his ballets for Sadler's Wells, The Wise Virgins (1940) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach. The Quest (1943), written in great haste, is, according to Grove, oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams. Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire, unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of Façade, the music for which was expanded for full orchestra, still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original. Music from The Quest and {{the whole of the}} Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler's Wells ballet, O.W., in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the quarter century of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to <b>deadlines</b> and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} {{parts of the}} game's development, the largest {{challenge}} was to coordinate Guasti's and his collaborators' work; when Guasti started working as a programmer, he learned about project management, and applied it to AM2R, but still found it challenging to have <b>deadlines</b> and keep people motivated, as everyone {{was working on the}} game for free in their spare time. In late 2014, the project was ported to the newer version GameMaker: Studio, which enabled improved loading times and performance, but required the complete rewriting of some features and changes to the designs of some levels. This move also made bugs faster to fix and new builds easier to make, leaving the development progress in a more expedient and productive state. Later in the same year, the developers worked on improving the visuals, giving the fourth area a new graphics tile set intended to give it more personality.|$|E
5|$|Midway {{through the}} 2010 season, Bouygues Telecom {{announced}} that they wished to reduce their involvement in financing the team, and were interested in continuing their partnership with the squad. This was on the proviso that team manager Jean-René Bernaudeau could find a primary sponsor that would allow Bouygues Telecom to contribute €1 million to the team's budget, {{but the rest of}} its finances would be covered by an incoming sponsor. At this point in time, the team had lodged an application to become a UCI ProTeam once again in 2011. Following his victory in the inaugural Grand Prix Cycliste de Québec, Voeckler was complacent about his team's future, believing his team manager Bernaudeau would eventually find a sponsor. Bernaudeau himself was still hopeful of acquiring a deal at that point, but that <b>deadlines</b> were working against him in order for the team to return as a professional team from the 2011 season onwards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An optimal {{negotiation}} agent {{should have}} capability for maximizing its utility even for negotiation with incomplete information {{in which the}} agents do not know opponent’s private information such as reserve price (RP) and <b>deadline.</b> To support negotiation with incomplete negotiation, this work focuses on designing learning agents called Bayesian learning (BL) based negotiation agents (BLNA) adopting a time-dependent negotiation model. In BLNA, BL is used for estimating opponent’s RP and the corresponding <b>deadline</b> is computed using the estimated RP. BLNA also has the capability of maximizing its utility using estimated <b>deadline</b> information when its <b>deadline</b> is shorter {{than or equal to}} the estimated <b>deadline.</b> To evaluate the performance of BLNA, BLNA is compared to an agent with complete information and an agent with incomplete information. Empirical results showed that BLNA achieved: 1) always higher utility than the agent with incomplete information for all cases, 2) close to or slightly lower utility than the agent with complete information when its <b>deadline</b> is lower and equal to opponent’s <b>deadline,</b> and 3) lower utility than the agent with complete information when <b>deadline</b> is higher than opponent’s <b>deadline.</b> Index Terms—Automated negotiation, negotiation agents, intelligent agents, Bayesian learning, negotiation with incomplete information I...|$|R
40|$|Datacenters are {{the main}} {{infrastructure}} on top of which cloud computing services are offered. Such infrastructure may be shared by {{a large number of}} tenants and applications generating a spectrum of datacenter traffic. Delay sensitive applications and applications with specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs), generate <b>deadline</b> constrained flows, while other applications initiate flows that are desired to be delivered as early as possible. As a result, datacenter traffic is a mix of two types of flows: <b>deadline</b> and regular. There are several scheduling policies for either traffic type with focus on minimizing completion times or <b>deadline</b> miss rate. In this report, we apply several scheduling policies to mix traffic scenario while varying the ratio of regular to <b>deadline</b> traffic. We consider FCFS (First Come First Serve), SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time) and Fair Sharing as <b>deadline</b> agnostic approaches and a combination of Earliest <b>Deadline</b> First (EDF) with either FCFS or SRPT as deadline-aware schemes. In addition, for the latter, we consider both cases of prioritizing <b>deadline</b> traffic (<b>Deadline</b> First) and prioritizing regular traffic (<b>Deadline</b> Last). We study both light-tailed and heavy-tailed flow size distributions and measure mean, median and tail flow completion times (FCT) for regular flows along with <b>Deadline</b> Miss Rate (DMR) and average lateness for <b>deadline</b> flows. We also consider two operation regimes of lightly-loaded (low utilization) and heavily-loaded (high utilization). We find that performance of deadline-aware schemes is highly dependent on fraction of <b>deadline</b> traffic. With light-tailed flow sizes, we find that FCFS performs better in terms of tail times and average lateness while SRPT performs better in average times and <b>deadline</b> miss rate. For heavy-tailed flow sizes, except for tail times, SRPT performs better in all other metrics. Comment: Technical Repor...|$|R
