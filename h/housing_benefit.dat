25|$|The {{council was}} given notice of an {{extraordinary}} audit on 26 June with the auditor concentrating on the council's loss of interest on payments from the Department of Health and Social Security (which would have covered the rate rebates element in <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> subsidy), and on payments from the Treasury Valuer (which paid contributions in lieu of rates on Crown property). The amount of both of these payments depended {{on the level of}} rates, and so no payment could be made until the level of rates was set.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, the Department for Work and Pensions brought {{criminal}} charges against Mote for allegedly claiming £32,000 in income support and £35,000 in <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> from Chichester District Council over a six-year period without declaring his monthly earnings of £4,000. Mote was committed for trial at Chichester Crown Court on 27 April 2004. He would face nine charges of false accounting and one charge of making a false representation. On 16 June, at a plea and directions hearing, he {{pleaded not guilty to}} the charges and a trial date was fixed for 15 November. The following month, the UK Independence Party withdrew the whip from Mote on 15 July 2004 after learning from an article in The Daily Telegraph that he faced trial; Mote had failed to inform his party of the impending charges.|$|E
25|$|The Civil Division {{deals with}} all non-criminal cases, {{and has been}} part of the Court since its {{establishment}} in 1875. The Civil Division is bound by the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom when making decisions, and is normally bound by its own previous decisions, with four exceptions; where the previous decision was made without the judges knowing of a particular law; where there are two previous conflicting decisions; where there is a later conflicting Supreme Court or House of Lords decision, and; where a law was assumed to exist in a previous case but did not. The first three were established by the case of Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd in 1946, the fourth by R (on the application of Kadhim) v Brent London Borough <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> Review Board in 2001. The Civil Division is led by the Master of the Rolls, currently Sir Terence Etherton (who is entitled to the post-nominal MR), assisted by the Vice-President of the Civil Division, Sir Martin Moore-Bick. The division hears cases from the High Court of Justice, County Courts and several tribunals.|$|E

25|$|On 7 March, Thamesdown {{passed a}} motion declaring its {{inability}} to set a rate. The council's chief executive, David Kent, wrote to all councillors after the meeting telling them that a rate had to be set {{by the end of}} March, and pressure appeared also from the Department of Health and Social Security which warned on 21 March {{that there would be a}} problem paying <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> to the council if no rate was made. The council felt sufficiently concerned to avoid budget chaos that it set up a special resources sub-committee to agree emergency measures for ordering supplies. On 25 March the Mayor summoned a special council meeting for 28 March, while senior councillors discussed options with the borough solicitor. The meeting on 28 March saw prolonged disruption from the public gallery by those who supported continued defiance, and Mayor Harry Garrett called on the police to keep order. Among the councillors the decision was taken to approve a legal rate of 196.65p; a council spokesman claimed that the council would be going ahead with what it was going to do anyway.|$|E

500|$|The local {{controlling}} council, Tendring District Council, {{are working}} with the residents of Brooklands on improving the area and trying to buy up land to build new housing. Council leader Mick Page stated [...] "The only way we will start anything in Jaywick is for us to lead it. We will be the catalyst." [...] The council are proposing to stop the allocation of <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares {{rental housing}} {{tools in the}} US, Britain and the Netherlands in order to {{determine}} the best strategy for enhancing rental housing accessibility. In doing so, the authors employ a 'tools approach' of governance paradigm, based on the work of Salamon's The Tools of Governance (2002). Rental housing tools are called housing vouchers in the US, <b>housing</b> <b>benefits</b> in Britain and housing allowances in the Netherlands. Overall, it was found that Britain and the Netherlands can learn from the US on means and ways of designing more efficient and fiscally responsible <b>housing</b> vouchers, <b>benefits,</b> and allowances (VBAs). The US, in turn, can learn from Britain and the Netherlands on means and needs of achieving higher equity and effectiveness. This analysis contributes in a meaningful way by addressing the missing middle link between policies and programs - namely, the tools perspective.

500|$|The Commission's final report, Powers for a Purpose was {{published}} on 18 March 2014, setting out recommendations {{that would be}} implemented if Scotland voted no in the referendum, and Labour were elected in 2015. The proposals included allowing the Scottish Parliament to raise as much as 40% of its annual revenue, and giving it greater leeway to vary income tax rates {{from those in the}} rest of the UK. The plans would build on the powers devolved under the 2012 Scotland Act, which legislated for an increase in responsibility over taxation from 2016, in exchange for a 10% reduction in the grant received from Westminster. The Commission also recommended devolving responsibility in some other fiscal areas, such as the payment of <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> and the possible levy of a mansion tax in Scotland, but decided against taking charge of other financial matters, including state pensions, National Insurance and tariffs on North Sea oil. Other proposals were to retain the Barnett formula, give Scotland control over its railways, and transfer authority for dissolving parliament and holding elections from Westminster to Holyrood. Lamont described the proposals as [...] "the right balance between fiscal accountability and insuring us against risk". Ben Thomson, chair of the cross-party Devo Plus think tank argued the plans were [...] "just tinkering with the current system" [...] and would allow the SNP to [...] "say that the unionist parties aren't interested in real devolution". Deputy First Minister Sturgeon welcomed the prospect of increased devolution, but said a vote for independence was the only way to ensure greater powers for Scotland as [...] "there [...] no guarantee that any new powers would be delivered in the event of a no vote". The proposals were subsequently endorsed by delegates at Scottish Labour's 2014 party conference.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, out-of-work {{sickness}} benefits had an {{annual cost of}} £13billion: the Chancellor, George Osborne, called this [...] "a very large budget". The total annual budget of the Department for Work and Pensions in 2011 was £180 billion, with the largest slice by far - almost half - being spent on the State Pension, followed by <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit</b> at slightly under £30 billion. Tax Credits, administered by the Treasury, cost roughly the same as <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Corbyn {{proposed}} {{to have the}} Bank of England create money to invest in housing and public transport, described by Corbyn as [...] "people's quantitative easing".

2500|$|In January 2012, {{sources close}} to the prime {{minister}} told The Scotsman that [...] "a unified tax and benefit system {{is at the heart of}} a united country" [...] and that these powers could not be devolved to Scotland after the referendum, though Liberal Democrat Michael Moore said in August 2013 that devolution of parts of the welfare budget should be [...] "up for debate". Labour politician Jim Murphy, a former Secretary of State for Scotland, has argued that he is [...] "fiercely committed" [...] to devolving welfare powers to the Scottish Parliament, but also warned that independence would be disruptive and would not be beneficial. Scottish Labour's Devolution Commission recommended in March 2014 that some aspects of the welfare state, including <b>housing</b> <b>benefit</b> and attendance allowance, should be devolved.|$|E

2500|$|Blair {{appointed}} David Freud, {{a former}} vice-chairman of investment banking at UBS, as an advisor on out-of-work benefit reform in December 2006. Freud's 2007 report - dubbed 'the Freud report' but officially titled Reducing dependency, increasing opportunity: {{options for the}} future of welfare to work - called for the greater use of private sector companies who would be paid by results, for substantial resources to be made available to help people on Incapacity Benefit back into work, and for a single working age benefit payment to replace <b>Housing</b> <b>Benefit,</b> Jobseekers Allowance, etc. His central thesis was that spending on 'delivery' - such as schemes to get people back to work [...] - would save money in the long run because there would be fewer people being paid money in the form of benefits. The DWP coined the term Invest to Save to describe this idea and referred to it in-house as [...] "the AME-DEL switch".|$|E
2500|$|Oliver was criticised for underestimating {{the cost}} of {{supposedly}} cheap food he encouraged poor people to prepare for themselves, also for an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain and round the Mediterranean.
