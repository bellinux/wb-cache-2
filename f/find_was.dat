5|$|Rediscovered {{from the}} air by {{biologist}} Cyrus L. Lundell of the Mexican Exploitation Chicle Company on December 29, 1931, the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> reported to Sylvanus G. Morley of the Carnegie Institute at Chichen Itza in March 1932.|$|E
5|$|The <b>find</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} by the main expedition photographer, Mohammedani Ibrahim, who took more than 9,321 large-format glass-plate images on Reisner's expeditions. The tablet is now held by the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (inventory number JE67573).|$|E
5|$|A second {{specimen}} {{was obtained}} in 1966 and the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> published in 1971 by Hugh Genoways and Knox Jones, who {{noted that the}} species is closely similar to O.palustris. Later workers affirmed the relationship between O.dimidiatus, O.palustris and associated species like O.couesi. Fiona Reid reported in 1997 that a third specimen had been found. In 2006, Marcelo Weksler and coworkers removed most of the species formerly placed in Oryzomys from the genus, {{because they are not}} closely related to the type species O.palustris, but kept O.dimidiatus as an Oryzomys.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013, archaeologists {{found the}} remains of 44 submarines, {{including}} UB-17, off the United Kingdom's southern and east coasts, near the county of Suffolk. The <b>find</b> <b>was</b> made up mostly of vessels from the German Imperial Navy dating to World War I. Der Spiegel reported divers located 41 German U-boats, and three of English submarines, found at depths of up to 50 feet, off England's southern and eastern coasts.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{after the}} field of the hoard <b>find</b> <b>was</b> ploughed, the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service {{surveyed}} the field, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all {{considered part of the}} same hoard. Both earlier Iron Age and later mediaeval materials were also discovered, but {{there was no evidence of}} a Roman settlement in the vicinity.|$|E

50|$|The finds from Centuripe itself {{have all}} {{apparently}} come from graves, though most earlier <b>finds</b> <b>were</b> illicitly excavated and so lacked proper archaeological provenances.

5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut into at least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, {{and the nature of the}} lost character can be established with relative certainty.|$|E
5|$|The Tjele helmet {{fragment}} is a Viking Age {{fragment of}} iron and bronze, originally comprising the eyebrows and noseguard of a helmet. It was discovered in 1850 with a large assortment of smith's tools in Denmark, and though the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> sent to the National Museum of Denmark, for 134 years the fragment was mistaken for a saddle mount. In 1984 it was properly identified by an assistant keeper at the museum as the remainder of one of only five known helmets from the Viking era.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} hoard, discovered {{within a}} large ring barrow known as Istriţa Hill near Pietroasele, Romania, consisted of 22 pieces, comprising a wide assortment of gold vessels, plates and cups {{as well as}} jewellery, including two rings with inscriptions. When first uncovered, the objects were found stuck together by an unidentifiable black mass, leading to {{the assumption that the}} hoard might have been covered in some kind of organic material (e.g. cloth or leather) prior to being interred. The total weight of the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> approximately 20kg (44lb.).|$|E
50|$|Small <b>finds</b> <b>is</b> {{an archaeological}} term for {{artifacts}} discovered on excavations which are somewhat special {{compared with the}} common finds for that type site or type phase on multi phasic sites. The special nature of the <b>find</b> <b>is</b> dictated by research agendas and the information the artifact can provide. Examples of the increased importance of small finds over other <b>finds</b> would <b>be</b> coins being often thought of as small finds whereas pottery sherd as just <b>finds.</b> The reason <b>is</b> coins can be much more specific {{when it comes to}} dating evidence. Small <b>finds</b> <b>are</b> usually treated differently in the recording system; often they are recorded on plan rather than being attributed to a single context like other generic finds.|$|R

5|$|The {{treasure}} {{weighed in}} at over 34 tons, or £205,536. Almost a quarter went to Albemarle. Phips, after paying out £8,000 in crew shares, received £11,000. Phips {{was treated as}} a hero in London, and the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> the talk of the town. Some economic historians argue that Phips' find significantly affected history because it led to a major increase in the formation of joint-stock companies, and even {{played a role in the}} eventual formation in the Bank of England.|$|E
5|$|Conybeare's {{presentation}} {{followed the}} resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy {{of one of the}} fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a 50% {{complete}} {{skeleton of}} a juvenile Tyrannosaurus was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation in Montana, by a crew from the Burpee Museum of Natural History of Rockford, Illinois. Dubbed Jane, the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> initially considered the first known skeleton of the pygmy tyrannosaurid Nanotyrannus but subsequent research has revealed {{that it is more}} likely a juvenile Tyrannosaurus. It is the most complete and best preserved juvenile example known to date. Jane has been examined by Jack Horner, Pete Larson, Robert Bakker, Greg Erickson, and several other renowned paleontologists, because of the uniqueness of her age. Jane is currently on exhibit at the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Rockford, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated uranium oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan {{continues to increase}} production and may have become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100t and Australia with 9,430t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia. The <b>find</b> <b>was</b> the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 2,000fragments of lead were found, 940of {{which were}} {{droplets}} of melted metal, {{some of these}} being {{a consequence of the}} fire in 1236. One of the earliest artefacts was a papal bulla dating from the rule of Pope Clement III (1187–91). Two other possible seals were discovered. A total of 15lead discs were recovered, some of which were inscribed with crosses. Two of these were found in graves, but the purpose of the discs has not been reliably explained. The other lead artefacts from this period were associated with the structure of the buildings and include fragments of kame (the lead used in leaded windows), ventilator grills, and water pipes. Leather fragments almost all came from shoes, and included an almost complete child's shoe dating from the late 16th or the 17thcentury. Another <b>find</b> <b>was</b> a small gemstone, a cabochon (polished) sardonyx.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 1842, Francisco Lopez, {{the uncle}} of Antonio's second wife, Jacoba Feliz, took a rest under {{an oak tree}} in Placerita Canyon and had a dream that he was {{floating}} on a pool of gold. When he awoke, he pulled a few wild onions from the ground finding flakes of gold in the roots. Contrary to some portraits {{of him as a}} farmer who stumbled upon his discovery by dumb luck, Lopez had studied mineralogy at the University of Mexico and had been actively searching for gold. Evidence suggests that gold had previously been found in the area about thirty years prior, but the Lopez gold <b>find</b> <b>was</b> the first popularly documented incident in the area. This sparked a gold rush on a much smaller scale than the 1849 California Gold Rush. About 2,000 people, mostly from the Mexican state of Sonora, came to Rancho San Francisco to mine the gold.|$|E

5|$|The Texas oil boom, {{sometimes}} called the gusher age, {{was a period of}} dramatic change and economic growth in the U.S. state of Texas during the early 20th century that began with the discovery of a large petroleum reserve near Beaumont, Texas. The <b>find</b> <b>was</b> unprecedented in its size and ushered in an age of rapid regional development and industrialization that has few parallels in U.S. history. Texas quickly became one of the leading oil producing states in the U.S., along with Oklahoma and California; soon the nation overtook the Russian Empire as the top producer of petroleum. By 1940 Texas had come to dominate U.S. production. Some historians even define the beginning of the world's Oil Age as the beginning of this era in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>find</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} {{under the}} Portable Antiquities Scheme, {{it was not}} declared treasure under the 1996 Treasure Act because single items of non-precious metal {{are not covered by}} the act. The finder and landowner were thus free to dispose of the helmet as they saw fit. The discovery was publicly announced by Christie's in mid-September 2010; the helmet was the centrepiece of its 7 October auction catalogue, featuring on the cover and six more pages. Its value was put at £200,000 – £300,000 ($309,200 – $463,800). The Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery launched an appeal with the aim of purchasing the helmet and making it the focus of a new Roman frontier gallery due to open in 2011. The campaign immediately attracted numerous donations, including £50,000 from an anonymous overseas benefactor who offered the sum if a matching sum could be raised by the public (it was); a £1 million offer from the National Heritage Memorial Fund; a £300,000 pledge from the Headley Trust and the Monument Trust; £200,000 from the Art Fund; and £75,000 from the J Paul Getty Jr Charitable Trust. By the time of the auction three and a half weeks after the campaign had been launched, the museum had raised enough money to support a bid of up to £1.7 million. Behind the scenes, efforts were made to persuade the finder and landowner to agree a private sale with the museum, but these approaches failed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>find</b> <b>was</b> {{taken to}} the farm where Maggie (later Mrs Nicholl) washed the items in a sink. At that time they did not realise they were made from gold. The hoard was {{eventually}} sold to the British Museum for six hundred pounds. It consisted of a miniature ship, complete with fittings and oars; two necklets, a bowl and a torc (or hollow collar). The <b>find</b> <b>was</b> described as a lump of mud when initially shown. Moreover, the boat had been so badly damaged by the plough that it took a goldsmith to later work out its structure.|$|E
