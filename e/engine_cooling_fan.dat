40|$|Over {{the last}} years, {{shape memory alloy}} {{materials}} have seen widespread usage in mechanical and automotive applications. The shape memory effect is the material’s ability to recover large mechanically-induced strains (up to 8 %) by temperature increase. NiTi’s remarkable behavior {{is due to the}} presence of two material phases, the martensite stable at low temperature and the austenite stable at high temperature, and the presence of a thermoelastic martensitic transformation. By means of shape memory alloy materials, the component gains the ability to adjust itself to external stimuli automatically. Furthermore, the increasing attention on low energy consumption opens the way to a larger employment of such materials. In this context, a study dealing with power reduction in <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fans,</b> through integration of shape memory alloy wires, is presented. The goal of the paper is to highlight that shape memory alloys are successful, replacing mechanical/pneumatic devices, in the design of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fans.</b> In particular they are able to actively modify their geometry according to operative conditions, {{in order to reduce the}} fan power absorption. NiTi shape memory alloy wires, pre-deformed in the martensitic state, are integrated in the blades’ structure and able to produce a macroscopic deformation when thermally activated. In this way, according to the temperature perceived by the NiTi wires, the blades’ configuration of the fan automatically modifies. As a consequence, the flow rate can be actively controlled with respect to the cooling requirement. Some relevant material properties, such as transformation temperatures, elastic moduli of the two material phases, maximum recoverable deformation and other constants, required for describing stress-temperature and strain-temperature dependences, have been determined experimentally. Thus, the design of a fan able to guarantee the necessary cooling flow rate in steady state conditions, but able to minimize power absorption when cooling conditions are not critical, has been performed. Comparing the simulated power absorptions of the fan in the critical and non critical conditions, it has been possible to quantify the improved cooling efficiency of the fan integrated with shape memory alloy wires...|$|R

50|$|Cars use {{clutches}} {{in places}} {{other than the}} drive train. For example, a belt-driven <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>fan</b> may have a heat-activated clutch. The driving and driven members are separated by a silicone-based fluid and a valve controlled by a bimetallic spring. When the temperature is low, the spring winds and closes the valve, which lets the fan spin at about 20% to 30% of the shaft speed. As {{the temperature of the}} spring rises, it unwinds and opens the valve, allowing fluid past the valve, makes the fan spin at about 60% to 90% of shaft speed. Other clutches—such as for an air conditioning compressor—electronically engage clutches using magnetic force to couple the driving member to the driven member.|$|E
50|$|Aside from styling, 1990 {{marked a}} number of {{mechanical}} improvements to the 740 series. The B200 and B230 motors received larger 13 mm connecting rods. The 740 Turbo switched from the Garrett T3-series turbocharger to the Mitsubishi TD04 series, which offers quicker spool-up and better boost at low engine speeds, albeit {{at the expense of}} top-end performance. The electronic fuel injection system was upgraded from Bosch LH-Jetronic 2.2 to 2.4 (in 1988 for naturally aspirated cars, in 1990 for turbocharged cars). The newer fuel system offers onboard diagnostics, which are accessible from the engine compartment and require no special equipment.

40|$|Summary. Tile kinetic {{temperature}} of {{a section of}} a propeller blade has been calculated for a blade with high thermal conductivity, and also for a blade which is non-conducting. -Calculations have been made for clear air, and for conditions of icing to find {{the extent to which}} kinetic heating is effective against ice. On a non-conducting blade the temperature is lowest at the position, on the cambered face, where the velocity of the air is greatest. At this position there is practically no protection from kinetic heating. In. the case of a blade which is a good conductor, the average temperature is calculated by balancing the flow of heat b ~ convection to and from the blade.

The M129 was fitted with a mechanically controlled six-piston fuel injection pump. A change from four to seven main bearings was necessary in order smoothly to handle the resulting increase in power. A larger capacity oil pump was also specified. Connecting rods were slightly shortened, reflecting the 6mm longer stroke in a block of unchanged overall height.

NIOSH {{researchers}} have found that water well drillers {{are exposed to}} levels above 85 dB (A) while performing certain tasks during a typical drilling job. Noise levels consistently over 85 dB (A) during an 8 -hour work shift are hazardous and can lead to hearing loss in workers. Finding ways to reduce noise exposure is difficult because of many factors. The work environment is constantly changing due to the location of jobs and environmental factors. The types of drill rigs required for drilling are expensive. Equipment can range from new to used (10 to 30 + years old). Drillers and owners can work together to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, and measures can be taken to reduce exposure to hazardous noise. [] Preventing hearing loss occurs through three stages. The first stage is removing noise from the source (i. e., drill rig). Various parts of a drill rig create noise besides the drilling rod. NIOSH researchers have examined noise levels of drill rigs.
