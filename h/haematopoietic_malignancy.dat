In an assay designed to detect antibodies to EBV viral capsid antigens, 41 % of dogs were positive. Dogs with cancers, including lymphoma, were more frequently positive than controls, but no particular association with B-cell lymphoma was noted. EBV-specific RNA and DNA sequences were not detected in lymphoma tissue by in situ hybridisation or PCR and herpesvirus genomes were not detected using multiple degenerate PCR assays with the ability to detect novel herpesviruses.

Clinical examination showed a lethargic, malnourished, dehydrated patient with ascites and bilateral leg oedema. Laboratory evaluation revealed mild normochromic normocytic anaemia and severe hypoproteinaemia with hypoalbuminaemia. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a thickened, friable duodenal mucosa with multiple erosions. Colonoscopy revealed nodular, pseudopolypoid lesions with patchy erosions in the left hemicolon. Haematoxylin-eosin stained sections from biopsies of endoscopically abnormal bowel segments showed multi-focal aggregates of large, histiocyte-like cells with abundant pale cytoplasm in the lamina propria.

The aim of this prospective and case-control study was to determine differences in faecal microbiota between healthy control dogs and dogs with multicentric lymphoma. Twelve dogs affected by multicentric, B-cell, stage III-IV lymphoma, and 21 healthy dogs were enrolled in the study. For each dog, faecal samples were analysed by Illumina sequencing of 16 S rRNA genes and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for selected bacterial groups. Alpha diversity was significant lower in lymphoma dogs. Principal coordinate analysis plots showed different microbial clustering (P =. 001) and linear discriminant analysis effect size revealed 28 differentially abundant bacterial groups in lymphoma and control dogs. The qPCR analysis showed significant lower abundance of Faecalibacterium spp. (q <. 001), Fusobacterium spp. (q =. 032), and Turicibacter spp. (q =. 043) in dogs with lymphoma compared with control dogs. On the contrary, Streptococcus spp. was significantly higher in dogs with lymphoma (q =. 041). The dysbiosis index was significantly higher (P <. 0001) in dogs with lymphoma.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} lymphatic and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies</b> in deck crew on tankers exposed to cargo vapours. METHODS: The study design was as a nested case-referent study in two cohorts of male Swedish seamen 20 - 64 years of age at the national census 1960 (n 13, 449) and 1970 (n 11, 290), respectively. Cases were detected by record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register 1961 - 79 and 1971 - 87, respectively. For each case, three to five age matched referents from the population were selected. Exposure was assessed from data in the Swedish Registry of Seamen and from a register of Swedish ships. RESULTS: Seamen in the 1970 cohort, who {{had been exposed to}} cargo vapours for at least one month on chemical or product tankers, had an increased risk of lymphatic and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies</b> (Mantel- Haenszel odds ratio (OR) 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 1 to 5. 9)) with a significant exposure-response relation (conditional logistic regression analysis, p = 0. 04). The ORs were increased for both lymphoma (3. 2), multiple myeloma (4. 0), and leukaemia (1. 6), but the increase was only significant for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (OR 3. 3, 95 % CI 1. 1 to 10. 6). There were no significantly increased risks for the 1960 cohort or for seamen exposed only on crude oil tankers, but these groups had few exposed cases and low cumulative exposure to benzene and other light petroleum products. CONCLUSIONS: Seamen exposed to cargo vapours from gasoline and other light petroleum products on chemical or product tankers had an increased incidence of lymphatic and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies.</b> One possible cause is exposure to benzene during loading, unloading, and tank cleaning operations...|$|R

40|$|Epigenetic {{pathways}} can regulate {{gene expression}} by controlling and interpreting chromatin modifications. Cancer cells {{are characterized by}} altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancy</b> that {{is often associated with}} aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd 4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd 4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ 1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ 1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd 4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ 1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd 4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention...|$|E
40|$|Lymphoma is {{the most}} common <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancy</b> of dogs, but little is known about its {{aetiology}} and pathogenesis. Canine lymphoma is composed of a clinically heterogeneous group of tumours, as in human non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hNHL), which shares many similarities with the canine disease. In humans, lymphoma is classified into many different subtypes, each with its own clinicopathological characteristics, prognosis, and in many cases, treatment regime. In dogs, diagnosis is often rudimentary, and many cases are not routinely or robustly subtyped. This has hampered efforts to develop accurate prognostic indicators and novel therapies, as heterogeneous groups of cases are analysed. More accurate classification of canine lymphomas is required before real progress can be made. In the work described in this thesis, molecular techniques were used to develop diagnostic tests to aid diagnosis of canine lymphoma, with a view to improving disease classification, and gaining a greater understanding of disease pathogenesis. The diagnosis of canine lymphoma can be assisted by PCR for antigen receptor rearrangements (PARR), which can determine clonality and tumour cell lineage. Diagnostic samples from suspected lymphoma patients were screened with multiple published PARR primers to establish a panel of assays for routine use. Primer coverage was assessed, and modifications to both primer sequences and primer combinations made where necessary. The optimised PARR assay was robust, highly sensitive and specific, comparable with published studies and provided useful diagnostic information unavailable from other tests.

PARTICIPANTS [...] For each patient younger than 40 years of age (n = 14) diagnosed between 1975 and 1989, four age and sex matched controls were selected via local general practitioners. METHODS [...] All parents of patients and controls completed a questionnaire on their lifestyle, living conditions, and health, for several years preceding each individual diagnosis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated, matched, and, if necessary, stratified for neighbourhood. MAIN RESULTS [...] Increased ORs were recorded for intensive use of petroleum products and pesticides by the patients themselves and their fathers: OR petroleum products: 8. 0 (95 % CI 2. 2, 129. 9) and 9. 0 (1. 0, 66. 1) respectively; OR pesticides: 6. 0 (0. 6, 49. 3) and 3. 2 (1. 0, 10. 1) respectively. Swimming in a local pond was also significantly associated with the disease: OR = 5. 3 (1. 3, 17. 4). In the 1970 s this pond had been polluted by petroleum products and pesticides.

We previously reported that the DOK 1 gene can be mutated and its expression down-regulated in human malignancies. However, the mechanism underlying DOK 1 silencing remains largely unknown. We show here that unscheduled silencing of DOK 1 expression through aberrant hypermethylation is a frequent event {{in a variety of}} human malignancies. DOK 1 was found to be silenced in nine head and neck cancer (HNC) cell lines studied and DOK 1 CpG hypermethylation correlated with loss of gene expression in these cells. DOK 1 expression could be restored via demethylating treatment using 5 -aza- 2 'deoxycytidine. In addition, transduction of cancer cell lines with DOK 1 impaired their proliferation, consistent with the critical role of epigenetic silencing of DOK 1 in the development and maintenance of malignant cells. We further observed that DOK 1 hypermethylation occurs frequently in a variety of primary human neoplasm including solid tumours (93 % in HNC, 81 % in lung cancer) and <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancy</b> (64 % in Burkitt's lymphoma). Control blood samples and exfoliated mouth epithelial cells from healthy individuals showed a low level of DOK 1 methylation, suggesting that DOK 1 hypermethylation is a tumour specific event.

Thus, hypermethylation of DOK 1 is a potentially critical event in human carcinogenesis, and may be a potential cancer biomarker and an attractive target for epigenetic-based therapy.

Factors studied included occupation, chemical exposure, radiation exposure, prior diseases, immunizations, chronic infections and markers for defects in immune regulation. A strong risk associated with agriculture/food processing was observed (RR = 1. 8, P= 0. 002). The risk could not be restricted to those exposed to animals or meat products, or those exposed to pesticides. Significant excesses were also noted for reported exposures to chemicals and gases/fumes, but no specific agent or group of agents could be identified. Cases had fewer tonsillectomies above the age of 10 (P= 0. 01). A large excess of shingles (herpes zoster) was observed in cases (P< 0. 001), but most of the excess cases occurred within 10 years of diagnosis, suggesting this was a preclinical manifestation of disease rather than a cause of it.

40|$|The {{disturbance}} of apoptosis molecular signaling pathways {{is involved in}} carcinogenesis. BCL 2 family of proteins {{is the hallmark of}} apoptosis regulation. In the last decade, new members of BCL 2 gene family were discovered and cloned and were found to be differentially expressed in many types of cancer. BCL 2 protein family, through its role in regulation of apoptotic pathways, is possibly related to cancer pathophysiology and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. It is well known that leukemias are <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies</b> characterized by biological diversity, varied cytogenetics, different immunophenotype profiles, and diverse outcome. Current research focuses on the prognostic impact and specific role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of leukemias. The understanding of the molecular pathways that participate in the biology of leukemias may lead to the design of new therapies which may improve patients' survival. In the present paper, we describe current knowledge on the role of BCL 2 apoptosis regulator proteins in acute and chronic leukemias...|$|R
40|$|The major {{types of}} leukaemias {{included}} in this burden estimation are acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute lymphoid (ALL) leukaemia. It should be noted that, in the more recent WHO classification of <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies,</b> both ALL and CLL are classified within non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHLs) and in parti-cular in B-cell neoplasms (Jaffe et al, 2001). In 2004, the UK age-standardised incidence rates for leukaemia overall {{for men and women}} were 13. 5 and 9. 5 per 100, 000, respectively, and have fluctuated around these levels since the 1970 s (Swerdlow et al, 2001). One-year relative survival from all leukaemias was around 60 %, and 5 -year survival was around 38 % for patients diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 in England and Wales. Survival from leukaemia has steadily increased since the 1980 s, and more so in men, but rates differ between the subtypes of leukaemia (Rachet et al, 2008 c). Non...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear pore {{complexes}} (NPCs) are {{the sole}} gateways between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells and they mediate all macromolecular trafficking between these cellular compartments. Nucleocytoplasmic transport is highly selective and precisely regulated {{and as such}} {{an important aspect of}} normal cellular function. Defects in this process or in its machinery have been linked to various human diseases, including cancer. Nucleoporins, which are about 30 proteins that built up NPCs, are critical players in nucleocytoplasmic transport and have also been shown to be key players in numerous other cellular processes, such as cell cycle control and gene expression regulation. This review will focus on the three nucleoporins Nup 98, Nup 214, and Nup 358. Common to them is their significance in nucleocytoplasmic transport, their multiple other functions, and being targets for chromosomal translocations that lead to <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies,</b> in particular acute myeloid leukaemia. The underlying molecular mechanisms of nucleoporin-associated leukaemias are only poorly understood but share some characteristics and are distinguished by their poor prognosis and therapy outcome...|$|R
40|$|The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) exerts oncogenic {{effects in}} many tumour types 1. However, loss-of-function {{mutations}} in PRC 2 components {{occur in a}} subset of <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies,</b> suggesting that this complex plays a dichotomous and poorly understood role in cancer 2, 3. Here we provide genomic, cellular, and mouse modelling data demonstrating that the polycomb group gene SUZ 12 functions as tumour suppressor in PNS tumours, high-grade gliomas and melanomas by cooperating with mutations in NF 1. NF 1 encodes a Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) and its loss drives cancer by activating Ras 4. We show that SUZ 12 loss potentiates the effects of NF 1 mutations by amplifying Ras-driven transcription through effects on chromatin. Importantly, however, SUZ 12 inactivation also triggers an epigenetic switch that sensitizes these cancers to bromodomain inhibitors. Collectively, these studies not only reveal an unexpected connection between the PRC 2 complex, NF 1 and Ras, but also identify a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy that may be exploited {{for a variety of}} cancers...|$|R
40|$|Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) {{include a}} {{heterogeneous}} group of disease characterized by dysplasia {{of one or}} more bone marrow cell lineages, usually with prominent ineffective erythropoiesis and genomic instability leading to anaemia and enhanced risk to transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus MDS is often diagnosed on the basis of chronic macrocytic anaemia accompanied or not by leukocytopenia and/or thrombocytopenia. The deletion of 5 q (5 q-) is a frequent clonal chromosomal abnormality in patients with MDS. MDS with 5 q- as a sole chromosome alteration is characterized by isolated anaemia, elevated platelet count and a favourable prognosis when compared to other forms of MDS. When the 5 q- accompanies additional chromosome defects, it leads to poor-risk karyotypes with dramatically different prognostic features. NPM 1 is a versatile nuclear phosphoprotein that plays multiple roles in ribosome biogenesis and transport, cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking, centrosome duplication and regulation of p 53. The NPM 1 gene is located in chromosome 5 q 35 and is involved in a number of human <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies,</b> such as promyelocytic leukaemia, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and AML. NPM 1 has also been found mutated in approximately 35...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) {{has been reported}} in several areas of the world and often correlated with the occurrence of AIDS-related lymphomas. A registry specialised in <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies</b> enabled us to report detailed time trends in the incidence of NHL over the period 1980 - 89. There was an overall significant increase in incidence of + 10. 9 % per year (P < 0. 001). Such a trend was observed both in men and in women (+ 11. 2 % and + 10. 5 %, respectively) and in all age groups. It was slightly more marked in the case of high-grade tumours than for low- or intermediate-grade tumours (+ 20. 0 %, + 12. 6 % and + 12. 6 % respectively) and in rural than in urban areas (+ 19. 6 % and + 8. 1 % respectively). In this series, only one case was associated with an HIV infection. These data indicate that, although a significant increase in NHL incidence related to the AIDS epidemic might be expected in the near future, there is an independent dramatic trend which started earlier than the AIDS problem and the causes of which should be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Many {{different}} aetiologies for {{childhood cancer}} have been suggested, but few are well established. One is that parental autoimmune disease is linked with susceptibility for <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies</b> in their offspring during childhood. The {{present study is}} the first to investigate this hypothesis using a follow-up design. A cohort of 53 811 children of more than 36 000 patients diagnosed with a systemic, organ-specific or suspected autoimmune disease were followed up for cancer incidence in the Danish Cancer Registry during 1968 – 1993. The parents were identified through the National Registry of Patients, while their children were traced in the Central Population Register. Cancer incidence among the offspring was compared with that in the corresponding childhood population of Denmark. In total, 115 cancers were observed among children aged 0 – 19 years, yielding a non-significant standardized incidence ratio of 1. 07. Lymphomas contributed 21 cases to the overall number of tumours, 60 % more than expected (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 0 – 2. 4); leukaemia contributed 37 cases representing an excess of 30 % (95 % CI 0. 9 – 1. 8). Our results give some support to the hypothesis that parental autoimmune disease is associated with childhood lymphoma and leukaemia. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Currently, {{clinical}} trials using WT 1 (Wilms tumour gene) peptide vaccines are conducted in <b>haematopoietic</b> <b>malignancies</b> and solid cancers. Single reports {{showed that the}} Wilms tumour gene product WT 1 is also expressed in astrocytic neoplasms. Our aim was to investigate WT 1 expression in a large cohort of various neuroepithelial tumours of different World Health Organization (WHO) grades and in normal central nervous system (CNS) tissue specimens to test its potential value as a diagnostic marker. Methods: Specimens were assessed by RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. The samples investigated in our study consisted of 334 human neuroepithelial tumours, among those 33 oligodendrogliomas, 219 astrocytomas (including 105 glioblastomas) and 47 ependymomas. Results: Our results showed a de novo WT 1 expression in neuroepithelial tumours. In diffuse astrocytomas and ependymomas, WT 1 expression increased significantly with the grade of malignancy. In contrast, no significant difference was seen between WHO grade-II and -III oligodendrogliomas. Controlling for WHO grade, the comparison of oligodendrogliomas with ependymal and astrocytic tumours showed higher expression values for the latter. Conclusions: Our study shows that WT 1 is expressed de novo in numerous neuroepithelial tumours and increases with the grade of malignancy. These results suggest an important role of WT 1 in tumourigenesis and progression in human brain tumours...|$|R
