25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student should <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all {{have the opportunity to}} pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E

50|$|Most local, {{state and}} federal {{education}} agencies are committed to standards based education reform, {{which is based on}} beliefs which conflict with the outcomes of traditional education. The goal is that all students will succeed at one high world-class level of what students <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to do, rather than different students learning different amounts on different tracks, producing some failures and some successes. Higher order thinking skills are emphasized by the new standards.

40|$|Abstract. Determining the {{semantic}} role of sentence constituents {{is a key}} task in determining sentence meanings lying behind a veneer of variant syntactic expression. We present a model of natural language generation from semantics using the FrameNet semantic role and frame ontology. We train the model using the FrameNet corpus {{and apply it to}} the task of automatic semantic role and frame identification, producing results competitive with previous work (about 70 % role labeling accuracy). Unlike previous models used for this task, our model does not assume that the frame of a sentence <b>is</b> <b>known,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>able</b> to identify nullinstantiated roles, which commonly occur in our corpus <b>and</b> whose identification <b>is</b> crucial to natural language interpretation. ...|$|R
