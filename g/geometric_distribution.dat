40|$|Many {{connections}} between <b>geometric</b> and exponential <b>distributions</b> are known. Characterizations and derivations of these distributions often run parallel. Moreover, {{one kind of}} distribution {{can be derived from}} the other: exponential distributions are limits of sequences of rescaled <b>geometric</b> <b>distributions,</b> and the integral parts of exponential random variables have <b>geometric</b> <b>distributions.</b> The lack of memory property is expressed by functional equations of the form (x + u) = (x) (u) for all (x, u) [set membership, variant], where (x) = P{X 1 > x 1, [...] ., Xn > xn}. With = 2 n+, the equation expresses a complete lack of memory that is possessed only by distributions with independent exponential marginals. But when is a proper subset of 2 n+, the functional equation expresses a partial lack of memory property that in some cases is possessed by a more interesting family of multivariate exponential distributions, as for example, those with exponential minima.

25|$|In {{probability}} theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (also known as negative exponential distribution) is the probability distribution {{that describes the}} time between events in a Poisson process, i.e. {{a process in which}} events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a particular case of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the <b>geometric</b> <b>distribution,</b> and it has the key property of being memoryless. In addition to being used for the analysis of Poisson processes, it is found in various other contexts.|$|E
25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} {{in every single}} innings, then their total number of runs scored divided {{by the number of}} times they have been out gives exactly the average number of runs they score per innings. However, for a batsman with innings which have finished not out, this statistic is only an estimate of the average number of runs they score per innings – the true average number of runs they score per innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs they would have scored if they could have completed all their not out innings. If their scores have a <b>geometric</b> <b>distribution</b> then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|E
