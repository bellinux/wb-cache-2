5|$|So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! (stylized as so <b>far,</b> <b>so</b> good... so what !) is {{the third}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on January 19, 1988 by Capitol Records. It is the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, {{both of whom were}} fired immediately after its subsequent tour. So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! features music performed at very fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth is an American thrash metal band {{formed by}} guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine—after he {{departed}} from Metallica—along with bassist David Ellefson, guitarist Greg Handevidt, and drummer Dijon Carruthers, in 1983. Early in 1984, Megadeth recorded a demo that featured new drummer Lee Rausch, who replaced Carruthers. Slayer guitarist Kerry King covered live dates while a permanent replacement was sought. This lineup was short-lived {{and after a}} few shows in 1984, Lee Rausch was replaced by jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson, in addition to the second guitarist Chris Poland. During the Megadeth's 1985 tour promoting their debut, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!, Poland left the band and was temporarily replaced by Mike Albert. Poland then rejoined Megadeth in October of the same year, shortly before they began work on Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?. After years of problems stemming from substance abuse, Mustaine fired both Poland and Samuelson before recording the third album So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What!; being replaced by Jeff Young and Chuck Behler, respectively.|$|E

25|$|Only one {{candidate}} was fired, {{despite the fact}} that Sir Alan had previously said that three people were going to get fired. This was because he felt that he could not separate the four finalists based on what he had seen so <b>far,</b> <b>so</b> he chose to have them face one last test to help him with his final decision. While Lucinda was not shown to be fired with regret, it was shown on Why I Fired Them that she was.|$|E
25|$|The pros {{were given}} a points system just like the amateurs. A first in the Main will earn a AA pro 240 points second 200, 160 for third and so on until six place would be worth 40 points. As in the amateur {{divisions}} the pros would earn rider points. The top ten pros would be determined by this points ranking. Additionally the best ten finishes at the nationals plus the Grand Nationals (making it eleven races) would count toward the pros eligibility to contend for the Pro #1 plate. Purse money would be distributed not only among the racers who made the main, but also those who got to the semis or even didn't make it that <b>far,</b> <b>so</b> practically every one got something for racing, {{even if it was}} just a one hundred percent payback on their entrance fee.|$|E
500|$|With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! {{took over}} five months to record. The album was plagued with {{problems}} during production, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: [...] "The production of So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't {{have at the}} time." [...] Mustaine clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the album's mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.|$|E

500|$|So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! was {{released}} in January 1988 and was well received by fans and critics. The album featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols' [...] "Anarchy in the U.K."; Mustaine changed the song's lyrics, later {{saying that he had}} simply heard them incorrectly. To support the album, Megadeth embarked on a world tour, opening for Dio in Europe and then joining Iron Maiden's Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour in the United States.|$|E
500|$|An {{extended}} version of [...] "Tangerine" [...] occurs, followed by [...] "So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Pleased", {{a duet with}} Gwen Stefani created to cater to modern radio. The aforementioned track and [...] "The Sun, the Moon and Stars" [...] both appear in their untouched versions on the album. A remix of promotional single [...] "Man'O'War" [...] is the eighth recording, immediately by a lengthier version of other promotional single [...] "Baby Knows". [...] "I Love U, but I Don't Trust U Anymore" [...] is also the original track, and includes a verse from folk rock singer Ani DiFranco, who plays an acoustic guitar.|$|E
500|$|Being {{interviewed about}} the album in September 2011, Ellefson commented on {{several of the}} album's other songs.

Ellefson said [...] "13" [...] is a song that [...] "summed up the arc of Megadeth as a band". While referring to another song, [...] "Deadly Nightshade", Ellefson stated the song's main riff [...] "was written during the sessions for Youthanasia, or maybe Cryptic Writings [...] It’s {{been around for a}} while." ...|$|E

The issue additionally contained remixes with vocals from Eve. [...] "So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Pleased" [...] and [...] "Hot Wit' U", featuring guest vocals from Gwen Stefani and Eve, respectively, were also planned to be released as singles in 2000.

500|$|... "So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Pleased" [...] is the album's seventh track, and {{features}} simultaneous verses from Gwen Stefani. The pair's collaboration was called an [...] "utterly delightful, effervescent duet". [...] "The Sun, the Moon and Stars" [...] {{is once again}} a ballad containing production catered to the same crowd. A cover of Sheryl Crow's 1996 single [...] "Everyday Is a Winding Road" [...] is the album's ninth track, but contains a more [...] "sexualized" [...] structure compared to Crow's rendition. [...] "Segue II" [...] is again a silent track, followed by promotional singles [...] "Man'O'War" [...] and [...] "Baby Knows", the former {{of which is a}} [...] "sexy ballad" [...] and the latter featuring contributions from Crow, including her vocals and use of a harmonica.|$|E
500|$|Gospel poems: Throughout her life, Dickinson wrote poems {{reflecting}} a {{preoccupation with the}} teachings of Jesus Christ and, indeed, many are addressed to him. She stresses the Gospels' contemporary pertinence and recreates them, often with [...] "wit and American colloquial language". Scholar Dorothy Oberhaus finds that the [...] "salient feature uniting Christian poets ... is their reverential attention {{to the life of}} Jesus Christ" [...] and contends that Dickinson's deep structures place her in the [...] "poetic tradition of Christian devotion" [...] alongside Hopkins, Eliot and Auden. In a Nativity poem, Dickinson combines lightness and wit to revisit an ancient theme: [...] "The Savior must have been/ A docile Gentleman–/ To come so <b>far</b> <b>so</b> cold a Day/ For little Fellowmen/ The Road to Bethlehem/ Since He and I were Boys/ Was leveled, but for that twould be/ A rugged billion Miles–".|$|E

500|$|The album's thirteenth track, [...] "I Love U, but I Don't Trust U Anymore", {{features}} vocals from folk rock singer Ani DiFranco, {{who plays}} an acoustic guitar. [...] "Silly Game" [...] uses a string orchestra {{performed by the}} NPG Orchestra. [...] "Strange but True" [...] uses a [...] "spoken-word soliloquy with a funky foundation", similar to Prince's previous song, [...] "Irresistible Bitch". The album's final mentioned track is [...] "Wherever U Go, Whatever U Do", is another [...] "subtle" [...] ballad, similar to [...] "So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Pleased" [...] and [...] "The Sun, the Moon and Stars". The standard edition of the album contains two hidden tracks, [...] "Segue III" [...] (also appears as [...] "1-800-Newfunk Ad" [...] in select releases), which is like the other two similarly titled tracks, and [...] "Prettyman", which is a jazz song, including a special appearance from saxophonist Maceo Parker.|$|E
500|$|Before the {{recording}} of the band's third album, Mustaine fired Poland and Samuelson; they were replaced by Jeff Young and Chuck Behler, respectively. The new lineup debuted on So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! in early 1988. Later that year, Mustaine fired Young and Behler {{and replaced them with}} guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. This lineup recorded Megadeth's fourth album, Rust in Peace, which was released in late 1990. The singles [...] "Holy Wars... The Punishment Due" [...] and [...] "Hangar 18" [...] reached the top 30 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. Megadeth's most commercially successful album, Countdown to Extinction (1992), peaked at number2 on the Billboard 200 chart, and was the band's first record to be certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Megadeth's biggest hit single is [...] "Symphony of Destruction", which peaked at number 71 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and in the top 15 in Ireland and the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Megadeth started {{performing}} the album's songs live before the record was released. During 1987 they toured with other thrash metal bands such as Kreator and Overkill {{at a number}} of European venues. The following year Megadeth appeared with more established heavy metal acts such as Dio and Savatage for some shows in North America. They also headlined a European tour, with support from Testament and Sanctuary. Later in 1988 the group made an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival, but were dropped from the line-up after one show; Megadeth was replaced by Testament. Dave Mustaine explained that the band toured quite often because they were not receiving much media exposure: [...] "We do a lot of shows and sell records by word-of-mouth". Los Angeles Times reported that So <b>Far,</b> <b>So</b> Good... So What! sold 400,000 copies one month after its release, becoming Megadeth's fastest selling album at that point. The record eventually went platinum and indicated Megadeth's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene.|$|E
