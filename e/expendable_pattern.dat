40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Magnesium alloy is a light weight metallic material which offers good engineering properties and environmental advantages. Most cast components in this material are produced by the traditional casting processes, predominantly the die-casting process. The <b>Expendable</b> <b>Pattern</b> Casting Process (EPC process) {{is a relatively new}} casting process which provides many design, processing and environmental benefits. However, the process differs significantly from the conventional empty mould sand casting process and there is the need for research to develop an understanding of the process parameters. The research was established to provide a preliminary evaluation of the production of magnesium base alloy castings by the <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> casting process under gravity and counter gravity pouring. The major process parameters investigated were filling pressure, pouring temperature and pattern bead density. The problems experienced in applying this process for this material in the experimental research were defined. Microstructures and mechanical properties of the cast specimens were investigated and reported. The results showed that the quality of test bar specimens produced by the EPC process under counter gravity pouring with optimised process parameters was compatible with the quality of castings produced by the conventional sand casting process. In addition to the experimental research a review was conducted of the modelling of different methods of pouring. The pouring methods considered were bottom gating in gravity pouring, counter gravity pouring in an empty cavity mould process, and <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> casting processes under both gravity and counter gravity pouring. A quasi one dimensional fluid mechanics analysis was conducted to explain the effect of pattern degradation on the delay in mould filling...|$|E

40|$|Generally Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) gas sensors {{are based}} on {{piezoelectric}} crystals like silicon oxide or lithium niobate and are often manufactured with a complicated technology. In order to reach high temperature stability, special crystal cuts are used. These cuts often show a small temperature gradient. Further on, a temperature compensation via mixer circuit is often applied. For the detection of specific components in undefined gas mixtures, the mostly very <b>expendable</b> process of <b>pattern</b> recognition is used. In {{the context of this}} dissertation, the influence of temperature onto the operation behaviour of SAW gas sensors was examined. For this purpose, mass sensitive SAW gas sensors with temperature regulation were produced based on CMOS compatible technology. Beside the possibility of economic mass production, CMOS compatible technology enables the monolithic integration of the devices. Hereby parasitic effects, caused by hybrid integration in the field of high frequencies, could be avoided. Instabilities like temperature drift mostly have a negative influence onto the functionality and behaviour of SAW gas sensors and consequently reduce significantly the sensitivity and stability of the devices. Therefore, the SAW devices produced in this dissertation were equipped with a polysilicon thermal resistor. To measure the surface temperature, a thin film resistor was located on the surface of each device. As a piezoelectric thin film polycrystalline zinc oxide and aluminium nitride were deposited. In order to achieve the required (002) -texture, the reactive HF sputter process as well as the pulsed DC sputter process were used and compared. The results of these examinations have shown, that the pulsed DC sputter process is especially capable to deposit textured thin films. It was possible to deposit strongly textured layers already at room temperature with high deposition rate. The examinations in context of this dissertation have shown, that often a significant increase of the surface temperature is caused by the adsorption of gases. Especially for SAW devices with a positive temperature gradient the variation of temperature causes an increase of transmitted frequency. Compared with the increase of mass by adsorption it should lead to a decrease of transmitted frequency. These two opposite effects lead to a reduction of sensitivity of SAW gas sensors. It could be shown, that a conventionally temperature compensation via electronic mixer circuit is not sufficient to eliminate these effects. So, the applied control of surface temperature was essential. With using the stabilisation of surface temperature, the SAW devices of this dissertation had shown a significant increase of sensitivity. In opposite to the examinations under laboratory conditions, the compounds as well as separate concentrations of a gas mixture are not known in real conditions. Therefore, the principle of pattern recognition is mostly used. By simultaneous use of gas sensors with different sensitivity and selectivity, a pattern of signals can be obtained. Such a structure needs a lot of cavity and further on a more complicated electronic circuit. It could be shown, that a controlled variation of temperature and the resulting temperature coefficients of sensitivity leaded to an additional information about the adsorbed gas component. So, the number of required SAW devices to analyse gas mixtures could be minimized and the selectivity of the SAW gas sensors could be increased significantly. In addition, the well known transient phenomenon of SAW-devices in the range of up to 2 hours could be reduced significantly by heating the devices. Beside these temperature effects, different layer structures and different polymers have been examined in order to cover / protect the SAW devices. An applicative choice of material and layer structure leaded to a significant reduction of drifts and consequently to an increase of long-term stability of SAW gas sensors for the application under real conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{investment}} casting process involves {{the production of}} engineering castings using an <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> such as wax. As it is growing in size and complexity, its properties need to be controlled. However, {{the quality of the}} final casting mainly depends on the quality of wax pattern and ceramic shell. This study highlights the application of a fuzzy logic analysis in combination with Taguchiâ€™s design of experiments for prediction of quality of wax patterns in terms of linear shrinkage, surface roughness and penetration in the {{investment casting}} process. Trial experiments were conducted to confirm this approach.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} two different rapid technologies, namely, MultiJet Modeling (MJM) and silicone rubber molding to manufacture investment casting pattern of gas turbine blade. For this reason, the second stage blade of Ruston TA 1750 (1. 3 MW) gas turbine was digitized using CMM and then its wax pattern manufactured by MJM technology and silicone rubber molding technique. Regarding the inspection results of manufactured patterns, maximum deviation of MJM pattern was - 0. 111 mm.

40|$|The {{advancement}} of the rapid prototyping (RP) technologies evolving toward rapid tooling in producing sacrificial patterns rapidly has profoundly benefits the investment casting (IC) process. Direct <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> fabrication via RP techniques in complex and intricate features significantly reduce the cost when associated with single or low volume production. However inappropriate settings of the RP processes and its variables may cause serious defect in the ceramic shell such as cracking during burning out of the patterns, incomplete collapsibility and poor qualities of end products. By implementing the ANOVA at 95 % confidence level to study the relative influence of factors and interactions, result shows that Surface Roughness (SR) and Dimensional Accuracy (DA) drastically affected by input variables within 5 % level of significance.

This study was conducted in an effort to exploit the application of various RP tand materials in the fabrication of IC patterns by utilizing the RP process parameters in minimizing the errors of responses.

40|$|Aiming at the {{cracking}} {{phenomenon of}} the thin shell mould in the <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> shell casting during the pattern removing process, some systemic researches are presented. The influence of the pattern removing method and temperature on the pattern removing were investigated. The shell mould cracking mechanism was analyzed by using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), and combining the temperature field and the volume change of the expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam pattern being tested. The {{results indicated that the}} shell mould was not easily cracked when the pattern removing process was carried out with the furnace being heated little by little because of the shell slowly shrinking with dehydration and shell strength gradually increasing. The shell mould was soon destroyed when it was set directly into the furnace at above 400 â„ƒ because of the thin shell mould rapidly shrinking and the foam pattern hindering. However, the shell mould had no cracking when it had been preheated for a long time even if the furnace temperature was above 400 ç¯Š and the shell was put into the furnace directly. Moreover, when the shell mould was directly set into the furnace at lower temperatures, 250 to 300 â„ƒ, the shell would shrink slowly and the foam pattern would stay at the maximum expansion stage temperature of 100 to 110 â„ƒ for a long time; and the shell mould would experience an expansion force from the foam pattern for a long time. The expansion force is related to the pattern removing temperature, holding time, foam pattern thickness and density. Therefore, the foam pattern with higher density could make the shell crack...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuation}} from {{rapid prototyping}} into rapid tooling technologies allows speedy fabrication of sacrificial patterns for investment casting process. Direct <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> fabrication with intricate features using rapid prototyping techniques significantly reduces the fabrication cost when associated with single- or low-volume production. During investment casting process, rapid prototyping patterns {{are subjected to}} high melting temperatures, high viscosities, and high thermal stress such as dewaxing and shell mold cracking. Furthermore, ceramic shell may cause crack during melting and burning out of the patterns and also incomplete collapsibility. Although rapid prototyping process can build parts with high stiffness rapidly, the part surface suffered a staircase effect and shrinkage during investment casting process solidification. This paper presents a direct approach of multijet modeling and fused deposition modeling on acrylate- and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene-based materials {{to be used as}} expendable patterns for the investment casting process. Thermal analyses were conducted on the rapid prototyping materials that exhibit mass loss and expansion. Quality assessment and benchmarking were performed between the rapid prototyping and the metal part on accuracy, surface roughness, and part built time. It was found that both the materials have dimensional deviation when employed in investment casting process and acrylate patterns have better surface roughness as compared to acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene patterns. Additionally, multijet modeling recorded a significantly shorter lead time when more than a single part can be produced during the rapid prototyping process. It was observed that the shell mold after burnout experiences cracking. Results also showed that acrylate-based materials decomposed above 500 Â°C, meanwhile acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene was above 600 Â°C. Acrylate material had a coefficient of thermal expansion and linear dimensional deviation as compared with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. No ash was observed in the ceramic molds when the part burnout temperatures are above 500 Â°C acrylate material and 600 Â°C for acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene...|$|E
40|$|Investment casting, {{known as}} the lost wax process too, {{is one of the}} oldest and {{well-known}} manufacturing processes traced back to 5000 BC. As a rule the wax pattern, a disposable specimen in the shape and size of the final product, or the wax pattern assembly is invested into ceramic slurry followed by the application of a coating of dry refractory particles (stucco) which, when dried, gives a thin refractory shell. The application of slurry and stucco is repeated, with drying between each successive coat, until the shell mould of sufficient thickness is achieved. Following completion of shell build, de-waxing and shell hardening processes get ready the shell for the following pouring of the molten metal into the expendable ceramic mould. The production of the investment casting ceramic mould is a crucial part of the whole process. The use of an <b>expendable</b> <b>pattern</b> confers an unique advantage to the investment casting process because the pattern is removed from the mould without any disturbance of the latter, but the continuous shell changing produces a random changing on the boundary conditions that directly affect the casting success. A method to quickly find out the thermo-physical properties of the mould is desirable to reach two main goals:. the controlling of the ceramic shell production;. the evaluation of the ceramic thermo-physical properties in order to provide reliable boundary conditions to the numerical simulation and to well simulate the critical process of metal solidification. The thermophysical properties of the ceramic mould strongly influences the boundary condition imposed to the metal during solidification and it is because the technique proposed in this work may be helpful to increase the reliability of the numerical casting simulation because it is often based on fixed data that do not take into account the random variability of the mould building process and also the influence of the process parameters (i. e. hardening time, slurry and stucco composition, slurry viscosity) on the thermophysical properties are partially or completely unknown. The transient cooling process of a ceramic isotropic thin slab starting from high temperature down to room temperature will be experimentally investigated using IR thermography and the superficial temperature Tm will be compared against the surface temperature drop Tn numerically generated. Varying thermo-physical properties of the numerical model is possible to find out its value in correspondence on the minimum of the norm of the vectorial difference (Tn - Tm). The technique modelling must be build to take into account the properties dependence on the temperature since the range of temperature must be necessarily wide. This is a typical inverse problem: given the effects (time variation of surface temperatures) the causes (the material properties) must be estimated. Inverse problems are typical ill-posed problems since the solution can be extremely sensible to the noise and can be unstable. The well-known trust-region-reflective algorithm will be used for the error minimization between experimental surface temperature and numerical surface temperature which is a parametric function depending on the unknown parameters. Also the error analysis has been carried out...|$|E
