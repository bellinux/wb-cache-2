40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{criteria}} for a comparison of legal concepts between different legal backgrounds. The traditional concept of equivalence must be revised, since absolute equivalence is, between national legal systems {{each with its own}} ethical principles and political priorities, no longer possible. A comparison on the grounds of a <b>definition</b> <b>by</b> <b>intension</b> becomes difficult because of the indeterminacy of legal concepts which are bound to moral values of a given society in a certain period. The "tertium comparationis " for comparative terminography has {{to be found in the}} function of a concept within the framework of a specific legal solution, be it laws, court decisions, regulations or other legal provisions. We must develop a new comparative approach which does not aim at complete conceptual correspondence but at complete documentation of the national concepts. The ultimate goal of terminology work in law is to inform the user of the concepts used by national legal systems to control specific social circumstances. Equivalence in terminology [...] . ...|$|E
50|$|Class {{and their}} members {{can be defined}} in OWL either by {{extension}} or <b>by</b> <b>intension.</b> An individual can be explicitly assigned a class by a Class assertion, for example we can add a statement Queen elizabeth is a(n instance of) human, or by a class expression with ClassExpression statements every instance of the human class who has a female value to the sex property is an instance of the woman class.|$|R
40|$|Although {{the field}} of digital {{libraries}} is still young, digital library collections have been built {{around the world and}} are being deployed on numerous public web sites. But what is a digital library, exactly? In many respects the best way to characterize the notion is by extension, in terms of actual examples, rather than <b>by</b> <b>intension</b> as in a conventional definition. In a very real sense, digital libraries are whatever people choose to call by the term “digital library. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{knowledge}} representation, a {{class is}} a collection of individuals or objects. A class can be defined either by extension, or <b>by</b> <b>intension,</b> using what is called in some ontology languages like OWL. If we follow the Type-token distinction, the ontology is divided into individuals, who are real worlds objects, or events, and types, or classes, who are sets of real world objects. Class expressions or definitions gives the properties that the individuals must fulfill to be members of the class. Individuals that fulfill the property are called Instances.|$|R
40|$|The {{organizational}} {{capacity to}} cope with unexpected changes remains a fundamental challenge in strategy as global competition and technological innovation increase environmental uncertainty. Conventional strategy-making is often conceived as a sequential linear process where {{we see it as}} a non-linear interaction between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms dealing with multiple actions taken throughout the organization over time. It is driven <b>by</b> <b>intension</b> but with a flexible balance between centralized (planned) and decentralized (spontaneous) activities. We adopt the principles of complementary Yin-Yang elements and Zhong Yong balance to explain the time bound interaction between these opposing yet complementary strategy-making mechanisms where tradeoffs and synergies are balanced across hierarchical levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposed}} a lane detection algorithm for urban environment. The algorithm was concerned on selecting an appropriate limited {{region of interest}} (ROI) by OTSU segmentation. Then candidates of lane markers were extracted by Canny, finally the lane boundaries were detected by Hough transform. The limited ROI helps to identification lane in an appropriate region. This process {{have the effect of}} enhancement in the speed of operation. The {{proposed a}}lgorithm was simulated in MATLAB. The test databases were shared by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). The experiments show that lane boundaries can be detected correctly although they are fade. Feature-based method is usually affected <b>by</b> <b>intension</b> of image. Several characteristics of roads need to be considered further for detection more precisely...|$|R

Classes can be specified by extension (listing their members) or <b>by</b> <b>intension,</b> i.e. <b>by</b> a [...] "propositional function" [...] such as [...] "x is a u" [...] or [...] "x is v". But [...] "if we take extension pure, our class is defined by enumeration of its terms, and this method will not allow us to deal, as Symbolic Logic does, with infinite classes. Thus our classes must in general be regarded as objects denoted by concepts, and to this extent {{the point of view of}} intension is essential." [...] (1909 p. 66) ...|$|R

In the second place, the collections having a given number of terms themselves presumably form an infinite collection: {{it is to be}} presumed, for example, that there are an infinite collection of trios in the world, for if this were not the case the total number of things in the world would be finite, which, though possible, seems unlikely. In the third place, we wish to define [...] "number" [...] {{in such a way that}} infinite numbers may be possible; thus we must be able to speak of the number of terms in an infinite collection, and such a collection must be defined <b>by</b> <b>intension,</b> i.e. <b>by</b> a property common to all its members and peculiar to them."
