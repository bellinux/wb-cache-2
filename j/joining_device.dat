30|$|A {{new concept}} for {{manufacturing}} tubular butt joint specimens for biaxial film adhesive material characteristics is presented. While the different thermal expansions {{are the main}} problem for manufacturing tubular butt joints with film adhesives in the past, the presented new joining concept utilizes these to align both adherends during the curing. The quality of bondline and the accuracy of orientation of the tubes are strongly increased. At this time the material tests show a decrease of variation in results of factor 4. The <b>joining</b> <b>device</b> is registered to Patent Number DE 102017114538.9.|$|E
40|$|Particularly in the {{automotive}} industry, {{there is a}} persistent problem arising from the need to reliably and permanently bond dissimilar materials such as plastics and metals. To solve this problem, experts at the Fraunhofer ILT in Aachen {{have come up with}} a solution that is suitable for industrial applications. Unlike adhesive bonding, the process works without additives or additional intervals for hardening or surface cleaning. Starting from the state-of-the-art process used today, the chain can be optimized for butt connections to a novel process using the thermal energy applied by the microstructuring process of the metal component. A new <b>joining</b> <b>device</b> is introduced, which allows the microstructuring of the metal component with an angle of incidence. After heating the component by the microstructuring process, it is pressed into the plastic component in the same <b>joining</b> <b>device.</b> The liquid plastic flows inside the inclined microstructures, which have a big undercut groove and a barb-like effect in the tensile shear load direction. After curing, the connection is based on a mechanical interlocking between the two components. At first suitable microstructuring parameters are evaluated to achieve a homogeneous melt flow of the plastic inside the cavities, which enables a high structure filling-rate and a good mechanical performance of the joint in tensile shear tests. Furthermore, the resulting temperature distribution is evaluated by thermocouples. Different influencing factors on the strength are evaluated like various penetration depths, different structure distances, or different clamping offsets of the plastic component...|$|E

30|$|Manufacturing trials show an {{excellent}} <b>joining</b> <b>device</b> for hollow tubular butt joints with reproducible properties. The concept with the smaller diameters {{of the core}} and sealing enable an easy to use joining of the components. The parameters which influence the specimen’s quality, only depend on the manufacturing quality of {{the male and female}} core. All manufactured specimen are free of voids and air inclusion and show the same bondline thickness. With 0.04  mm the bondline is at its minimum thickness guaranteed by an integrated polyvinyle carrier fleece. Typically wide bonded plates bonded with the adhesive show a thickness of 0.1  mm. With the small wall thickness of 3  mm of the tubes, the adhesive leaks out till the carrying-fleece of the film adhesive is fully compressed. A possible solution is the stacking of additional adhesive layers. If the bondline thickness does not depend on the carrying fleece, another outer sealing concept needs to be used.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} amount of composite materials used for civil aircraft structures, joining and repair methods suitable for composite structures are necessary. Possible methods are structural bonding and bonded repairs. However, a huge challenge is {{the availability of}} reliable material properties for the adhesives. A common ap-proach for determining the material properties is to use adhesively bonded tubular butt joint specimens (e. g. ISO 11003 - 1). Within the Presented work they are manufactured with a new <b>joining</b> <b>device</b> and tested in a biaxial servo hydraulic testing system where tensional and torsional loads can be applied individually but also simultaneously. Thus, the multiaxiality of the bondline stress can be selectively adjusted and the adhesives yielding and strength can be determined. In order to determine stress-strain curves of the adhesive systems to be investigated a local strain or deformation measurements needs to be performed. However, the small thickness (approximately 0. 1 mm) of an e. g. epoxy film adhesive is a huge challenge. Because of the thin bondline, resulting deformations are very small. Therefore, the measuring method is crucial for a reliable adhesive characteri-zation. Within this paper, two different strain measurement techniques are presented and compared. The first is a high resolution digital image correlation (DIC) system. DIC measuring {{has the advantage of}} measuring a complete strain field in each direction within the measurement area. The second method relies on capacitive sensors, which are com-bined in a manner, which allows the decoupled measuring of axial and torsional move-ments of the adhesively bonded adherends. This method is easy to use, online applicable also to fatigue testing but gives only a global displacement information. Both methods and results are compared and discussed...|$|E

And 99.9 percent took not longer then 64 milliseconds. The overall network delay {{with an average of}} 2.25 milliseconds leads to an average response time of 4.89 milliseconds and a maximum response time of 206 milliseconds on client side. 98.2 percent of the responses reached the inquiring client within 2 to 8 milliseconds.

40|$|This demo {{presents}} MultiNet, a novel {{method for}} <b>joining</b> <b>devices</b> to a domestic Wi-Fi network. MultiNet dynamically reconfigures the network to accept each device, rather than configuring each device {{to fit the}} network as is the norm. It does so by assuming that each device is preconfigured with a cryptographically generated WPA 2 network SSID/passphrase pair, and then providing a lightweight interaction through which the user creates a new network for each device. This approach makes securely adding devices to a wireless network straightforward without compromising security or burdening the user, and maintaining backward compatibility with existing deployed standards and protocols. The demo deploys a MultiNet Access Point (AP) {{and a number of}} Wi-Fi enabled consumer devices to allow viewers to dynamically construct and deconstruct the network via the MultiNet controller currently implemented as an app on an Android phone (Figure 1).

40|$|This review will {{commence}} {{with research}} into language development in native speakers by Hunt (1965); Bateman and Zidonis (1966); O'Donnell, Griffin, and Norris (1967); and Hunt (1970). Reviews of language development studies which precede Kellogg Hunt's research in 1965 {{may be found}} in Me Carthy (1954), Carroll (1960), and Erwin and Miller (1963). Hunt (1965) Hunt's research pioneered in the identification of a language unit called a 'minimal-terminal unit' or a ‘t-unit'. He explains the meaning of this term as follows: ‘terminal' because it is grammatically allowable to terminate them, like sentences, with a capital letter at one end and a period or other terminal mark at the other; and 'minimal' {{in the sense that they}} are the shortest units into which a passage can thus be segmented without leaving fragments as a residue. (pp. 8 - 9) Thus, a t-unit, as defined by Hunt, is a sentence with only one main clause plus any subordinate clauses or non-clausal elements accompanying it, This unit replaces the highly unreliable sentence length as the traditional measure of language development [...] - often younger students write longer sentences than older students by virtue of simple <b>joining</b> <b>devices</b> as coordination between main clauses (Hunt, p. 11) ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} RAMBO, an {{algorithm}} for emulating a read/write distributed shared memory in a dynamic, rapidly changing environment. RAMBO provides a highly reliable, highly available service, even as participants join, leave, and fail. In fact, the entire set of participants may change during an execution, as the initial devices depart and {{are replaced by}} {{a new set of}} devices. Even so, RAMBO ensures that data stored in the distributed shared memory remains available and consistent. There are two basic techniques used by RAMBO to tolerate dynamic changes. Over short intervals of time, replication suffices to provide fault-tolerance. While some devices may fail and leave, the data remains available at other replicas. Over longer intervals of time, RAMBO copes with changing participants via reconfiguration, which incorporates newly <b>joined</b> <b>devices</b> while excluding devices that have departed or failed. The main novelty of RAMBO lies in the combination of an efficient reconfiguration mechanism with a quorum-based replication strategy for read/write shared memory. The RAMBO algorithm can tolerate a wide variety of aberrant behavior, including lost and delayed messages, participants with unsynchronized clocks, and, more generally, arbitrary asynchrony. Despite such behavior, RAMBO guarantees that its data is stored consistency. We analyze the performance of RAMBO during periods when the system is relatively well-behaved: messages are delivered in a timely fashion, reconfiguration is not too frequent, etc. We show that in thes...|$|R
