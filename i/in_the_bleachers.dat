5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleachers,</b> reading her apology letter.|$|E

25|$|On October 19, 2010, in {{the second}} inning of Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, with no score, Yankees player Robinson Canó hit a fly to the right field wall. Rangers right fielder Nelson Cruz backtracked and {{positioned}} himself to jump in the air and attempt to catch Cano's fly ball at the wall. Jared Macchirole, a 20-year-old spectator seated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleachers,</b> reached out to catch the ball, and in doing so, made contact with the glove of Cruz, ending his upward momentum, and ensuring that Cruz would not catch the ball, that did reach the seats. Right Field Umpire Jim Reynolds ruled the play a home run rather than calling for Instant Replay review to determine whether spectator interference had occurred as specified by MLB's new rule regarding Instant Replay. The potential interference and umpire's call resulted in a solo home run for Cano, the Yankees taking a 1–0 lead at the time.|$|E

500|$|Others {{were less}} enamored with Ferris, many taking {{issue with the}} film's [...] "rebel without a cause" [...] hedonism. David Denby of New York Magazine, called the film [...] "a nauseating {{distillation}} of the slack, greedy side of Reaganism." [...] Author Christina Lee agreed, adding it was a “splendidly ridiculous exercise in unadulterated indulgence,” and the film “encapsulated the Reagan era's near solipsist worldview and insatiable appetite for immediate gratification—of living in and for the moment....” Gene Siskel panned the film from a Chicago-centric perspective saying “Ferris Bueller doesn't do anything much fun ... hey don't even sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleachers</b> where all the kids like to sit {{when they go to}} Cubs games.” Siskel did enjoy the chemistry between Jennifer Grey and Charlie Sheen. Ebert thought Siskel was too eager to find flaws in the film's view of Chicago.|$|E

500|$|The AAFC {{proposed}} match-ups with NFL teams {{numerous times}} during its four-year existence, but no inter-league game ever materialized. That made Cleveland's {{entry into the}} NFL in the 1950 season the first test of whether its early supremacy could continue into a more established league. The proof came quickly: Cleveland's NFL regular-season opener was against the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles on September 16 in Philadelphia. The Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards—including 246 passing yards from Graham and his receivers—in a 35–10 win before a crowd of 71,237. [...] This decisive win quashed any doubts about the Browns' prowess. Behind an offense that featured Graham, Groza, Motley, Lavelli and running back Dub Jones, Cleveland finished the 1950 season with a 10–2 record, tied for {{first place in the}} Eastern Conference. After winning a playoff game against the New York Giants, the Browns advanced to the NFL championship match against the Los Angeles Rams in Cleveland. The Browns won 30–28 on a last-minute Groza field goal. Fans stormed the field after the victory, carting off the goalposts, ripping off one player's jersey and setting a bonfire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleachers.</b> [...] "It was the greatest game I ever saw", Brown later said.|$|E
500|$|The first close game of {{the season}} game in early November in a conference game against the Minnesota Golden Gophers in Minneapolis.

Michigan came within ten yards of a {{touchdown}} five minutes into the game but did not score. The first half ended in a scoreless tie. When Michigan scored its touchdown in the second half, Michigan fans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleachers</b> signaled the event with cowbells. Michigan's touchdown was scored by fullback duffy and the goal after touchdown was kicked by Ferbert. Minnesota responded with a touchdown (worth 4 points under 1896 rules), but the score came at {{the far corner of the}} field where a straight kick for the goal after touchdown (worth 2 points) was impossible. Accordingly, Minnesota attempted a double kick, kicking the ball first to the fullback Loomis. Loomis caught the ball so close to the goal posts that his kick for goal [...] "was easily stopped by Michigan players." [...] The blocked kick was the difference in a close game. Michigan's lineup was Hutchins (right end), Henninger (right tackle), Bennett (right guard), Wombacher (center), Carr (left guard), Villa (left tackle), Farnham (left end), Felver (quarterback), Caley (right halfback), Ferbert (left halfback), and Hogg and Duff at fullback.|$|E
500|$|The halftime show {{received}} critical acclaim. Said Marc Schneider of Billboard: [...] "It's Madonna Louise Ciccone's world, we're just {{living in}} it". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times wrote {{that although the}} choice of Madonna as halftime-show performer was a subject of discussion, the singer was [...] "defiantly unconcerned with the more conservative red state wing of the football fanbase who'd never be caught dead singing along {{to one of her}} songs ... and her halftime show was pure spectacle by the Cleopatra of the game ... Madonna is Madonna for a reason. And we saw it firsthand Sunday." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot called the show an [...] "S party to Ancient Egypt". Along with reminding the audience of her older hits, Madonna had [...] "important career-advancing work to do ... after all, never does anything unless she's got something to sell, and with a new studio album due out in March and a tour to follow, she had plenty on her to-do list". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that although the singer was not as [...] "indefatigable" [...] as she had been, she was a [...] "party girl turned regent: a queen on her throne, a homecoming queen strutting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bleachers,</b> a church singer fronting a choir". Pareles called Madonna [...] "grown-up", and wrote that she put on a show appropriate for the NFL. Peter Robinson of The Guardian called the performance low-key for the singer, despite the large audience. Robinson wrote that the show's budget would [...] " [...] your average James Cameron effort look like Homes Under the Hammer", and called Madonna's entrance and exit his favorite parts of the show.|$|E
25|$|When {{configured}} as {{a basketball}} arena, <b>the</b> fans <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nearby <b>bleachers</b> got a suitable {{view of the}} court, but the action was difficult to see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> upper decks.

The Metrodome as a basketball arena was much larger than most NBA and major college basketball arenas, which run to about 20,000 seats; it functioned like Syracuse's large Carrier Dome. However, the NCAA made a significant amount of money selling the high number of seats for regional and championship games for the men's basketball tournament.|$|R
