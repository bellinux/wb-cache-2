500|$|Progressive {{alignment}} {{methods are}} efficient enough to <b>implement</b> <b>on</b> {{a large scale}} for many (100s to 1000s) sequences. Progressive alignment services are commonly available on publicly accessible web servers so users need not locally install the applications of interest. The most popular progressive alignment method has been the Clustal family, especially the weighted variant ClustalW to which access is provided by {{a large number of}} web portals including , , and [...] Different portals or implementations can vary in user interface and make different parameters accessible to the user. ClustalW is used extensively for phylogenetic tree construction, in spite of the author's explicit warnings that unedited alignments should not be used in such studies and as input for protein structure prediction by homology modeling. Current version of Clustal family is ClustalW2. EMBL-EBI announced that CLustalW2 will be expired in August 2015. They recommend Clustal Omega which performs based on seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile techniques for protein alignments. They offer different MSA tools for progressive DNA alignments. One of them is MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform).|$|E

2500|$|Alternative ("alternate") tuning {{refers to}} any open-string note-arrangement other than {{standard}} tuning. Such alternative tuning arrangements offer different chord voicing and sonorities. Alternative tunings necessarily change the chord shapes associated with standard tuning, which eases the playing of some, often [...] "non-standard", chords {{at the cost}} of increasing the difficulty of some traditionally-voiced chords. [...] As with other scordatura tuning, regular tunings may require re-stringing the guitar with different string gauges. FOr example, all-fifths tuning has been difficult to <b>implement</b> <b>on</b> conventional guitars, due the extreme high pitch required from the top string. [...] Even a common approximation to all-fifths tuning, new standard tuning, requires a special set of strings.|$|E
