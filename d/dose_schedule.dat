Methods: Chart reviews were conducted on all patients who met inclusion criteria. Data collected included patient demographics, history of surgery/radiation, number of past chemotherapy treatments, and lab values prior to each eribulin cycle. Results: A total of 37 patients met inclusion criteria for this study. Ten patients were initially started on the “day 1 /day 8 ” schedule and 3 of those patients required a change to the extended “day 1 /day 15 ” schedule.

Therefore, a study was carried out, to resolve these issues in diagnosed cases of PA complicating old treated patients of pulmonary tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: The study patients randomly received itraconazole either in a fixed <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> of 200 mg (group I), 200 mg twice daily (group II) or a variable <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (group III), for 12 months. All the patients were followed up for the entire duration of the study for clinical, radiological, and immunological response. The side effects were recorded as and when reported by the patients and managed symptomatically. Results: A total of 60 patients were enrolled, 20, in each group. There were no intergroup differences with regard to age, sex, body weight, smoking status, alcohol intake, symptoms, Potassium hydroxide (KOH) mount, fungal culture, pattern of radiological lesions or anti-aspergillus antibodies (anti-Asp-Ab) titers. The radiological response was poor in group I patients, {{as compared to the}} other groups, at two months (P < 0. 05). The dose of itraconazole was increased in five of the patients in group I due to poor response. A higher number of group II patients suffered side effects and the dose of itraconazole had to be decreased in three of these patients, but none of the patients on a variable <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> required a change in <b>dose</b> <b>schedule.</b> Conclusion: Thus, a weight-based variable <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> of itraconazole was found to be a more effective and safer modality in the management of PA than a fixed <b>dose</b> <b>schedule...</b>|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: A two <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (0 and 6 months) for a {{combined}} hepatitis A and B vaccine {{is currently being}} developed. METHODS: The present study compared the combined hepatitis A and B vaccines in 12 - 15 -year-old: Twinrix paediatric (360 EL. U HAV antigen/ 10 microg HBs antigen) on a three <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (0, 1 and 6 months) to the adult formulation (720 EL. U HAV antigen/ 20 microg HBs antigen) on a two <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> (0 and 6 months) and also reports on the follow-up until 24 months. RESULTS: Seroconversion (SC) rates to HAV in both regimens reached 100 % by month 7 and remained 100 % up to month 24. Anti-HAV, GMTs were slightly higher for the two dose than the three dose regimens at this time point. Seroprotection against hepatitis B was > 99 % in both groups by month 7 and 24, this was still 94 and 96 %, respectively. Statistical non-inferiority of group 1 (two dose) versus group 2 (three dose) was demonstrated. All vaccines were well tolerated and the most frequently reported local and general symptoms were pain and fatigue. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events reported during the study. CONCLUSION: The two dose regimen elicited similar immunogenicity to HAV and HBsAg and reactogenicity profiles as the three dose regimen in this group of healthy adolescents. The {{reduction in the number}} of doses from the current three <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> will make vaccination against hepatitis A and B more convenient to the vaccinee, reduce healthcare staff time required and may lower the overall costs associated with vaccination...|$|E

40|$|The {{choice of}} {{chemotherapy}} {{for patients with}} metastatic breast cancer (MBC) depends on disease- and patient-related factors, {{but there is little}} guidance on dosing modifications for patients unable to receive the licensed dose. Nab-paclitaxel is a solvent-free form of paclitaxel that uses albumin as a drug carrier and exploits endogenous albumin transport pathways to achieve enhanced drug targeting and tumour penetration with reduced toxicity. It is approved for use at a dose of 260 mg/m(2) every three weeks in adults who have failed first-line treatment for MBC and for whom standard anthracycline-based therapy is not indicated.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the role of <b>dose</b> <b>schedule</b> for treatment of grammatical morphology deficits in children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). Sixteen 4 - 5 year old children with SLI participated in a 6 -week intervention program during which children received equivalent daily Enhanced Conversational Recast treatment targeting grammatical morpheme errors. Half of the children received treatment in one 30 -minute session (massed condition). The other half received treatment in three 10 -minutes sessions (spaced condition) over a 3 -hour period. Progress was assessed three times weekly by probing a child’s use of his/her treatment morpheme and untreated morpheme (a maturational control) in untreated contexts. Pre-to-post treatment morpheme usage differed significantly for children regardless of dosage condition, demonstrating overall treatment efficacy. There were no differences in treatment effects for the massed and spaced conditions. In addition, nonverbal IQ and receptive vocabulary test scores correlated with treatment effect sizes. The study adds to evidence that Enhanced Conversational Recast can produce positive results, in a relatively short period of time, for children with specific language impairment.

40|$|AbstractCarfilzomib is a {{proteasome}} inhibitor {{that binds}} selectively and irreversibly to its target. In July 2012, carfilzomib received accelerated approval in the United States {{for the treatment}} of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Based on emerging preclinical data and clinical results, the total dose, infusion time, and administration schedule of carfilzomib have evolved during phase I and phase II clinical studies, with the aim of optimizing the risk-benefit profile of the agent. Based on in vitro and in vivo findings and encouraging phase I tolerability data, a consecutive-day, twice-weekly <b>dosing</b> <b>schedule</b> was implemented early in the development program.
