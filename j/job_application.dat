He rented a room under the alias Chris Hagen at a boarding house near the Florida State University (FSU) campus. Bundy later said that he initially resolved to find legitimate employment and refrain from further criminal activity, knowing he could probably remain free and undetected in Florida indefinitely as long as he did not attract the attention of police; but his lone <b>job</b> <b>application,</b> at a construction site, had to be abandoned when he was asked to produce identification. He reverted to his old habits of shoplifting and stealing credit cards from women's wallets left in shopping carts.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{to detect}} {{possible}} effects of introducing anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications,</b> we compare {{the situation of}} anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> with a counterfactual situation, i.e., a comparable situation with standard <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> Theoretically, three different effects are possible {{if we assume that}} anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> eliminate any differential treatment of minority groups. First, anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> may cause the interview invitation probabilities of minority groups to increase and to equalize with those of majority groups. In this situation, minority groups are discriminated against with standard applications. Second, if discrimination is not present with standard <b>applications,</b> anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> have no effect on interview invitation probabilities. Third, if instruments such as affirmative action are applied through which minority groups actually benefit from higher interview invitation probabilities with standard applications, the introduction of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> may cause interview invitation probabilities of minority groups to decrease. Given that the hiring processes are very heterogeneous (sometimes even within the same organization) with respect to the type of vacancy, the method that is used to make sensitive information anonymous and the number of applicants, we conduct our analysis separately for each hiring process. Results on the effects of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> are for one example recruitment process reported in Section 3.3, and for all processes in Section 3.4.|$|R
30|$|Considering {{the future}} {{perspective}} of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> naturally {{leads to the}} following questions: When do anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> work? And when do they not work? It is generally true that the instrument of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> only has potential {{if there is a}} relevant initial size of discrimination. Additionally, as mentioned before, one should keep in mind that anonymity shifts the focus towards skills and qualifications. However, do minority groups have equal access to those? Anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> are clearly not a universal remedy to any type of discrimination related to the professional life.|$|R
30|$|Next {{to these}} {{relatively}} large-scale experiments, a smaller-scale experiment provides additional insights {{on the effects}} of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> Krause et al. (2012 a) analyze a randomized experiment at a European economic research institution. Data on interview invitations is empirically analyzed for a particular labor market of economists who apply for post-doctoral positions. Results indicate that anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> are in general not associated with a different invitation probability. However, whereas female applicants have a higher probability to receive an invitation than male applicants with standard applications, this difference disappears with anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> The underrepresented gender is thus hurt by anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> Small-scale <b>applications</b> of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> can also be found in other countries such as Switzerland and Belgium. However, these applications have in common that no rigorous empirical evaluations are available (yet).|$|R

As a result, Clarke was suspended by the council on 6 August 2015. In giving evidence the DVLA admitted its self-declaration system had a weakness, since it allowed applicants to be assessed by either an employer-appointed occupational-health doctor or their own GP, and occupational-health doctors would not usually {{have access to the}} applicant's medical records.|$|E
30|$|The {{effects of}} {{anonymous}} <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> in this organization {{can therefore be}} summarized as follows. First, female applicants and individuals with a migration background have the same chances to receive an interview invitation with anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> Second, the effects of introducing anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> differ for female applicants and applicants with a migration background. The latter group seems to benefit from anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> The interview invitation probability of migrants is significantly higher when their applications are anonymously reviewed, at least based on the comparison with the previous year’s recruitment process. This result {{could be interpreted as}} the first type of a causal effect, namely that previously existing discrimination is eliminated. However, our results indicate the opposite effect for female applicants. At least when we use the second potential control group in this example, women are significantly less likely to receive an interview invitation with anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> than with standard applications. This could indicate that previous affirmative action to promote the chances of female applicants is not possible anymore when the applicant’s gender is unknown. The effects of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> therefore depend by and large on the initial situation.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the ongoing and lively debate about anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications.</b> Can this instrument prevent employers from hiring discrimination? And if so, what are the related costs? We first summarize the main findings of experiments with anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> in Europe in Section 2 and present novel empirical results from the recent German experiment in Section 3. Against this background, we then comprehensively discuss and analyze the potentials and limits of anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> in Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.|$|R

State {{officials}} castigated the hospital for failing to report a nonfatal insulin overdose, administered by Cullen, in August. An investigation into Cullen's employment history revealed past suspicions about his involvement with prior deaths. Somerset Medical Center fired Cullen on October 31, 2003, ostensibly for lying on his <b>job</b> <b>application.</b> Fellow nurse Amy Loughren alerted the police after becoming alarmed about Cullen's records of accessing drugs and links to patient deaths.

Apart from Alito's written 1985 statement of membership of CAP on a <b>job</b> <b>application,</b> which Alito says was truthful, there is no other documentation of Alito's involvement with or contributions in the group.

30|$|Anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> {{appear as}} an {{attractive}} policy instrument to combat hiring discrimination. Nevertheless, {{they are very}} controversially discussed in the public debate. Our paper backs this discussion by reconsidering the available empirical evidence from field experiments testing anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> in Europe. Against this background, we discuss the potentials and limits of this approach. We particularly focus on novel evidence from an experiment organized by the German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency. Results show that anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications</b> can be practically implemented, but they also show that the method of implementation is crucial. Standardized application forms which are completed by the applicants appear as {{the most effective and}} efficient way to make applications anonymous. Results show moreover that with anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications,</b> all applicant groups have the expected equal chances to receive an interview invitation in nearly all recruitment processes. When analyzing the effects of introducing anonymous <b>job</b> <b>applications,</b> we find that anonymous hiring can reduce discrimination—if discrimination is present beforehand. Anonymous hiring can also have no effects if no discrimination exists initially, and it can even prevent the employer from applying measures such as affirmative action, at least in the first stage of the hiring process.|$|R

25|$|Badger (voiced by Andy Cunningham, {{operated}} by Andy Cunningham + others) - Badger {{is named after}} what he is - a badger. He is anthropomorphic - {{he has the ability}} to talk and wears smaller versions of human clothes (including his trademark red beret and red and white patterned neckerchief) and is obsessed with mashed potato, which he likes to play with as well as eat. Because he has a low, booming voice, he has a laugh that's similar to boxer Frank Bruno. He gets Simon into trouble much of the time by playing around with mashed potato because some of the characters do not know about Badger, so instead Simon gets the blame for Badger's mishaps. It is Badger's child-like inability to continually behave that gets him into trouble with Simon, when Simon has to take the blame for many of Badger's antics to try and keep Badger secret. However Badger is still a very good friend to Simon and tries to help him out every way he can. All this said, however, Badger still exhibits the natural instincts of a badger beyond simply his physical limitations by being a badger. For example he still pinches and eats various items that he isn't supposed to in situations when it isn't exactly helpful. On two occasions he has eaten smashed up cake at completely inappropriate times and on another he ate a biro pen when Bodger got one out to fill out a <b>job</b> <b>application</b> form. He can also run very fast (badgers can run up to 19mph) and can frequently be heard scuttling away from any given situation or location.|$|E
25|$|Salam {{very early}} {{established}} a reputation throughout the Punjab and {{later at the}} University of Cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation (entrance) examination at the Punjab University. He won a full scholarship to the Government College University of Lahore, Punjab State. Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in Urdu and English literature in which he excelled. But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration. Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on Srinivasa Ramanujan's problems in mathematics, and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944. His father wanted him to join Indian Civil Service. In those days, the Indian Civil Service was the highest aspiration for young university graduates and civil servants occupied a respected place in the civil society. Respecting his father's wish, Salam tried for the Indian Railways but did not qualify for the service as he failed the medical optical tests because he had worn spectacles since an early age. The results further concluded that Salam failed a mechanical test required by the railway engineers to gain a commission in Indian Railways, and moreover that Salam {{was too young to}} compete for the job. Therefore, Indian Railways rejected Abdus Salam's <b>job</b> <b>application.</b> While in Lahore, Abdus Salam went on to attend the graduate school of Government College University. He received his MA in Mathematics from the Government College University in 1946. That same year, he was awarded a scholarship to St John's College, Cambridge, where he completed a BA degree with Double First-Class Honours in Mathematics and Physics in 1949. In 1950, he received the Smith's Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to Physics. After finishing his degrees, Fred Hoyle advised Salam to spend another year in the Cavendish Laboratory to do research in experimental physics, but Salam had no patience for carrying out long experiments in the laboratory. Salam returned to Jhang, Punjab (now part of Pakistan) and renewed his scholarship and returned to the United Kingdom to do his doctorate.|$|E
