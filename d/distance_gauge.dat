40|$|AbstractOptic flow fields provide rich {{information}} about the observer’s self-motion. Besides estimation of the direction of self-motion human observers are also able to discriminate the travel distances of two self-motion simulations. Recent {{studies have shown that}} observers estimate the simulated ego velocity of the self-motion simulation and integrate it over time. Thus, observers use a 3 -D percept of the ego motion through the environment. In the present work we ask if human observers are able to use this 3 -D percept of the motion simulation to build up an internal representation of travel distance and indicate it in a static scene. We visually simulated self-motion in different virtual environments and asked subjects to indicate the perceived distances in terms of static virtual intervals on the ground. The results show that human observers possess a static <b>distance</b> <b>gauge,</b> but that they undershoot the travel distances for short motion simulations. In further experiments we changed the modality of the distance indication but the undershoot in distance estimation remained. This suggests that the undershoot is linked to the perception of the optic flow field...|$|E

An endoscope {{was used to}} visualize adenomas in CPC;Apc mice weekly for 10 weeks. The lesion surface areas were measured using a <b>distance</b> <b>gauge</b> and digitally generated grid. Coronal scans were performed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to localize adenomas, and tumor volumes were measured from regions of interest drawn on consecutive axial scans. Rapamycin (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally daily for 5 weeks. Endoscopy and MRI were performed weekly to monitor adenoma regression. Caliper measurements and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on adenomas postmortem. Dimensions from n = 30 adenomas in n = 7 animals were measured. Adenoma surface areas on endoscopy correlated with volumes on MRI and with postmortem caliper measurements, R 2 = 0. 84 and R 2 = 0. 81, respectively. The mean adenoma doubling times on endoscopy and MRI were 0. 95 ± 0. 14 and 1. 21 ± 0. 16 weeks, respectively. The minimum detectable adenoma surface area and volume on endoscopy and MRI was 0. 69 mm 2 and 1. 76 mm 3, respectively. On histology, the rapamycin-treated adenomas showed limited regions of dysplasia. Rapamycin therapy resulted in much lower mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and cell proliferation. Lower expression of phospho-S 6 and reduced numbers of Ki 67 -positive cells were seen on IHC compared to vehicle-treated lesions.

40|$|The {{temporal}} evolution of snowpacks {{is important for}} avalanche forecasts and flood predictions. Especially in complex alpine terrain, such as avalanche starting zones, it is until now difficult to derive continuous and non-destructive information on snow parameters. In our previous work, we already demonstrated the feasibility to quantitatively derive snowpack properties and monitor their evolution in time using an upward-looking ground penetrating radar (upGPR) that was buried underneath the snow. To determine some properties, we still needed additional information such as independently measured snow height. To overcome these limitations, we present two promising methods: (1) We combined the upGPR travel-time information with tomographic GPS signal strength losses. This combination allowed determining liquid water content, snow height and snow water equivalent from beneath the snow cover without using external information. The snow parameters derived by combining upGPR and GPS data are in good agreement with conventional sensors as e. g. laser <b>distance</b> <b>gauges</b> or snow pillows. As the GPS sensors are cheap, they can easily be installed in parallel with upGPR systems. (2) To fully exploit the information content of upGPR data, and thus to at least partially compensate {{for the lack of}} information, we applied full-waveform inversion (FWI) techniques. We refined the model of the snowpack by repeated forward modeling the waveforms and updating the model parameters to match it with recorded data. This allowed us to determine the density and the liquid water content for each layer in the snowpack. Both approaches show a high potential for alpine management tasks...|$|R
