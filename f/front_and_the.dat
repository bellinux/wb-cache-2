5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and underwear cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|Although {{taken by}} surprise, Kesselring moved rapidly {{to regain control}} of the situation, {{summoning}} Generaloberst Eberhard von Mackensen's Fourteenth Army headquarters from northern Italy, the 29th and 90th Panzergrenadier Divisions from the Cassino <b>front,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 26th Panzer Division from Tenth Army. OKW chipped in some divisions from other theatres. By February, Kesselring was able to take the offensive at Anzio but his forces were unable to crush the Allied beachhead, for which Kesselring blamed himself, OKW and von Mackensen for avoidable errors.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back of the body, and branch to organs including the lophophore at the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area.

It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E

5|$|Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to {{contribute}} poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes, {{making him the}} only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an Imagist. Marianne Moore also became associated with the group during this period. However, with World War I as a backdrop, the times were not easy for avant-garde literary movements (Aldington, for example, {{spent much of the}} war at the <b>front),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the Imagists as a movement.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Khalid divided his mobile guard {{into two}} {{divisions}} and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left center, while the infantry of the Muslim right center attacked from front. Under this three-pronged flanking manoeuvre, the Byzantines fell back. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking from the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cavalry reserve attacking the northern {{flank of the}} Byzantine left wing. As the Byzantine left center retreated under three-pronged attacks of Khalid, the Byzantine left wing, having been exposed at its southern flank, also fell back.|$|E

5|$|Phase 2: Vahan, {{noticing the}} huge cavalry {{maneuver}} of the Muslims, ordered his cavalry to group together, {{but was not}} quick enough; before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flank {{while they were still}} moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate.|$|E

5|$|After the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Ante Pavelić, {{the leader of the}} newly created Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), offered Adolf Hitler volunteers to serve on the Eastern Front. This offer soon resulted in the formation and deployment of army, air force and naval detachments which, after being trained and equipped by Germany, were committed to fighting the Red Army. The largest element was the 369th Croatian Reinforced Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 100th Jäger Division, but was decimated at Stalingrad in January 1943. The Croatian forces performed creditably on the Eastern <b>Front,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Germans continued to support the development of NDH forces with the aim of raising several divisions to serve there. Due to the lack of trained leaders and staff, these divisions were raised using a German cadre.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} January, the KPA II Corps was {{decimated}} {{during its}} guerrilla operations, and its estimated strength was reduced from 16,000 to 8,000. The KPA V Corps' attempt to capture Wonju had also resulted in crippling casualties, and its estimated strength was reduced from 32,000 to 22,000 {{by the end of}} January. In contrast, the UN losses were relatively moderate during the same period. The defeat of the North Korean army enabled the UN forces to consolidate their positions along the Korean central and eastern <b>front,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> retreating US Eighth Army on the Korean western front could finally return to the offensive after its rear and eastern flank were secured. As soon as the US X Corps regained full control of the central front at the end of January, Ridgway immediately ordered the US Eighth Army to launch Operation Thunderbolt against Chinese and North Korean forces on January 25, 1951.|$|E

5|$|Dukovac did {{not meet}} further success until 25 May, when he claimed two Supermarine Spitfire V fighters {{southeast}} of Temryuk. Two days later, he and two other pilots surprised eight LaGG-3s west of Trarehof, all of them claiming one, although Dukovac's claim was not witnessed. On 30 May, he was on another He 111 escort mission when he accounted for another LaGG-3. At this juncture there were a spate of defections from 15./JG 52, with pilots flying to Soviet airfields. The remaining pilots were questioned by the Luftwaffe, the Staffel was withdrawn from the <b>front,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> commander of the HZL was replaced. This {{was the end of}} the second tour of 15./JG 52 on the Eastern Front, during which Dukovac had claimed 14 confirmed and six unconfirmed kills, five of which were later confirmed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{setbacks}} of the Russian army at {{the hand of}} Nazi Germany, Novikov and the Leningrad air forces {{took part in a}} number of strikes against the advancing German armies, including the first Soviet air operation of the war, from June 25 – 30, 1941, which cost the Germans 130 aircraft. During this time, Novikov was noted for his skill in command and for his innovation, particularly the then unknown use of radio to coordinate bomber flights. In July 1941, Novikov expanded his command from Leningrad to include air forces of the Northern Front, Northwestern <b>Front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Baltic Fleet, and as the Germans approached Leningrad, Novikov and his forces flew 16,567 sorties.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of the day B Company was subjected to intense indirect fire on the Hinge, as was C Company on Hill 317. The Anti-Tank Platoon and Assault Pioneer Platoon reinforced C Company, with a platoon of C Company moved forward to the Hinge to support B Company. At 20:00 both the Hinge and Hill 317 were again heavily shelled for 45 minutes, heralding the beginning of the inevitable Chinese counterattack. Heavy mist concealed the Chinese advance, and this assisted many to penetrate the Australian perimeter. Throughout the night of 7/8 October the Hinge was attacked on three occasions from both the <b>front</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> flanks by a force of battalion strength, however the Australians beat back the Chinese in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese swept forward, but were stopped by intense small arms and artillery fire. During one such assault Sergeant P.J. O'Connell, on seeing one of his platoon's Bren gunners wounded, manned the light machine-gun himself, breaking up a Chinese assault, while controlling the fire of the men around him. Meanwhile, Sergeant R.W. Strong arranged the resupply of ammunition to the forward Australian sections. Both were awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a two-component system of reaction-diffusion equations {{with a small}} cutoff in the reaction term. A semi-analytical solution of <b>fronts</b> <b>and</b> how <b>the</b> <b>front</b> velocities vary with the parameters are given for the case when the system has a piecewise linear nonlinearity.

Numerical results of solutions to these equations are also presented and they allow us to consider <b>the</b> collision between <b>fronts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> existence of different types of traveling waves emerging from random initial conditions.
