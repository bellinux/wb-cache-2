5|$|Because of {{the very}} brief nature of the Spanish {{occupation}} of the city, very few European artefacts were found. Those <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> that were found consisted of forged iron crossbow bolts.|$|E

5|$|Melish likely {{held back}} {{much of the}} issue for later resale, and with <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped {{somewhat}} when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by numismatic writers for greed.|$|E

5|$|Fleming's second novel, Live and Let Die {{shows that}} in his early twenties, Leiter wrote a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News. Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the {{original}} draft of the story, Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack; when Naomi Burton, Fleming's US agent with Curtis Brown, protested {{about the death of}} the character, Fleming relented and Leiter lived, albeit missing an arm and half a leg. Espionage scholar Rupert Allason, writing as Nigel West, noted that Leiter's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA's charter, as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bronze and}} silver coins have mainly {{been found in}} Aksum territory, with very <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> found in Judea, Meroë and Egypt. They are based roughly {{on the size of}} older Roman As and Sestertius in shape and thickness. The design also {{developed}} like Roman coins in first being good but then the pictures turn archaic and non recognisable. The name is unknown so it is referred to as an Æ diameter in mm Unit, like Æ17 for a coin of 17mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{very few}} remains of monastic {{architecture}} {{in the period}} are supplemented by brief documentary mentions. St Laurence's Church, Bradford-on-Avon appears to represent a unique near-complete monastic church of the period, and the angels in relief were probably {{part of a large}} rood cross group. Generally the contemporary sources give much more detail on the valuable treasures in precious metal, rich embroidered cloth, and other materials which the monasteries were able to accumulate, largely from gifts by the elite. The <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> to survive mostly did so outside England, and include the silver Brussels Cross and a walrus ivory figure from a Crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from his}} operas, Wagner {{composed}} relatively <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> of music. These include a symphony in C major (written {{at the age}} of 19), the Faust Overture (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the Siegfried Idyll for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the Ring cycle. The Wesendonck Lieder are also often performed, either in the original piano version, or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the American Centennial March (1876), and Das Liebesmahl der Apostel (The Love Feast of the Apostles), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with a <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> of dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest {{as soon as the}} last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible and what is not. The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E
2500|$|The {{team with}} <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> starts by placing pieces {{by a group}} of pyramids, one of which has the gold pyramid under it. That team may claim as many as it wishes but must leave at least one pyramid unclaimed. The team with more pieces must claim the pyramids that its {{opponent}} did not claim. At this point, the gold pyramid is revealed, and the team that has claimed it wins all the pieces that were played on the board. If teams have the same number of pieces the team that had <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> the round before places first. If teams are tied in first round, the team that won the final mission places their pieces first ...|$|R
5000|$|Special {{variations}} of Pocky include Decorer Pocky (which features extra decorative icing) and Mousse Pocky (which features extra thick, [...] "creamy" [...] mousse-like icing {{and is more}} exclusive).

50|$|Some current {{prolific}} carvers are converting from quantity to quality, making <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> of high artistic quality (as {{the market}} is flooded with lower quality quickly-made carvings). Modern carvings of superior quality sell for about the same prices as classic old original carvings of equal quality by unknown artists.|$|R
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A <b>few</b> <b>pieces</b> of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E

2500|$|In Losing chess, {{stalemate}} is {{not necessarily}} a draw [...] Depending on the variant, stalemate can be a draw, or a win for either the player with <b>fewer</b> <b>pieces</b> (a draw results if the players have the same number of pieces) or for the stalemated player.
