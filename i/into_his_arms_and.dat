At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject of}} Eliot's poem {{is drawn from}} the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (...) , and the early Christian canticle Nunc dimittis derived from it. In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be {{presented}} in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is [...] "waiting for the consolation of Israel" [...] after being promised that [...] "he should not see death before {{he had seen the}} Lord's Christ". (...) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come. This prayer would become known later as the Nunc dimittis from its Latin incipit.|$|E
500|$|Following Mark's return, Claire Crick from All About Soap commented [...] "Yay! We've {{been waiting}} for weeks and finally hunky Brennan's back on the street. All we need now is for Kate to fall <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> {{for them to be}} back {{together}} forever... Oh, hang on a minute. That's definitely not going to happen!" [...] Crick {{went on to say that}} Kate was more suited to Mark than Mason and that picking between the two should be a no-brainer. Anthony D. Langford from TheBacklot.com quipped [...] "Oh and he's kind of a goof, but Brennan is really hot." [...] In 2016, Crick (All About Soap) criticised the character for arresting his fiancée on their wedding day, saying [...] "We all know Mark Brennan can be a bit strait-laced when it comes to being a copper (has there ever been a man in Ramsay Street who takes the law so seriously?), but apprehending your own bride while she's practically waiting at the alter for you... Really, mate?!" ...|$|E

Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and compared DNA on three occasions without a match.|$|R
2500|$|By New Year 1924, Bow {{defied the}} possessive Maxine Alton {{and brought her}} father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: [...] "I didn't care a rap, for (Maxine Alton), or B. P. Schulberg, or my motion picture career, or Clara Bow, I just threw myself <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed and kissed him, and we both cried {{like a couple of}} fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful." [...] Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: [...] "She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever {{management}} kept me going." [...] Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting [...] "his big star" [...] into a scandal. When Bow found out, [...] "She tore up her contract and threw it in his face and told him he couldn't run her private life." [...] Jacobson concluded, [...] " [...] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn't cross her and you didn't do her wrong."

It turned {{out that he had}} surgically inserted a Penrose drain <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> filled it with foreign blood and anticoagulants.|$|R
5000|$|Leila Norako {{agrees with}} Manion’s view and elaborates upon {{it in her}} 2013 article “Sir Isumbras and the Fantasy of Crusade,” even arguing that Sir Isumbras belongs in the further {{sub-category}} of “recovery romance.” [...] She notes the connection between Isumbras carving a cross <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> taking of the cross by crusaders. [...] Furthermore, she posits that Sir Isumbras represents a cultural fantasy that belied {{the reality of a}} divided Christendom and powerful Islamic enemy.|$|R

60|$|He {{came close}} to her <b>and</b> drew her <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms,</b> tenderly <b>and</b> reverently, all his shyness and awkwardness {{swallowed}} up in the grace of his great happiness. In the old garden he kissed her lips and Alice entered into her own.|$|R
50|$|In a long {{corridor}} of an underground bunker, several prisoners are marching under armed guard. As {{they approach the}} door {{at the end of the}} corridor, one prisoner seizes his chance to assault a guard, but the door opens almost immediately and several German soldiers step through to mow down the entire group, save for one prisoner who remains standing. The guards grab him and force him through the door, where he is placed on an operating table and held down as a drip is inserted <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> blood pumped <b>into</b> <b>his</b> veins. He stops moving for a short time before his eyes blink open revealing his irises have become zombified-white.|$|R

Here, she personally uses technology devised by Cliff Carmichael to gain a measure of control over Chemo, allowing her to use the toxic behemoth for the Squad's benefit. Rick Flag is revealed to have survived the events at Jotunheim and was returned to Waller, who revealed to him Rick Flag, Jr. was never anything but an alias, {{and that he was}} in reality a brainwashed soldier remade into Flag to serve Eiling's ends.|$|R
6000|$|He {{really said}} {{it in a way}} that made me take refuge for an instant in looking at my watch. [...] "Are you going back to tea?

[...] I had already again put my hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> we strolled for a little till I threw off that I was sure Mrs. Server was waiting for him. To this he replied that if I wished to get rid of him he was as willing to take that as {{anything}} else for granted--an observation that I, on my side, answered with an inquiry, though an inquiry that had nothing to do with it. [...] "Do you also tell everything to Mrs. Brissenden?" ...|$|R
