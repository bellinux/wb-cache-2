5000|$|Sometimes digital buses in {{electronic}} systems {{are used to}} convey quantities that can only increase or decrease by one at a time, for example the output of an <b>event</b> <b>counter</b> which is being passed between clock domains or to a digital-to-analog converter. The advantage of Gray codes in these applications is that differences in the propagation delays of the many wires that represent the bits of the code cannot cause the received value to go through states {{that are out of}} the Gray code sequence. This is similar to the advantage of Gray codes in the construction of mechanical encoders, however the source of the Gray code is an electronic counter in this case. The counter itself must count in Gray code, or if the counter runs in binary then the output value from the counter must be reclocked after it has been converted to Gray code, because when a value is converted from binary to Gray code, it is possible that differences in the arrival times of the binary data bits into the binary-to-Gray conversion circuit will mean that the code could go briefly through states that are wildly out of sequence. Adding a clocked register after the circuit that converts the count value to Gray code may introduce a clock cycle of latency, so counting directly in Gray code may be advantageous. A Gray code counter was patented in 1962 , and there have been many others since. In recent times a Gray code counter can be implemented as a state machine in Verilog. In order to produce the next count value, it is necessary to have some combinational logic that will increment the current count value that is stored in Gray code. Probably the most obvious way to increment a Gray code number is to convert it into ordinary binary code, add one to it with a standard binary adder, and then convert the result back to Gray code. This approach was discussed in a paper in 1996 [...] and then subsequently patented by someone else in 1998 [...] Other methods of counting in Gray code are discussed in a report by R. W. Doran, including taking the output from the first latches of the master-slave flip flops in a binary ripple counter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sampling is {{a common}} way to collect {{execution}} information with performance <b>event</b> <b>counters.</b> However, the sampling data generated from performance <b>event</b> <b>counters</b> tend to be massive if sampling with high frequencies. Storing and processing {{a large amount of}} sampling data require much disk space and computing time. In this paper, we propose the online linear regression method {{to reduce the size of}} the sampling data. Our idea is to fit the sampling data with a series of straight lines. Each line represents the variation trend of the sample values within the corresponding section. Then we store the parameters of the lines instead of the sample values, resulting in a reduction of the sampling data size. The SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks are tested to verify the proposed online linear regression method. The experimental result shows the online linear regression method can reduce the sampling data size effectively with a low overhead, and retain the variation characteristic of the sampling data with a normalized estimated standard deviation less than 0. 1.

40|$|Scalability of {{the core}} {{frequency}} is a common feature of low-power processor architectures. Many heuristics for frequency scaling were proposed {{in the past to}} find the best trade-off between energy efficiency and computational performance. With complex applications exhibiting unpredictable behavior these heuristics cannot reliably adjust the operation point of the hardware because they do not know where the energy is spent and why the performance is lost. Embedded hardware monitors in the form of <b>event</b> <b>counters</b> have proven to offer valuable information in the field of performance analysis. We will demonstrate that counter values can also reveal the power-specific characteristics of a thread. In this paper we propose an energy-aware scheduling policy for non-real-time operating systems that benefits from <b>event</b> <b>counters.</b> By exploiting the information from these counters, the scheduler determines the appropriate clock frequency for each individual thread running in a time-sharing environment. A recurrent analysis of the thread-specific energy and performance profile allows an adjustment of the frequency to the behavioral changes of the application. While the clock frequency may vary in a wide range, the application performance should only suffer slightly. Because of the similarity to a car cruise control, we called our scheduling policy Process Cruise Control. This adaptive clock scaling is accomplished by the operating system without any application support. Process Cruise Control has been implemented on the Intel XScale architecture, that offers a variety of frequencies and a set of configurable <b>event</b> <b>counters.</b> Energy measurements of the target architecture under variable load show the advantage of the proposed approach...|$|R

In this paper, we present Scal-Tool, a tool that isolates and quantifies scalability bottlenecks in parallel applications running on DSM machines. The scalability bottlenecks currently quantified include insufficient caching space, load imbalance, and synchronization. The tool is based on an empirical model that uses as inputs measurements from hardware event counters in the processor.

40|$|Great Tits Parus major {{can reduce}} fruit damage in apple {{orchards}} by predating on caterpillars. A model by Mols (2003) predicted that damage reduction is mainly {{influenced by the}} hatching date of the Great Tit nestlings {{and the number of}} breeding pairs in the orchard. We tested these predictions by investigating predation pressure on caterpillars by Great Tits in various orchards. First we calculated the total number of feeding visits by Great Tits using two different methods: <b>event</b> <b>counters</b> and the daily weight gain of nestlings. For the latter method we needed to make assumptions on prey size selectivity of Great Tits to prevent overestimation of the number of visits. With the <b>event</b> <b>counters</b> we showed that the number of feeding visits increased with date and with the number of nestlings but there was no effect of hatching date on the total number of feeds over the whole nesting period. Next, we used these data on feeding visits to calculate the maximum proportion of caterpillars that Great Tits removed in organic apple orchards. The average number of three breeding pairs of Great Tits per ha removed on average 23 % of the caterpillars. This percentage can increase up to 49 % if all foraging takes place within the orchard. ...|$|R
40|$|The Time Warp {{synchronization}} protocol allows causality {{errors and}} then recovers from {{them with the}} assistance of a cancellation mechanism. Cancellation can cause the rollback of several other simulation objects that may trigger a cascading rollback situation where the rollback cycles back to the original simulation object. These cycles of rollback can cause the simulation to enter a unstable (or thrashing) state where little real forward simulation progress is achieved. To address this problem, knowledge of causal relations between events can be used during cancellation to avoid cascading rollbacks and to initiate early recovery operations from causality errors. In this paper, we describe a logical time representation for Time Warp simulations that is used to disseminate causality information. The new timestamp representation, called Total Clocks, has two components: (i) a virtual time component, and (ii) a vector of <b>event</b> <b>counters</b> similar to Vector clocks. The virtual time component provides a one dimensional global simulation time, and the vector of <b>event</b> <b>counters</b> records <b>event</b> processing rates by the simulation objects.

In this paper, we present the design and calibration of a CMOS <b>event</b> <b>counter</b> for long-term, self-powered mechanical usage monitoring. The counter exploits a log-linear response of the hot-electron injection process on a floating-gate transistor when biased in weak-inversion. By configuring an array of floating-gate injectors to respond to different amplitude levels of the input signal, a complete analog processor has been designed that implements a level counting algorithm which is widely used in mechanical usage monitoring. Measured results from a fabricated prototype in a 0. 5 -µm CMOS process demonstrate that the processor can sense, store and compute over 105 usage cycles with an injection limit approaching one single electron per second and with a counting resolution of 5 bits. This paper also presents a calibration algorithm that is used for compensating the variations which arise due to device mismatch, power supply and temperature fluctuations.
