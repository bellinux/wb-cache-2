She started the show in its 12th season and became known for her no-nonsense, hard-hitting, and often humorous advice. Vanzant's take on everything from cheating spouses to financial struggles connected with viewers and, at times, Winfrey sat in the audience while Vanzant led the show. Her books In the Meantime and One <b>Day</b> <b>My</b> Soul Just Opened Up became New York Times bestsellers.|$|E
25|$|Watson {{then spent}} {{a very brief}} period selling sewing {{machines}} for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One <b>day</b> <b>my</b> dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and {{had too much to}} drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more than a year to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to {{the tens of thousands of}} people who had to follow his rules.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one <b>day</b> <b>my</b> brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E

500|$|... "Some <b>Day</b> <b>My</b> Prince Will Come" [...] {{was written}} by {{composer}} Frank Churchill and lyricist Larry Morey for Walt Disney's animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The first jazz recordings were by Donald Byrd and The Dave Brubeck Quartet in 1957. Bill Evans has recorded the song several times. Miles Davis's rendition on the album Someday My Prince Will Come (1961) is notable for John Coltrane's memorable solo.|$|E
500|$|On 18 August 1980, after {{a show in}} Minneapolis, Ward {{quit the}} band. [...] "It was {{intolerable}} {{for me to get}} on the stage without Ozzy. And I drank 24 hours a <b>day,</b> <b>my</b> alcoholism accelerated". Geezer Butler stated that after the show, Ward came in drunk, talking about the things where [...] "He might as well be a Martian". Ward then got angry, and decided to pack his things, and get on a bus to leave. The group then brought in drummer Vinny Appice to replace Ward.|$|E

500|$|The British beat group Unit 4 + 2 {{released}} {{a recording of}} [...] "You Ain't Goin' Nowhere" [...] as a single in 1968 but it suffered poor sales {{as a result of}} the version released by The Byrds and consequently it did not chart. Joan Baez included a gender-switched version of the song, in which she sings [...] "Tomorrow's the <b>day</b> <b>my</b> man's gonna come", on her 1968 album of Dylan covers, Any Day Now. Australian band The Flying Circus included this song on their self-titled debut album released in August 1969.|$|E
500|$|Most {{songs from}} Back to Basics were {{inspired}} by real-life events that Aguilera had experienced. The track [...] "Oh Mother" [...] talks about Aguilera's childhood with her abusive father; its lyrical theme was compared to Madonna's [...] "Oh Father" [...] (1989). Her marriage with Jordan Bratman was the main theme of the album, with tracks inspired by the event including [...] "Makes Me Wanna Pray", [...] "Ain't No Other Man", [...] "On Our Way", [...] "Without You", [...] "Mercy on Me", [...] "Save Me from Myself" [...] and [...] "The Right Man". On [...] "The Right Man", Aguilera expresses that she has found [...] "the right man" [...] for her imagined daughter as she hopes that the child {{would not have to}} experience an abusive childhood like her, [...] "One <b>day,</b> <b>My</b> little girl will reach out her hand and she'll know I found the right man".|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other <b>day,</b> <b>my</b> girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' and I guess I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what I thought were really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E

500|$|The {{songs in}} Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were {{composed}} by Frank Churchill and Larry Morey. Paul J. Smith and Leigh Harline composed the incidental music score. Well-known songs from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs include [...] "Heigh-Ho", [...] "Some <b>Day</b> <b>My</b> Prince Will Come", and [...] "Whistle While You Work". Since Disney {{did not have}} its own music publishing company at the time, the publishing rights for the music and songs were administered through Bourne Co. Music Publishers, which continues to hold these rights. In later years, the studio was able to acquire back {{the rights to the}} music from many of the other films, but not Snow White. Snow White became the first American film to have a soundtrack album, released in conjunction with the feature film. Before Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a film soundtrack recording was unheard of and of little value to a movie studio.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} a {{tremendous}} critical success, with many reviewers hailing it as a genuine work of art, recommended for both children and adults. Although film histories often state that the animation of the human characters was criticized, more recent scholarship finds that most reviewers praised the realistic style of the human animation, with several stating that audiences will forget that they are watching animated humans rather than real ones. At the 11th Academy Awards, the film won an Academy Honorary Award for Walt Disney [...] "as a significant screen innovation which has charmed millions and pioneered a great new entertainment field". Disney received a full-size Oscar statuette and seven miniature ones, presented to him by 10-year-old child actress Shirley Temple. The film was also nominated for Best Musical Score. [...] "Some <b>Day</b> <b>My</b> Prince Will Come" [...] has become a jazz standard that has been performed by numerous artists, including Buddy Rich, Lee Wiley, Oscar Peterson, Frank Churchill, and Oliver Jones. Albums by Miles Davis, by Wynton Kelly, and Alexis Cole.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis was lyrically {{influenced}} by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs {{written for the}} album such as [...] "By the Way," [...] "I Could Die for You," [...] "Dosed," [...] "Warm Tape" [...] and non-album tracks [...] "Someone" [...] and [...] "Body of Water" [...] all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and [...] "Don't Forget Me" [...] expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in [...] "This Is the Place" [...] and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: [...] "On the <b>day</b> <b>my</b> best friend died/I could not get my copper clean." [...] "Venice Queen" [...] was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: [...] "We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen." ...|$|E

500|$|Jumpers was {{scheduled}} to appear at the National Theatre {{at the start of}} 1972, but encountered problems when the theatre's director, Laurence Olivier, called the play [...] "unintelligible" [...] before walking out during the first read-through in disgust. Despite this, rehearsals went ahead, which the cast found difficult; the play featured many scenes, a complicated script, and relied heavily on the opening scene, a sceptical speech about the existence of God which lasted 13 minutes. In his autobiography, Hordern commented: [...] "Each <b>day</b> <b>my</b> fists would sink into my cardigan pockets as I tried {{to make sense of it}} all." [...] In a meeting shortly before the opening night, Olivier complained to Stoppard that the play was overlong and, in some parts, laborious. Stoppard agreed to reduce the epilogue by half. The decision angered Hordern as it meant the extra stress of learning a new script at short notice. [...] He vented his frustrations on Wood who agreed to leave his character alone and instead to cut many of the other scenes. The final dress rehearsal also experienced disruption when the revolving stage broke down and had to be fixed half-way through. The problems had ceased by the opening performance the following evening; it was a night which Hordern called [...] "unbelievable, one of the highlights of my career". [...] The actress Maureen Lipman, who was in the audience on the opening night, said that her husband, the playwright Jack Rosenthal, had [...] "laughed so hard he thought he was going to be seriously ill".|$|E

2500|$|Although its {{legitimacy}} {{is often called}} into question, competitive marching band is sometimes considered a sport, {{due in large part}} to the physical exertion required in combination with teamwork. Many HBCU marching band fans refer to band as marching sport. Sports Illustrated considered the activity a sport in 1987, describing the Drum Corps International World Championships “one of the biggest sporting events of the summer.” In the same article, Sports Illustrated quoted basketball coach Bobby Knight, [...] "If a basketball team trained as hard as these kids do, it would be unbelievable. I like to take my players [...] to show them what they can accomplish with hard work and teamwork. Besides, once they see them practice 12 hours a <b>day,</b> <b>my</b> players think I’m a helluva lot easier.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Garner has {{campaigned for}} laws {{to protect her}} {{children}} from paparazzi. [...] "There's an idea that because our pictures are everywhere that we are complicit in it. When really what happens is they're waiting outside our door every single <b>day.</b> <b>My</b> kids take karate for example, and we have our classes {{at the same time}} every week. So the guys know when we have karate, and so 20 of them wait there for us every single class. So that's a lot of energy coming at little, little kids." [...] In August 2013, Garner testified alongside Halle Berry before the California Assembly Judiciary Committee in support of a bill that would protect celebrities' children from harassment by photographers. The bill passed in September 2013 and is now California law.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Paul Fedor and it premiered on August 6, 2002, on MuchMusic USA's show Oven Fresh, which highlights new videos. The video {{was shot in the}} California desert on May 23, 2002. Jared Leto had an idea about kids hearing something from the ground, about mud. Fedor explained that was difficult shot the video, and commented [...] "this video was my hey <b>day....</b> <b>my</b> apex.... the day I went Erich von Stroheim." [...] The music video features the band members in a desert-mud based set where people are digging in mud pits. The band are playing in a ditch where others are watching them. Near the end of the video, {{what appears to be a}} SWAT team arrives and begins taking control of the area, hosing down the diggers. The band's logos are shown different times on a stone-based plate.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{followed}} up with Duty Now for the Future in 1979, which moved the band more towards electronic instrumentation. While not as successful as their first album, it did produce some fan favorites with the songs [...] "Blockhead" [...] and [...] "The <b>Day</b> <b>My</b> Baby Gave Me a Surprize" [...] , {{as well as a}} cover of the Johnny Rivers hit [...] "Secret Agent Man". [...] "Secret Agent Man" [...] had been recorded first in 1974 for Devo's first film and performed live as early as 1976. In 1979, Devo traveled to Japan for the first time, and a live show from this tour was partially recorded. Devo appeared on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert in 1979, performing [...] "Blockhead", [...] "Secret Agent Man", [...] "Uncontrollable Urge", and [...] "Mongoloid". Also in 1979, Rhino—in conjunction with the LA radio station KROQ-FM—released Devotees, a tribute album. It contained a set of covers of Devo songs interspersed with renditions of popular songs in Devo's style.|$|E
