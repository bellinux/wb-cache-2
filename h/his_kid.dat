In 2014, IGN ranked him as the eighth greatest anime character of all time, saying that [...] "In Edward we had a character who was truly multidimensional. He could be comedic and pull off wild takes and sight gags. He could be placed in the most tragic circumstances and portray the deepest kind of sadness. He could be a complete badass, but he could also be the nicest guy on the planet." [...] Several pieces of merchandise have been released in Edward's likeness, including plush toys, action figures, and key-chains. Vic Mignogna, who performs the voice of Edward in the English dub, was the winner in American Anime Awards in the category [...] "Best Actor" [...] for voicing Edward.

2500|$|Not Fade Away (2012), Chase's {{feature film}} debut, was {{released}} on December 21, 2012. It centers on the lead singer of a teenage rock 'n' roll band (played by John Magaro) in 1960s New Jersey. Described as [...] "a music-driven coming-of-age story," [...] the film reunites Chase with James Gandolfini (former star of Sopranos), who co-stars as Magaro's father. Other cast members include Bella Heathcote, Christopher McDonald, Molly Price, Lisa Lampanelli, Jack Huston and Brad Garrett.

2500|$|Critics {{have also}} {{commented on the}} voice acting for Madeline {{and its impact on}} the player. In Blasko's opinion, Madeline's {{constant}} giggling, pirouetting, skipping, and smiling reflected the programmers' awareness of the games' intended, female audience. [...] Writers in two SuperKids reviews found Madeline's accent and [...] "encouraging, praising, and giggling" [...] attitude to be endearing, but Hwan-Chi questioned if she would deter a male audience. AllGames Lisa Karen Savignano compared the repeated phrases used by Madeline to congratulate the player to [...] "fingernails down a blackboard" [...] and advised [...] "invest in a good pair of earplugs" [...] before playing the game. Foran wrote that players may get annoyed by Madeline's [...] "phony accent and endless saccharine praise", and Lynne Touhy from The Daily Gazette called the repetition of the [...] "You are so clever" [...] sentiment in Madeline's [...] "French-accentuated, high-pitched" [...] voice to be a deterrent to the player. Ray praised the characterization of Madeline, but found that her faux French accent proved annoying to <b>his</b> <b>kid</b> play-testers. Jeffrey Branzburg wrote in Technology & Learning that young players may have difficulty understanding her French accent, while Macworld suggested her [...] "exaggerated French accent can be hard on the ears [...] annoying". Meanwhile, New Straits Times Rhonwyn Hwan-Chi thought Madeline spoke [...] "flawless (although accented) English." [...] The Herald Sun wrote that she speaks [...] "in the worst fake French accent imaginable." [...] Home PC suggested that Christopher Plummer's narration [...] "frees children who have not yet learned to read from the feelings of frustration that come with stumbling through printed directions." ...|$|E

60|$|In the 'flush times' of steamboating, a {{race between}} two {{notoriously}} fleet steamers was {{an event of}} vast importance. The date was set for it several weeks in advance, and from that time forward, the whole Mississippi Valley {{was in a state}} of consuming excitement. Politics and the weather were dropped, and people talked only of the coming race. As the time approached, the two steamers 'stripped' and got ready. Every encumbrance that added weight, or exposed a resisting surface to wind or water, was removed, if the boat could possibly do without it. The 'spars,' and sometimes even their supporting derricks, were sent ashore, and no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground. When the 'Eclipse' and the 'A. L. Shotwell' ran their great race many years ago, it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the fanciful device which hung between the 'Eclipse's' chimneys, and that for that one trip the captain left off <b>his</b> <b>kid</b> gloves and had his head shaved. But I always doubted these things.|$|E
