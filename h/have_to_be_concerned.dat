Ramsey Isler of IGN wrote mixed {{comments about the}} season, saying, [...] "There {{was a time when}} [...] was one of the funniest shows on TV; it was comedy gold. But somewhere along the line, the show's shine faded, its image was tarnished, and the magic disappeared", but added, [...] "That's not to say that FG hasn't been good at all lately. Season 8 certainly had a few good episodes including the season opener, [...] "Road to the Multiverse", which had a clever premise that was executed well. But after the first episode, the quality of the stories started to decline". He listed [...] "Brian's Got a Brand New Bag", [...] "Jerome Is the New Black", [...] "Go Stewie Go", [...] "Peter-assment" [...] and [...] "April in Quahog" [...] as the worst episodes of the season. Isler praised the [...] "tail end of the season", however, citing [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as [...] "one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] In his review for the Family Guy volume eight DVD, Frank Rizzo of DVD Talk said, [...] "The episodes stand on their own, whether you care about the dependence on easy gags and gimmicky concepts or not, because they are simply funny." [...] Rizzo commented on the DVD release: [...] "Fans of Family Guy, or any of MacFarlane's series for that matter, <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> that the very reason the series continues to air, the DVDs the fans buy, are getting diluted and weakened, especially when you're getting less extras, less MacFarlane, and, for the first time, less of the commentaries that give you a peek into the show's creation." ...|$|E

Military family housing neighborhoods often have churches, schools, banks, service stations, recreational facilities and stores. PMQ housing consists of apartments, row houses, duplex or detached houses. Family size, rank of the serviceman and the particular station dictate what type of housing is provided. Base housing is convenient because military members moved frequently and so members do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> with constantly selling and buying a house; members only need to pay rent.

Thus, Germany would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>concerned</b> about the newly independent states to the East, sitting between Germany and its goal of Russian territory.
