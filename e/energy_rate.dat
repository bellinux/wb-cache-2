5000|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>rate</b> {{density is}} {{actually}} a general term that is equivalent to more specialized terms used by many different disciplinary scientists.

Interdisciplinary researchers prefer to use the general term, <b>energy</b> <b>rate</b> density, not only to stress the intuitive notion of energy flow (in contrast to more colloquial connotations of the word [...] "power"), but also to unify its potential application among all the natural sciences, as in the cosmology of cosmic evolution.|$|E

To provide habitable indoor conditions without air-conditioning during heatwave, residential building energy efficiency need to be upgraded. The aim of this research is to investigate the possible correlation of building <b>energy</b> <b>rating</b> upgrading with heat-related health hazard during heatwave, with case data drawing from Melbourne, Australia. Using building simulations, indoor heat stress conditions of different <b>energy</b> <b>rated</b> houses were calculated using wet bulb globe temperature and discomfort index under the Melbourne 2009 heatwave conditions. The results showed that during three days heatwave period, residents of 0. 9 star <b>energy</b> <b>rated</b> house were exposed to extreme heat stress conditions for almost 25 h compared to only 6 h experienced by the occupants of 5. 4 star <b>energy</b> <b>rated</b> house.

Despite {{the fact that the}} investment for buildings is higher than most of those equipment, only developed countries and few developing countries have developed their own energy ratings or certifications for buildings. Nevertheless, energy efficiency in building sector is utmost important as it accounts more than one fifth of annual energy consumption worldwide. <b>Energy</b> efficiency <b>rating</b> system can be considered as a key policy instrument that will assist government to reduce the <b>energy</b> consumption. <b>Energy</b> <b>rating</b> includes the direct benefits such as, energy requirement and CO 2 emission reduction; increase the public awareness regarding energy issues; cost reduction for the users and improve the available data for the building.

50|$|Notable among {{quantitative}} {{efforts to}} describe cosmic evolution are Eric Chaisson's research efforts {{to describe the}} concept of energy flow through open, thermodynamic systems, including galaxies, stars, planets, life, and society. The observed increase of <b>energy</b> <b>rate</b> density (energy/time/mass) among {{a whole host of}} complex systems is one useful way to explain the rise of complexity in an expanding universe that still obeys the cherished second law of thermodynamics and thus continues to accumulate net entropy. As such, ordered material systems—from buzzing bees and redwood trees to shining stars and thinking beings—are viewed as temporary, local islands of order in a vast, global sea of disorder. A recent review article, which is especially directed toward big historians, summarizes much of this empirical effort over the past decade.|$|E
50|$|One {{striking}} {{finding of}} such complexity studies is the apparently ranked order among all known material {{systems in the}} universe. Although the absolute energy in astronomical systems greatly exceeds that of humans, and although the mass densities of stars, planets, bodies, and brains are all comparable, the <b>energy</b> <b>rate</b> density for humans and modern human society are approximately a million times greater than for stars and galaxies. For example, the Sun emits a vast luminosity, 4x1033 erg/s (equivalent to nearly a billion billion billion watt light bulb), {{but it also has}} a huge mass, 2x1033 g; thus each second an amount of energy equaling only 2 ergs passes through each gram of this star. In contrast to any star, more energy flows through each gram of a plant's leaf during photosynthesis, and much more (nearly a million times) rushes through each gram of a human brain while thinking (~20W/1350g).|$|E
