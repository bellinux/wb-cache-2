25|$|The hand-cranked churn, {{which also}} uses ice and salt for cooling, {{replaced}} the pot-freezer method. The exact {{origin of the}} hand-cranked freezer is unknown, but the first U.S. patent for one was #3254 issued to Nancy Johnson on 9 September 1843. The hand-cranked churn produced smoother ice cream than the pot <b>freezer</b> <b>and</b> did it quicker. Many inventors patented improvements on Johnson's design.|$|E

When police left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain, and this proved fatal. His head was retained in the <b>freezer</b> <b>and</b> his body dismembered.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, the American {{standard}} of living was the highest among the industrial countries, according to the OECD. Out of the 85 million households in the United States, 64% owned their own living quarters, 55% had at least two TV sets, and 51% {{had more than one}} vehicle. In terms of possession of telephones, TV sets, school enrollments, animal protein in diets, and energy consumption, the United States was far ahead of other industrialized countries. Wealthy and middle class and a majority of poor Americans had higher after-tax incomes than their counterparts almost anywhere else in the world. By 1985, the US per capita income was $11,727, one of the highest among industrialized countries. By the mid-1980s, 98% of all households had a telephone service, 77% a washing machine, 45% a <b>freezer,</b> <b>and</b> 43% a dishwasher.|$|E

The then-unnamed water park was scheduled to open in December 2006. In April 2006, Dreamworld's internal Blue Lagoon was closed. At around the same time, Dreamworld began constructing a Wave Loch FlowRider on Ocean Parade. It was constructed on part of the site of the former Thunderbolt roller coaster which was removed in 2004.

500|$|In 2001, the FSIS {{approved}} the gaseous disinfection system {{as an intermediate}} step before the roller press <b>freezer,</b> <b>and</b> {{approved the}} disinfected product for human consumption, as an additive. The FSIS agreed with BPI's suggestion that ammonia was a [...] "processing agent" [...] which {{did not need to}} be listed on labels as an ingredient. FSIS microbiologists Carl Custer and Gerald Zirnstein stated that they argued against the product's approval for human consumption, saying that it was not [...] "meat" [...] but actually [...] "salvage", and that the USDA should seek independent verification of its safety, but they were overruled. In 2003, BPI commissioned a study of the effectiveness and safety of the disinfection process; the Iowa State University researchers found no safety concern in the product or in ground beef containing it.|$|E

2500|$|Cryopreservation {{in humans}} {{with regards to}} {{infertility}} involves preservation of embryos, sperm, or oocytes via freezing. [...] Conception, in vitro, is attempted when the sperm is thawed and introduced to the 'fresh' eggs, the frozen eggs are thawed and sperm is placed with the eggs and together they are placed back into the uterus or a frozen embryo is introduced to the uterus. [...] Vitrification has flaws and is not as reliable or proven as freezing fertilized sperm, eggs, or embryos as traditional slow freezing methods because eggs alone are extremely sensitive to temperature. [...] Many researchers are also freezing ovarian tissue {{in conjunction with the}} eggs in hopes that the ovarian tissue can be transplanted back into the uterus, stimulating normal ovulation cycles. In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cryopreserved in a (Planer, UK) controlled-rate <b>freezer</b> <b>and</b> then stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated [...] after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.|$|E
