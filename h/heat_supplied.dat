The calculation in a case indicates that the change of heat production of large-scale <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> unit will not {{affect the quality of}} <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> to a certain extent. During <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> period, thermal load of <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> network shall be moderately lowered to coordinate with the in-depth peak regulation when power grid is at its low ebb, and <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> shall be moderately decreased based on characteristics of thermal storage of <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> network and buildings when the peak regulation capacity of power grid is very limited, which indicates that it is feasible and practical to help power grid go through its low ebb with the peak regulation capacity gained here.

40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>supply</b> {{industry}} {{is one of}} the economic energy industries. The <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> companies are considered local monopolies. This state is caused by customers having practically no opportunities to change the supplier or the way of heating. The reason for this is mainly the investment intensity of obtaining the technology of heating systems. The specific problem concerning the <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> companies {{lies in the fact that}} the majority of customers are households which, as a result of increasing prices of consumed thermal energy, are interested in savings. The volume of heat sales to households depends particularly on outside temperature. The customers cannot be motivated to make higher purchases because they take only as much thermal energy as they need to balance heat losses of a heated object. The dissertation thesis called 'The marketing behaviour of a <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> company in a regulated energy industry' deals with the possibilities of using marketing tools in companies that are active in price-regulated energy industry. It outlines the basic relationships that individual subjects in the <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> industry establish among themselves and it analyses these relationships. First and foremost it contains the assessment of influence of external factors on <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> companies. It points out the possibilities of using individual elements of the marketing mix in a <b>heating</b> <b>supply</b> company, a combination of elements or specific conditions in <b>heat</b> <b>supply</b> industry of only one of them. The cause of this state is seen in the fact that the product is unambiguously determined, the price is significantly regulated by state represented by the Energy Regulatory Office and the system for thermal energy distribution is firmly established. It is shown that pointed and effective use of the marketing communication tools (especially the creation of public relations, sales and advertising support) is the most effective element of the marketing mix.

If we take 6000K for {{the temperature of the}} sun and 300K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable with a stack of an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000K blackbody radiation coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the net amount of light absorbed – the stack emits radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). They found that the maximum power was 86.8% of the amount of in-coming radiation. When the in-coming radiation comes only from an area of the sky the size of the sun, the efficiency limit drops to 68.7%.|$|E
