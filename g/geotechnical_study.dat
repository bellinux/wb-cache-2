40|$|ABSTRACT: Geotechnical {{conditions}} of an underground parking {{project in the}} city centre of Concepción are described.

Two rows of anchors were designed, where the anchors installation and placement were studied in order to not disturb the different stages of construction. Tests were carried out to verify the anchor designs. It can be concluded that the excavation support solution adopted performed adequately, since no serious deformation in the Tribunals nor in the surrounding buildings nor in the services has occurred. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is {{to determine whether the}} conclusions made within the Eagle Project Mining Permit Application regarding crown pillar subsidence and hydrologic stability are defensible. Due to the difficulties associated with determining the mechanical properties of a particular rock mass, mining rock mechanics can be a subjective science. However, many best-practice data collection and analysis techniques have been established to eliminate many of the uncertainties associated with prediction of the response of a rock mass to mining. The analysis techniques used to assess the crown pillar stability of Eagle Mine do not reflect industry best-practice. In addition, the hydrologic stability of the crown pillar has not been considered. Therefore, the conclusions made within the Eagle Project Mining Permit Application regarding crown pillar subsidence are not considered to be defensible. The Scaled Span analysis conducted clearly indicates that stability of the proposed Eagle crown pillar should be a concern, although this concern has not been raised within the conclusions of the Eagle Project <b>Geotechnical</b> <b>Study.</b> Considering the sensitive nature of the hydrological environment surrounding the Eagle project, further detailed analysis is required to understand fully the expected short- and long-term crown pillar subsidence and hydrologic stability...|$|E

40|$|On June 15 1995, {{a locally}} 6. 2 -R {{destructive}} earthquake {{occurred in the}} western Gulf of Corinth and caused extensive onshore and offshore sediment instabilities. A detailed offshore geophysical survey along the Tolofonas/Eratini coastline, soon after the earthquake, revealed the existence of two major sediment failures affecting the surficial 8 and 2 m of the recent sedimentary cover. The sizes of the two sediment failures are approximately 200000 and 50000 m(2). The <b>geotechnical</b> <b>study</b> has shown that (1) the coastal sediments are stable under gravitational stresses and cyclic loading stresses induced by the 6. 2 -R earthquake and (2) the sediment failures were initiated due to liquefaction of subsurface layers. The failed sediments very quickly disintegrated and transformed to mass flows. The deformation of the failed sediment was caused by loss of sediment strength due to development of high pore water pressure induced by the earthquake. The study suggests that the alluvial fan deposits along the coastal zone of the western Corinth Gulf are susceptible to liquefaction by any earthquake event with a magnitude greater than 6 R, depending upon {{the proximity of the}} site to the earthquake epicenter. Earthquakes of magnitude 6 R are expected to occur every 22. 7 years and therefore the recurrence interval for sediment failure events is about the same. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.
