40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{an alternative}} to the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing model currently under development within ISO New Eng-land’s (ISO NE) ancillary service market. Since ISO NE’s real-time ancillary service market co-optimizes both energy and reserve products, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing is needed for both energy and reserve. A co-optimization approach for <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing requires defining com-plex pricing rules and implementing heuristics to ensure consistent binding constraints with the ex ante dispatch. In order to avoid com-plexity and uncertainty of required heuristics, a new <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> pricing schema is proposed to calculate the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> energy and reserve prices in a decoupled way while recognizing the coupling effect of energy and reserve. In the proposed approach, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> energy prices are first computed by incorporating the ex ante marginal opportunity cost of reserve in the energy offer; the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> reserve prices are then calculated by considering the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> marginal opportunit...|$|R

In contrast to previous studies that use stock returns or future operating cash flows, we use <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> intrinsic value of equity as the criterion for comparison. <b>Ex</b> <b>post</b> intrinsic value of equity is determined adopting both the discounted dividend and residual income models with <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> (future) realizations of dividends/residual income over three- and five-year horizons as inputs.
