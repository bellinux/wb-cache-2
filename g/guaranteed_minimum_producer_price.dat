40|$|There {{is a large}} {{research}} literature which quantifies the important contributions of public, private and human capital to economic growth and poverty reduction. However, studies based on the endogenous growth model tend to exclude the effects of relative prices on economic growth. This paper develops a simple growth model which details the effects of <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> support <b>prices</b> and maximum consumer issue prices on Indian foodgrain production and rural poverty, subject to a long run government budget constraint. The major structural changes in the non-stationary variables are endogenously identified over the period 1951 to 2001 and the Johansen FIML procedure is used to derive efficient estimates of important long run elasticities. It is found that a one per cent increase in the real <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> support <b>price</b> for wheat will increase real foodgrain production per rural worker by 1. 3 per cent {{in the long run}}. Similarly, a one per cent reduction in the real consumer maximum issue price for wheat (via the public distribution system) will reduce the rural head count poverty ratio by 1. 3 per cent in the long run. The government budget constraint applies in the long run whereby a one per cent increase in the <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> support <b>price</b> requires the consumer maximum issue price to increase by 1. 5 per cent. However, these prices can be moved in opposite directions to reduce poverty in the short run. A one per cent increase in the <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> support <b>price</b> is found to Granger cause the maximum issue price to fall by 1. 1 per cent in the next year. This dynamic growth analysis confirms that price policy in India since independence has importantly promoted the production of foodgrain and contributed to the reduction in rural poverty. Prices can be powerful policy instruments and the elasticity estimates contained here certainly support this view. foodgrain production, price policies, economic growth, rural poverty...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, the {{government}} of Côte d’Ivoire has pursued various reforms to cut its role in domestic and export marketing of cocoa, to create a competitive environment for the private sector, and to raise <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Despite some success, those reforms did not contributed much in raising <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> The maintenance of fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing costs and margins encouraged rent-seeking activities and led to efficiency losses. In August 1999 the government liberalized the export marketing system by eliminating public management. The reform package included: the end to mandatory export authorization, the abolition of public forward sales, {{and the elimination of}} fixed <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing margins. The paper finds that the benefits from liberalizing the export marketing system, in terms of lower marketing costs/margins and higher <b>producer</b> <b>prices,</b> outweigh costs from eliminating the public forward sales program and fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Additional results from a general equilibrium model indicate that reducing marketing costs would have had a small negative effect on aggregate welfare, but would have improved income distribution toward poorer rural areas. While Côte d’Ivoire has market power in the world cocoa market justifying a higher optimal export tax than the current one, raising export taxes may eventually reduce its market share and worsen income distribution particularly {{at the expense of the}} rural poor.

40|$|Cote d'Ivoire has {{historically}} taxed cocoa producers. Market reforms {{over the past}} 10 years have somewhat succeeded in making domestic and foreign marketing more transparent and competitive. But they have not done much to raise <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> in real terms or {{as a share of}} the FOB (free on board) <b>price.</b> Maintaining fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing costs and margins has encouraged rent-seeking and led to efficiency losses. New reform will fully liberalize the country's export marketing system by eliminating public management of exports. This means the end of mandatory export authorization, of public forward sales, and of fixed <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> <b>prices</b> and marketing margins. The new reform is expected to improve producers'incomes. The authors find that the benefits from the new reform (in terms of lower implicit taxes, lower marketing costs and margins, and higher <b>producer</b> <b>prices)</b> will outweigh the costs from eliminating public forward sales and fixed <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> Results from a general equilibrium model indicate that reducing export taxes would have a small negative effect on aggregate income but would improve income distribution for poorer rural areas.

40|$|In January 2000, {{all federal}} milk {{marketing}} orders began using {{a common set}} of product price formulas to establish milk component values and related Class prices. For roughly forty years before then, order Class prices were tied to the price paid for milk by unregulated manufacturing plants in Minnesota and Wisconsin. This paper addresses the question of how actual Class milk prices compare with prices that would have been generated by current product price formulas. A consistent set of product prices is derived and used to impute monthly Class prices from January 1991 to March 2003, when current formulas became effective. Between 1991 and 1995, formulas yielded higher Class I prices and lower Class II and Class III prices than prices actually experienced. Differences between actual and imputed prices narrowed in later years. A measure of <b>minimum</b> <b>producer</b> blend <b>prices</b> showed that, in the 13 years prior to adoption of the current product price formulas, average actual and imputed prices were almost identical. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{examined}} the transmission of <b>producer</b> <b>price</b> changes to consumer prices in Finnish beef and pork markets. Both meat varieties were studied based on monthly observations from 1981 through May 2003. According to the earlier studies price transmission can be asymmetric e. g., <b>producer</b> <b>price</b> rises move faster and/or more completely to consumer prices than corresponding price reductions. This may happen, for example, because of adjustment costs or market power. Adjustment was studied with co-integration threshold models and price change threshold models. In addition nonlinear impulse response functions were calculated based on 0, 1 € change in <b>producer</b> <b>price.</b> It {{was not possible to}} detect possible asymmetric price transmission, since the time period under study was characterized by strong structural changes in the formation of <b>producer</b> <b>prices,</b> However, the results suggest that it is the consumer price that responds to the long-term disequilibrium of the consumer and <b>producer</b> <b>prices.</b> The consumer price also reacts to changes in the <b>producer</b> <b>price</b> in the short term...|$|R
