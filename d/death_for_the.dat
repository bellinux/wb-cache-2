5|$|Chandler {{was found}} guilty of the murders, and was sentenced to death on November 4, 1994. He {{maintained}} his innocence, and continued to pursue legal appeals while on Florida's Death Row. He admitted to the Madeira Beach incident but said the sex was consensual, and that the victim changed her mind during the act. Since Chandler had already been sentenced to <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Rogers family murders, and prosecutors did not want to subject Blair to the emotional trauma of a rape trial, he was never prosecuted for Blair's rape.|$|E
5|$|In a court hearing, Vaseegaran is {{sentenced to}} <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{casualties}} and damages {{caused by the}} robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana before dismantling itself.|$|E

30|$|For animal illness sensitivity, we again draw on households’ {{explanations}} for livestock mortality. As {{reported in the}} final column of Table  8, of all animal deaths reported, animal disease was cited as <b>the</b> cause <b>for</b> 31 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> left out group, 40 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moving from group, 21 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> staying with group, and 27 % of <b>deaths</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> combining group. The staying with group is less exposed to disease transmission relative to the more sedentary groups. We can also pair the relatively low drought loss <b>for</b> <b>the</b> moving from group reported in Table  4 with the relatively high animal disease exposure reported in Table  8 for this group to interpret their smaller herds and lower mobility exposing them differently to animal loss than may be <b>the</b> case <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other groups.|$|R

5|$|The Ipswich serial murders {{took place}} between 30 October and 10 December 2006, during which time the bodies of five murdered women were {{discovered}} at different locations near Ipswich, Suffolk, England. All {{of the victims were}} women who had worked as prostitutes in the Ipswich area. Their bodies were discovered naked, but there were no signs of sexual assault. Two of the victims, Anneli Alderton and Paula Clennell, were confirmed to have been killed by asphyxiation. A cause of <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other victims, Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol and Annette Nicholls, was not established.|$|E
5|$|At the Rio de Janeiro location, {{many months}} later, Roger Moore arrived {{several days later}} than {{scheduled}} for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of kidney stones that he had suffered while in France. After arriving in Rio de Janeiro, Moore was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and make-up work, before re-boarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. Sugarloaf Mountain was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio de Janeiro, the stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his <b>death.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth, the cable was actually made of liquorice, although Richard Kiel was still required to use his steel dentures.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, {{and he may have}} been someone of high status, as his body shows little {{evidence}} of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's <b>death,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119AD, in either the Iron Age or Romano-British period. The body has been preserved by freeze-drying and is on permanent display at the British Museum, although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the Manchester Museum.|$|E

5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It is hoped the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Following her fiftieth {{birthday}} in May 1767, Maria Theresa contracted smallpox from her daughter-in-law, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. She survived, {{but the new}} empress did not. Maria Theresa then forced her daughter, Archduchess Maria Josepha, to pray {{with her in the}} Imperial Crypt next to the unsealed tomb of Empress Maria Josepha. The Archduchess started showing smallpox rash two days after visiting the crypt and soon died. Maria Carolina was to replace her as the pre-determined bride of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. Maria Theresa blamed herself for her daughter's <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of her life because, at the time, the concept of an extended incubation period was largely unknown and it was believed that Maria Josepha had caught smallpox from the body of the late empress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the land}} {{adjacent}} to Carthy's Castle is Orlagh House {{which has been}} owned by the Augustinian Order since the mid-nineteenth century and is a retreat and conference centre run by the friars. It was built in 1790 by Mr Lundy Foot, a wealthy snuff merchant, who named the house Footmount. He was also a magistrate and was instrumental in condemning {{three members of the}} Kearney family to <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder of John Kinlan, the gamekeeper at Friarstown, near Bohernabreena, in 1816. Foot was subsequently murdered in 1835, an act that was attributed to relatives of the Kearneys. In fact, Foot was killed by James Murphy, the son of an evicted tenant farmer whose land Foot had bought following the eviction.|$|E

5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{covered the}} deaths of the men with a photo essay, including photographs by Cornell Capa and some taken by the five men before their deaths. The ensuing worldwide publicity gave several missionary organizations significant more visibility, especially in the United States and Latin America. Most notable among these was the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), the organization for which both Elisabeth Elliot and Rachel Saint worked. Because of the martyrdom of her brother, Saint considered herself spiritually bonded to the Huaorani, believing that what she saw as his sacrifice for the Huaorani was symbolic of Christ's <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> salvation of humanity. In 1957, Saint and her Huaorani companion Dayuma toured across the United States and appeared on the television show This Is Your Life. The two also appeared in a Billy Graham crusade in New York City, contributing to Saint's increasing popularity among evangelical Christians and generating significant monetary donations for SIL.|$|E
5|$|Metalloproteinase {{activity}} causes hemorrhage and necrosis {{following a}} snake bite, {{a process which}} aids digestion. The activity of proteases, on the other hand, disrupts platelet and muscle function and damages cell membranes, and thus contributes to a quick <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> prey animal. The {{study found that the}} venoms of Crotalus fell into two categories; those that favored metalloproteinases (Type I) and those that favored proteases (Type II). The study stated that these functions were essentially mutually exclusive; venoms had been selected for based on either their toxicity or their tenderizing potential. The researchers also hypothesized that the reason for this dichotomy was that a venom high in neurotoxicity, such as a type II venom, kills an animal quickly, preventing the relatively slower acting metalloproteinase from digesting tissue.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, the {{governor}} of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. (Mumtaz Qadri was sentenced to <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism {{of the law and}} the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E

5|$|Roman {{slavery was}} {{not based on}} race. Slaves were drawn from all over Europe and the Mediterranean, {{including}} Gaul, Hispania, Germany, Britannia, the Balkans, Greece... Generally slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) born outside of Italy estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Those from outside of Europe were predominantly of Greek descent, while the Jewish ones never fully assimilated into Roman society, remaining an identifiable minority. These slaves (especially the foreigners) had higher mortality rates and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at <b>death</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slaves {{of the city of}} Rome was extraordinarily low: seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).|$|E
