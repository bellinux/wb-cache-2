Here, those adhesive tapes were used on steel substrates and the gluing process was studied by the method of fluorescence microscopy. The {{results of this study}} show that silicone contamination does not cause any significant depression in adhesive properties. During the gluing process, silicon oil films shrink and direct contacts between the adhesive and the substrate and, therefore, strong bonding become possible. The authors believe that steel substrates are typical of all polar surfaces and plan to prove this <b>hypothesis</b> <b>in</b> <b>further</b> studies...|$|E
40|$|Neuroblastoma is an {{embryonal}} tumor with {{a heterogeneous}} clinical course. The tumor {{is presumed to}} be derived from the neural crest, but the cells of origin remain to be determined. To date, few recurrent genetic changes contributing to neuroblastoma formation, such as amplification of the MYCN oncogene and activating mutations of the ALK oncogene, have been identified. The possibility to model neuroblastoma in mice allows investigation of the cell of origin <b>hypothesis</b> <b>in</b> <b>further</b> detail. Here we present the evidence that murine neural crest progenitor cells can give rise to neuroblastoma upon transformation with MYCN or ALK(F 1174 L). For this purpose we used JoMa 1, a multipotent neural crest progenitor cell line, which is kept in a viable and undifferentiated state by a tamoxifen-activated c-Myc transgene (c-MycER(T)). Expression of MYCN or ALK(F 1174 L), one of the oncogenic ALK variants identified in primary neuroblastomas, enabled these cells to grow independently of c-MycER(T) activity in vitro and caused formation of neuroblastoma-like tumors in vivo in contrast to parental JoMa 1 cells and JoMa 1 cells-expressing TrkA or GFP. Tumorigenicity was enhanced upon serial transplantation of tumor-derived cells, and tumor cells remained susceptible to the MYC-inhibitor, NBT- 272, indicating that cell growth depended on functional MYCN. Our findings support neural crest progenitor cells as the precursor cells of neuroblastoma, and indicate that neuroblastomas arise as their malignant progen...|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of our {{everyday}} lives, we are constantly faced with situations in which we must choose. Do we invest in the bank or the stock-market? Is a new wage deal so unfair that we should resort to a strike? These situations are elegantly described mathematically by Rational Choice Theory (RCT), which dominates the quantitative social sciences such as economics. However, unfortunately RCT often fails to predict how humans actually behave. Here I investigate choice using paradigms derived from the RCT framework, but aim to better predict actual choices by using a biological level of explanation. First, I examine simple choices that involve no social interaction, asking how choices are influenced by risk in potential outcomes, and by whether outcomes reflect potential gains or losses. The data reveal independent impacts of risk and loss on choice, findings not predicted by extant economic theories. Instead, I then harness functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to suggest a biological mechanism by which risk and loss bias approach behaviour, and test this <b>hypotheses</b> <b>in</b> <b>further</b> behavioural experiments. Secondly, I examine social choices. Specifically, I examine biological systems that enable social behaviour to respond flexibly to environmental contingencies. I investigate the neural basis of the human fairness motivation using fMRI, and show how it flexibly adapts to external social context. Next, I show how this fairness motivation adapts to changes in an individual’s internal physiological state. Finally, I show how cooperation is modulated by the androgen hormone testosterone. Overall, in light of these non-social and social findings, I propose that a biologically-based account of choice can explain choices that are not predicted by existing theory...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} Granger causality between renewable energy consumption (REC) {{and economic growth}} (EG) for USA. To accomplish this objective and to add the stronger evidence to the controversial issue, the tests were done under a new framework that embeds wavelet analysis, a novel tool, in nonlinear causality test approaches developed recently. The classical linear causality test procedure was also involved for comparison. The empirical data sources from the USA Energy Information Administration and Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) CountryData database. Sample period is from January 1993 to October 2014. The results indicate significantly the existence of unidirectional causality from EG to REC and support the conservation <b>hypothesis.</b> <b>In</b> additional, <b>further</b> evidences show that the causal relationship among them is not constant and depends on the time scale or frequency ranges, and that wavelet analysis is an important aid to capture the nonlinear causality.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{investigate}} management auditing, a thorough examination {{of an organization}} and the management in place, through an empirical research to gather data about how management audits are perceived and implemented among Geneva’s (Switzerland) business community. The board of directors {{is in charge of}} a corporation’s overall supervision. The internal auditing function works {{under the aegis of the}} board to ensure that the directors will properly execute their responsibilities as defined by corporate governance rules. Management auditing could thus be used to improve corporation performance. However, management audits are not commonly used or referred to as a tool to address corporate governance. Findings enable the authors to both explain why management audits are not commonly used or referred to as a tool to address corporate governance and generate related research <b>hypotheses.</b> Design/methodology/approach – <b>In</b> this paper, the authors rely on an ethnographic study aimed at exploring perceptions of management audits in service companies from the Geneva region. This study is based on transcripts from 85 semi-directed interviews, conducted over a three-year period, of professionals with managerial and auditing backgrounds. The economic context during these three years was consistently characterized by the Swiss and international financial crises, ensuring that the findings remain comparable over this time period. Findings – This paper identified three main factors that influence the integration of management audits into corporate practices: the degree of acceptance of the tools and requirements of management audits, the national culture and values embodied in the practice and the degree of corporate governance maturity. This paper presents the findings in the form of hypotheses that can be tested on any adoption of good corporate governance practices – not on management audits alone. Research limitations/implications – Notwithstanding the limitations due to its nature and extent, this study’s main limitation is its lack of validation of the <b>hypotheses.</b> <b>In</b> <b>further</b> research, the authors intend to use a quantitative survey to validate the research hypotheses and make statistical inferences. Originality/value – This paper contributes to the literature because it is, to the authors’ knowledge, the first study to empirically examine the significant link between management audits and corporate governance. The findings could be interesting for an international audience because they indicate possible action points that boards of directors can leverage to carry out management audits. The findings also bridge a gap between the literature on management audits and the expanding role of the internal audit function. This study also examines the way companies – in the Swiss context – understand, perceive and may be ready to apply management audits as a good corporate governance practice...|$|R
40|$|An {{influential}} suggestion {{about the}} relationship between Bayesianism and inference to the best explanation (IBE) holds that IBE functions as a heuristic to approximate Bayesian reasoning. While this view promises to unify Bayesianism and IBE in a very attractive manner, important elements of the view have not yet been spelled out in detail. I present and argue for a heuristic conception of IBE on which IBE serves primarily to locate the most probable available explanatory hypothesis to serve as a working <b>hypothesis</b> <b>in</b> an agent’s <b>further</b> investigations. Along the way, I criticize what I consider to be an overly ambitious conception of the heuristic role of IBE, according to which IBE serves as a guide to absolute probability values. My own conception, by contrast, requires only that IBE can function as a guide to the comparative probability values of available hypotheses. This is shown to be a much more realistic role for IBE given the nature and limitations of the explanatory considerations with which IBE operates...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a word extraction approach {{based on the}} use of a confidence index to limit the total number of segmentation <b>hypotheses</b> <b>in</b> order to <b>further</b> extend our on-line sentence recognition system to perform on-the-fly recognition. Our initial word extraction task is based on the characterization of the gap between each couple of consecutive strokes from the on-line signal of the handwritten sentence. A confidence index is associated to the gap classification result in order to evaluate its reliability. A reconsideration process is then performed to create additional segmentation hypotheses to ensure the presence of the correct segmentation among the <b>hypotheses.</b> <b>In</b> this process, we control the total number of segmentation hypotheses to limit the complexity of the recognition process and thus the execution time. This approach is evaluated on a test set of 425 English sentences written by 17 writers, using different metrics to analyze the impact of the word extraction task on the whole sentence recognition system's performances. The word extraction task using the best reconsideration strategy achieves a 97. 94 % word extraction rate and a 84. 85 % word recognition rate which re{{presents a}} 33. 1 % word error rate decrease relatively to the initial word extraction task (with no segmentation hypothesis reconsideration) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{sound of}} a solid body {{electric}} guitar comes from the loudspeaker transducing into sound the string velocity. Because of mechanical string-structure coupling, the string vibration, and therefore the sound, substantially depends on the lutherie parameters. This study focuses on the comparison between ebony-fingerboard and rosewood-fingerboard guitars: {{is a change in}} the fingerboard wood perceived by the guitar players? In order to test the hypothesis that it is actually perceived, a psychological investigation is carried out. Two experimental methods are used: a free sorting task with recorded stimuli from the guitars (listening test) and a free verbalisation task where the guitarists play the guitars. In the listening test, the guitarists perceive differences between guitars, but the resulting clusters do not show an ebony/rosewood dichotomy. A linguistic analysis of the verbalisations exhibits psychological descriptors that are relevant for the discrimination of the wood of the fingerboard: PRECISION (referring to how each note stands out from others), {{and to a lesser extent}} ATTACK (referring to the guitar's response to musician's gesture) and BALANCE (referring to the frequency content). This study is part of a broader project aiming at establishing an explicite relation between mechanics, perception, and lutherie. A physical interpretation of the psychologically-relevant descriptors is eventually proposed in order to use them as <b>hypotheses</b> <b>in</b> a <b>further</b> hypothetico-deductive approach starting from physics and using psychophysical methods...|$|R

To {{learn more}} about the {{etiology}} of this desease and to do further research on its different stages, especially in-vivo analysis, we need a spontaneous model for O. D. The spread of collagens in porcine cartilage ist comparable to the one in humans. Also the texture is comparable. In commercial breeding of pigs O. D. is well known. The aim of this work was to reproduce the already shown histologic features of O. D. in pigs of commercial breeding in pigs that did not undergo commercial breeding features such as mass feeding and drug applications. In order to proof their eligibility as a spontaneous model. Another task was to analyse the spread of different types of collagens in cartilage such as collagen type X in affcted cartilage. We used standardised methods of histologic analysis and immunostaining. Our results of histopathologic findings and the spread of different types of collagens support the idea that O.

40|$|The {{limbic system}} (the {{collective}} {{term for the}} brain structures that are the centers of emotion and moti-vation) functions in interesting ways in responding to music. Research into {{the question of the}} physiological effect of music on the limbic area of the brain may give insight into human emotional response to music. Insights gained from this study might provide a more thorough understanding of affective responses of human subjects to music. Howard Gardner addressed the importance of the study of emotional response to the arts in this way: Given the difficulty of determining feeling life, why introduce it into a discussion of artistic development? The answer [...] . is that feeling life has been regarded universally as a crucial component of the artistic process; any discussion of the arts that takes no account of the feelings of individuals runs the risk of completely misrepresenting the phenomena under investigation. If artists speak of communicating their feelings to others, or of portraying feelings and their forms in artistic works-If perceivers and critics have their feelings deeply affected and altered through encounters with artistic works-these are situations that merit study and explanation (1973, p. 70). Research on the limbic area of the brain is rela-tively recent (Hart, 1975, p. 66). The factors that determine emotional response to music are complex. Therefore, answers to most questions are highly spec-ulative and are often posed as <b>hypotheses</b> <b>in</b> need of <b>further</b> study...|$|R
50|$|Within {{the last}} two decades, {{researchers}} have reconsidered {{the role of the}} skull in bTBI. While it was originally considered that the skull remained static upon contact with the primary wave front, clinically significant skull flexure has been documented in vivo with rats exposed to blast waves and with model human heads exposed to blast conditions. In contact with a blast wave, the skull becomes elastic due to its deformable foundation - the external environment, the cerebrospinal fluid of the dura, and the brain itself. During a blast, the brain collides with the dynamic skull and rebounds in accordance with localized cranial pressure spikes. This trauma may account for the localized axonal injuries that characterize bTBI. Chavko et al. (2010) explored cranial position as a function of bTBI severity, finding that rats directly facing the blast wave front featured the highest intracranial amplitude and pressure duration periods (in comparison with rats perpendicular to the wave front and those facing away from the blast wave) Alessandra Dal Cengio Leonardi’s group at Wayne State University expanded upon the skull flexure <b>hypothesis</b> <b>in</b> rat models, <b>further</b> correlating increased age and body mass to increases in intracranial pressure for rats in front-facing bTBI. Chavko’s group remarked further on the role of Kevlar armor in fluid pressure damage to neurovasculature, finding that subcortical hemorrhage seen in bTBI patients has been linked to local pressurization rather than vascular hydrodynamics.|$|R
