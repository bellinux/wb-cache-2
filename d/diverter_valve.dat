25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} part of the cost of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is discharged to this hose through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a hyperbaric chamber, though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid a squeeze if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|E

40|$|Requirements were {{established}} for a conceptual design study {{to analyze and}} design an engine flow diverter system and to include accommodations for an ejector system in an existing 3 / 4 scale fighter model equipped with YJ- 79 engines. Model constraints were identified and cost-effective limited modification was proposed to accept the ejectors, ducting and flow <b>diverter</b> <b>valves.</b> Complete system performance was calculated and a versatile computer program capable of analyzing any ejector system was developed...|$|R
50|$|Various {{tools such}} as Automatic <b>Diverter</b> <b>Valves</b> (ADV), SandCats and other Tubing String and Pump Tools enhance the {{performance}} of the ESP. The majority of systems deployed in today's market are Dual ESP Systems which is a simple arrangement of two ESPs in the same well. This delivers a complete downhole system booster or back up - downtime is minimal, workovers cost less and there are savings in other operational areas. ESP Dual Systems bring a significant enhancement of well profitability.|$|R
50|$|A {{compressor}} {{bypass valve}} (CBV), {{also known as}} a pressure relief valve or <b>diverter</b> <b>valve,</b> is a manifold vacuum-actuated valve designed to release pressure in the intake system of a turbocharged vehicle when the throttle is lifted or closed. This air pressure is re-circulated back into the non-pressurized end of the intake (before the turbo) but after the mass airflow sensor.|$|E
50|$|In reverse thrust, {{intake air}} entered the bypass duct, via {{a gap in}} the cold nozzle outer wall, and went through the fan, to be {{expelled}} through the intake. A small proportion of the bypass duct air entered the IP compressor, via a special <b>diverter</b> <b>valve,</b> to sustain the gas generator. Reverse thrust was obtained by the fan going through fine (rather than feather) pitch. Engine testing took place in the mid 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Carbureted engines' {{exhaust raw}} fuel content tends to spike {{when the driver}} {{suddenly}} releases the throttle. To prevent the startling and potentially damaging effects of the explosive combustion of this raw fuel, a <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> is used. This valve senses the sharp increase in intake manifold vacuum resulting from the sudden closure of the throttle, and diverts the air pump's outlet to atmosphere. Usually this diverted air is routed to the engine air cleaner or to a separate silencer to muffle objectionable pump noise.|$|E
40|$|Static {{performance}} and acoustic {{tests were conducted}} on a two-dimensional one-third-scale augmentor flap model that simulated a cruise blowing augmentor system designed for a scale augmentor flap model that simulated a cruise blowing augmentor, which offers a degree of 150 -passenger STOL airplane. The cruise blowing augmentor, which offers a degree of simplicity by requiring no fan air <b>diverter</b> <b>valves,</b> was simulated by fitting existing lobe suppressor nozzles with new nozzle fairings. Flow turning performance of the cruise blowing augmentor was measured through a large range of flap deflection angles. The noise suppression characteristics of a multilayer acoustic lining installed in the augmentor were also measured...|$|R
50|$|The {{thyristors}} {{also had}} poor transient overcurrent capability, so another unusual {{feature of the}} scheme was the existence of overcurrent <b>diverters</b> between the <b>valves</b> and transformers, although these were later decommissioned at the Apollo station.|$|R
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, <b>diverter,</b> bypass, turbo-relief <b>valve,</b> blow-off valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|Each engine {{contained}} a <b>diverter</b> <b>valve.</b> These valves either ducted longitudinally into the horizontal thrust nozzles of the aircraft, or inward to the lift nozzles {{located in the}} fuselage. The lift/cruise engines provided forward thrust when faced horizontally and lift when faced vertically. This was {{through the use of}} the diverter valves. All 6 tail pipes had 10Â° of freedom in order to direct thrust. The fuselage engines were used when initiating VTOL flight but were turned off when the aircraft was sufficiently in flight.|$|E
50|$|Exhaust system backfires {{occur in}} engines {{that have an}} {{emission}} system malfunction, like an air injection system <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> problem, an exhaust leak, or when the catalytic converter has been removed. In some high-performance vehicles, when a driver shifts up and lets off the accelerator, the engine has a moment of running rich. This causes an incomplete burn which causes the fumes to explode in the exhaust system along with an audible pop or bang sound. This {{is a result of}} working equipment, and is unlikely to cause damage.|$|E
50|$|Parallel {{arrangements}} typically {{require the}} use of a bypass or diverted valve to allow one or both compressors to feed the engine. If no valve were employed and both compressors were merely routed directly to the intake manifold, the supercharger would blow backwards through the turbocharger compressor rather than pressurize the intake manifold, as that would be the path of least resistance. Thus a <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> must be employed to vent turbocharger air until it has reached the pressure in the intake manifold. Complex or expensive electronic controls are usually necessary to ensure smooth power delivery.|$|E
40|$|A great {{interest}} has been arising {{in the last}} decade for the sustainable supply of energy and fresh water, also due to the rapidly growing demand from developing countries. Facing this demand by traditional technologies and fossil energy sources implies evident difficulties and risks, because of the scarcity and high cost of fuels and their relevant environmental impact in terms of local pollution and global warming emissions. Then, the efforts of researchers have been focusing on alternative solutions, either based on the use of renewable energy sources and on innovative plant schemes for the combined and efficient production of several energy and material flows. In this paper an innovative renewable polygeneration system is considered, which includes: a solar field based on concentrating parabolic trough photovoltaic/thermal collectors; a biomass heater; a single-stage absorption chiller; a Multiple Effect Distillation desalination plant; two sensible heat storage tanks; Balance of Plant and auxiliary components, like pumps, mixers, <b>diverters,</b> <b>valves,</b> controllers, plate-fin heat exchangers, etc. The system is sized to cover the very base load of an isolated small community. The plant operation has been analysed in detail in previous papers; in this paper an exergetic and exergoeconomic analysis is made. As concerns the exergetic analysis, it is intended to: i) quantify the exergy destructions occurring along the whole complex energy conversion process; ii) identify the steps that mostly affect the overall exergy efficiency of the system and thus propose possible improvements. Also, as the system actually operates under dynamic conditions, the analyses are performed by adopting daily integral values of energy flows, comparing the results obtained in the summer, winter and intermediate (spring/autumn) seasons. Finally, being the installation and maintenance costs of plant components known, an exergoeconomic analysis is also performed, based on the exergy costing method. The study is applied to integral energy flows; then, the cost accounting procedure will allow one to assign a monetary value to each energy or material flow, thus representing a good premise for the future definition of selling prices...|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} device {{would remove}} bubbles of gas from {{a stream of}} liquid (typically water), accumulate the gas, and periodically release the gas, in bulk, back into the stream. The device is intended {{for use in a}} flow system (1) {{in which there is a}} requirement to supply bubble-free water to a downstream subsystem and (2) that includes a sensor and valves, just upstream of the subsystem, for sensing bubbles and diverting the flow from the subsystem until the water stream is again free of bubbles. By coalescing the gas bubbles and then periodically releasing the accumulated gas, the proposed device would not contribute to net removal of gas from the liquid stream; nevertheless, it would afford an advantage by reducing the frequency with which the <b>diverter</b> <b>valves</b> would have to be activated. The device (see figure) would include an upper and a lower porous membrane made of a hydrophilic material. Both membranes would cover openings in a tube leading to an outlet. These membranes would allow water, but not gas bubbles, to pass through to the interior of the tube. Inside the tube, between the two membranes, there would be a flow restrictor that would play a role described below. Below both membranes there would be a relief valve. Water, possibly containing bubbles, would enter from the top and would pass through either the lower membrane or both membranes, depending how much gas had been accumulated thus far. When the volume of accumulated gas was sufficient to push the top surface of the liquid below the lower porous membrane, water could no longer flow through either membrane toward the outlet. This blockage would cause an increase in back pressure that would cause the relief valve to open. The opening of the relief valve would allow both the water and the bulk-accumulated gas to pass through to the outlet. Once the gas had been pushed out, water would once again flow through both membranes at a much lower pressure drop. The flow restrictor would maintain enough pressure drop to keep the relief valve open until gas had been cleared from both hydrophilic membranes...|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (<b>diverter</b> or bypass <b>valves),</b> but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixtureâbecause the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|STCs for nonpotable {{pool water}} use are often made of plastic. Pool water is mildly {{corrosive}} due to chlorine. Water {{is circulated through}} the panels using the existing pool filter or supplemental pump. In mild environments, unglazed plastic collectors are more efficient as a direct system. In cold or windy environments evacuated tubes or flat plates in an indirect configuration are {{used in conjunction with}} a heat exchanger. This reduces corrosion. A fairly simple differential temperature controller is used to direct the water to the panels or heat exchanger either by turning a valve or operating the pump. Once the pool water has reached the required temperature, a <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> is used to return water directly to the pool without heating. Many systems are configured as drainback systems where the water drains into the pool when the water pump is switched off.|$|E

40|$|This thesis evaluates a {{configuration}} of a 3 -mode solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP), {{which features a}} heat exchanger and heat pump which may operate independently or in series to provide heat for a domestic hot water system. The system is designed to deliver heat through the heat exchanger, heat pump, or both simultaneously, with the operating mode dictated by a system controller. The configuration is evaluated in comparison to established system designs, such as electric-only, solar domestic hot water (SDHW) and 2 -mode SAHP (heat exchanger or heat pump) systems. TRNSYS 17 simulation software is used to perform year-long simulations of the systems for performance comparison purposes. Subjecting each system to the same parameters, weather conditions and draw patterns ensures that differences in performance are due to the available modes of heat delivery. The systems simulated in TRNSYS use mathematical models of physical components to model the behaviour of a real system. Most of the models used were previously validated by former student William Wagar, supporting their use here. The system includes a heat exchanger and heat pump that are connected to operate independently or in series, depending on the settings of several flow <b>diverter</b> <b>valves.</b> The inclusion of the series configuration is intended to maximize heat gains in high-demand scenarios and to extend heat pump operating hours in low-availability scenarios. A highly-detailed decision-making scheme is developed to control the system. The scheme uses measurements of available sunlight and system temperatures to predict the performance of individual components, using validated equations and specified system settings. The predicted performance values are used, in conjunction with {{an evaluation of the}} current system demands for heat, to determine the optimal mode of operation at that time. The âoptimalâ mode may be the mode which delivers the most heat, consumes the least electricity, or has the best heat delivery to electricity consumption ratio (COP), depending on the demand; the highly effective control strategy balances these priorities to achieve high solar gains and energy savings, while maintaining high temperatures in the storage tank. The behaviour of multi-mode SAHP systems, when contrasted with single-mode designs, shows that having the option to use a heat exchanger and a heat pump substantially improves solar gains and electricity savings. Such systems have the flexibility to adapt to changing weather conditions to ensure strong performance at all times. The behaviour study shows that under the current control settings, the series configuration is rarely utilized by the system. Additionally, system behaviour is dominated by the maximum heat delivery mode, with rare consideration of power consumption. A parametric study indicates that SAHP systems operate most effectively with a constant thermostat setting of 60 C. A location/climate study indicates that SAHP systems are best-suited to settings in which SDHW systems fare poorly, such as the sub-arctic climate of Whitehorse, Yukon, Canada. A highly detailed control scheme with the ability to apply several definitions of âoptimal performanceâ is shown to allow excellent system performance in comparison to single-definition designs. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the series mode is a beneficial but rarely-used option, though use of this mode may be increased if a smaller heat pump is installed. It is recommended to focus on further development of the control scheme by optimizing system settings. It is also recommended to perform tests of the system, using an appropriately-sized variable-speed heat pump, to validate the controllerâs feasibility and further advance the field of SAHP study...|$|R
30|$|The {{building}} is heated {{with the help}} of floor heating in KfW 55, Sonnenhaus and passive house and via radiators (Type 362) in WSchVO 95. With the help of an onâoff controller and a PID controller (two step), the set point for the mass flow is achieved which considers the room temperature and the desired room temperature. The heating system works such that the room is 20 Â Â°C and during night a desired room temperature of 16 Â Â°C during 22 : 00 â 6 : 00 in the nights. There assumed to be four persons living {{in the house and the}} gains are such that there is at least one person in the house and the electrical gains are also taken into the account. In addition, {{with the help of}} a <b>diverter</b> and mixer <b>valve,</b> the temperature inlet to the space heating is varied and this is done in accordance to the ambient temperature. The gas boiler is controlled such that the auxiliary volume of the storage tank is kept at 50 Â Â°C in all cases except WSchVO 95 where it is to be maintained at 65 Â Â°C. Moreover, the radiators at WSchVO 95 building require a lot of power, and radiator is an older high temperature model, and hence the gas boiler is also sized such that this is satisfied. As mentioned in TableÂ  1, the infiltration and ventilation systems were designed for each building. Along with that, the simulation of window opening during the summer months is achieved via increasing the infiltration when the ambient temperature goes above 26 Â Â°C. The self-shading and shading via overhangs are also taken into account in the simulation.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a temperature sensor and pulse duration modulation (PDM) <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> for a thermal control-mixing control device are described.

The pressure sensitivity of the sensor is approximately 0. 0019 F/kPa. The valve which was selected was tested and performed with 100 % flow diversion.

40|$|Layflat tubing, or {{flexible}} pipe, is {{used for}} both distribution and conveyance of irrigation water and has many {{of the advantages of}} rigid surface irrigation pipe. The tubing described in this article is uniquely constructed with an interior membrane so as to form a dual-conduit tube. This permits the tube to be used both for water conveyance and distribution. Manual, semi-automatic, and fully automatic diverter valves were developed to direct water flow either {{to one side of the}} membrane for distribution through outlets in the side of the tube, or to the opposite side of the membrane for water conveyance to the next irrigation set(s). In the conveyance mode, the membrane covers the distribution outlets or gates in the side of the tube. To change irrigation sets manually, the irrigator either pulls or pushes a handle on a <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> to change the tube's operating mode. This eliminates manually opening individual gates for the next succeeding set and closing all of the gates of the previous set. Valve and coupler fittings were designed to be easily assembled and disassembled. The tubing system was satisfactorily tested and evaluated on three farms.

30|$|Generally, {{there are}} two types of shower events; (1) occur in {{separate}} shower stalls, and (2) occur in shower/bathtub combinations. Each type of shower event produces a distinct pattern. A shower event from a shower/bath tub combo typically begins with a high flow rate. Then, the <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> is tripped and the flow is throttled down to a much lower rate for the duration of the shower. A standard shower stall event does not exhibit the high flow rate at the beginning or end of the shower event; also, it tended to have a relatively consistent flow rate throughout the duration of the shower event. Volume and the most frequent flow rate (mode) property are two critical features for identifying a shower event.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Experimental work {{has been carried out}} with a hydraulic flow test rig in which flows of water up to 65 kgs-l can be measured with a weigh-tank and its <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> to an accurary of Â± 0. 2 %. The nature of the experimental work has been to investigate the system pressure losses due to the components in line (i) For interference free flow; (ii) For interactions. The components used are 90 degree circular bends and orifice plates. Bends of radius ratios from R/D - 1. 49 to 4. 89 and nominally standard single-hole and multi-hole orifice plates of area ratios from m â 0. 170 to 0. 508 have been tested. To investigate the interaction effects arising from an orifice plate in proximity to bends, various bend-orifice plate (in a few instances orifice plate-bend) combinations have been arranged. The bore diameter of duct (or pipe) and bend is approximately D â 145. 05 mm and tests have been performed for Reynolds numbers ranging from Re(D) â 0. 7 x 105 to 6 x 10 (5). In those instances in which results from the experimental work can be compared directly with published results, agreement is good. However, many of the experimental results, particularly the measurements of interactions between bends and orifice plates, are new. Turkish Ministry of Educatio...|$|E
40|$|Any {{detectable}} leakage {{emanating from}} the argon storage dewar is undesirable; not only from a safety standpoint (eg, cryogenic burns, asphyxiation, etc.), but also small amounts of air back diffusing through leaks can render the argon unsuitable for the future physics experiments to take place within the cryostats. Whereas leakage {{through some of the}} control and manually operated valves on the dewar does not necessarily infroduce any of the above hazards directly, it could be high enough to be an economical, and perhaps an operational nuisance. Contained in the following is a compilation of the final leakage rates associated with the dewar during the period of January through May of 1990 and the raw data from which they were derived from. Also contained is a calculation of the total maximum allowable leakage rate int%ut of the dewar. The general strategy employed while leak checking the dewar was to eliminate all leaks found which could be relatively easily stopped and to reduce the more difficult ones to an acceptable level. Leakage past the seats/plugs of control and main relief valves in addition to leakage past the ball seals in the <b>diverter</b> <b>valve</b> fell into the latter category. Helium mass spectrometer leak detector (HMSLD), rate of rise (ROR) method, and throughput calculations based on effective pumping speeds were the means used to determine leakage rates. Usually the HMSLD method was used to detect the numerous smaller leaks (1 OE-S to 1 OE- 1 0 std eels) which were eventually stopped by thread tightening, gasket replacement. redesign, etc. The ROR method helped measure the leakage past valve plugs and establish outgassing rates for volumes deemed as being tight; ie, no detectable leakage using the HMSLD. The throughput calculation was used only to determine the relatively large leak past the plug/seat of the vaporizer valve. A sample calculation of each leakage rate determining method is attached to this note. All leakage rates are given for helium gas at one atm differential...|$|E
