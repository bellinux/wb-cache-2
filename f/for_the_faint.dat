[...] Mayall successfully completed his thesis and was awarded his PhD degree in 1934.

[...] Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible, and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again.

In the DVD volume 7 review for the anime, Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge described the fight scene between Saitō and Kenshin as [...] "definitely choreographed well". He praised [...] "the viciousness in the attacks, masked under their cold calculating facade" [...] as being [...] "wonderfully done, providing a real feel for these ultimate killers". His appearance in the OVAs has also received praise. Mike Crandol of Anime News Network states that during the character's brief appearances in the [...] OVA series, he appears to be [...] "truly menacing." [...] Mark A. Grey of Anime News Network said that the song [...] "Hoeru Miburo (Howling Wolf of Mibu)" [...] in the anime series [...] "perfectly" [...] represents the character. Reviewing the manga Restoration, Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network felt Saitō's was interesting in regards to his philosophy as it contrasted Kenshin's but lamented his lack of appearances in this version. Daryl Surat from Otaku USA considers him as the greatest character from the series based on the impact he brings to the series during his introduction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} we {{quantify}} {{the degree to}} which star-forming events are clumped. We apply a precise and accurate technique to calculate the correlation dimension Dc of the distribution of HII regions in a sample of disk galaxies. Our reliable results are distributed in the range 1. 5 ∼ < Dc ∼ < 2. 0. We get significant variations in the fractal dimension among galaxies, contrary to a universal picture sometimes claimed in literature. <b>The</b> <b>faintest</b> galaxies tend to distribute their HII regions in more clustered (less uniform) patterns. Moreover, <b>the</b> fractal dimension <b>for</b> <b>the</b> brightest HII regions within the same galaxy seems to be smaller than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>faintest</b> ones suggesting some kind of evolutionary effect. ...|$|R
