5|$|Struggle for the Land (1993; reissued 2002) is a {{collection}} of essays in which Churchill chronicles what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as the U.S. government's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians. He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent defoliation and industrial practices such as surface mining.|$|E

5|$|The {{methods used}} to {{cultivate}} crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work De Agri Cultura, which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> a simple mechanical reaper that cut the ears of wheat and barley without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposition}} {{is based}} on Galileo’s analysis of a body following a parabolic trajectory under the action of a constant acceleration. In Proposition 10, <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> it as Galileo’s Theorem, and mentions Galileo several other times in relation {{to it in the}} Principia. Combining it with Kepler's Second Law gives the simple and elegant method.|$|E
5|$|American {{televangelist}} Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> a scenario where Wall Street, the Federal Reserve System, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly {{in the direction of}} world government for the Antichrist.|$|E
5000|$|Layer of Langerhans - In {{the same}} paper in which <b>he</b> <b>described</b> Langerhans cells (dendritic cells), <b>he</b> <b>described</b> the {{granular}} {{cells in the}} exterior portion of the Malpighian layer of the epidermis, the stratum granulosum otherwise known as the Layer of Langerhans.|$|R

5|$|Around Vikram 1664 (1607 CE), Tulsidas was {{afflicted by}} acute pain {{all over his}} body, {{especially}} in his arms. He then composed the Hanuman Bahuk, where <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> his bodily pain and suffering in several stanzas. He was relieved of his pain after this composition. Later he was also afflicted by Bartod boils (Hindi: बरतोड़, furuncles caused by {{pulling out of the}} hair), which may have been the cause of his death.|$|E
5|$|Berndt Von Üxküll – Von Üxkül is a {{paraplegic}} junker from Pomerania and {{a composer}} {{who is married}} to Una. A World War I veteran, he fought alongside Aue's father in the Freikorps, whom <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as a sadist. Despite essentially agreeing with their nationalist and antisemitic ideology, he distances himself from the Nazis. His name is possibly a reference to Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, an anti-Nazi resistant and uncle of Claus von Stauffenberg, a central figure in the failed plot to assassinate Hitler.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Tribunes Pulitzer Prize-winning {{architecture}} critic, Blair Kamin, {{praised the}} incorporation of various wildlife into the decor and numeours elements of the rehab resulting from the alliance of real estate developers and historic preservationists, but {{made it clear that}} Virgin Hotels Chicago is not the Four Seasons Hotel Chicago or Ritz-Carlton (Four Seasons). <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> this as a successful recycling of a second-tier historic building.|$|E

5|$|Dawkins is an atheist, and is {{well known}} for his {{criticism}} of creationism and intelligent design. In The Blind Watchmaker (1986), he argues against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> evolutionary processes as analogous to a blind watchmaker in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any designer. In The God Delusion (2006), Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He opposes the teaching of creationism in schools.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. <b>He</b> <b>describes</b> the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>describes</b> {{the range}} of species in each group in some detail, {{concluding}} that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; he thinks there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, Silverstein {{appeared}} {{at a rally}} of construction workers and public officials outside an insurance industry conference. He highlighted what <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> as the failures of insurers Allianz and Royal & Sun Alliance to pay $800 million in claims related to the attacks. Insurers state that an agreement to split payments between Silverstein and the Port Authority is a cause for concern.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} two {{chapters}} <b>he</b> <b>describes</b> the atrocious conditions he witnessed in China. Shanghai is depicted as a squalid, noisy, and polluted den of crime, poverty, and disease, and yet still comparatively wealthy compared {{to the rest of}} the country. The interior of the country is difficult to access due to lack of infrastructure, is mostly unsafe for travel, and is wracked constantly by famine and starvation.|$|E
