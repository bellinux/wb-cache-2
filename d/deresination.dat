40|$|Abstract. Microwave {{treatment}} is a newly developed technique to expel resin from pine wood by generating high internal steam pressure. To understand {{the mechanism of}} <b>deresination</b> process during the treatment, a mathematical model was developed and was used to predict its critical conditions. The model indicated that the critical pressure inside Masson pine wood was 1. 17 × 10 5 Pa and its corresponding critical temperature was 104 0 C in order to expel the resin mixture from the interior to the surfaces. The experiment results showed that during microwave <b>deresination</b> large quantities of the resin overflowed to the wood surfaces when {{the temperature of the}} pine wood was controlled in the range 104 - 112 0 C. The result observed during the microwave treatment matched well with the critical temperature predicted from the simple mathematical model. The validated model could provide some understanding and improvement of microwave <b>deresination</b> process...|$|E

In {{order to}} find the more {{suitable}} drying schedule, this test, by adopting 100 ℃drying test method, studies the index of drying characteristics of Masson pine <b>deresination</b> wood, examines and evaluates the drying quality grade indexes.

40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{improved}} <b>deresination</b> of sulphite pulps were evaluated, namely, alkaline washing, enzyme treatment, and pulp fractionation. Alkaline washing appears {{to come at}} a high cost, because caustic is expensive and affects cellulose chain length, as indicated by lower viscosity of the pulps. Thus {{this is not a}} viable option for pulps that are sensitive to changes in viscosity. Enzyme treatment did not completely degrade the glycerides under the mill conditions used. Fibre fractionation studies showed that the fines fractions contained 8 to 13 times more residual lipophilic extractives than the whole pulps. Removing this fraction, which represents {{only a small percentage of}} the whole pulp, could reduce by about a half the amount of lipophilic extractives in the remaining pulp. Thus pulp fractionation appears to be a viable option to achieve further <b>deresination</b> of sulphite pulps...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to produce {{information}} for the estimation of the flow balance of wood resin in mechanical pulping and to demonstrate the possibilities for improving the efficiency of <b>deresination</b> in practice. It was observed that chemical changes in wood resin take place only during peroxide bleaching, {{a significant amount of}} water dispersed wood resin is retained in the pulp mat during dewatering and the amount of wood resin in the solid phase of the process filtrates is very small. On the basis of this information there exist three parameters related to behaviour of wood resin that determine the flow balance in the process: 1. The liberation of wood resin to the pulp water phase 2. Theretention of water dispersed wood resin in dewatering 3. The proportion of wood resin degraded in the peroxide bleaching The effect of different factors on these parameters was evaluated with the help of laboratory studies and a literature survey. Also, information related to the values of these parameters in existing processes was obtained in mill measurements. With the help of this information, it was possible to evaluate the <b>deresination</b> efficiency and the effect of different factors on this efficiency in a pulping plant that produced low-freeness mechanical pulp. This evaluation showed that the wood resin content of mechanical pulp can be significantly decreased if there exists, in the process, a peroxide bleaching and subsequent washing stage. In the case of an optimal process configuration, as high as a 85 percent <b>deresination</b> efficiency seems to be possible with a water usage level of 8 m 3 /o. d. t...|$|E
40|$|Washing {{after the}} oxygen {{delignification}} stage in aspen kraft pulping {{has been shown}} to reduce the extractives in pulp. It was previously shown that this can be enhanced by the addition to oxy- gen delignification of a certain generic surfactant. Further work has now been carried out to investigate the effect of a selection of commercially available surfactant blends on <b>deresination.</b> One of the for- mulations was particularly effective in enhancing extractives removal in an oxygen stage environment...|$|E
40|$|Wood extractives in radiata pine are {{the source}} of the {{observed}} pitch problems in the pulp and paper industry. Various methodologies have been studied and used to reduce or eliminate their negative effects. A biological treatment with albino fungi of the Ophiostoma genus, fungi that degrade the lipidic components of extractives, has been proposed as a more environmentally friendly alternative for pitch degradation. The current methods used to search for Ophiostoma albino strains with the highest degradation rates of wood extractives are labor intensive and require a large amount of resources. The Tween 80 ® Opacity test, an assay designed to measure lipolytic enzyme activity in filamentous fungi, was studied to verify the feasibility of its application as a methodology to rank Ophiostoma albino strains with <b>deresination</b> capabilities. The Tween 80 ® Opacity Test was first characterized by implementing a non-replicated 2 k-p fractional factorial design of resolution V for a 5 factors with 16 treatments and then to study the effect of the fungus species on the lipolytic enzyme activity; a randomized one factor general factorial design was conducted. The incubation temperature; antibiotics presence; and Tween 80 ®, CaCl 2, and peptone concentrations were investigated in the first experiment. The Ophiostoma species effect was studied in the second experiment. In both experiments, the halo area size, which was formed by the fatty acid-calcium complex precipitate, was the response variable. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the Tween 80 ® opacity test to measure the lipolytic enzyme activity of Ophiostoma albino strains. Similarly, the incubation temperature and the concentrations of Tween 80 ®, CaCl 2, and bacteriological peptone had the highest statistically significant effect on the response variable. In addition, our data demonstrated that the albino strains from the specie O. floccosum exhibited the highest rate of lipolytic enzyme production...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{surfactants}} in {{the neutral}} sulfite pulping process was studied. The mass {{transfer of the}} pulping liquor into the wood {{as well as the}} interfacial properties between the liquor and wood, and the changes in the properties due to the surfactants present in the liquor were investigated. A mixture of anionic and nonionic surfactants, effective in neutral sulfite pulping, was selected during the pulping experiments. Due to the surfactants present in the pulping liquor, the reaction rate of carbohydrate degradation was found to be considerably lower when compared with those of control without surfactants. The surfactant mixture was observed to accelerate the <b>deresination</b> process during the pulping heat-up period. However, the dissolved extractives diffused out of the wood chips at slower rate when the surfactants were present. This was a result of more micelles being formed by surfactants and dissolved extractives which also are surfactants. The sodium sulfite concentration profiles in wood after cooking indicated that the surfactant mixture could increase the diffusion process by improving the swelling of the lignin fraction. It was concluded that surfactants could modify the mass transfer mechanism. However, the experiments also indicated that the diffusion of surfactants was rather slow. Compared to the cooks with the surfactants, the reaction rates of the control cooks were found to be higher. As more of the wood components got dissolved, the more porous wood structure was developed during pulping, which explains, why after certain period of time, the sodium sulfite content of the control cook was higher. In order to obtain quantitative information on the diffusion process, the chemical profiles in wood were simulated using the diffusion model with simultaneous reactions. The simulated chemical distribution curve was adjusted to fit the measured ones by changing the effective diffusivity. Measurements of a dynamic contact angle, as well as a diameter and volume of a droplet of pulping liquor were carried out to obtain an in-depth understanding of the surfactants behavior in pulping process. The results show that the surfactants did not improve the spreading wetting but improved the absorption. This phenomenon could not be simply explained as a function of capillary pressure, in fact, the liquor containing surfactants must have been able to disperse the air inside the wood structure and therefore to reduce the resistance of air to penetration and diffusion. Finally, it was found that surfactants improved the pulp yield {{as a result of a}} slower reaction rate and faster diffusion rate, as less lignin condensation and carbohydrate degradation was observed...|$|E
