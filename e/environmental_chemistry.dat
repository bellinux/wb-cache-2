500|$|The long {{half-life}} of technetium-99 and {{its potential}} to form anionic species creates a major concern for long-term disposal of radioactive waste. Many of the processes designed to remove fission products in reprocessing plants aim at cationic species such as caesium (e.g., caesium-137) and strontium (e.g., strontium-90). Hence the pertechnetate escapes through those processes. Current disposal options favor burial in continental, geologically stable rock. The primary danger with such practice is {{the likelihood that the}} waste will contact water, which could leach radioactive contamination into the environment. The anionic pertechnetate and iodide tend not to adsorb into the surfaces of minerals, and are likely to be washed away. By comparison plutonium, uranium, and caesium [...] tend to bind to soil particles. Technetium could be immobilized by some environments, such as microbial activity in lake bottom sediments, and the <b>environmental</b> <b>chemistry</b> of technetium is an area of active research.|$|E
500|$|A {{density of}} more than 5g/cm3 is {{sometimes}} mentioned as a common heavy metal defining factor and, {{in the absence of}} a unanimous definition, is used to populate this list and (unless otherwise stated) guide the remainder of the article. Metalloids meeting the applicable criteria–arsenic and antimony for example—are sometimes counted as heavy metals, [...] particularly in <b>environmental</b> <b>chemistry,</b> as is the case here. Selenium (density 4.8g/cm3) is also included in the list. It falls marginally short of the density criterion and is less commonly recognised as a metalloid but has a waterborne chemistry similar in some respects to that of arsenic and antimony. Other metals sometimes classified or treated as [...] "heavy" [...] metals, such as beryllium (density 1.8 g/cm3), aluminium (2.7 g/cm3), calcium (1.55 g/cm3), and barium (3.6 g/cm3) are here treated as light metals and, in general, are not further considered.|$|E

2500|$|EXAFS is, like NEXAFS/XANES, {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} technique with elemental specificity. [...] As such, EXAFS {{is an extremely}} useful way to determine the chemical state of practically important species which occur in very low abundance or concentration.

2500|$|Jobs for chemists usually require {{at least}} a bachelor's degree, but many positions, {{especially}} those in research, require a [...] Master of Science or a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD.). Most undergraduate programs emphasize mathematics and physics as well as chemistry, partly because chemistry {{is also known as}} [...] "the central science", thus chemists ought to have a well-rounded knowledge about science. At the Master's level and higher, students tend to specialize in a particular field. Fields of specialization include biochemistry, nuclear chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, polymer chemistry, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, theoretical chemistry, quantum chemistry, <b>environmental</b> <b>chemistry,</b> and thermochemistry. Postdoctoral experience may be required for certain positions.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} goal of <b>environmental</b> <b>chemistry</b> is tracing {{the source and}} degradation of pollutants. [...] Various methods have been employed for fingerprinting pools of environmental pollutants such as the bulk chemical composition of a spill, isotope ratios of the bulk chemical mixture, or isotope ratios of individual constituent compounds. [...] Stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen {{can be used as}} complimentary fingerprinting techniques for natural gas. [...] Recently, the D/H ratio of hydrocarbons from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill was used to verify that their origin was likely from the Macondo well. [...] Hydrogen isotope ratios have also been used as a measure of the relative amount of biodegradation that has occurred in oil reservoirs in China, and studies on pure cultures of n-alkane degrading organisms have shown a chain-length dependence on the amount of hydrogen isotope fractionation during degradation. [...] Additional studies have also shown hydrogen isotope effects in the degradation of Methyl tert-butyl ether and Toluene that have been suggested to be useful in the evaluation of the level of degradation of these polluting compounds in the environment. [...] In both cases the residual unreacted compounds became enriched in deuterium to a few tens of per mil, with variations exhibited between different organisms and degree of reaction completeness. [...] These observations of heavy residual compounds have been applied to field observations of biodegradation reactions such as the removal of benzene and ethylbenzene, which imparted a D/H fractionation of 27 and 50 per mil, respectively. [...] Additionally analysis of o-xylene in a polluted site showed high residual D/H ratios after biodegradation, consistent with activation of C-H bonds being a rate limiting step in this process ...|$|E
