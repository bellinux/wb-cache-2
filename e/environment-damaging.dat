50|$|Printing inks and toners {{are very}} {{expensive}} and use <b>environment-damaging</b> volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and non-renewable oils, although {{standards for the}} amount of heavy metals in ink have been set by some regulatory bodies. Deinking recycled paper pulp results in a waste slurry, sometimes weighing 22% of the weight of the recycled wastepaper, which may go to landfills.|$|E
5000|$|In The New York Times, Janet Maslin lauded the film. She wrote, [...] "Mr. Tamahori, {{who gives}} Mulholland Falls a smashing, {{insidious}} L.A.-noir style meant to recall Chinatown, {{along with a}} high-testosterone swagger that is distinctively his own. This director's first Hollywood film has such punch, in fact, {{that it takes a}} while to realize how slight and sometimes noxious its concerns really are. But Mulholland Falls is so well cast and relentlessly stylish (thanks to some fine technical talent assembled here) that its sheer energy prevails over its shaky plot. After all, when a filmmaker can show Ms. Griffith contentedly reading A Farewell to Arms, there's not much he won't do. So this film has all the Chinatown staples—dangerous sex, corrupt power and a vast <b>environment-damaging</b> conspiracy—along with mushroom clouds, porn movies, a crash-landing airplane and many quick bursts of one-on-one violence." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{outcomes}} of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris Convention (COP 21), the steady escalating of global carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentration and the declaration of 2015 as the warmest year ever, demanding solutions to keep the earth fit for human habitation for years to come. One of such solutions {{is the use of}} biodiesel as an energy supply for diesel engines, that is regarded as a less <b>environment-damaging</b> fuel. As such, this review presents the possibility of utilizing non-edible rubber seed (Hevea brasiliensis) oil as a potential feedstock in biodiesel preparation via both homogeneous and heterogeneous acid and alkali catalysts. It deliberates the one-step and two-step routes of methyl ester production with various reaction conditions that to be weighted in order to achieve environment-responsibility yet cost-effective renewable fuel...|$|E
40|$|Various {{subspecies}} (ssp.) of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) {{are considered}} the best agents known so far to control insects, being highly specific and safe, easily mass produced and with long shelf life. 1 The para-crystalline body that is produced during sporulation in the exosporium includes polypeptides named δ-endotoxins, each killing {{a specific set of}} insects. The different entomopathogenic toxins of various Bt ssp. can be manipulated genetically in an educated way to construct more efficient transgenic bacteria or plants that express combinations of toxin genes to control pests. 2 Joint research projects in our respective laboratories during the last decade demonstrate what can be done by implementing certain ideas using molecular biology with Bt ssp. israelensis (Bti) as a model system. Here, we describe our progress achieved with Gram-negative bacterial species, including cyanobacteria, and some preliminary experiments to form transgenic plants, mainly to control mosquitoes (Diptera), but also a particular Lepidopteran and Coleopteran pest species. In addition, a system is described by which <b>environment-damaging</b> genes can be removed from the recombinants thus alleviating procedures for obtaining permits to release them in nature...|$|E
40|$|Through {{a series}} of {{historical}} social and technological developments, we as a species have developed — especially in the industrialized countries — a belief system and a social structure that are contributing directly to our global energy and environmental problems. The problems are not just problems of technology, they include the inappropriate ways that technology is used. Much of this stems from a value system which gives more priority {{to the rights of}} humans, and even their automobiles, than to those of nature. However, the needs of humans and the needs of nature are inextricably connected. Our current earthdepleting, <b>environment-damaging</b> social structure evolved from a sequence of value systems that developed naturally within western societies. However, we now find ourselves with a set of beliefs, portions of which are inappropriate and incompatible with the long-term viability of our earthly life-support system. These value systems and social structures have become major barriers to the kinds of reform that are needed to protect the earth for future generations. It is time that we add to our list of research topics, studies of the social, moral, philosophical, and ethical questions that {{lie at the heart of}} our energy and environmental crises...|$|E
40|$|Lightweighting in the {{transportation}} industry is today {{recognized as one}} of the most important strategies to improve fuel efficiency and reduce anthropogenic climate-changing, <b>environment-damaging,</b> and human death-causing emissions. However, the structural applications of lightweight alloys are often limited by some inherent deficiencies such as low stiffness, high wear rate and inferior strength. These properties could be effectively enhanced by the addition of stronger and stiffer reinforcements, especially nano-sized particles, into metal matrix to form composites. In most cases three common strengthening mechanisms (load-bearing effect, mismatch of coefficients of thermal expansion, and Orowan strengthening) have been considered to predict the yield strength of metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs). This study was aimed at developing a unified model by taking into account the matrix grain size and porosity (which is unavoidable in the materials processing such as casting and powder metallurgy) in the prediction of the yield strength of MMNCs. The Zener pinning effect of grain boundaries by the nano-sized particles has also been integrated. The model was validated using the experimental data of magnesium- and titanium-based nanocomposites containing different types of nano-sized particles (namely, Al 2 O 3, Y 2 O 3, and carbon nanotubes). The predicted results were observed to be in good agreement with the experimental data reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|The Equator Principles (EPs) are a {{voluntary}} and self-regulatory Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative {{in the field}} of project finance. The EPs provide a number of principles to businesses to reduce the negative impacts of lending practices linked to <b>environment-damaging</b> projects. The paper argues that the actual impact of the EPs even now as revised version is still limited. This is due to their voluntary nature and their lack of adequate governance mechanisms, that is, enforcement, monitoring and sanctioning. With the help of RepRisk, which provides a database capturing third-party criticism as well as a company’s or project’s exposure to controversial socio-environmental issues, the paper evaluates the on-the-ground performances of the two ‘Equator banks’ Barclays and JPMorgan Chase and compares their performance with the one of the two non-Equator banks Deutsche Bank and UBS. The paper shows that the EPs do not have a substantial influence on the broader CSR-performance of multinational banks due to the EPs’ limited scope – focusing mainly on project finance – and the (still) existing various loopholes, grey areas and discretionary leeway. The paper also gives an overview of the main institutional shortcomings of the EPs and their association and discusses some potential reform steps which should be taken to further strengthen and ‘harden’ this ‘soft law’ EP-framework. The paper thus argues in favor of (more) mandatory and legally binding rules and standards at the transnational level to overcome the EPs’ ‘voluntariness bias’...|$|E
