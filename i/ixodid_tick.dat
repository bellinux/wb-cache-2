MethodsA total of 4 459 cattle of {{all age groups}} and sex were examined from eighteen districts of five major agro-climatic zones of Punjab state, India. ResultsThe overall prevalence of <b>ixodid</b> <b>ticks,</b> Rhipicephalus microplus (R. microplus), Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum (H. a. anatolicum) and mixed infestation were 58. 06 %, 50. 16 %, 11. 34 % and 3. 45 %, respectively. Among the various agro-climatic zones highest prevalence rate of R. microplus and H. a. anatolicum were recorded in submountain undulating region (79. 36 %) and western region (20. 40 %), respectively indicating that R. microplus prefers a hot and humid environment whereas, arid and semi arid conditions suit better for H. a. anatolicum.

40|$|Background: <b>Ixodid</b> <b>ticks</b> (Acari: İxodidae) and fleas (Siphonaptera) are {{the major}} vectors of {{pathogens}} threatening animals and human healths. The aim of our study was to detect the infestation rates of East Hedgehogs (Erinaceus concolor) with ticks and fleas in Van Province, eastern region of Turkey. Methods: We examined fleas and ticks infestation patterns in 21 hedgehogs, collected from three suburbs with the greater of number gardens. In order to estimate flea and tick infestation of hedgehogs, we immobilized the ectoparasites by treatment the body with a insecticide trichlorphon (Neguvon®-Bayer). Results: On the hedgehogs, 60 <b>ixodid</b> <b>ticks</b> and 125 fleas were detected. All of the <b>ixodid</b> <b>ticks</b> were Rhipicephalus turanicus {{and all of the}} fleas were Archaeopsylla erinacei. Infestation rate for ticks and fleas was detected 66. 66 % and 100 %, respectively. Conclusion: We detected ticks (R. turanicus) and fleas (A. erinacei) in hedgehogs at fairly high rates. Since many ticks and fleas species may harbor on hedgehogs and transmit some tick-borne and flea-borne patogens, this results are the important in terms of veterinary and public health.  </p...|$|R
