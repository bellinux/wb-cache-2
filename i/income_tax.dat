5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the sales tax to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the sales tax and <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> modifications with a flat five percent personal <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E
