50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{depends on}} {{asymmetric}} {{application of the}} brakes on the main gear wheels to turn the aircraft. For this, the aircraft must be equipped with separate controls for {{the right and left}} brakes (usually on the rudder pedals). The nose or tail wheel usually is not equipped with <b>brakes.</b> <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> requires considerable skill. In aircraft with several methods of steering that include <b>differential</b> <b>braking,</b> <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> may be avoided because of the wear it puts on the <b>braking</b> mechanisms. <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> has the advantage of being largely independent of any movement or skidding of the nose or tailwheel.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{hierarchical}} control architecture for lateral stabilization in automotive vehicles is proposed in this paper. The proposed direct yaw stabilization strategy {{is based on}} the optimal coordination of two conventional stabilization systems (<b>differential</b> <b>brake</b> and traction torque transfer). Thanks to this approach, high stabilization capabilities are obtained while the impact on the longitudinal motion is reduced. The control architecture is a three layer structure composed of a high-level control, an optimal control allocation and a low-level control. The main idea consists in the use of a dual-mode control allocation formulation to handle the different operating modes of the wheel according to available actuators, i. e. conventional braking and/or torque transfer. The performance of the integrated control strategy proposed is highlighted through simulation results...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} the potential in utilizing the brakes on a vehicle to perform a small-overlap avoidance maneuver as a potential future active safety system and is done through both experimental and simulated testing. A strong reason for using brakes instead of steering is the availability of a powerful actuator that can be controlled by-wire while being less intrusive than a mechanically connected steering-actuated system. A 2008 SAAB 9 - 3 test vehicle is equipped with a separate electronic hydraulic <b>brake</b> system, enabling <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> that can be implemented in a way to generate a yawing motion of the vehicle similar to turning the steering wheel. Simulink was used to develop a controller to autonomously perform the avoidance maneuver, requiring only an input describing the desired lateral displacement. In order to verify the functionality of the controller without experimental testing the vehicle dynamic simulation software, CarSim, was used. The developed avoidance maneuver controller was identical in both simulation and in the test vehicle to ensure proper correlation between the two. In order to evaluate and quantify the <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> potential, the experimental tests were conducted in different conditions and levels of intervention. Parameters such as velocity, vehicle load, road friction, and lateral displacement were varied to achieve a good performance estimation. To minimize driver intrusiveness during a <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> avoidance maneuver tests were also conducted with spacers installed between the front wheels and hubs to remove the lateral component of the scrub radius and thereby decrease the torque steer effect during braking. However the results proved that self-aligning moment is more dominant than torque steer and the installed spacers had a negligible effect on both driver intrusiveness and avoidance maneuver performance. To evaluate the potential of <b>differential</b> <b>braking,</b> the maneuvers were compared to corresponding simulated and experimental front wheel steered maneuvers to generate a reliable and quantifiable assessment of the <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> potential. The experimental steered maneuvers were performed with a steering robot to ensure high accuracy and consistency. The results show that there is indeed potential in utilizing <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> to perform an avoidance maneuver. At higher velocities, <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> has the potential to perform avoidance maneuvers both at a shorter distance as well as duration compared to steering, especially for smaller lateral displacements. <b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> decelerates the vehicle, shortening the traveled distance {{while at the same time}} increasing the duration to perform the maneuver. At lower velocities, a steered maneuver is performed at both a shorter distance as well as duration, compared to <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> since the vehicle is not as sensitive to steering inputs and larger steering amplitudes can be applied, resulting in more effective lateral movement...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} control design method for a driver {{assistance}} system. In {{the operation of}} the system, a predefined trajectory required by the driver with a steering command is followed. During manoeuvres the control system generates <b>differential</b> <b>brake</b> moment and the auxiliary front-wheel steering angle and changes the camber angles of the wheels in order to improve the tracking of the road trajectory. The performance specifications are guaranteed by the local controllers, i. e. the brake, the steering, and the suspension systems, while the coordination of these components is provided by the supervisor. The advantage of this architecture is that local controllers are designed independently, which is ensured {{by the fact that the}} monitoring signals are taken into consideration in the formalisation of their performance specifications. The fault-tolerant control can be achieved by incorporating the detected fault signals in their performance specifications. The control system also uses a driver model, with which the reference signal can be generated. In the control design, the parameter-dependent linear parameter-varyingmethod, which meets the performance specifications, is used. The operation of the control system is illustrated through different normal and emergency vehicle manoeuvres with a high-accuracy simulation software. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|E

30|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>braking</b> {{and active}} {{steering}} {{have already been}} integrated to overcome their shortcomings. However, existing research mainly focuses on two-axle vehicles and controllers are mostly designed to use one control method to improve the other. Moreover, many experiments are needed to improve the robustness; therefore, these control methods are underutilized. This paper proposes an integrated control system specially designed for multi-axle vehicles, in which the desired lateral force and yaw moment of vehicles {{are determined by the}} sliding mode control algorithm. The output of the sliding mode control is distributed to the suitable wheels based on the abilities and potentials of the two control methods. Moreover, in this method, fewer experiments are needed, and the robustness and simultaneity are both guaranteed. To simplify the optimization system and to improve the computation speed, seven simple optimization subsystems are designed for the determination of control outputs on each wheel. The simulation results show that the proposed controller obviously enhances the stability of multi-axle trucks. The system improves 68 % of the safe velocity, and its performance is much better than both <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> and active steering. This research proposes an integrated control system that can simultaneously invoke <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> and active steering of multi-axle vehicles to fully utilize the abilities and potentials of the two control methods.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLane {{departure}} avoidance systems assist actively {{the driver}} during inattention or drowsiness and increase driving safety. Most {{of the lane}} departure avoidance systems use for the lateral control of the vehicle in closed loop a DC motor similar to the electrical powered steering (EPS) assistance. Important difficulties and limits of this approach are the shared control with the driver {{on the steering wheel}} and the vehicle handling at limits. In this paper a combined lateral control using a DC motor on the steering wheel and the <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> control is investigated to keep the vehicle on the lane. The main objective is to develop lateral control laws which allow a repartition of the control effort in real time between the steering by the steering angle and the steering by the <b>differential</b> <b>braking.</b> This could facilitate a better interaction with the driver and avoid for instance tires saturation, steering angle saturation or excessive lateral accelerations. A joint design of the steering angle control and of the lateral control by <b>differential</b> <b>braking</b> is ensured by minimizing the vehicle reachability set. This is achieved by means of a quadratic Lyapunov function and LMI methods. Preliminary simulation results illustrate the approach and show a very good performance to avoid the lane departure even during curve negotiation...|$|R

Another advantage is outright simplicity; the steering system connects directly to the brake and nothing else, producing a very simple mechanical arrangement.|$|R
