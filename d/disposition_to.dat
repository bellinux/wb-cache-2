Governor General Jules Marcel de Coppet provided the party with space in public buildings for meetings. PADESM candidates in the January 1947 provincial elections received financial support from French settlers owing to the party's favorable <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> the French administration.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> SAH; risk is {{increased}} three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, hormone replacement therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E

The aim {{of the study is}} to find out the expression of certain areas of self-concept and <b>dispositions</b> <b>to</b> school education. A group of Slovenian and a group of British high school students participated in the study. The results of ANOVA and discriminant analysis showed significant differences as related to nationality.

25|$|Reward {{dependence}} is {{not consistently}} associated with diagnosis {{but can also}} significantly affect treatment issues, such as Therapeutic alliance. Persistence in completing weight-loss programs were related to high RD scores during pre-treatment. This demonstrates that, having higher reward dependence enhances an individual's <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> being more dedicated and sociable, making them increasingly respond to societal pressures, thereby reducing their risk of dropping out from weight-loss programs.|$|E
25|$|According to Cloninger’s theory, {{individuals}} high in reward {{dependence and}} low in norepinephrine levels are ambitious, warm, sentimental, pleasant, sociable, sensitive, sympathetic and socially dependent. Individuals with high RD personalities have a <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> recognize salient social cues which in turn facilitates effective communication, warm social relations, and their genuine care for others, but these individuals are then disadvantaged in being excessively socially dependent. High reward dependent individuals also exhibit persistent behaviors and are easily influenced by emotional appeals.|$|E

40|$|Building on the {{construct}} of mathematical dispositions – ideas and values about mathematics and patterns of engagement over time – this study investigated which practice-linked goals students appropriated, their explanations of these goals, and the expression of these goals in situated actions in problem solving {{as a way to}} develop a more nuanced understanding of students’ positive <b>dispositions</b> <b>to</b> mathematics. The study was conducted in a 3 rd grade classroom in a school that actively supports the development of positive <b>dispositions</b> <b>to</b> mathematics over the 2013 - 2014 school year. Data sources included student surveys, student interviews and classroom observation. Analysis was conducted at the classroom and individual level to determine to what extent students held practice-linked goals aligned with the values of the reform-oriented mathematics education community. In addition, close analysis of case study students allowed analysis of how different goal profiles related to situated actions in problem solving. The results of the study contribute to our field’s understanding of how primary students orient themselves to mathematics and how the development of positive <b>dispositions</b> <b>to</b> mathematics can be supported in the classroom...|$|R

25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the <b>disposition</b> <b>to</b> respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E
