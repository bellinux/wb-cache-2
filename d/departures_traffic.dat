Second, the existing Trajectory Synthesizer (TS) module of the Center-TRACON Automation System (CTAS) was modified to generate trajectories that closely model actual aircraft climb profiles and terminal airspace procedures. Third, an algorithm was applied to predict conflicts between trajectories of departure and arrival aircraft and to determine if an unrestricted climb is advisable.

40|$|To meet {{traffic demand}} predictions, the global air traffic {{management}} (ATM) system needs to be changed. Several visions on future ATM operations exist. A commonality between the different visions is 4 D Trajectory management. This function enables plan-based operation {{as opposed to the}} state-based approach of the present system. Plan-based operation enables the optimization of traffic flows by generating 4 D trajectories. A part of the traffic flow generation process is scheduling. The research presented in this thesis focuses on these scheduling opportunities. In this research the scheduling opportunities for <b>departure</b> <b>traffic</b> at a runway are investigated. A study of the existing literature showed that the most common scheduling algorithms currently available can be divided into four categories: first come first served, brand-and-bound, greedy search and genetic algorithms. A simulation environment is designed for evaluation of the departure scheduling algorithms using various input parameters like traffic situation, airport map and algorithm. The four algorithm categories are evaluated on output aspects like delay and robustness of the schedule and are compared with the current method of traffic scheduling. The evaluation of the scheduling algorithms shows that the performance of the current method of scheduling <b>departure</b> <b>traffic</b> performs well in comparison with the tested algorithms. In case of no disturbances the genetic algorithm performs slightly better than the current method, but the other algorithms do not have a better performance. When disturbances are taken into account, a bigger performance increase can be obtained by using scheduling algorithms.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} detailed {{results from}} a high-fidelity human-in-the-loop evaluation of an airport surface decision support tool. The Spot And Runway Departure Advisor is designed to aid controllers in managing aircraft surface operations {{and is based on}} two optimization algorithms: the Spot Release Planner and the Runway Scheduler. The Spot Release Planner provides sequence and timing advisories to the Ground controller for releasing departure aircraft into the aircraft movement area to reduce taxi delay while achieving maximum throughput. The Runway Scheduler provides take-off and arrival runway crossing sequences to the Local controller to maximize runway usage. Performance metrics from the simulation include delay, number of aircraft stops, fuel consumption, and aircraft engine emissions. The results were not consistent among the different traffic scenarios. Results from high traffic scenarios show the average departure delay and number of aircraft stops in the movement area were reduced by 64 and 68 percent, respectively. Fuel consumption and engine emissions were reduced by as much as 38 percent. There was a slight reduction in taxi time of arrival aircraft even if the emphasis of the tool was on <b>departure</b> <b>traffic.</b> However, for normal traffic scenarios there was little change in any of performance metrics mainly due to low traffic volume...|$|R

This air traffic management implies the realization of several level-offs at each departure which suppose an increase of the fuel consumption firstly and as result the rise of overall cost of operation. Furthermore, not only operational costs are affected but both noise and pollutants emissions are increased, eco-friendly departure procedures requires a special heed because a new international range of equirements desire to abate the environmental impact due to aircraft operations. In order to avoid this inefficient departure procedure, continuous climb operations (CCOs) are defined as novel procedures which will ease the pilot departure perform.

We implement the mechanism at the edge routers of a DiffServ Domain. The admission control mechanism is only executed at the edge routers and doesn’t require any signaling between inner routers. The mechanism does not depend on the underlying network topology or any specifications of the cross traffic present in the domain. Therefore the mechanism is scalable. In addition, the proposed approach does not require any traffic policing mechanism at the entrance of the network. This approach can provide the statistical QoS guarantees to a variety of service classes within aDiffServ domain. We show that the proposed framework can provide a high degree of network resource sharing among multiple traffic classes while satisfying their QoS requirements.
