40|$|Three {{groups of}} 10 {{subjects}} each {{were exposed to}} stepwise increments of cross coupled angular accelerations in three visual modes: internal visual reference (IVR), <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> (EVR), and vision absent (VA). The subjects in the IVR condition required significantly greater amounts of stimulus exposure to neutralize their illusory subjective reactions. They also suffered a greater loss of well-being and a more marked incidence of motion sickness than did subjects in the EVR and VA conditions. The same 30 subjects were reexposed to the same graded cross coupled stimulation 1 week later. This time, however, all the subjects were tested under only the IVR condition. All three groups showed some positive transfer of adaptation, but only the IVR-IVR combination required significantly fewer head motions {{to achieve the same}} level of adaptation on the second occasion. Taken overall, however, the most efficient and least disturbing route to adaptation at the completion of the second test was via the VA-IVR combination...|$|E
40|$|Loss {{of control}} - {{inflight}} (LOC-I) has historically represented the largest category of commercial aviation fatal accidents. A {{review of the}} worldwide transport airplane accidents (2001 - 2010) evinced that loss of attitude or energy state awareness was responsible for {{a large majority of}} the LOC-I events. A Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) study of 18 worldwide loss-of-control accidents and incidents determined that flight crew loss of attitude awareness or energy state awareness due to lack of <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>reference</b> cues was a significant causal factor in 17 of the 18 reviewed flights. CAST recommended that "Virtual Day-Visual Meteorological Condition" (Virtual Day-VMC) displays be developed to provide the visual cues necessary to prevent loss-of-control resulting from flight crew spatial disorientation and loss of energy state awareness. Synthetic vision or equivalent systems (SVS) were identified for a design "safety enhancement" (SE- 200). Part of this SE involves the conduct of research for developing minimum aviation system performance standards (MASPS) for these flight deck display technologies to aid flight crew attitude and energy state awareness similar to that of a virtual day-VMC-like environment. This paper will describe a novel experimental approach to evaluating a flight crew's ability to maintain attitude awareness and to prevent entry into unusual attitudes across several SVS optical flow design considerations. Flight crews were subjected to compound-event scenarios designed to elicit channelized attention and startle/surprise within the crew. These high-fidelity scenarios, designed from real-world events, enable evaluation of the efficacy of SVS at improving flight crew attitude awareness to reduce the occurrence of LOC-I incidents in commercial flight operations...|$|E

40|$|Tactile {{displays}} {{provide information}} by applying local vibrations to the user's skin. The research organization TNO {{has developed a}} tactile torso display by implementing a number of pager motors, or tactors into a vest, allowing for the generation of spatio-temporal patterns. TNO carries out research into the usefulness of this tactile torso display as an additional cockpit instrument. In a series of experiments, in a simulator and in an actual helicopter, it was shown that tactile information can significantly enhance hover performance, waypoint navigation, spatial orientation, and reduce the effects of extra workload. The general advantage of well-designed tactile cues {{is that they are}} intuitive, induce short response times, and are "eyes free". The latter aspect allows pilots to keep their eyes on <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>references,</b> which is particularly useful in flight tasks that depend on <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>references,</b> such as helicopter landings. Tactile cues may improve flight safety in low-visibility conditions, for example in brown-out situations where the helicopter downwash stirs up sand. In a recent flight trial with a Cougar helicopter the landing maneuver was performed quicker and more accurate with tactile feedback than in the condition without tactile feedback. This paper gives an overview of the TNO research in this area...|$|R

All aspects of response are presented as the final stage in a process of communication between the design team and the consumer. The role of <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>references</b> is examined and the effects of moderating influences at each stage in the process of communication are discussed. In particular, the personal, situational and cultural factors that moderate response are considered. In concluding the paper, implications for design practice and design research are presented...|$|R
40|$|A Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) {{study of}} 18 {{worldwide}} loss-of-control {{accidents and incidents}} determined {{that the lack of}} <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>references</b> was associated with a flight crew's loss of attitude awareness or energy state awareness in 17 of these events. Therefore, CAST recommended development and implementation of virtual day-Visual Meteorological Condition (VMC) display systems, such as synthetic vision systems, which can promote flight crew attitude awareness similar to a day-VMC environment. This paper describes the results of a high-fidelity, large transport aircraft simulation experiment that evaluated virtual day-VMC displays and a "background attitude indicator" concept as an aid to pilots in recovery from unusual attitudes. Twelve commercial airline pilots performed multiple unusual attitude recoveries and both quantitative and qualitative dependent measures were collected. Experimental results and future research directions under this CAST initiative and the NASA "Technologies for Airplane State Awareness" research project are described...|$|R

40|$|Judgments of the orientations of 2 D lines show {{systematic}} biases {{that can}} be described as exaggerating deviations from horizontal. These biases are not due to numeric estimation biases. An orientation of about 37 ° from horizontal is judged to be equidistant from horizontal and vertical. The same orientation is judged to be 45 ° from horizontal and 45 ° from vertical. One hypothesis concerning this distortion is an experience-based anisotropy in the distribution of orientation sensitive cells in visual cortex. An alternative view is that these biases are intrinsic to the encoding of spatial orientation. To tease apart these two possibilities we oriented observers at 45 ° from vertical and asked them to do two kinds of tasks. One task was a psychometric measurement of perceived vertical or horizontal using a forced choice method. Judgments of visual stimuli, presented in a circular aperture that removed any <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> <b>references,</b> were made either with respect to an egocentric (bodily) or exocentric (gravitational) reference frame. Over 150 participants were tested. Both within and between subjects, variability was much less for judgments made with respect to the exocentric (perceived gravitational) reference frame. Similarly, when required to make numeric estimates of orientation with respect to the two types of reference frame, estimates with respect to perceived gravitational frames exhibited the standard bias exaggerating deviations from horizontal. Estimates with respect to bodily frames did not. These findings are consistent with the precedence of gravitational <b>reference</b> frames in <b>visual</b> experience and imply that 2 D orientation asymmetries between horizontal and vertical are not caused simply by biases in the distribution of early cortical orientation analyzers. Precision was greatest when observers were upright so that gravitational and bodily vertical were aligned, but for tilted observers, judgments made with respect to gravitational reference frames were most similar to judgments made upright.

Sensory processing of water currents involves a number of sensory modalities including the inner ear, vision, tactile sense and the mechanosensory lateral line. The inner ear will detect whole-body accelerations generated by changes in £ow, or by turbulence, whereas visual and tactile inputs will signal translational movement with respect to an <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> or tactile <b>reference</b> frame. The super¢cial neuromasts of the mechanosensory lateral line detect £ow over the surface of the body and have the appropriate anatomical distribution and physiological properties to signal the strength and the direction of £ow and, hence, contribute to the detection of regional di¡erences in £ow over di¡erent parts of the body...|$|R

Twenty-six students enrolled in an introductory statistics course for social sciences graduate students (post-baccalaureate) solved eight probability problems in a structured interview format. Results show that students spontaneously use selfgenerated <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> representations while solving probability problems. The types of visual representations used include: reorganization of the given information, pictures, novel schematic representations, trees, outcome listings, contingency tables, and Venn diagrams. The frequency of use {{of each of these}} different <b>external</b> <b>visual</b> representations depended on the type of probability problem being solved. We interpret these findings as showing that problem solvers attempt to select representations appropriate to the problem structure, and that the appropriateness of the representation is determined by the problem’s underlying schema...|$|R

These results confirm that the visual system uses multiple representations of space and suggest that it weights them differently for different tasks and different viewing conditions.
