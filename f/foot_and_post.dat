Methods: Participants were recruited from community groups and completed standardized tests assessing sensation, foot posture, foot function, ankle dorsiflexion and first metatarsal phalangeal joint range of motion (1 st MPJ ROM), hallux valgus presence and severity. Results: Twenty-three stroke participants (mean age 75. 09 ?±? 7. 57 years; 12 fallers) and 16 controls (mean age 73. 44 ?±? 8. 35 years) took part. Within the stroke group, reduced 1 st MPJ sensation (p?=? 0. 016) and 1 st MPJ ROM (p?=? 0. 025) were observed in the affected foot in comparison to the non-affected foot; no other differences were apparent. Pooled data (for both feet) was used to explore between stroke/control (n?=? 78 <b>feet)</b> <b>and</b> stroke faller/non-faller (n?=? 46 feet) group differences. In comparison to the control group, stroke participants exhibited reduced sensation of the 1 st MPJ (p?=? 0. 020), higher Foot Posture Index scores (indicating greater foot pronation, p?=? 0. 008) <b>and</b> reduced <b>foot</b> function (p?=? 0. 003). Stroke fallers exhibited significantly greater foot pronation in comparison to non-fallers (p?=? 0. 027). Conclusions: Results indicated differences in <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle characteristics <b>post</b> stroke in comparison to healthy controls. These changes may negatively impact functional ability and the ability to preserve balance. Further research is warranted to explore the influence of foot problems on balance ability and falls in people with stroke. Implications for Rehabilitation Foot problems are common post stroke. As foot problems have been linked to increased fall risk among the general population we recommend that it would be beneficial to include <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> ankle assessments or a referral to a podiatrist for people with stroke who report foot problems.

Munro {{appears to have}} feared having his stores exposed at Conjeveram, and, instead of bringing the help which Baillie expected, merely sent a small reinforcement of Highlanders and sepoys under Colonel Fletcher. Indeed, a want of judgment and energy seems to have pervaded the measures of both commanders, the result being that Baillie, moving forward from Pollilur {{in the direction of}} Conjeveram, on the morning of 10 September 1780, found himself assailed by Hyder All's entire host. In the engagement which ensued, the blowing-up of two tumbrils within the oblong into which Baillie had formed his troops, followed by a general stampede of camp-followers through his ranks, produced irretrievable confusion. Despite the heroic efforts of their officers, the sepoys, panic-stricken, could not be rallied; but the Europeans, to the number of five hundred, got together in square under Colonel Baillie, who was on <b>foot,</b> <b>and,</b> taking <b>post</b> on a rising bank of sand, fought with a stubborn determination never surpassed. Again and again they withstood the fierce charges of fresh bodies of Hyder's horse, supported by masses of infantry in the intervals, until all the officers lay killed or wounded, and but sixteen soldiers out of the five hundred of all ranks in the square remained unhurt. The survivors, including such of the wounded as were thought worth removal, were swept from the field as prisoners, and carried off to Seringapatam. Among the number grievously wounded was Colonel Baillie, whose personal courage in the fight and in the subsequent captivity was admitted alike by friends and foes.|$|R

Overall, there was adequate reproduction of commercial tree species (1174 stems per acre), {{but there were}} some scattered unstacked areas. The overall reproduction of oaks was relatively poor (an average of 340 per acre and less than 20 percent milacre plot stocking) and cherrybark, Shumard, and swamp chestnut oak reproduction was probably not sufficient to recover their proportions that existed in the preharvest overstory. Water/willow oaks were more successful than the other oaks and may attain equal or higher levels in the future stand compared to the preharvest overstory. Understocked areas in the patches resulted primarily from development of heavy woody vine and shrub cover, with grapevine the most important problem. The eight-year stocking of oaks originated primarily from advance reproduction less than one <b>foot</b> tall <b>and</b> from <b>post</b> harvest germination of acorns.

40|$|Fully Controlled Production Environment for Autoclave Injection Processes Ensuring a reproducible, high {{product quality}} {{is a major}} goal for all {{production}} scenarios. In case of the ribs for the LOCOMACHS Lean Assembly Wing Box, geometrical accuracy was {{as important as the}} laminate quality itself and therefore a variety of measures has been investigated to actively measure and tune all quality relevant production parameters. The process that has been chosen to produce the ribs is a combination of resin infusion and autoclave technology because this combination offers a wide bandwidth of process parameter variation. The rib design with one integrated rib <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> one integrated rib post has been offered a good combination of simplicity and degree of structural integration. Since the mould line is not critical from a CTE point of view it was possible to use a cost efficient aluminium male tooling which has been designed to produce two different ribs in one cycle. Flange angle of the rib <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> rib <b>post</b> have been designed to compensate “Spring-In” deformations in a formally defined production window. Process-induced distortions (PID) of the ribs have been predicted with a novel pheno-numerical simulation approach that has been introduced within the LOCOMACHS project. The methodology provides efficient PID predictions due to shell-element modeling and a significant reduction of corresponding simulation parameters. To ensure that all quality relevant production parameters are in the specified production window a network of ultrasonic sensors has been installed in a special pattern. A crucial advantage of the ultrasonic sensors is that they are installed on the accessible backside of the mould and do not affect the mould line side. By measuring and analyzing sound amplitudes and propagation times it was possible to monitor flow front propagation, laminate thickness and also the cure progress in the running process. To manipulate the process conditions {{on the basis of the}} gained information, the injection pressure of the two injection lines could be used to tune resin flow, the pressure difference between autoclave and injection system could be used to control laminate thickness and the temperature profile can be manipulated in function of the cure progress. The ability to compensate most of the typical production scatter problems is major step towards the formally defined target of reproducible, high product quality. Furthermore the overall process time is no longer restricted to predefined, highly conservative cure times since the degree of cure is directly measured...|$|R
