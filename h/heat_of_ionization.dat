The heat of reaction of chemically reduced nickel by hypophosphite, as well as the heats of oxi-dation of hypophosphite and nickel, and the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> of water, was measured at 94 ~ C. A calorimetric study of electroless nickel deposition was performed, {{with the aim of}} establishing the en-ergy balance for the system. It was shown in a pre-vious publication (1) that the as-plated alloy is com-posed of a nickel phase and a nickel phosphide, Ni 2 P, phase. Hence, the heat of formation of the Ni 2 P must be contained in the heat of reaction of the deposition. The DTA of the deposit showed, indeed, that the en-ergy evolved during heating corresponds almost exactly to the heat of formation of Ni 3 P from Ni 2 P (2, 1). A study of the l iterature shows that four principal reaction mechanisms have been proposed to explain the chemical plating of nickel by reduction with hypophosphite: 1.

By combining the measured heat for glycine solutions titrated with NaOH with the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> for water, the enthalpy of protonation of glycine is obtained. The reaction is exothermic at all temperatures and pressures studied. The effect of pressure on the enthalpy of reaction is very small. The experimental heat data are analyzed to yield equilibrium constant (K), enthalpy change (ΔH), and entropy change (ΔS) values for the protonation reaction as a function of temperature. These values are compared with those reported previously at 298. 15 K. The ΔH and ΔS values increase (become more positive), whereas log K values decrease, as temperature increases. The trends for ΔH and ΔS with temperature are opposite to those reported previously for the protonation of several alkanolamines. However, log K values for proton interaction with both glycine and the alkanolamines decrease with increasing temperature. The effect of the nitrogen atom substituent on log K for protonation of glycine and alkanolamines is discussed in terms of changes in long-range and short-range solvent effects. These effects are used to explain the difference in ΔH and ΔS trends between glycine protonation and those found earlier for alkanolamine protonation...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the stability, purification and properties of Glutathione S-aryltransferase (Ec 2. 5. 1. 13) from the grass-grub, Costelytra zealandica. The enzyme was found to be extremely unstable in crude homogenates of grass-grubs that had been stored frozen at - 2 O degrees C, but was considerably more stable in homogenates of live grass-grubs. The instability increased with increase of pH. Glutathione gave some protection against inactivation. Selective fractionation of crude homogenates with (NH 4) 2 SO 4 provided some evidence for the presence of an endogenous inhibitor of the enzyme. DEAE-cellulose chromatography and isoelectric focusing studies showed the presence of two major GSH S-aryltransferases with isoelectric points of 4. 6 and 8. 7. Both enzymes were present in the homogenate from a single, live, grass-grub. The molecular weight and optimum pH of each enzyme was identical within experimental error. A brief comparative study of GSH S-transferases showed the presence of GSH S-alkyl- and GSH s-alkene-transferase, but in only very small amounts compared with GSH S-aryltransferase. Differences in stability were demonstrated and some cross-specificity was indicated. Several inhibitor-substituted Sepharoses were prepared in an attempt to purify GSH s-aryltransferase by affinity chromatography. Although columns of the inhibitors removed the enzyme from solution an active enzyme could not be recovered. The effects of pH and temperature on the enzyme-catalysed reaction of GSH and 1, 2 -dichloro- 4 -nitrobenzene (DCNB) were investigated in detail. Analysis of the variation of pKGSH with pH showed the presence of active site groups with pK approximately 9 involved in GSH binding. Calculation of the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> of these groups in the pI 8. 7 enzyme, from the effect of temperature on their pK, suggested that the groups may be Lysine epsilon-NH 2.

Most of the susceptible FRET peptides were cleaved at more than one peptide bond, without particular substrate specificity. the more relevant observation was that the peptides containing E or D were cleaved at only one peptide bond and TTR was competitively inhibited by glutathione analog peptide gamma-E-A-G-OH that contains two free carboxyl groups. the dependence on ionic interactions of TTR hydrolytic activity was confirmed by the large inhibitory effects of salt and ionic surfactants. TTR was not inhibited by any usual peptidase inhibitors, except by ortho-phenanthroline and EDTA. the mechanism of TTR catalysis was explored by the pH-profile of TTR hydrolytic activity in different temperatures and by proton inventory. the obtained pK and <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> values suggest that a carboxylate and an ammonium group, possibly from a lysine side chain are involved.

The ionization of guanine and uracil residues was estimated from changes in the E 270 /E 260 ratio and E 230 /E 260 ratio respectively. In the amorphous form of RNA both residues had the same pK, whereas in the double-helical form ionization was suppressed.

The difference in the denaturation spectrum of adenine [...] uracil and guanine [...] cytosine base pairs at 280 mμ was enhanced in acidic solutions whereas E 260 was hardly affected.

From these data we have calculated the <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> solution of all of the above amino acids and the apparent <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>of</b> dibromo-l-tyrosine and dichloro-/tyrosine. Methods The technique employed for obtaining the solubilities of the amino acids was the same as described by Dalton and Schmidt (2). The concentrations of the amino acids in the saturated solutions were obtained by micro Kjeldahl determinations of nitrogen (3). The criteria of purity of the preparations were constant solubility after repeated recrystallization and constant solubility when there was a small excess and a large excess of the solid phase. For estimating the apparent dissociation constants, the solubilities of the amino acids were determined in aqueous solutions and in solutions containing varying amounts of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen ion activities of the solutions were determined with the aid of the quinhydrone electrode. They are based on the value 1. 078 for the pall of 0. 1000 molar HC 1 (4), and on the assumption that contact potential differences were eliminated by the use of saturated potassium chloride.

40|$|The {{stability}} of protein is defined {{not only by}} the hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, van der Waals interactions, and salt bridges. Additional, much more subtle contributions to protein stability can arise from surface residues that change their properties upon unfolding. The recombinant major cold shock protein of Escherichia coli CspA an all-beta protein unfolds reversible in a two-state manner, and behaves in all other respects as typical globular protein. However, the enthalpy of CspA unfolding strongly depends on the pH and buffer composition. Detailed analysis of the unfolding enthalpies as a function of pH and buffers with different <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> shows that CspA unfolding in the pH range 5. 5 - 9. 0 is linked to protonation of an amino group. This amino group appears to be the N-terminal alpha-amino group of the CspA molecule. It undergoes a 1. 6 U shift in pKa values between native and unfolded states. Although this shift in pKa is expected to contribute approximately 5 kJ/mol to CspA stabilization energy the experimentally observed stabilization is only approximately 1 kJ/mol. This discrepancy is related to a strong enthalpy-entropy compensation due, most likely, to the differences in hydration of the protonated and deprotonated forms of the alpha-amino group...|$|R

40|$|The {{cellulose}} {{enzymatic hydrolysis}} {{is carried out}} by the synergistic action of cellulase enzyme complex, namely endo-glucanase, exo-glucanase and Ã¢-glucosidase (BGL). BGL is responsible for the regulation of the cellulolytic process as both endo- and exo-glucanase activities are often inhibited by cellobiose. In recent years, interest in BGL has gained momentum, owing to its potential use in various biotechnological processes including biomass degradation, fuel ethanol production, release of aromatic residues, extraction of fruit juices, production of fermented foods etc. A. niger {{is by far the most}} efficient BGL producer among the microorganisms investigated. To cope with the current industrial demand it is necessary to produce BGL with improved catalytic and kinetic properties. The current report deals with the development of A. niger strain through gamma rays treatment. Hyper producer mutant M- 6 was selected on the basis of 2 -deoxy-D-glucose resistance, which showed about two fold higher production of BGL as compared to control. Both the parent and mutant had shown best results with 3 % wheat bran at 30 Â°C and pH 5. Random mutagenesis resulted in mutations within the BGL gene sequence, leading to overall conformational change in BGL secondary structure. The subunit and native molecular mass of the BGLs from parent and mutant were same i. e. 130 and 252 kDa, respectively. LC-MS/MS analysis also confirmed the identity of protein bands as BGL from both strains with a slight difference in molecular masses. The mutant BGL proved to be 1. 6 fold efficient for cellobiose hydrolysis with lower activation energy (Ea) and thermodynamically more stable against denaturants than parent BGL. The mutant BGL gene was also expressed in Pichia pastoris and the recombinant BGL possessed similar characteristics as that of the mutant BGL. Effect of metals on parent and mutant BGLs showed that Ca 2 + decreased the Ea, resulting in efficient formation of ES*-complex as compared to apo-BGL, while, Mn 2 + decreased the Ea at lower metal concentrations only. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> for the acidic and basic limbs of the apo- BGL reduced significantly in the presence of Ca 2 + and Mn 2 +. The turnover (kcat) of apo-BGL showed an increase in the presence of low concentrations of Ca 2 + and Mn 2 +. The BGL activation mechanism by Ca 2 + was of mixed nature where Ca 2 + was preferably binding with free enzyme, while Mn 2 + was preferably binding with ES*-complex rather than free enzyme (partially uncompetitive). Ca 2 +- and Mn 2 +- bound BGL also showed higher thermo-stability as compared to apo-BGL. Immobilization of BGL through entrapment on latex and silicone resulted in an increase in optimum temperature and thermal stability than the free enzyme. The immobilized BGL also increased the cellulose hydrolysis rate with more than 70 % functional stability after multiple reuses.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{available}} data {{with regard to the}} chemical and physical properties of the "substrate" luciferin (LH 2) and enzyme, luciferase (A), and of kinetic data derived both from the reaction in extracts of Cypridina, and from the luminescence of intact bacteria, the fundamental reactions involved in the phenomenon of bioluminescence have been schematized. These reactions provide a satisfactory basis for interpreting the known characteristics of the system, as well as the theoretical chemistry with regard to the control of its over-all velocity in relation to various factors. These factors, here studied experimentally wholly with bacteria, Photobacterium phosphoreum in particular, include pH, temperature, pressure, and the drugs sulfanilamide, urethane, and alcohol, separately and in relation to each other. Under steady state conditions of bacterial luminescence, with excess of oxidizable substrate and with oxygen not limiting, the data indicate that the chief effects of these agents center around the pace setting reactions, which may be designated by the equation: A + LH 2 → ALH 2 following which light emission is assumed proportional to the amount of the excited molecule, AL*. The relation between pH and luminescence intensity varies with (a), the buffer mixture and concentration, (b), the temperature, and (c), the hydrostatic pressure. At an optimum temperature for luminescence of about 22 ° C. in P. phosphoreum, the effects of increasing or decreasing the hydrogen ion concentration are largely reversible over the range between pH 3. 6 and pH 8. 8. The relation between luminescence intensity and pH, under the experimental conditions employed, is given by the following equation, in which I 1 represents the maximum intensity, occurring about pH 6. 5; I 2 the intensity at any other given pH; K 5 the equilibrium constant between hydrogen ions and the AL-; and K 6 the corresponding constant with respect to hydroxyl ions: See PDF for Equation The value of K 5, as indicated by the data, amounts to 4. 84 x 104, while that of K 6 amounts to 4. 8 x 105. Beyond the range between approximately pH 3. 8 and 8. 8, destructive effects of the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, respectively, were increasingly apparent. By raising the temperature above the optimum, the destructive effects were apparent at all pH, and the intensity of the luminescence diminished logarithmically with time. With respect to pH, the rate of destruction of the light-emitting system at temperatures above the optimum was slowest between pH 6. 5 and 7. 0, and increased rapidly with more acid or more alkaline reactions of the medium. The reversible effects of slightly acid pH vary with the temperature in the manner of an inhibitor (Type I) that acts independently of the normal, reversible denaturation equilibrium (K 1) of the enzyme. The per cent inhibition caused by a given acid pH in relation to the luminescence intensity at optimum pH, is much greater at low temperatures, and decreases as the temperature is raised towards the optimum temperature. The observed maximum intensity of luminescence is thus shifted to slightly higher temperatures by increase in (H+). The apparent activation energy of luminescence is increased by a decrease in pH. The value of ΔH‡ at pH 5. 05 was calculated to be 40, 900 calories, in comparison with 20, 700 at a pH of 6. 92. The difference of 20, 200 is taken to represent an estimate of the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> of ALH in the activation process, and compares roughtly with the 14, 000 calories estimated for the same process, by analyzing the data {{from the point of view}} of hydrogen ions as an inhibitor. The decreasing temperature coefficient for luminescence in proceeding from low temperatures towards the optimum is accounted for in part by the greater degree of ionization of ALH. At the optimum temperature and acid reactions, pressures up to about 500 atmospheres retard the velocity of the luminescent oxidation. At the same temperature, with decrease in hydrogen ion concentration, the pressure effect is much less, indicating a considerable volume increase in the process of ionization and activation. In the extremely alkaline range, beyond pH 9, luminescence is greatly reduced, as compared with the intensity at neutrality, and under these conditions pressure causes a pronounced increase in intensity, presumably by acting upon the reversible denaturation equilibrium of the protein enzyme, A. Sulfanilamide, in neutral solutions, acts on luminescence in a manner very much resembling that of hydrogen ions at acidities between pH 4. 0 and pH 6. 5. Like the hydrogen ion equilibrium, the sulfanilamide equilibrium involves a ratio of approximately one inhibitor molecule to one enzyme molecule. The heat of reaction amounts to about 11, 600 calories or more in a reversible combination that evidently evolves heat. Like the action of H ions, sulfanilamide causes a slight shifting of maximum luminescence intensity in the direction of higher temperatures, and an increase in the energy of activation. The effect of sulfanilamide on the growth of broth cultures of eight species of luminous bacteria indicates that there is no regular relationship among the different organisms between the concentration of the drug that prevents growth, and that which prevents luminescence in the cells which develop in the presence of sulfanilamide. p-Aminobenzoic acid (PAB) antagonizes the sulfanilamide inhibition of growth in luminous bacteria, and the cultures that develop are luminous. When (PAB) is added to cells from fully developed cultures, it has no effect on luminescence, or causes a slight inhibition, depending on the concentration. With luminescence partly inhibited by sulfanilamide, the addition of PAB has no effect, or has an inhibitory effect which adds to that caused by sulfanilamide. Two different, though possibly related, enzyme systems thus appear to limit growth and luminescence, respectively. The possible mechanism through which both the inhibitions and the antagonism take place is discussed. The irreversible destruction of the luminescent system at temperatures above that of the maximum luminescence, in a medium of favorable pH to which no inhibitors have been added, proceeds logarithmically with time at both normal and increased hydrostatic pressures. Pressure retards the rate of the destruction, and the analysis of the data indicates that a volume increase of roughly 71 cc. per gm. molecule at 32 ° C. takes place in going from the normal to the activated state in this reaction. At normal pressure, the rate of destruction has a temperature coefficient of approximately 90, 000 calories, or about 20, 000 calories more than the heat of reaction in the reversible denaturation equilibrium. The data indicate that the equilibrium and the rate process are two distinct reactions. The equation for luminescence intensity, taking into account both the reversible and irreversible phases of the reaction is given below. In the equation b is a proportionality constant; k' the rate constant of the luminescent reaction; A 0 the total luciferase; A 0 i the total initial luciferase at time t equals 0; kn the rate constant for the destruction of the native, active form of the enzyme; kd the rate constant for the destruction of the reversibly denatured, inactive form; t the time; and the other symbols are as indicated above: See PDF for Equation For reasons cited in the text, kn evidently equals kd. Urethane and alcohol, respectively, act in a manner (Type II) that promotes the breaking of the type of bonds broken in both the reversible and irreversible reactions and so promotes the irreversible denaturation. This result is in contrast to the effects of sulfanilamide, which at appropriate concentrations may give rise to the same initial inhibition as that caused by urethane, but remains constant with time. The inhibition caused by urethane and alcohol, respectively, increases as the temperature is raised. As a result, the apparent optimum is shifted to lower temperatures, and the activation energy for the over-all process of luminescence diminishes. An analysis for the approximate heat of reaction in the equilibrium between these drugs and the enzyme, indicates 65, 000 calories for urethane, and 37, 000 for alcohol. A similar analysis with respect to the effect of hydroxyl ions as the inhibitor gives 60, 300 calories. The effects of alcohol and urethane are sensitive to hydrostatic pressure. Moderate inhibitions at optimum temperature and pH, caused by relatively small concentrations of either drug, are completely abolished by pressures of 3, 000 to 4, 000 pounds per square inch. At optimum temperature and pH, increasing concentrations of alcohol caused the apparent optimum pressure for luminescence to shift markedly in the direction of higher pressures. Analysis of the data with respect to concentration of alcohol at different pressures indicated that the ratio of alcohol to enzyme molecules amounted to approximately 4, at 7, 000 pounds, but only about 2. 8 at normal pressures. This phenomenon was taken to indicate that more than one equilibrium is established between the alcohol and the protein. A similar interpretation was suggested in connection with the fact that analysis of the relation between concentration of urethane and amount of inhibition at different temperatures also indicated a ratio of urethane to enzyme molecules that increased with temperature in the equilibria involved. Analysis of the data with respect to pressure and the inhibition caused by a given concentration of alcohol at different temperatures indicated that the volume change involved in the combination of alcohol with the enzyme must be very small, while the actual effect of pressure is apparently mediated through the reversible denaturation of the protein enzyme, which is promoted by alcohol, urethane, and drugs of similar type...|$|E

Equilibrium dialysis analysis shows that dCMP binds to two sites in the dimer of both wild-type and mutant thymidylate synthase. A concomitant net uptake of protons with binding of dCMP to both enzymes, was detected carrying out calorimetric experiments in various buffer systems with different <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization.</b> The change in protonation for binding of dCMP to wild-type enzyme is lower than that obtained for binding of this nucleotide to TS N 229 D, which suggests that the pK value of Asp- 229 is increased upon dCMP binding to the mutant enzyme. At 25 °C, although the binding of dCMP to wild-type and N 229 D TS is favoured by both enthalpy and entropy changes, the enthalpy change is more negative for the mutant protein. Thus, the substitution of Asn 229 for Asp results in a higher affinity of TS for dCMP due to a more favourable enthalpic contribution.

Results from stopped-flow experiments fitted a {{dissociation constant}} of 0. 16 mM for the Michaelis complex, {{formation of an}} acetyl enzyme with a rate constant of 32 s- 1 and a subsequent deacylation step with a rate constant of 0. 81 s- 1. Non-linear Van't Hoff and Arrhenius plots for these parameters, measured at pH 7. 5, may be partly explained by a conformational transition affecting catalytic groups, but a linear Arrhenius plot for {{the ratio of the}} rate constant for acylation relative to KS was consistent with energy-compensation between the binding of the substrate and catalysis of the formation of the transition state. At 20 degreesC, the pH-dependence of kcat was similar to that of kcat/Km, indicating that formation of the acyl-enzyme did not affect the pKa values (6. 5 and 9. 0) of an acidic and basic group in the active enzyme. The <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> deduced from values of pKa for kcat, which measures the rate of deacylation, are consistent with alpha-amino and guanidinium groups whose pKa values are decreased in a non-polar environment.

40|$|Ionization {{constants}} {{for several}} simple amino acids have been measured {{for the first}} time under hydrothermal conditions, using visible spectroscopy with a high-temperature, high-pressure flow cell and thermally stable colorimetric pH indicators. This method minimizes amino acid decomposition at high temperatures because the data can be collected rapidly with short equilibration times. The first ionization constant for proline and α-alanine, Ka,COOH, and the first and second ionization constants for glycine, Ka,COOH and Ka,NH 4 +, have been determined at temperatures as high as 250 °C. Values for the standard partial molar <b>heat</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>ionization,</b> ΔrCpo,COOH and ΔrCpo,NH 4 +, have been determined from the temperature dependence of ln (Ka,COOH) and ln (Ka,NH 4 +).

40|$|Thermochemical {{properties}} {{related to}} molecular basicity are examined for series of substituted amines and nitriles using {{ion cyclotron resonance}} techniques and photoelectron spectroscopy. Proton affinities PA(B), defined for a base B as the heterolytic bond dissociation energy for removing a proton from the conjugate acid BH^+, and adiabatic ionization potentials, IP(B), are determined. In previously examined series of bases linear relationships have been established between proton affinities and adiabatic first ionization potentials which correspond to removal of an electron from a lone pair localized {{at the site of}} protonation. Nitrile proton affinities are found to be linearly related not to the first CN π ionization potentials but rather to the adiabatic N lone pair σ ionization potentials at higher energy. This relationship provides a useful chemical means for the assignment of bands in photoelectron spectra; specific examples are considered and assigned. Homolytic bond dissociation energies D(B^+-H) are obtained using the relation PA(B) -D(B^+-H) = IP(H) -IP(B). Systematic effects of substitution on PA(B), D(B^+-H), and IP(B) are identified and discussed in terms of the intrinsic factors affecting molecular basicity. Ion cyclotron resonance techniques are also used to measure relative heterolytic bond dissociation energies D(R^+-Br^-) in the gas phase for a series of alkali cations, alkyl carbenium ions, acylcations, and cyclic halonium ions. D(R^+-Br^-) for adamantyl cation is found to be less than for tert-butyl cation. A proton affinity for norbornene of D(B-H^+) = 198. 2 ± 2 kcal/mol is determined from which D(R^+-Br^-) = 146. 8 ± 2. 3 kcal/mol is calculated for norbornyl cation, 14 kcal/mol less than for cyclo-pentyl cation. Relative enthalpies of solvation are estimated via appropriate thermochemical cycles by combining the gas phase data with <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> <b>ionization</b> in fluorosulfuric acid. The results show that solvation enthalpies are related to ion size with smaller ions being better solvated. Relative stabilities of cyclic bromonium ions are the same in the gas phase and solution. Stability increases with increasing ring size and in the three-membered rings with methyl substitution. However, solvent has an appreciable effect in attenuating the observed range. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Statherin is a {{salivary protein}} that {{inhibits}} the nucleation {{and growth of}} hydroxyapatite crystals in the supersaturated environment of the oral cavity. The thermodynamics of adsorption of statherin onto hydroxyapatite crystals have been characterized here by isothermal titration calorimetry and equilibrium adsorption isotherm analysis. At 25 °C, statherin adsorption is characterized by an exothermic enthalpy of 3 kcal/mol that diminishes to zero at 25 % surface coverage. The initial <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> statherin adsorption increases with temperature, displaying a positive <b>heat</b> capacity change <b>of</b> 194 (7 cal K- 1 mol- 1 at 25 °C. The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> adsorption during this initial phase {{is strongly dependent on}} the buffer species, and from the differential <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> buffer <b>ionization,</b> it can be calculated that approximately one proton is taken up by the crystal or protein upon adsorption. The free energy of adsorption is dominated at all coverages by a large positive entropy (g 23 cal K- 1 mol- 1), which may be partially due to the loss of organized water that hydrates the protein and the mineral surface prior to adsorption. These results are interpreted using a two-site model for adsorption of statherin onto the hydroxyapatite crystals. Organisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for controlling inorganic mineral growth to make high-perfor-mance composite materials such as bone and teeth, and t...|$|R
40|$|We derive {{here the}} {{form for the}} exact {{exchange}} energy density for a density that decays with Gaussian-type behavior at long range. This functional is intermediate between the B 88 and the PW 91 exchange functionals. Using this modified functional to match the form expected for Gaussian densities, we propose the X 3 LYP extended functional. We find that X 3 LYP significantly outperforms Becke three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr (B 3 LYP) for describing van der Waals and hydrogen bond interactions, while performing slightly better than B 3 LYP for predicting <b>heats</b> <b>of</b> formation, <b>ionization</b> potentials, electron affinities, proton affinities, and total atomic energies as validated with the extended G 2 set of atoms and molecules. Thus X 3 LYP greatly enlarges the field of applications for density functional theory. In particular the success of X 3 LYP in describing the water dimer (with R-e and D-e within the error bars of the most accurate determinations) makes it an excellent candidate for predicting accurate ligand-protein and ligand-DNA interactions.

Two possible 6 -QNH 2 electro-oxidation pathways are investigated, namely, the initial single-electron oxidation of 6 -QNH 2 at lower electrode potentials, leading to the formation of cation radicals [6 -QNH 2]•+ in acidic solutions and neutral radicals [6 -QNH] • in alkaline solutions, as well as the two-electron oxidation of 6 -QNH 2 leading to the initial formation of nitrenium cations [6 -QNH]+ at higher electrode potentials. The regioselectivity of 6 -QNH 2 dimerization reactions, which follow both the single- and two-electron transfer reactions, is computationally studied. Cyclic voltammetry experiments, conducted at a glassy carbon paste electrode in Britton-Robinson buffer/methanol media, are correlated with the computationally predicted 6 -QNH 2 electro-oxidation mechanism.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of different density functional theory (DFT) and molecular orbital (MO) methods for calculating molecular and energetic properties of low-coordinated phosphorus compounds is reported. While DFT methods include both Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP and B 3 LYP) nonlocal functionals, MO methods involve second-order perturbation theory (MP 2), quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD(T) ], and coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T) ], {{in conjunction with}} the 6 - 31 G(d,p), 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 2 p), and 6 - 311 ++G(3 df, 3 pd) basis sets. Properties examined include geometrical parameters of the different CH 3 P equilibrium structures (phosphaethene, phosphinocarbene, methylphosphinidene, and a phosphacarbyne) and relevant transition structures for isomerisations and rearrangements in both the lowest-lying singlet and tripler states, vibrational wave numbers, relative energies, barrier heights, and singlet-triplet energy gaps. In addition, the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> formation, <b>ionization</b> energy, and proton affinity of phosphaethene are also evaluated.
