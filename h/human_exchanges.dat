50|$|Brazil and France share a 673 km {{border between}} the state of Amapá and the {{overseas}} department of French Guiana. The cross-border cooperation {{between the two countries}} has enjoyed increased vitality. This cooperation makes it possible to better integrate French Guyana into its geographical environment, to respond to the concerns of both parties about the various cross-border risks, to encourage <b>human</b> <b>exchanges</b> and trade and to develop the economy of the Amazon region, respecting the local populations and extraordinary environment. The granting to France, on the initiative of Brazil, of observer status within the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, will strengthen this cooperation. The construction of the Oyapock River Bridge over the Oyapock River, decided during President Lula’s visit to France, will make the Cayenne-Macapá road link possible.

30|$|In other words, all the {{temporal}} and spatial processes of cultural and <b>human</b> <b>exchanges</b> in the South China Sea Rim not only shape the cultural ecology, but also have a function of social integration. Such exchanges, including the flow of people and things, imply a stable underlying structure in the region. In a certain sense, the networked regional social system lays the methodological basis on which the South China Sea Rim is dealt with as a whole. By extracting and separating the multiple cultural and social networks from the system, this paper aims to probe into the historical process and the networked structure of regional social systems as well as into the structural characteristics of ethnic group activities.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{considers}} {{that the process}} of Europeanization through higher education is aided, sustained and undergirded by <b>human</b> <b>exchanges,</b> such as student and faculty mobility schemes, student exchanges endorsed through bilateral agreements or simply through personal relations forged in the context of individual studies abroad. While such transactions may occur through institutionally sanctioned programs, they have distinct and unintended consequences for the emergence of a European public space. The connections developed in these inter-human exchanges infuse European higher education with a mosaic of perspectives and practices circulating in a constant cycle of borrowing and localization. In turn, then, higher education serves as an aggregating and filtering system for the formation of a European intellectual realm premised upon the movement of ideas between students and faculty across the EU and Europe as a whole...|$|E

In {{the second part of}} this commentary, I analyze the contemporary conditions of globalization.

40|$|A common {{point of}} {{contention}} among educators and economists is the likely effect a free market would have on modern education. Most supporters of public schooling maintain that the field would either be adversely affected by competition and choice, or that the effects would be insubstantial. Conversely, {{a significant number of}} critics argue that education, like all other <b>human</b> <b>exchanges,</b> would respond to market incentives with improved performance, increased attention to the needs of families, and greater innovation. Historical evidence is presented indicating that teachers and schools are indeed affected by the financial incentives of the systems in which they operate. In particular, the data show that economic pressures have forced schools in competitive markets {{to meet the needs of}} families, through methodological advancements and diversity in curriculum, while centralized bureaucratic systems have generally been coercive and pedagogically stagnant...|$|E
40|$|As {{emblems of}} otherness {{in a space}} devoted to {{commercial}} and <b>human</b> <b>exchanges</b> and dedicated to mercantilism, Vietnamese women who cross the border and now live in areas bordering China have quickly come to represent their country—in the eyes of Chinese people—as a figure of marginal femininity. Observed, dated, used but rarely understood in a linguistic and cultural sense, it is their strong, sensual, and docile bodies that are primarily considered. Contradictory and accommodating images emerge and then expand in the discourses, portraying these women as submissive spouses, tireless workers, prostitutes, manipulators, heartless pragmatists, devoted companions, and ambiguous merchants.

40|$|We are {{presenting}} here, {{in three}} chapters {{centered around the}} notions of sign, translatability and context, a synthesis of Derrida's ideas about the theorization of translation. His thorough reading sheds light on the metaphysical, rather than purely scientific, ground of linguistics and semiotics, {{as well as on}} the fundamental role the idea of translatability plays in Western thinking. The two theological models of translatability are also considered, i. e., the logocentric and the Babelian approach, which opens up a paradoxical perspective, where translation appears to be at once necessary and impossible. This paradox emphasizes the intrinsically human dimension of translation, which then becomes a tool for knowledge, <b>human</b> <b>exchanges,</b> responsibility and creativity in attributing meaning and direction. We are finally presenting the new conceptual tools Derrida offers in respect to sign, reading, and writing, tools which reveal the complexity of the subject, but, conversely, position the translator's decision making and responsibility at the heart of the issue...|$|E

As such, the man appears in the polis as an individual and asserts himself as an individual in the community. Equipped with an oikos, the man together with other man constitutes the polis as a “community of freemen” (Arist. 1279 a 21). For <b>human</b> <b>exchange</b> and the true perception of good and bad and right and wrong, the polis “is prior in nature to the household and {{to each of us}} individually.

While these patterns are reported in the ethnobotanical literature for rural tropical and subtropical regions, there has been little work on comparable patterns for industrial and post-industrial Europe. We review the subject, and illustrate the issues with reference to recent data on the management of germplasm in British allotments in East Kent and West London...|$|R
40|$|The {{location}} {{and timing of}} domestication of the olive tree, a key crop in Early Mediterranean societies, remain hotly debated. Here, we unravel the history of wild olives (oleasters), and then infer the primary origins of the domesticated olive. Phylogeography and Bayesian molecular dating analyses based on plastid genome profiling of 1263 oleasters and 534 cultivated genotypes reveal three main lineages of pre-Quaternary origin. Regional hotspots of plastid diversity, species distribution modelling and macrofossils support the existence of three long-term refugia; namely the Near East (including Cyprus), the Aegean area and the Strait of Gibraltar. These ancestral wild gene pools have provided the essential foundations for cultivated olive breeding. Comparison of the geographical pattern of plastid diversity between wild and cultivated olives indicates the cradle of first domestication in the northern Levant followed by dispersals across the Mediterranean basin in parallel with the expansion of civilizations and <b>human</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{in this part of}} the world...|$|E

The novel depicts a dramatic crossroads of two epochs – the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of modern times. In doing so, it offers philosophical, moral and political implications for societal existence: the loss of the moral code of chivalry and the end of medieval idealism. The psychogenesis and sociogenesis of the most intimate aspects of <b>human</b> <b>exchanges</b> – love and friendship – is approached, in the article, {{from the perspective of the}} history of consciousness...|$|E

40|$|Reciprocating {{interactions}} {{represent a}} central feature of all <b>human</b> <b>exchanges.</b> They {{have been the}} target of various recent experiments, with healthy participants and psychiatric pop-ulations engaging as dyads in multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behav-iour in such exchanges involves complexities related to each agent’s preference for equity with their partner, beliefs about the partner’s appetite for equity, beliefs about the partner’s model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise account of the behaviour is an essential step to-wards understanding what underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an inter-active partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert observations of behavioural choices. We use generated be-haviour to elucidate the richness and sophistication of interactive inference...|$|E

In the past decade, scholars of live art have become increasing absorbed by discussion of the archive, and the questions of what remains of artists’ transient, time-based interventions in the aesthetic, social and political sphere. Today, the archive is framed as active, and productive – a fertile repository of records that actively reach out to their own future role in an as-yet-unauthored archaeology of practice. Photos, texts, footage and artefacts of live art practices stimulate productive new encounters, productive new interpretations, allowing the exchanges that take place at an event like Exist in 08 to extend beyond the event itself, and inform the ongoing development of the artists, the artform, and scholarly research into the artform.

40|$|Promises {{are central}} to <b>human</b> <b>exchanges,</b> {{especially}} in adult-child interactions. They consist of a commitment {{on the part of}} the speaker to perform a future act, as in "je promets de ranger ma chambre " ("I promise to clean my room"). For the past ten years, we have been investigating promise comprehension among children from the point of view that language is a communication system and that language competence is the acquisition and use of that system. The emphasis is therefore placed on the functional aspects of language (Bates, 1976; Bruner, 1983; Ervin-Tripp and Mitchell-Kernan, 1977; Halliday, 1985; Ninio & Snow, 1996; Tomasello, 2000). It has been shown in this perspective that interaction formats or routines (prototypical exemplars of social relations) are very important for young children (Bernicot, 1994; Marcos & Bernicot, 1994; 1997). Some of the questions that we have been addressing are the following: How do children understand utterances that express a promise? How does their comprehension evolve with age? What cues do children use to interpret utterances expressing promises? Do they consider contextual cues, such as the listener's wishes about the accomplishment of an action (Bernicot and Laval, 1996) or do they rely on textual cues such as the utterance's linguisti...|$|E
