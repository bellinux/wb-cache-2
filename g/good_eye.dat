His <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> and accurate throws often saw him run batsmen out with direct hits.|$|E

25|$|After {{meeting with}} the Sioux, Walsh set up two {{outposts}} on the Wood Mountain side of Cypress Hills. One would {{be closer to the}} Sioux while the other would be a halfway camp, near present-day Eastend. Walsh decided to build a house at the Wood Mountain post so he could keep a <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> on Sitting Bull. Worried that the Sioux may engage in war either with the United States or other tribes, Walsh instructed Wood Mountain traders, such as Légaré, to give the Sioux only enough ammunition to hunt for food.|$|E
25|$|On February 7, 1950, McGuirk’s career {{came to an}} end. In Little Rock, Arkansas, McGuirk {{was being}} driven to a {{restaurant}} by his wrestling pupil, Robert “Bob” Clay. In an attempt to prevent a collision, Clay locked the car’s brakes, and McGuirk was thrown against the front windshield. McGuirk’s tinted glasses were shattered and {{the side of the}} glasses covering his <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> were fractured, blinding McGuirk permanently. It was another Oklahoman, Danny Hodge, who rose to prominence in the Junior Heavyweight field. By 1960, Hodge became the principal headliner for McGuirk.|$|E

25|$|Shyness {{may involve}} the {{discomfort}} of difficulty in {{knowing what to}} say in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves {{a combination of both}} symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{protection}} such as {{welding goggles}} should be worn at all times, including {{to protect the}} eyes against glare and flying sparks. Special safety eyewear must be used—both to protect the welder {{and to provide a}} clear view through the yellow-orange flare given off by the incandescing flux. In the 1940s cobalt melters’ glasses were borrowed from steel foundries and were still available until the 1980s. However, the lack of protection from impact, ultra-violet, infrared and blue light caused severe eyestrain and eye damage. Didymium eyewear, developed for glassblowers in the 1960s, was also borrowed—until many complained of eye problems from excessive infrared, blue light, and insufficient shading. Today very <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> protection can be found designed especially for gas-welding aluminum that cuts the sodium orange flare completely and provides the necessary protection from ultraviolet, infrared, blue light and impact, according to ANSI Z87-1989 safety standards for a Special Purpose Lens.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, a batsman needs <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> {{reflexes}} {{which are}} considered to be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly a batsman often needs to anticipate beforehand what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler's grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball's flight.|$|E

25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{a small amount}} of {{responsiveness}} to nonverbal information, including gestures and facial expressions from other people, and made reasonably <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> contact. However, her demeanor was completely devoid of any expressions or discernible body language, and she could only nonverbally get across a few very basic needs. She clearly distinguished speaking from other sounds but remained almost completely silent and unresponsive to speech, and any responses she gave were to accompanying nonverbal signals. When upset Genie would wildly attack herself, but remained completely expressionless and never cried or vocalized; some accounts said she could not cry at all. To make noise, she would push chairs or other similar objects. Her outbursts initially occurred very often and had no discernible trigger—Kent wrote that she never tried to indicate the source of her anger—and continued until someone diverted her attention or she physically tired herself out, at which point she would again become silent and non-expressive.|$|E

500|$|On October 19, 2010, Scribner {{published}} {{a collection of}} short stories, Palo Alto, by Franco. The book is named after the California city where Franco grew up and is dedicated to many of the writers he worked with at Brooklyn College. Inspired by some of Franco's own teenage memories Palo Alto, and memories written and submitted by high school students at Palo Alto Senior High School, consists of life in Palo Alto as experienced by a series of teenagers who {{spend most of their time}} indulging in driving drunk, smoking weed and taking part in unplanned acts of violence. Each passage is told by a young narrator. The book has received mixed reviews; Los Angeles Times called it [...] "the work of an ambitious young man who clearly loves to read, who has a <b>good</b> <b>eye</b> for detail, but who has spent way too much time on style and virtually none on substance". The Guardian said that Franco's [...] "foray into the literary world may be met with cynicism in some quarters, but this is a promising debut from a most unlikely source". Writing in The New York Times, reviewer and fellow author Joshua Mohr praised Franco for how, in the story [...] "American History", he juxtaposed historical parts with a present-day social commentary that [...] "makes the we wonder how much we've actually evolved in post-bellum America". At least one editor of a literary journal testified he would not publish Franco's stories, claiming he has been published due to his star power, not literary talent. Publishers Weekly reviewed the collection, stating [...] "The author fails to find anything remotely insightful to say in these 11 amazingly underwhelming stories".|$|E
