40|$|One of {{the first}} steps in {{neurogenesis}} is the diversification of cells along the dorsoventral axis. In Drosophila {{the central nervous system}} develops from three longitudinal columns of cells: ventral cells that express the vnd/nk 2 homeobox gene, intermediate cells, and dorsal cells that express the msh homeobox gene. Here we describe a new Drosophila homeobox gene, intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind), which is expressed specifically in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> cells. ind is essential for <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> development: Null mutants have a transformation of intermediate to dorsal column neuroectoderm fate, and only 10 % of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> neuroblasts develop. The establishment of dorsoventral column identity involves negative regulation: Vnd represses ind in the ventral column, whereas ind represses msh in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>column.</b> Vertebrate genes closely related to vnd (Nkx 2. 1 and Nkx 2. 2), ind (Gsh 1 and Gsh 2), and msh (Msx 1 and Msx 3) are expressed in corresponding ventral, intermediate, and dorsal domains during vertebrate neurogenesis, raising the possibility that dorsoventral patterning within the central nervous system is evolutionarily conserved...|$|E
30|$|It is {{noticed that}} with the {{increment}} of the slope, the fundamental time period of the models gets reduced. The reduction of column length increases the structural stiffness; as a result, the time period reduces. Models on 45 ° slope (MF 45 and MS 45) show marginal increase of time period compared to the models on 30 ° slope (MF 30 and MS 30). The models on 15 ° slope (MF 15 and MS 15) and 30 ° (MF 30 and MS 30) slope have <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> length (in between 0 and 3  m) in different storey levels along the height, which does not allow the storeys to vibrate freely as a complete storey. These intermediate columns provide additional stiffness to those storeys and reduce the time period of the models, but the models on 45 ° slope (MF 45 and MS 45) get a complete storey on each level, which results in a minor increase in flexibility {{as well as in}} time period.|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila CNS {{develops}} {{from three}} columns of neuroectodermal cells along the dorsoventral (DV) axis: ventral, intermediate, and dorsal. In {{this and the}} accompanying paper, we investigate the role of two homeobox genes, vnd and ind, in establishing ventral and intermediate cell fates within the Drosophila CNS. During early neurogenesis, Vnd protein is restricted to ventral column neuroectoderm and neuroblasts; later it is detected in a complex pattern of neurons. We use molecular markers that distinguish ventral, intermediate, and dorsal column neuroectoderm and neuroblasts, and a cell lineage marker for selected neuroblasts, to show that loss of vnd transforms ventral into <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> identity and that specific ventral neuroblasts fail to form. Conversely, ectopic vnd produces an intermediate to ventral column transformation. Thus, vnd is necessary and sufficient to induce ventral fates and repress intermediate fates within the Drosophila CNS. Vertebrate homologs of vnd (Nkx 2. 1 and 2. 2) are similarly expressed in the ventral CNS, raising the possibility that DV patterning within the CNS is evolutionarily conserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila {{columnar}} {{genes are}} key regulators of neural precursor formation and patterning along the dorsal–ventral {{axis of the}} developing CNS and include ventral nerve cord defective (vnd), intermediate nerve cord defective (ind), muscle segment homeodomain (msh), and Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr). To investigate the evolution of neural pattern formation, we identified and determined the expression patterns of Tribolium vnd, ind, and msh, and found that they are expressed in the medial, intermediate, and lateral columns of the developing CNS, respectively, in patterns similar, but not identical, to their Drosophila orthologs. The pattern of Egfr activity suggests that the genetic regulatory mechanisms that initiate Tc-vnd expression are similar in Drosophila and Tribolium, whereas those that initiate Tc-ind have diverged. RNAi analyses of gene function show that Tc-vnd and Tc-ind promote the formation of medial and <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> neural precursors and that vnd-mediated repression of ind establishes {{the boundary between the}} medial and intermediate columns. These data suggest that columnar gene expression and function underlie neural pattern formation in Drosophila, Tribolium, and potentially all insects, but that subtle spatiotemporal differences in expression of these genes may produce species-specific morphological differences...|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} that in both methods, {{the amount of}} bending moment, in every column of each individual storey is almost similar for the models of 0 ° slope (MF 0 and MS 0). Maximum bending moment is at ground storey (GS) columns {{and the value of}} bending moments reduces with the increment of storey height in models of 0 ° slope. But in the models other than 0 ° slope, the columns of the shorter side of the structure at the higher level of the slope is facing higher bending moment compared to the columns of taller side at lower level of the slope. So in models resting on sloping ground, within a particular storey there is huge variation of column forces and the columns with higher bending moment at the upper side of the slope are affected severely during earthquake. Increment of the column bending moment in the upper side of the slope is noticed with increase of slope angle. Slope angle variation results in the formation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> lengths (in between 0 and 3  m) at different storey level of models resting on 15 ° and 30 ° slopes. These reduced columns carry higher bending moments compared to full-length columns.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Drosophila neuroectoderm is {{initially}} subdivided into three longitudinal domains that {{give rise to}} columns of neuroblasts. This subdivision is coordinately accomplished by the action of the signaling pathways, Dorsal and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), in conjunction with the homeodomain proteins, Ventral nervous system defective, Intermediate neuroblasts defective (Ind) and Muscle Segment Homeobox. We previously demonstrated that Ind expression is activated in response to the EGFR pathway. Here we show that EGF signaling subsequently mediates the direct phosphorylation of Ind by MAP kinase, which enhances the capacity of Ind to repress target genes, such as achaete. Specifically, we show that reduced EGF signaling results in diminished repression of achaete in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>column,</b> despite the presence of high levels of Ind protein. We also demonstrate that ectopic activation of MAP kinase results in the lateral expansion of the Ind expression domain with a corresponding reduction in achaete expression. This regulation is also dependent on the co-repressor, Dichaete. Our data indicate that EGF signaling, acting through MAP kinase, impinges on multiple aspects of Ind regulatory activity. While it has been often demonstrated that MAP kinase phosphorylation of transcriptional repressors attenuates their repressor activity, here we provide an example of phosphorylation enhancing repressor activity...|$|E

40|$|Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) exerts its {{functions}} through natriuretic peptide receptors. Recently, BNP {{has been}} shown to be involved in a wide range of functions. Previous studies reported BNP expression in the sensory afferent fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. However, BNP expression and function in the neurons of the central nervous system are still controversial. Therefore, in this study, we investigated BNP expression in the rat spinal cord in detail using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR analysis showed that BNP mRNA was present in the spinal cord and DRG. BNP immunoreactivity was observed in different structures of the spinal cord, including the neuronal cell bodies and neuronal processes. BNP immunoreactivity was observed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and in the neurons of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> and ventral horn. Double-immunolabeling showed a high level of BNP expression in the afferent fibers (laminae I-II) labeled with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), suggesting BNP involvement in sensory function. In addition, BNP was co-localized with CGRP and choline acetyltransferase in the motor neurons of the ventral horn. Together, these results indicate that BNP is expressed in sensory and motor systems of the spinal cord, suggesting its involvement in several biological actions on sensory and motor neurons via its binding to NPR-A and/or NPR-B in the DRG and spinal cord...|$|E
40|$|Cold-formed steel unequal angles are non-symmetric sections. The design {{procedure}} of non-symmetric sections subjected to axial compression load {{could be quite}} difficult. The unequal angle columns may fail by different buckling modes, such as local, flexural and flexural-torsional buckling as well as interaction of these buckling modes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the behaviour and design of cold-formed steel unequal angle columns. A nonlinear finite element analysis was conducted to investigate the strength and behaviour of unequal angle columns. The measured initial local and overall geometric imperfections as well as the material properties of the angle specimens were included in the finite element model. The finite element analysis was performed on fixed-ended columns for different lengths ranged from stub to long columns. It is demonstrated that the finite element model closely predicted the experimental ultimate loads and the behaviour of cold-formed steel unequal angle columns. Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries. The column strengths obtained from the parametric study were compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification for cold-formed steel structural members. It is shown that the current design rules are generally unconservative for short and <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> lengths for the unequal angles. Therefore, design rules of cold-formed steel unequal angle columns are proposed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Mitigation of {{progressive}} collapse {{after an initial}} failure has become a primary concern of engineers in recent years. Often alternative load paths are sought to redistribute load from the damaged area. It has been recognised {{for some time that}} the omission of compressive membrane action (CMA), also termed ‘arching action’, can lead to a significant underestimation of load capacity. An investigation has been conducted to ascertain whether the additional load carrying capacity from CMA can provide an inherent alternative load path to aid robustness. A series of scaled specimens with industry standard detailing have been designed for an experimental investigation. Reinforced concrete elements were modelled in the double span scenario once an <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> has been removed. The test rig used allows the central support to be removed followed by the application of a point load applied at midspan; the system is determinate including measurement of the horizontal reaction. Subsequent to the flexural response two modes of membrane action are induced, initially compressive until tensile membrane extends load capacity at high values of deflection. The response during the latter tensile phase is outside the scope of this research. Comparisons of experimental data with analytical methods inclusive of CMA have demonstrated that whilst conservative the method by Merola (2009) provides a reasonable prediction. This method has been utilised in a study of a series of flat slab structures with a range of column spacings. The inherent restraint stiffness provided by the surrounding slab and frame has been quantified using FEA and has allowed for the extent to which CMA can improve the robustness of a structure to be determined...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{intrinsic}} {{muscles of the}} back are defined by their embryological origin and innervation pattern, no detailed study on their development is available. Human embryos (5 - 10 weeks development) were studied, using Amira 3 D® reconstruction and Cinema 4 D® remodeling software for visualization. At Carnegie Stage (CS) 15, the epaxial portions of the myotomes became identifiable laterally to the developing vertebrae. At CS 16, these portions fused starting cranially to form a longitudinal muscle column, which became innervated by the dorsal branches of the spinal nerves. At CS 17, the longitudinal muscle mass segregated into medial and lateral columns (completed at CS 18). At CS 18, the medial column segregated again into intermediate and medial columns (completed at CS 20). The lateral and intermediate columns did not separate in the lower lumbar and sacral regions. Between CS 20 and CS 23, the cervical portions of the three columns segregated again from lateral to medial resulting ventrolaterally in rod-like continuations of the caudal portions of the columns and dorsomedially in spade-like portions. The observed topography identifies the iliocostalis and splenius as belonging to the lateral column, the longissimus to the <b>intermediate</b> <b>column,</b> and the (semi-) spinalis to the medial column.

40|$|A new {{modification}} of existing intermediate capillary column tests for uncoated columns is presented. A short (1 m), thick film (2 µm) precolumn is coupled to the column to be tested. The {{use of a}} short precolumn results in a rapid test. This makes it attractive {{in terms of time}} to inject the test compounds separately, thus excluding mutual influences, in diluted solutions spiked with n-alkanes as references. Moreover, the short precolumn gives sharp Gaussian injection profiles on the second column. A simple versatile coupling device has been developed, which permits easy control and adjustment of pressures and carrier flows, monitoring of the effluents of the precolumn and introduction of sharp input bands on the second column. The monitor detector accurately shows the shape and time of introduction of the compounds on the second column. This permits the evaluation of peak distortion, peak shift and yield on the second column. Test compounds were {{selected on the basis of}} their physico-chemical properties (vapour pressure, acid-base properties, dipole moments, hydrogen bonding, complexation with metals, etc.). A number of differently pretreated capillaries were tested with these compounds under various external conditions. Accurate quantification and qualification of the activity of the capillary present difficulties. The test is a case of nearly ideal non-linear chromatography. When peaks of different sizes are superimposed, the tails lie on a common envelope. The k' of the end of the tail is fixed, irrespective of the amount injected, and forms an important parameter in the evaluation. Reconstruction of the chromatogram with a k' scale instead of a time scale eliminates the influence of carrier velocity and column length.

40|$|International audienceHerschel {{has shown}} that {{filamentary}} structures are ubiquitous in star-forming regions, in particular in nearby molecular clouds associated with Gould's Belt. High dynamic range far-infrared imaging of the Musca cloud with SPIRE and PACS reveals at least two types of filamentary structures: (1) the main ~ 10 -pc scale high column-density linear filament; and (2) low column-density striations {{in close proximity to}} the main filament. In addition, we find features with <b>intermediate</b> <b>column</b> densities (hair-like strands) that appear physically connected to the main filament. We present an analysis of this filamentary network traced by Herschel and explore its connection with the local magnetic field. We find that both the faint dust emission striations and the plane-of-the-sky (POS) magnetic field are locally oriented close to perpendicular to the high-density main filament (position angle ~ 25 - 35 °). The low-density striations and strands are oriented parallel to the POS magnetic field lines, which are derived previously from optical polarization measurements of background stars and more recently from Planck observations of dust polarized emission. The position angles are 97 ± 25 °, 105 ± 7 °, and 105 ± 5 °. From these observations, we propose a scenario in which local interstellar material in this cloud has condensed into a gravitationally-unstable filament (with "supercritical" mass per unit length) that is accreting background matter along field lines through the striations. We also compare the filamentary structure in Musca with what is seen in similar Herschel observations of the Taurus B 211 / 3 filament system and find that there is significantly less substructure in the Musca main filament than in the B 211 / 3 filament. We suggest that the Musca cloud may represent an earlier evolutionary stage in which the main filament has not yet accreted sufficient mass and energy to develop a multiple system of intertwined filamentary components.

The complex stiffeners {{of the channel}} sections consist of simple lips with return lips. A total of 30 column specimens were tested. The specimens were brake pressed from high strength zinc-coated structural steel sheets. Four different cross sections with different flange slenderness were tested over a range of column lengths. Detailed measurements of material properties, geometric imperfections, and local buckling loads of the specimens were conducted. Interaction of local and overall buckling was observed in the tests. Failure modes include local buckling, distortional buckling, and flexural-torsional buckling. The test strengths of the columns are compared with the design strengths predicted by the American Specification and the Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Design column curves are also plotted. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by the American Specification are generally unconservative for short and <b>intermediate</b> <b>columns,</b> whereas the design strengths predicted by the Australian/New Zealand Standard are generally conservative for all column lengths.

However, a molar was cut in mid-sagittal plane, and in that section, which I illustrated, the valleys are closed in at the bottom, Yshaped, as in a stegodont.
