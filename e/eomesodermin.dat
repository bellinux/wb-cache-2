40|$|SummaryThe {{regulation}} of memory CD 4 + helper T (Th) cell function, such as polarized cytokine production, remains unclear. Here {{we show that}} memory T helper 2 (Th 2) cells are divided into four subpopulations by CD 62 L and CXCR 3 expression. All four subpopulations produced interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 13, whereas only the CD 62 LloCXCR 3 lo population produced IL- 5 accompanied by increased H 3 -K 4 methylation at the Il 5 gene locus. The transcription factor <b>Eomesodermin</b> (encoded by Eomes) was highly expressed in memory Th 2 cells, whereas its expression was selectively downregulated in the IL- 5 -producing cells. Il 5 expression was enhanced in Eomes-deficient cells, and <b>Eomesodermin</b> was shown {{to interact with the}} transcription factor GATA 3, preventing GATA 3 binding to the Il 5 promoter. Memory Th 2 cell-dependent airway inflammation was attenuated {{in the absence of the}} CD 62 LloCXCR 3 lo population but was enhanced by Eomes-deficient memory Th 2 cells.

40|$|SummaryThe cell-intrinsic {{mechanisms}} guiding naive CD 8 + T cells for clonal {{expansion and}} memory generation via homeostatic proliferation (HP) are unclear. Here, {{we have shown}} that HP of naive CD 8 + T cells requires IL- 7 -, but not IL- 15 -induced mTOR kinase activation. HP-induced mTOR enhances transcription factor T-bet for functional maturation and CD 122 expression, which sensitizes for an IL- 15 -dependent memory transition by favoring transcription factor <b>Eomesodermin</b> over T-bet. Inhibition of mTOR blocks T-bet and CD 122 expression but preserves memory in an IL- 15 -independent manner by promoting <b>Eomesodermin</b> expression. The ability of rapamycin to augment HP-induced memory was cell-intrinsic given that silencing mTOR in CD 8 + T cells generated identical outcomes. Strikingly, HP-induced CD 8 + T cell memory generated by IL- 15 -dependent or -independent mechanisms demonstrated identical tumor efficacy. These results indicate a central role for mTOR in HP-induced CD 8 + T cell responses and demonstrate the importance for CD 8 + memory in HP-induced tumor efficacy...|$|E

Here we report an extensive ex vivo analysis of HIV-specific CD 8 T cells, covering the expression of 16 different molecules involved in CD 8 function or differentiation. This approach gave remarkably homogeneous readouts in different donors and showed that CD 8 dysfunction in chronic HIV infection was much more severe than described previously: some Ifng transcription was observed, but most cells lost the expression of all cytolytic molecules and <b>Eomesodermin</b> and T-bet by chronic infection. These results reveal a cellular mechanism explaining the dysfunction of CD 8 T cells during chronic HIV infection, as CD 8 T cells are known to maintain some functionality when either of these transcription factors is present, but to lose all cytotoxic activity when both are not expressed. Surprisingly, they also show that chronic HIV and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infections have a very different impact on fundamental T-cell functions, "exhausted" lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific cells losing {{the capacity to}} secrete IFN-γ but maintaining some cytotoxic activity as granzyme B and FasL are overexpressed and, while down-regulating T-bet, up-regulating <b>Eomesodermin</b> expression...|$|E
40|$|The {{high rates}} of {{embryonic}} mortalities which follow in vitro production of ruminant embryos have emphasized the need for increased knowledge of early development. It is likely that early failures in embryonic development and placenta formation involve abnormal differentiation of mesoderm. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the pattern of expression of two T-box genes known to control the gastrulation process, Brachyury and <b>Eomesodermin,</b> by whole-mount in situ hybridization. To allow a more precise comparison of both expression patterns between embryos, we describe a new staging of pre-implanted ovine embryos by gross morphology and histology from pre-gastrulation stages to the beginning of neurulation. In pre-streak embryos primitive mesoderm cells delaminated in between the primitive endoderm and the epiblast. At that stage, no expression of Brachyury or <b>Eomesodermin</b> could be detected in the embryos. Early expression of both T-genes was observed by the early-streak stages in epiblast cells located close to the presumptive posterior pole of the embryos. Later on, during gas-trulation both genes followed a pattern of expression similar to the ones described in other mammals. These observations suggest that other genes, which remain to be identified, are responsible for extra-embryonic mesoderm differentiation in rumi-nant embryos. Reproduction (2004) 127 491 – 50...|$|E

Less {{is known about the}} role of IL- 17. We observed increased IL- 6 and IL- 17 levels in tracheal aspirate samples from severely ill infants with RSV infection. In a mouse model of RSV infection, time-dependent increases in pulmonary IL- 6, IL- 23, and IL- 17 expression were observed. Neutralization of IL- 17 during infection and observations from IL- 17 −/− knockout mice resulted in significant inhibition of mucus production during RSV infection. RSV-infected animals treated with anti-IL- 17 had reduced inflammation and decreased viral load, compared with control antibody-treated mice. Blocking IL- 17 during infection resulted in significantly increased RSV-specific CD 8 T cells. Factors associated with CD 8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes, T-bet, IFN-γ, <b>eomesodermin,</b> and granzyme B were significantly up-regulated after IL- 17 blockade. Additionally, in vitro analyses suggest that IL- 17 directly inhibits T-bet, <b>eomesodermin,</b> and IFN-γ in CD 8 T cells. The role of IL- 17 was also investigated in RSV-induced exacerbation of allergic airway responses, in which neutralization of IL- 17 led to a significant decrease in the exacerbated disease, including reduced mucus production and Th 2 cytokines, with decreased viral proteins. Taken together, our data demonstrate that IL- 17 plays a pathogenic role during RSV infections...|$|E

The process of AVE induction and migration are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that the T-box gene <b>Eomesodermin</b> (Eomes) plays {{an essential role in}} AVE recruitment, in part by directly activating the homeobox transcription factor Lhx 1.

However, during tail-bud stages, Eomes expression is re-born in the most anterior part of the brain, becoming strongly transcribed in the olfactory region of the telencephalon.

However, loss of FoxH 1 in several species does not reliably cause {{the full range}} of loss-of-Nodal phenotypes, indicating that Nodal signals through additional transcription factors during early development. We investigated the FoxH 1 -dependent and -independent roles of Nodal signaling during mesendoderm patterning using a novel recessive zebrafish FoxH 1 mutation called midway, which produces a C-terminally truncated FoxH 1 protein lacking the Smad-interaction domain but retaining DNA-binding capability. Using a combination of gel shift assays, Nodal overexpression experiments, and genetic epistasis analyses, we demonstrate that midway more accurately represents a complete loss of FoxH 1 -dependent Nodal signaling than the existing zebrafish FoxH 1 mutant schmalspur. Maternal-zygotic midway mutants lack notochords, in agreement with FoxH 1 loss in other organisms, but retain near wild-type expression of markers of endoderm and various nonaxial mesoderm fates, including paraxial and intermediate mesoderm and blood precursors. We found that the activity of the T-box transcription factor <b>Eomesodermin</b> accounts for specification of these tissues in midway embryos. Inhibition of <b>Eomesodermin</b> in midway mutants severely reduces the specification of these tissues and effectively phenocopies the defects seen upon complete loss of Nodal signaling. Our results indicate that the specific combinations of transcription factors available for signal transduction play critical and separable roles in determining Nodal pathway output during mesendoderm patterning. Our findings also offer novel insights into the co-evolution of the Nodal signaling pathway, the notochord specification program, and the chordate branch of the deuterostome family of animals...|$|E

To better define the generation and maintenance of these effective CD 8 (+) T cell responses, we used microarrays to characterize gene expression in total and EBV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 10 individuals followed from acute infectious mononucleosis (AIM) into convalescence (CONV). In total CD 8 (+) T cells, differential expression of genes in AIM and CONV was most pronounced among those encoding proteins important in T cell activation/differentiation, cell division/metabolism, chemokines/cytokines and receptors, signaling and transcription factors (TF), immune effector functions, and negative regulators. Within these categories, we identified 28 genes that correlated with CD 8 (+) T cell expansion {{in response to an}} acute EBV infection. In EBV-specific CD 8 (+) T cells, we identified 33 genes that were differentially expressed in AIM and CONV. Two important TF, T-bet and <b>eomesodermin,</b> were upregulated and maintained at similar levels in both AIM and CONV; in contrast, protein expression declined from AIM to CONV. Expression of these TF varied among cells with different epitope specificities. Collectively, gene and protein expression patterns suggest that a large proportion, if not a majority of CD 8 (+) T cells in AIM are virus specific, activated, dividing, and primed to exert effector activities. High expression of T-bet and <b>eomesodermin</b> may help to maintain effector mechanisms in activated cells and to enable proliferation and transition to earlier differentiation states in CONV...|$|E

We find that maternal β-catenin signaling is not only active dorsally but also all around the equatorial region, coinciding with the prospective mesoderm. Maternal β-catenin function is required both for expression of dorsal genes and for activation of MAPK and the mesodermal markers Xbra and <b>eomesodermin.</b> β-catenin acts in a non- cell-autonomous manner upstream of zygotic FGF and nodal signals.

Eomes also rapidly induces the expression of Mesp 1, a key regulator of cardiovascular differentiation, and directly binds to regulatory sequences of Mesp 1. Eomes effects are strikingly modulated by Activin signalling: high levels of Activin inhibit the promotion of cardiac mesoderm by Eomes, while they enhance Eomes-dependent endodermal specification.

We identify a genetic interaction between Ago 2 and T, as Ago 2 haploinsufficiency partially rescues the classic T/+ short-tail phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that the ectopic T expression and concomitant mesoderm expansion result from disrupted fibroblast growth factor signaling, likely due to aberrant expression of <b>Eomesodermin.</b> Together, these data indicate that a factor best known as a key component of the RNA-induced silencing complex is required for proper fibroblast growth factor signaling during gastrulation, suggesting a possible micro-RNA function in the formation of a mammalian germ layer...|$|E

We discuss how T-bet and Eomes expression is regulated during NK cell development and peripheral maturation. Furthermore, we summarize the current literature on the role of T-bet and Eomes in the transcriptional regulation of NK cell function and review possible effects of T-box transcription factor anomalies during aging, infection, cancer, and after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Differential {{expression of the}} T-box transcription factors T-bet and <b>Eomesodermin</b> (Eomes) facilitated the cooperative maintenance of the pool of antiviral CD 8 (+) T cells during chronic viral infection. T-bet(hi) cells displayed low intrinsic turnover but proliferated in response to persisting antigen, giving rise to Eomes(hi) terminal progeny.

Here we report that Eomes expression within the primitive streak marks the earliest cardiac mesoderm and promotes formation of cardiovascular progenitors by directly activating the bHLH (basic-helix-loop-helix) transcription factor gene Mesp 1 upstream of the core cardiac transcriptional machinery. In marked contrast to Eomes/Nodal signalling interactions that cooperatively regulate anterior-posterior axis patterning and allocation of the definitive endoderm cell lineage, formation of cardiac progenitors requires only low levels of Nodal activity accomplished through a Foxh 1 /Smad 4 -independent mechanism.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of intracellular signaling {{is critical to}} the ability of a T cell to develop, survive, and function in an immune response. In this work, we examined the effect of T cell-specific deletion of the Ras GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) neurofibromin (NF 1) on T cell development and function. We have determined that NF 1 has a non-redundant role in T cell development in the thymus as well as in peripheral T cell homeostasis. NF 1 -deficient naïve CD 8 + T cells express higher amounts of the effector cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and the transcription factor <b>Eomesodermin,</b> and this is likely the reason for the ability of T cell-specific neurofibromin-deficient mice to respond more efficiently to Listeria monocytogenes infection in vivo. We have also determined that the cytokine IL- 4 is an inducer of IFN-gamma expression in wild-type CD 8 + T cells. IL- 4 directly induces transcription at the ifng locus, which is augmented by concomitant T cell antigen-receptor (TCR) stimulation, and is likely due to IL- 4 -mediated up{{regulation of}} the transcription factors <b>Eomesodermin</b> and T-bet. The effects of IL- 4 on IFN-gamma expression in CD 8 + T cells are mediated by Ras-ERK and PI 3 K signaling, with dependence on STAT 6 activation when the TCR is activated concomitantly with the IL- 4 receptor. Finally, we show that the induced systemic loss of both NF 1 and the related RasGAP RASA 1 in adult mice promotes the development of T cell lymphoma. Lymphoma cells were found to populate all hematopoietic and were CD 4 +CD 8 + CD 25 +TCR- cells of thymic origin. Tumor cells were also found to possess activating mutations in Notch 1, a hallmark of both human and murine T cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-ALL), in all but one instance of disease.

However, it remains unclear how HHEX functions in this process. To reveal the molecular mechanisms of hepatic specification by HHEX, we tried to identify the genes directly targeted by HHEX. We found that HHEX knockdown considerably enhanced the expression level of <b>eomesodermin</b> (EOMES). In addition, HHEX bound to the HHEX response element located in the first intron of EOMES. Loss-of-function assays of EOMES showed that the gene expression levels of hepatoblast markers were significantly upregulated, suggesting that EOMES has a negative role in hepatic specification from the DE cells.

Eomes synergizes potently with Bon and Gata 5 to induce cas, even in animal pole blastomeres. We show that Eomes is required for endogenous endoderm induction, acting via an essential binding site in the cas promoter.

We show that deletion of Eomes alleles {{at the onset}} of type 1 ILC maturation using NKp 46 -Cre imposes a substantial block in cNK development. Formation of the entire lymphoid and nonlymphoid type 1 ILC compartment appears to require the semiredundant action of both T-bet and Eomes. To determine if Eomes is sufficient to redirect hILC 1 development to a cNK fate, we generated transgenic mice that express Eomes when and where T-bet is expressed using Tbx 21 locus control to drive expression of Eomes codons. Ectopic Eomes induces cNK-like properties across the lymphoid and nonlymphoid type 1 ILC compartments.

Consistent with this observation, the phenotype, function and age-dependent expansion of 'virtual memory' CD 8 (+) T cells are strongly affected in absence of type I interferon signalling. In addition, type I interferons induce a sustained expansion of 'virtual memory' CD 8 (+) T cells in an Eomes-dependent fashion. We further show that the development of 'innate thymic' CD 8 (+) T cells is dependent on the same pathway.

40|$|The T-box {{transcription}} factors T-bet and <b>Eomesodermin</b> (Eomes) {{have been}} well defined as key drivers of immune cell development and cytolytic function. While the majority of studies have defined the roles of these factors {{in the context of}} murine T-cells, recent results have revealed that T-bet, and possibly Eomes, are expressed in other immune cell subsets. To date, the expression patterns of these factors in subsets of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells beyond T-cells remain relatively uncharacterized. In this study, we used multiparametric flow cytometry to characterize T-bet and Eomes expression in major human blood cell subsets, including total CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells, γδ T-cells, invariant NKT cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, B-cells, and dendritic cells. Our studies identified novel cell subsets that express T-bet and Eomes and raise implications for their possible functions in the context of other human immune cell subsets besides their well-known roles in T-cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{design of}} {{effective}} cell replacement therapies requires detailed {{knowledge of how}} embryonic stem cells form primary tissues, such as mesoderm or neurectoderm that later become skeletal muscle or nervous system. Members of the T-box transcription factor family are key {{in the formation of}} these primary tissues, but their underlying molecular activities are poorly understood. Here, we define in vivo genome-wide regulatory inputs of the T-box proteins Brachyury, <b>Eomesodermin,</b> and VegT, which together maintain neuromesodermal stem cells and determine their bipotential fates in frog embryos. These T-box proteins are all recruited to the same genomic recognition sites, from where they activate genes involved in stem cell maintenance and mesoderm formation while repressing neurogenic genes. Consequently, their loss causes embryos to form an oversized neural tube with no mesodermal derivatives. This collaboration between T-box family members thus ensures the continuous formation of correctly proportioned neural and mesodermal tissues in vertebrate embryos during axial elongation...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} underpinning {{integration of}} instructions that program naive CD 8 + T cells for effector and/or memory differentiation {{are not well}} understood. Herein, we demonstrate that interleukin- 12 (IL- 12) enhanced and sustained antigen and costimulatory molecule (B 7. 1) -induced mTOR kinase activity in naive CD 8 + (OT-I) T cells via phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and STAT 4 transcription factor pathways. Blocking mTOR activity by rapamycin reversed IL- 12 -induced effector functions because of loss of persistent expression of the transcription factor T-bet. Rapamycin treatment of IL- 12 -conditioned OT-I cells promoted persistent <b>Eomesodermin</b> expression and produced memory cell precursors that demonstrated enhanced sustenance and antigen-recall responses upon adoptive transfer. The memory cell precursors showed greater tumor efficacy than IL- 12 -conditioned effector OT-I cells. These results identify mTOR as the central regulator of transcriptional programs that determine effector and/or memory cell fates in CD 8 + T cells. Targeting mTOR activity offers new opportunities to regulate CD 8 + T cell-mediated immunity...|$|E
