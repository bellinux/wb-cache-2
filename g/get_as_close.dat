25|$|The attacking team {{uses the}} bomb in attack, but this attack can quickly turn to {{defensive}} if the bomb is fielded {{by the opposition}} team. Therefore, there is a defensive element in deciding whether to kick a bomb. A bomb is useful defensively because {{even if it is}} fielded by the opposition, it is still useful in giving the kicking team ample time to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible to the player with the ball which allows the kicking team to prevent the opposing team from making too much ground towards their in goal area.|$|E

For example, energy systems typically have a trade-off between performance and cost or one might want to adjust a rocket's fuel usage and orientation so that it arrives both at a specified place and at a specified time; or one might want to conduct open market operations so that both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are {{as close as possible to}} their desired values.|$|E

25|$|England resumed on {{the fourth}} day looking to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as {{possible}} to Australia's score in the hope of bowling them out cheaply in the second innings, and set up an easy chase. Lamb moved on from his overnight 103 in much the same fashion as he had done the previous day. Smith joined in and the pair looked quite comfortable throughout the morning. Lamb was batting confidently and the pair took their partnership past 50. A short time later however, Lamb was undone by a brilliant trade-mark bat-pad catch by David Boon off Alderman's bowling. A short time later Derek Pringle, out LBW, became debutant Greg Campbell's first ever Test wicket, and his only victim of the whole tour.|$|E
25|$|Fractional {{ownership}} divides {{a property}} into more affordable segments {{for individuals and}} also matches an individual's ownership time to their actual usage time. A fractional share gives the owners certain privileges, such {{as a number of}} days or weeks when they can use the property. Occasionally, the property is sold after a predetermined time, distributing the relative proceeds back to the owners. A few private owner-groups have developed highly sophisticated usage allocation schemes and other features based on the principle of attempting to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible to the flexibility of individual ownership, and only compromising this to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate multiple owners. In such schemes, the basic agreement is between the members themselves, whereas in most commercial fractional ownership schemes, the owner's principal relationship is with the property developer and/or promoter of the scheme.|$|E

In perfect line of battle, they advanced up the muddy slope until they were cut down at about 125 yards from the stone wall by repeated rifle volleys. Some soldiers were able to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as 40 yards, but having suffered severe casualties from both the artillery and infantry fire, the survivors clung to the ground.

Palmer followed, with casualty rates of almost 50%.|$|E
25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) {{there will always be}} a distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, {{there will always be a}} distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E
25|$|On senior {{night in}} Chapel Hill, UNC had already locked up {{the number one}} seed in the ACC with Louisville's loss to Notre Dame, but Duke still had to win to clinch a double-bye in the ACC Tournament. Joel Berry II, who came off the bench so seniors could start, and Luke Kennard led the way for their {{respective}} teams and would score 28 points each. Berry made each of his five attempted three-pointers {{in the first half}} to supplement Isaiah Hicks's success in the post for UNC, while Duke's Kennard, Grayson Allen, and Jayson Tatum enjoyed success from outside the arc, including a bank shot for Kenanrd and a four-point play for Allen. Neither team lead by more than four points in the first half, which ended with a 48-46 lead for UNC. In the second half, UNC stayed in front or tied until Frank Jackson would give Duke the lead on a free throw with fifteen minutes left in the regulation. In a game that ultimately featured 24 lead changes and 14 ties, Justin Jackson put UNC up 74-71 on a straightaway three-pointer after missing his first six attempts from outside the arc. After Jackson's shot, Duke would <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as down by one but Berry scored seven straight points to keep UNC ahead.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but BjÃ¶rk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around BjÃ¶rk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to her as we could, as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video super-fast editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|After several weeks, Waters {{began to}} visualise another concept. [...] The three new {{compositions}} from 1974's tour {{were at least}} {{a starting point for}} a new album, and [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] seemed a reasonable choice as a centrepiece for the new work. [...] Mostly an instrumental twenty-minute-plus piece similar to [...] "Echoes", the opening four-note guitar phrase reminded Waters of the lingering ghost of former band-member Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour had composed the phrase entirely by accident, but was encouraged by Waters' positive response. [...] Waters wanted to split [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", and sandwich two new songs between its two halves. [...] Gilmour disagreed, but was outvoted three to one. [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] were barely veiled attacks on the music business, their lyrics working neatly with [...] "Shine On" [...] to provide an apt summary of {{the rise and fall of}} Barrett; [...] "Because I wanted to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as possible to what I felt... that sort of indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd." [...] "Raving and Drooling" [...] and [...] "You Gotta Be Crazy" [...] had no place in the new concept, and were set aside until the following album, 1977's Animals.|$|E
500|$|The only {{artillery}} {{support for}} the troops making these tentative advances was from the navy. Finding targets difficult to spot, and in fear of hitting their own troops, the big guns of the battleships and cruisers concentrated fire on the flanks of the beaches. The destroyers {{were able to get}} in closer, and from 08:00 began engaging their own targets. At 09:50, two minutes after the [...] destroyed a 75mm gun position in WN-74, the destroyers were ordered to <b>get</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> in as possible. Some approached within 1,000 yards (900m) several times, scraping bottom and risking running aground. An engineer who had landed in the first wave at Fox Red, watching the Frankford steaming in towards shore, thought she had been badly hit and was being beached. Instead, she turned parallel to the beach and cruised westwards, guns blazing at targets of opportunity. Thinking she would turn back out to sea, the engineer soon saw that she had instead begun backing up, guns still firing. At one point, gunners aboard the Frankford saw an immobilized tank at the water's edge, still firing. Watching the fall of its shot, they followed up with a salvo of their own. In this manner, the tank acted as the ship's fire control party for several minutes.|$|E

Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star.
