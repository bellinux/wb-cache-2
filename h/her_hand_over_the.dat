60|$|She hung <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side, rejoicing in {{the touch}} of the cool soft water.|$|E
6000|$|She seated {{herself at}} the piano and lightly passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> keys. Then, in a clear {{mezzo-soprano}} voice, she sang the first verse {{of one of the}} most popular Irish ballads:-- ...|$|E
60|$|There were a {{few moments}} of indescribable confusion, during which Diana retreated, pale and breathless, to a {{neighboring}} window, and stood with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> locket which she had always worn upon her heart.|$|E
6000|$|FTATATEETA (falling on {{her knees}} and {{stretching}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> waters). Gods of the seas, bear her safely to the shore! ...|$|R
50|$|Grandmothers Predictions (Cleveland Grandma) - William Gent Mfg, c. 1929 - The wise old {{grandmother}} passes <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fortune telling {{cards and}} {{stops at the}} proper fortune. The card falls into the tray below.|$|R
60|$|The girl lifted herself about noiselessly {{and locked}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bed-post. Then {{she laid her}} face down on them, biting at them silently until the marks of her teeth showed white against their red roughness.|$|R
60|$|Florida {{fell back}} in her chair with an aspect of such relief as comes to one from {{confirmation}} on an important point. She passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sewing in her lap, but did not speak.|$|E
60|$|And as she {{smoothed}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> silk collar {{she thought}} of her eldest son. But this son was living enough inside the clothes. She passed her hand down his back to feel him. He was alive and hers. The other was dead.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer. She had a novel, {{with her}} finger between its leaves, pressed against her heart, after the manner of ladies coming out on hotel piazzas. She sat down and rested it on her knee, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top.|$|E
60|$|At Lady Portlebury's lawn the steam-launch halted, and Harold {{managed to}} get Isabel alone among the walks, while his aunt escorted {{the main body of}} {{visitors}} thus thrust upon <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> conservatories. Eager and hasty, now, he lost no time in making the best of the situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're simply wonderful, Barker! I don't see how {{you manage}} to make a room so cosy!" [...] Jill {{sat down on the}} club fender that guarded the fireplace, and held <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> blaze. [...] "I can't {{understand}} why men ever marry. Fancy having to give up all this!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{dressmaker}} passed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> caressingly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> girl's splendid bust and side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It!' {{replied the}} woman, laying <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other's mouth. 'The {{only thing she}} had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!' ...|$|E
6000|$|But Mary gently put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> votes, {{and told}} them that that was not the way to count votes. [...] "You must all go and sit down again," [...] she said, [...] "and appoint some one to count them; and then he or she must come alone, and look them over and tell you who is chosen." ...|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Cyrilla put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lady's kid glove. [...] "So did mine," [...] she said. Then the {{two women}} smiled tenderly at each other. Afterwards they rested from their labours and all had what Aunt Cyrilla called a [...] "snack" [...] of {{sandwiches}} and pound cake. The khaki boy said he hadn't tasted anything half so good since he left home.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{answered}} {{the young lady}} of the house, and sitting down at the organ she ran <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> keys and started the song. She could sing and play well, and all joined in the chorus. The music was kept up for over an hour, and then the Rover boys retired, highly pleased over their reception.|$|R
60|$|Whereupon Nigel {{offered to}} lend <b>her</b> a <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> rougher places, but this she also declined.|$|R
60|$|Antonia {{listened with}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> balustrade, opening and {{shutting}} the fan gently; and Decoud {{talked a little}} nervously, as if afraid that she would leave him at the first pause. Their comparative isolation, the precious sense of intimacy, the slight contact of their arms, affected him softly; for {{now and then a}} tender inflection crept into the flow of his ironic murmurs.|$|R
60|$|The doctor, without answering, {{looked at}} her gravely. Knowing {{she would not be}} allowed to keep the child much longer, the woman kissed him again; and she passed her hand down his body till she came to his feet; she held the right foot in her hand and felt the five small toes; and then slowly passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> left one. She gave a sob.|$|E
6000|$|She {{smiled a}} smile of joy, held up her hand, and thanked her brother. Her father {{scarcely}} lifted his head, her mother made a rigid curtsey, and with a grim look of sorrow coming over her features, laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> old Baron's shoulder. [...] "Come away, Herr Vater," [...] she said; [...] "he is going to hear her confession, and make her too holy for the like of us to touch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leo!" [...] said Ayesha, in an absent voice; [...] "why, that is 'lion' in the Latin tongue. The old man hath named happily for once. It is very strange," [...] {{she went}} on, {{speaking}} to herself, [...] "very. So like--but {{it is not}} possible!" [...] With an impatient gesture she passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water once more. It darkened, and the image vanished silently and mysteriously as it had risen, and once more the lamplight, and the lamplight only, shone on the placid surface of that limpid, living mirror.|$|E
60|$|That {{woman had}} taken them, used their light and colour, and then flung them back! She wrapped them {{again in the}} paper, tied the string, and went towards the river. She did not hurry, but walked with her eyes {{steadily}} before her. She crossed the Embankment, and stood leaning on <b>the</b> parapet with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> grey water. <b>Her</b> thumb and fingers unclosed; the white parcel dropped, floated a second, and then disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he's quite different," [...] said Jinny, folding <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top of <b>her</b> glass. [...] "I don't {{suppose you}} know what Ted means when he says a thing like that," [...] she said, looking at Jacob. [...] "But I do. Sometimes I could kill myself. Sometimes he lies in bed all day long--just lies there.... I don't want you right on the table"; she waved <b>her</b> <b>hands.</b> Swollen {{iridescent}} pigeons were waddling round their feet.|$|R
6000|$|... [Perhaps {{the music}} of the lawn-mower is not to JOHN's mood, for he betakes himself to another room. MR. VENABLES pauses in his labours to greet a lady who has {{appeared}} on the lawn, and who is MAGGIE. She is as neat as if she were one of the army of typists [who are quite the nicest kind of women], and carries a little bag. She comes in through the window, and puts <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> COMTESSE's eyes.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} delighted to do so," [...] said I; and if she {{had asked me to}} delay my journey and take luncheon with them that day I think I should have {{accepted}} the invitation. But she did not do that, and she was not a young lady who would stand too long by a public road talking to a young man. She smiled very sweetly and held out <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wall. [...] "Good-bye again," [...] she said. As I took her hand I felt very much inclined to press it warmly, but I refrained. Her grasp was firm and friendly, and I would have liked very much to know {{whether or not it was}} more so than was her custom.|$|E
6000|$|... "My people! speak {{not to me}} of my people," [...] she {{answered}} hastily; [...] "these slaves are no people of mine, they are but dogs to do my bidding till the day of my deliverance comes; and, as for their customs, naught have I to do with them. Also, call me not Queen--I am weary of flattery and titles--call me Ayesha, the name hath a sweet sound in mine ears, it is an echo from the past. As for this Ustane, I know not. I wonder if it be she against whom I was warned, and whom I in turn did warn? Hath she--stay, I will see;" [...] and, bending forward, she passed <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> font of water and gazed intently into it. [...] "See," [...] she said quietly, [...] "is that the woman?" ...|$|E
60|$|And it did. North {{dispatched}} a second letter to Maria {{saying that he}} had already made other arrangements for the baby. Pleased with her easy victory, Miss Bessy became more than usually gracious, and the next day bowed her shapely neck meekly to the yoke of her teacher, and became a docile pupil. James North could not have helped noticing her ready intelligence, even had he been less prejudiced in her favor than he was fast becoming now. If he had found it pleasant before to be admonished by her there was still more delicious flattery in her perfect trust in his omniscient skill as a pilot over this unknown sea. There was a certain enjoyment in guiding <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> writing-book, that I fear he could not have obtained from an intellect less graciously sustained by its physical nature. The weeks flew quickly by on gossamer wings, and when she placed a bunch of larkspurs and poppies in his hand one morning, he remembered for the first that it was spring.|$|E
60|$|She sat motionless, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{tightening}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{edge of the}} table, and he, too, said no more. She {{began to}} tremble violently.|$|R
60|$|On Dotterine's tenth {{birthday}} <b>her</b> nurse <b>handed</b> <b>her</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> cradle, {{and repeated}} to her her mother's dying words; {{but the child}} {{was too young to}} understand the value of such a gift, and at first thought little about it.|$|R
5000|$|By {{creating}} juxtaposition between formally acknowledged or respected [...] "art" [...] {{and the art}} Corita saw in her everyday world - at the supermarket, on a walk, in {{the classroom}} - she lovingly elevated the banal to the holy. “Like a priest, a shaman, a magician, she could pass <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> commonest of the everyday, the superficial, the oh-so-ordinary, {{and make it a}} vehicle of the luminous, the only, and the hope filled,” noted Corita's friend, theologian Harvey Cox.|$|R
60|$|It was now eleven o'clock. When had the Port house {{been open}} so late as that? The {{people in the}} town must be talking about it, {{and there would be}} more talking the next day. Perhaps it might be in the town paper. The morning would be worse than the night. She could not bear it any longer. There was now nothing to be heard in front but that maddening chatter in the parlor, and up the back stairs came the snores of the servant. She got a traveling-bag from a closet and {{proceeded}} to pack it; then she put on her bonnet and shawl and put into her bag all the money she had with her, trembling all the time {{as if she had been}} a thief: robbing her own house. She could not go down the back stairs, because, as has been said, she could have been seen from the parlor; but a carpenter had been mending the railing of a little piazza at the back of the house, and she remembered he had left his ladder. Down this ladder, with her bag in her hand, Miss Port silently moved. She looked into the kitchen; she could not see the servant, but she could hear her snoring on a bench. Clapping <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> girl's mouth, she whispered into her ear, and without a word the frightened creature sat up and followed Miss Port into the yard.|$|E
60|$|Jess did {{not require}} a second invitation, but slipped up to the wall in five seconds. Passing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stone-work she found the air-hole, which she remembered well, for they used to play bo-peep there as children, {{and was about to}} whisper through it, when {{suddenly}} the door at the other end opened, and Frank Muller entered, bearing the lantern in his hand. For a moment he stood on the threshold, opening the slide of the lantern in order to increase the light. His hat was off, and he wore a cape of dark cloth thrown over his shoulders, which seemed to add to his great breadth. Indeed the thought flashed through the mind of Jess as she looked at him through the hole, and saw the light strike upon his face and form, glinting down his golden beard, that he was the most magnificent specimen of humanity whom she had ever seen. In another instant he had turned the lantern round and revealed her dear sister Bessie to her gaze. Bessie lay upon one of the half-empty sacks of mealies, apparently half asleep, for she opened her wide blue eyes and looked round apprehensively like one suddenly awakened. Her golden curls were in disorder and falling over her fair forehead, and her face was very pale and troubled, and marked beneath the eyes with deep blue lines. Catching sight of her visitor she rose hurriedly and retreated as far from him as the pile of sacks and potatoes would allow.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's beautiful," [...] Elma cried enthusiastically, as the {{composer}} {{looked up at}} her with an inquiring glance. [...] "I never heard anything in my life before that went so straight through one, with its penetrating melody. Such a lovely gliding sound, you know! So soft and serpentine!" [...] And even as she said it, a deep flush rose red in the centre of her cheek. She was sorry for the words before they were out of her mouth. They recalled all at once, in some mysterious way, that horrid, persistent nightmare of the hateful snake-dance. In a second, Miss Ewes caught the bright gleam in her eye, and the deep flush on her cheek that so hastily followed it. A meaning smile came over the elder woman's face all at once, not unpleasantly. She was a handsome woman for her age, but very dark and gipsy-like, after the fashion of the Eweses, with keen Italian eyes and a large smooth expanse of powerful forehead. Lightly she ran <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> keys with a masterly touch, and fixed her glance as she did so on Elma. There was a moment's pause. Miss Ewes eyed her closely. She was playing a tune that seemed oddly familiar to Elma's brain somehow--to her brain, not to her ears, for Elma felt certain, even while she recognised it most, she had never before heard it. It was a tune that waxed and waned and curled up and down sinuously, and twisted in and out and--ah yes, now she knew it--raised its sleek head, and darted out its forked tongue, and vibrated with swift tremors, and tightened and slackened, and coiled resistlessly at last in great folds all around her. Elma listened, with eager eyes half starting from her head, with clenched nails dug deep into the tremulous palms, as her heart throbbed fast and her nerves quivered fiercely. Oh, it was wrong of Miss Ewes to tempt her like this! It was wrong, so wrong of her! For Elma knew what it was at once--the song she had heard running vaguely through her head the night of the dance--the night {{she fell in love with}} Cyril Waring.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old woman's voice trembled as {{she spoke}} the last few words, and she spread <b>her</b> skinny <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> small fire that smouldered in {{the centre of the}} floor.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, John," [...] she said, {{stretching}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> away <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fair {{plain of}} the Guadalquivir, {{as soon as}} we stood against the parapet; [...] "is not that lovely?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then Asti {{knelt down}} by the pool, and bent her head, and {{stretched}} out <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water, and Tua touched the strings of her harp and began to chant very solemnly in an unknown tongue. The words of that chant were low and sweet, yet it seemed to Janees that they fell like ice upon his hot blood, and froze it within his veins. At first {{he kept his eyes}} fixed upon her beauty, but by slow degrees something drew them down to the water of the pool.|$|R
