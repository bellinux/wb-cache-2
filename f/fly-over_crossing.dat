5000|$|The single {{carriageway}} by-pass {{was eventually}} {{replaced by a}} dual carriageway, opened by Neil Blaney on 25 June 1963, {{the first section of}} the Dublin-Naas road to be increased to four lanes. The local service station in Beaufort, owned by the Goosen family, became famous for its [...] "open 24Â½ hours daily" [...] sign. This road was poorly designed with broadside crossings of insufficient length to accommodate even a small motor car. Kill's new dual carriageway claimed 18 lives in its first three years of operation to 1966 and a total of 57 lives in all. Even after traffic lights were eventually installed at the Kill junction in November 1980 eleven more lives were lost before a proper graded <b>fly-over</b> <b>crossing</b> was completed on 14 August 2006.|$|E
