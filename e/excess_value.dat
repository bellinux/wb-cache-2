40|$|Peaks over Thresholds' ('POT') models {{commonly}} used e. g. in hydrology, assume that peak values of an i. i. d. or stationary sequence Xi above {{a high value}} u, occur at Poisson points, and the <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> of the peak above u are independent with an arbitrary common d. f. G. Motivation for these models has been provided by Smith (1985, 1987), by using Pareto-type approximations of Pickands (1975) for distributions of such <b>excess</b> <b>values.</b> These works strongly suggest that the Pareto family provides the appropriate class of distributions G for the POT model. In the present paper we consider the point process of <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> of peaks above a high level u and demonstrate that this converges in distribution to a Compound Poisson Process as u [...] >[infinity] under appropriate assumptions. It is shown that the multiplicity distribution of this limit (i. e. the limiting distribution of <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> of peaks) must belong to the Pareto family and detailed forms are given for the normalizing constants involved. This exhibits the POT model specifically as a limit for the point process of excesses of peaks and delineates the distributions involved. ...|$|R
40|$|The isotopic {{composition}} of the rainfall in northwestern Sicily (Italy, central Mediterranean) was investigated in the period February 2002 to March 2003. A rain gauge network was installed and sampled monthly. The monthly values of the D and 18 O ratios showed a wide range that reflected seasonal climatic variations. Mean weighted values were used to define an isotopic model of precipitation. Temporal variations in deuterium excess were also investigated. Using mean volume weighted values, the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) can be represented by the equation: dD = 4. 7 d 18 O 8. 2 (r 2 = 0. 96). Deuterium excess (d = dD 8 d 18 O) {{was found to be}} strongly related to orography. The coastline samples were characterized by mean weighted deuterium <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> close to 12. 5 %; samples from inland areas showed values of 16 %, while samples taken from the main reliefs showed values close to 19 %. In inland areas, isotopic exchange between raindrops and moisture could shift the deuterium <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> slightly. On the higher reliefs, the interaction between falling raindrops and orographic clouds could shift the deuterium <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> significantly. The low slope of the LMWL could be referred to the high deuterium <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> of the higher sites and is related to orographic precipitation rather than to evaporation processes during the fall of the raindrops.

The experimental observed values are used to evaluate thermo dynamical parameters such as adiabatic compressibility (βα), molecular free length (Lf), acoustic impedance (Z), free volume (Vf), internal pressure (π i) and their <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> as adiabatic compressibility (βαE), free length (LfE), free volume (VfE), internal pressure (π iE), and Gibb’s free energy of activation (∆GE). From the properties of these excess parameters the nature and strength of the interactions in the binary system have been discussed for molecular interaction. The non linearity nature observed in the plots of these ultrasonic parameters and their <b>excess</b> <b>values</b> with the composition range indicates presence of the intermolecular interaction between the components of the unlike molecules of the mixture.

This study was aimed to compare blood base <b>excess</b> <b>value</b> and blood lactate levels among patient with and without organ dysfunction. Materials and Methods: Twenty eight subjects aged 15 - 64 years who have undergone trepanation procedure due to severe traumatic brain injury involved in this study. Base <b>excess</b> <b>value</b> and blood lactate levels were measured shortly and 12, 24, 48 h after arrived in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The presence of organ dysfunction was measure by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score system. The difference of base <b>excess</b> <b>value</b> and blood lactate levels between patient with and without organ dysfunction was compared with Mann Whitney tests and the association between base excess with SOFA scores was calculated by chi-squire test. Results: The blood lactate value in patient with organ dysfunction was significantly higher after 24 and 48 h compared with patient without organ dysfunction (p = 0. 008 and p = 0. 035, respectively). The difference of base <b>excess</b> <b>value</b> can only be seen after 48 h (p = 0. 048). A positive association was found between abnormal base excess and organ dysfunction (p = 0. 04).

A CONSIDERABLE FRACTION OF U. S. CORPORATIONS diversify their operations, either across multiple lines of business ~industrial diversification!, across different national markets ~global diversification!, or both. Over the past decade, an extensive academic literature has developed documenting the causes and consequences of industrial diversification. Studies in this literature report that, on average, diversified firms are valued at a discount relative to a portfolio of comparable, single-segment firms. This value discount appears to stem, in part, from inefficient investment policies. In addition, the evidence indicates a trend towards less industrial diversification since the mid- 1980 s, as well as a gain in shareholder value associated with refocusing strategies. 1 Because industrial diversification potentially benefits corporate managers through increased power and prestige, through compensation arrange...|$|E
