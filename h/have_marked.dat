5|$|The power {{stations}} {{were among the}} last remaining heavy industrial buildings in modern Tyneside, and their demolition was felt by many Tynesiders to <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> the end of industrial Tyneside. The National Trust was then uninterested in the preservation of modern structures such as this.|$|E
5|$|Altar Q and Altar R are {{two small}} {{rhyolite}} disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt, the buried Structure 1B-sub.4.

5|$|Wagner's early {{correspondence}} with Meyerbeer, up to 1846, is cringingly obsequious. However, {{from the early}} 1840s, as Wagner developed Tannhäuser and Lohengrin, his ideas on opera increasingly diverged from Meyerbeerean standards; even in 1843 Wagner had written to Schumann condemning Meyerbeer's work as 'a striving after superficial popularity'. During 1846 Meyerbeer turned down Wagner's {{application for a loan}} of 1,200 thalers, and this may <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> a turning point.|$|E
5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had been marked by unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> him as a more acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E

5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, {{that light}} tanks were a {{liability}} and too vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete. This decision may <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat.|$|E
5|$|The family then {{initiated}} {{a long journey}} in exile that would take them first to Mexico, then to Canada, where they went to pick up Arabella (the Árbenzs' oldest daughter), and then to Switzerland via the Netherlands and Paris. They hoped to obtain citizenship in Switzerland based on Árbenz's Swiss heritage. However, the former president {{did not wish to}} renounce his Guatemalan nationality, as he felt that such gesture would <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> the end of his political career. Árbenz and his family were the victims of a CIA-orchestrated and intense defamation campaign that lasted from 1954 to 1960. A close friend of Árbenz, Carlos Manuel Pellecer, {{turned out to be a}} spy working for the CIA.|$|E
5|$|According to the Arab chroniclers, the {{realization}} of Egypt's vulnerability from the sea led, after {{a long period of}} neglect, to the urgent strengthening of Egypt's maritime defences by Governor Anbasah. Within nine months of the raid, Damietta was refortified along with Tinnis and Alexandria. Various works were undertaken at Rosetta, Borollos, Ashmun, at-Tina, and Nastarawwa. Ships were constructed and new crews were raised. Most seamen were forcibly conscripted from among the Copts and the Arabs of the interior, earning Anbasah a bad reputation in contemporary sources. Complaints against him were directed to Caliph al-Mutawakkil. Later Arabic sources like al-Maqrizi and Coptic sources confirm that the new fleet was used in raids against the Byzantines in subsequent years, although no details are recorded. This activity is generally held to <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> the rebirth of the Egyptian navy. Under the Tulunid dynasty (868–905) it numbered 100 ships and reached its peak later under the Fatimids (969–1171).|$|E

5|$|If the Bruins were swept, {{it would}} <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> {{the first time}} an overall top-seed was swept from the opening {{round of the playoffs}} since the Cleveland Barons ousted the Buffalo Bisons in 1954. But the Bruins fought off {{elimination}} with a 5–1 victory in game three on May 4, where Bourque scored two goals and one assists against his former team. Despite scoring the first goal for the third straight game, Hershey failed to score on any of its six power plays, including a five-on-three that lasted a full two minutes. Providence also won a dramatic fourth game on May 5. Trailing 4–3 in the third period, the Bruins stunned Hershey by scoring two goals in the final four minutes, including Carter Camper completing a hat trick with his game-winner with 64 seconds left in the game. Hershey were eliminated from the playoffs after losing the fifth and final game by 3–2. Crabb tied the game 2–2 in the third with his fifth goal of the series, but Bruins forward Jamie Tardif broke the tie at 9:20 of the period. The Bears finished the period with a six-on-four advantage but could not score.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players <b>have</b> <b>marked.</b> The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster.|$|E
5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to {{have been a number of}} small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this time. Here a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E

5|$|The old {{heritage}} monuments, {{which are}} palaces and temples {{are located in}} the old town (east of the Chaugans), on the lower slopes of Shah Madar hill. They were built in the lower valley where the two rivers and steep thickly forested hillsides provided a strong defense. Located here is the 10th century Champavati Temple, said to <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> the birth of the town, the Lakshmi Narayan group of temples (built from 10th-19th century), the 10th century Sita Ram Temple, Bansi Gopal temple, Kharura Mohalla and Hari Rai temple, the 11th century Sui Mata Temple and Chamunda Devi Temple, and the Akhand Chandi palace, overlooking the Chaugan, which has since been converted into a college. Additions were made to the palace {{in the form of the}} Zenana Mahal and the Rang Mahal in the 18th century. The temples built in Chamba demonstrate a strong Kashmiri influence with their stone temple architecture and temple iconography. Given their age however, only their unicellular layout with fluted pillars has been retained.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would <b>have</b> <b>marked</b> a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E
