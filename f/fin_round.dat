40|$|In {{louvered}} fin heat exchangers, {{the flow}} deflection influences the {{heat transfer rate}} and pressure drop and thus the heat exchanger's performance. To date, studies of the flow deflection are two-dimensional, which is an acceptable approximation for flat tube heat exchangers (typical for automotive applications). However, in louvered fin heat exchangers with round tubes, which are commonly used in air-conditioning devices and heat pumps, the flow is three-dimensional throughout the whole heat exchanger. In this study, three-dimensional numerical simulations were performed to investigate the flow deflection and horseshoe vortex development in a louvered <b>fin</b> <b>round</b> tube heat exchanger with three tube rows in a staggered layout. The numerical simulations were validated against the experimental data. It {{was found that the}} flow deflection is affected by the tubes in the same tube row (intratube row effect) and by the tubes in the upstream tube rows (inter-tube row effect). Flow efficiency values obtained with two-dimensional studies are representative only for the flow behavior in the first tube row of a staggered louvered fin heat exchanger with round tubes. The flow behavior in the louvered elements of the subsequent tube rows differs strongly due to its three-dimensional nature. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} flow deflection affects the local pressure distributions upstream of the tubes of the downstream tube rows and thus the horseshoe vortex development at these locations. The results of this study are important because the flow behavior is related to the thermal hydraulic performance of the heat exchanger...|$|E
40|$|A {{dark spot}} on the dorsal fin is common. Round Goby – The {{distinctive}} feature of the round goby is its fused pelvic (bottom) fins. This fish can grow up to 10 inches in length, although 3 - to 6 -inch fish are more common. The smaller tubenose goby has two, rather distinct, tube-like projections from its head. Map courtesy of U. S. Geological Survey. The round goby is a small, but aggressive bottom-dwelling fish that grows rapidly, and reproduces several times in one spawning season. It is a huge threat to North American aquatic ecosystems because it is adaptable {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions, and will eat just about anything alive that will fit in its mouth. Species Description Round gobies have a soft body and a large round head with thick lips and distinctive frog-like raised eyes. They can reach up to 10 inches in length as adults, but are usually less than seven inches in the Great Lakes. Females and immature males are a solid slate gray mottled with black and brown spots. Spawning males turn almost solid black. Two distinguishing characteristics of round gobies are a single, scallop-shaped pelvic fin and a distinctive black spot located on the dorsal <b>fin.</b> <b>Round</b> gobies closely resemble the native mottled sculpin, but the two species can be easily separated by looking at the pelvic fins. The sculpin has two separated pelvic fins compared to the single, fused pelvic fin found on the round goby. The sculpin also lacks the large black spot found on the dorsal fin of the round goby. Native & Introduced Ranges Round gobies are native to Eurasia in the Black, Caspian, and Azov seas, and tributaries. They were first discovered in the St. Clair River in 1990, presumably released during ballast water exchanges of transoceanic ships. They have since spread to all of the Great Lakes, and are now working their way inland through rivers and canal systems. In Pennsylvania, the round goby is abundant in Lake Erie and its lower tributaries. The first inland occurrence for Pennsylvani...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extensive {{experimental study of}} the effective mobility in the long-channel undoped triple-gate FinFETs. The mobility behavior in FinFETs is studied as compared with that in quasi-planar very wide fin FETs made on the same wafers and {{as a function of}} the fin width. Devices with two types of the gate dielectrics are investigated. New insights about the carrier transport in triple-gate FinFETs are obtained using a careful analysis of the results for various fin widths. In particular, it is shown that the model treating the triple-gate FinFET in terms of the (100) top and (110) lateral channels is not perfectly accurate for describing the transport properties in real FinFETs with relatively narrow fins; at low and moderate inversion charge densities, this is due to different inversion carrier distributions (and, thus, nonidentical scattering rates for various fin widths), and at high charge densities, it is presumably due to <b>fin</b> <b>rounding</b> which results in ambiguous crystallographic orientation, different from the postulated (100) and (110) ...|$|R
