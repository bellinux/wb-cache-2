40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented of the postbuckling {{behavior of a}} simply supported square flat plate with straight edges compressed beyond the buckling load into the plastic range. The method of analysis involves {{the application of a}} variational principle of the deformation theory of plasticity in conjunction with computations carried out on a high-speed calculating machine. Numerical results are obtained for several plate proportions and for one material. The results <b>indicate</b> <b>plate</b> strengths greater than those that have been found experimentally on plates that do not satisfy straight-edge conditions. (author) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of geologic realism into numerical models of subduction {{is becoming increasingly}} necessary as obser-vational and experimental constraints <b>indicate</b> <b>plate</b> bound-aries are inherently three-dimensional (3 D) in nature and contain large viscosity variations. However, large viscosity variations occurring over short distances pose a challenge for computational codes, and models with complex 3 D ge-ometries require substantially greater numbers of elements, increasing the computational demands. We modified a com-munity mantle convection code, CitcomCU, to model realis-tic subduction zones that use an arbitrarily shaped 3 D plate boundary interface and incorporate {{the effects of a}} strain-rate dependent viscosity based on an experimentally derived flow law for olivine aggregates.
