The range has a karstic lithological appearance, i.e. parts of the calcareous (calcium carbonate, limestone) rock outcrops have been dissolved away in water. Left behind are limestone pavements - areas where the limestone has formed etched, pitted or fluted rock pinnacles and ridges between which are deep grooves, sinkholes or <b>dolinas,</b> caves, underground rivers, and gullies.

40|$|One of {{the current}} {{objectives}} of karst research is to understand the spatial dynamics of karstic processes that increase ordecrease pore volume. Although we can construct 3 D numerical models, it is a complex, multi-step process. These modellingapproaches combine a dissolution algorithm, a flow and/or transport model and an algorithm to reconstruct thespatial geometry of fracture networks. The paper focuses on the last task, and does not consider the first two problems. We applied the RepSim code, a DFN (discrete fracture network) type fracture geometry modelling software that usesfractal behavior of fracture patterns, for simulations. This method simulates fracture systems at a reservoir scale. The input parameters (length distribution, aperture, orientation and fractal dimension of the fracture midpoints) weredetermined using field measurements and evaluation of digitized images. The primary images were of outcrops fromthe surface and from two caves. The examined area is the karstic block of the Mecsek Mountains in SW Hungary, {{which is one of}} the most exploredkarstic regions in that country. There are seven small and one relatively large (Vízfő) catchment areas in the mountains. The large catchment was used as the study area, which lithologically consists of sandstones and limestones,both intensely fractured by subsequent tectonic events. The spatial distribution of cave entrances and <b>dolinas</b> is unevenacross the study area. This phenomenon has not yet been investigated. Here, a relationship is inferred between the original (prekarstic) microfracture network geometry and the spatial distributionof the aforementioned karst forms. The results show that the region can be divided into two zones that fracturedin distinctly different ways. Their fracture network communication features, porosity and permeability differ. Additionally, sub-regions could develop inside the catchment area where dissolution-cementation processes couldhave been differently effective, determining the spatial distribution of the dissolution governed karstic forms (e. g. caves, <b>dolinas).</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Neste trabalho foram aplicadas técnicas de análise morfoestrutural, hidrogeológica e hidroquímica com objetivo de definir as características e as potencialidades de um aqüífero cárstico localizado na região norte do Estado de Minas Gerais. Essas técnicas permitiram o estudo da distribuição espacial e dafreqüência das feições morfoestruturais (fraturas e <b>dolinas),</b> a orientação das fraturas e o comportamento {{regional}} dos parâmetros dimensionais, hidrodinâmicos e hidroquímicos do aqüífero. A distribuição espacial das feições morfoestruturais evidenciou zonas com diferentes características do ponto de vista tectônico e de carstificação. Além disso, há evidências de que as principais drenagens daárea são controladas por fraturamentos. Estatisticamente as fraturas que mais ocorrem na área são as longitudinais com azimutes de 30 a 40 graus e as angulares com azimutes de 110 a 120 graus. As fraturas associadas às <b>dolinas</b> mais freqüentes são as angulares orientadas entre 10 a 20 ou 110 a 120 graus e as transversais com azimutes entre 140 e 150 graus. As fraturas longitudinais propiciam a instalação de um carste mais raso enquanto a carstificação ao longo das fraturas angulares e tranversais atingiu maiores profundidades. Verificou-se também, que os níveis de carstificação não estão relacionados, de uma maneira geral, com o comprimento das fraturas ou ao tamanho das <b>dolinas.</b> A espessura saturada média é de 55 m, a máxima superior a 100 m e a mínima de 30 m. Os recursos exploráveis estimados são de 32. 1 0 ́ POT. 6 m POT. 3 /́ano. Estes recursos são acessíveis em vista da pouca profundidade do aqüífero e são favoráveis a explotação através de poços. As águas subterrâneas da área, de modo geral, não apresentam restrições ao uso agrícola, humano e a alguns tipos de indústrias. As principais restrições ao uso são relativos à dureza e alcalinidade. Foram verificados também, alguns focos de poluição na área em questão) refletindo a grande vulnerabilidade do aqüífero. Este fato sugere que é importante que sejam observados, na região, os aspectos relacionados a conservação e preservação dos recursos hídricos subterrâneos. Morphostructural, hydrogeological and hydrochemical {{techniques were}} applied {{in this study}} to characterize the groundwater system of the Jaíba Karst aquifer and its potencial for exploration and utilization as water supply to {{northern part of the}} state of Minas Gerais. These techniques allowed as the study of the spacial distribution and frequency of some morphological features, such as fractures and sinkholes as well as the regional behavior of dimens ional and hydrodynamic parameters of the aquifer. From {{the point of view of}} tectonics and karstification, the spacial distribution of the morphological features exhibit zones with different characteristics. It was also seem that the level of karstification is generally independent of the length of the fractures and of the size of the sinkholes. Is addition, there is evidence that the drainage of the principal streams is controlled by geological fracturing. Statiscally, the most frequently occurring fractures are longitudinal with azimuths from 30 up to 40 degrees and angular fractures with azimuths from 110 up to 120 degrees. The fractures frequently associeted with sinkholes are angular (10 up to 20 and 110 up to 120 degrees) and transversal, with azimuths between 140 and 150 degrees. The longitudinal fractures allowed a more shallow karst development while the karstification along the angular and transversal fractures was deeper. The average saturated thickness is 55 m with a maximum around 100 m and a minimum of 30 m. The estimated sustainable groundwater yield is about 3 ́ 2. 10 POT. 6 m POT. 3 /́year. These groundwater resources are highly accessible by wells because of the shallow depth of the water table. The good groundwater quality in this region, in general, allow it be indicated for many types of agricultural, industrial and potable usages. The principle restriction on its usages is related to its hardness and alkalinity. In some parts of the aquifer were also found vestiges of pollution, so indicating its vulnerability to groundwater contamination. This fact suggests the importance of the statement of a groundwater protection program to insure the quality of this valuable resource...|$|R

Multichannel seismic lines show that the sedimentary succession locally reaches a maximum thickness of 15 - 20 m above an unconformity interpreted as the emersion surface which developed during the last glacial sea-level lowstand. Such depocenters are located in current-protected areas flanking the reef rim of the atoll or in infillings of karst <b>dolinas.</b> Much of the 50 m deep sea floor in the lagoon interior is current swept, and has no or very minor sediment cover. Erosive current moats line drowned patch reefs, whereas other areas are characterized by nondeposition.
