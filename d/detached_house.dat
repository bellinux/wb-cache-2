40|$|Newly {{produced}} {{air source}} heat pumps can provide heat energy from outdoor air at temperature {{as low as}} - 20 °C. As a result they could be utilized during most {{days of the year}} even in the cold Nordic climates. The drawback of air source heat pumps is the reduction in efficiency as the outdoor air become colder, resulting in lower heat supply in times when it is most needed. Despite its inverse relationship between efficiency and outdoor temperature, air source heat pumps were installed in 57000 <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> in Sweden during 2010 alone, which is 3 % of the total <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> stock. That makes air source heat pumps the most sold heating technology for <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> in Sweden during 2010, 1. 6 times more than the number of installations of ground source heat pump and 3 times more than the number of connections of <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> to district heating during the same year. Similar trends can be found in other Nordic countries. This study compares the use of an air source heat pump with other existing commercial technologies in <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> and analyzes the impacts on primary energy use, on final energy use, on electricity production and on costs benefits for house owners. It was found that converting existing electric heated Swedish <b>detaches</b> <b>houses</b> to district heating with biomass based CHP or bed-rock heat pump could reduce the use of resources, which could benefit Sweden as a society. Converting electric heated Swedish <b>detaches</b> <b>houses</b> to district heating or pellets stove could reduce power demand and level out the power demand load curve. That would benefit utilities of power supply as it could secure power supply. However cost effectiveness in one of most important drivers for <b>house</b> owners of <b>detached</b> <b>houses</b> to choose energy efficiency measures. For that reason house owners may most likely benefit by the installation of air-source heat pumps...|$|R

Although few records exist concerning the moon gate's construction and usage, it is known to have made its appearance in the house in the 1960s and to have been designed and built by William Swaffield, a pre-World War II Comptroller of Government House and a professional furniture designer. It is constructed of chengal, teak and meranti wood. In the middle of the driveway in front of the house, there is a brick pit that was originally used by horse-drawn carriages.
