25|$|Under ISO 3632, {{determination}} of non-stigma content ("floral waste content") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material ("ash") are also key. <b>Grading</b> <b>standards</b> are {{set by the}} International Organization for Standardization, a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric absorbance. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20–50 for all categories.|$|E
30|$|All {{results were}} {{interpreted}} using both a strict <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> and a lenient <b>grading</b> <b>standard.</b> The strict <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> was fully automated and required subjects to type the exact name of each item, as {{decided by the}} experimenter prior to the experiment. The lenient <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> was partially automated. Words that were deemed incorrect by the strict standard were interpreted by an experimenter blind to condition, who allowed for minor misspellings, confusion of plural and singular, {{and the use of}} synonyms. Any corrections were automatically applied to other errors, ensuring reliability across subjects. The results were similar for both grading schemes, so only the more objective, strict <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> is reported. All statistical tests yielded the same conclusions in both grading schemes unless stated otherwise.|$|R
30|$|The {{existing}} KEC method assigned {{points to}} each attribute {{according to a}} <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> set based on a few case studies of debris-flow occurrences. But {{it did not take}} the nonoccurrence cases into consideration (Kim 2012). In addition, the KEC <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> set used all data samples collected for the study. In order to appropriately represent the differences between debris-flow occurrences and nonoccurrences, modifications can be made to the <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> using additional tests. The three applications in this study included a large number of debris-flow occurrence sites and can be used for this purpose.|$|R

25|$|The most {{successful}} mixed cut is the Princess cut, first introduced in 1960 by A. Nagy of London. It was originally intended for flat rough (macles), but {{has since become}} popular enough that some gemological labs, {{such as that of}} the American Gem Society (AGS), have developed Princess cut <b>grading</b> <b>standards</b> with stringency akin to standards applied to round brilliants. Its higher fire and brilliance compared to other mixed cuts is one reason for the Princess cut's popularity, but more importantly is the fact that, of all the diamond cuts, it wastes the least of the original crystal. Another beautiful cut is the Flanders cut, a modified square with cut corners, brilliant facets and is currently being cut by cutters at Russian Star.|$|E
500|$|The United States used (some {{states still}} do, as they await state regulation) {{different}} <b>grading</b> <b>standards.</b> Maple syrup {{was divided into}} two major grades: Grade A and Grade B. Grade A was further divided into three subgrades: Light Amber (sometimes known as Fancy), Medium Amber, and Dark Amber. In Massachusetts, the Grade B was renamed as Grade A Very Dark, Strong Taste. The Vermont Agency of Agriculture Food and Markets used a similar grading system of colour, and is roughly equivalent, especially for lighter syrups, but using letters: [...] "AA", [...] "A", etc. The Vermont grading system differed from the US system in maintaining a slightly higher standard of product density (measured on the Baumé scale). New Hampshire maintained a similar standard, but not a separate state grading scale. The Vermont-graded product had 0.9 percent more sugar and less water in its composition than US-graded. One grade of syrup not for table use, called commercial or Grade C, was also produced under the Vermont system.|$|E

Shepherd believed that if the government was to remain in Washington, the city's infrastructure and facilities must be modernized and revitalized. [...] He filled in the long-dormant Washington Canal and placed [...] of paved roads and sidewalks, [...] of sewers, [...] of gas mains, and [...] of water mains. [...] In 1872, Boss Shepherd was responsible for the demolition of the Northern Liberties Market. Two individuals, a butcher who was still on the premises at the time of the demolition and a young boy who had come with his dog to chase the rats who fled the structure, were killed in the process. Under his direction the city also planted 60,000 trees, built the city's first public transportation system in the form of horse-drawn streetcars, installed street lights, and had the railroad companies refit their tracks to fit new citywide <b>grading</b> <b>standards</b> for the District.|$|E

2500|$|Wood from beetle-affected trees {{retains its}} {{commercial}} usefulness for 8 to 12 {{years after the}} tree has died, but its value drops rapidly, for within several months, the escaping moisture blows large checks and cracks from the outer perimeter of the wood deep {{into the heart of}} the tree. The remaining moisture escapes more slowly, causing small cracks throughout the timber. [...] This causes difficulties for modern high-output automated sawmill operations and greatly increases the lumber losses and the labor to produce high quality wood products. [...] This so-called ‘shelf life’ is dependent on a number of factors, including economic and stand site conditions. The trees remain commercially viable longer under drier conditions. In areas where it is wetter, the trees tend to rot at the base and fall faster, especially if they are larger. The fungus that is carried by the beetles and kills the trees causes blue staining of the sapwood at the perimeter of the tree, but it does not affect the wood’s strength, nor are there any harmful human health effects. [...] Blue stain is, however, considered to be a defect in the lumber <b>grading</b> <b>standards</b> and thus is considered a 'down-grade' resulting in a lower commodity market price. [...] All these factors have severely limited the production of blue-stain wood products.|$|E

30|$|Although the <b>grading</b> <b>standard</b> of the {{original}} KEC method was established based on 30 field applications (KEC 2009), the scale of damage by debris flow during the considered period was very small (Kim 2014).
