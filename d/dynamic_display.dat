40|$|Observers’ {{perceptions}} of the three-dimensional structure of smoothly curved surfaces defined by patterns of image shading were investigated under varying conditions of illumination. In five experiments, observers judged the global orientation and {{the motion of the}} simulated surfaces from both static and dynamic patterns of image shading. We found that perceptual performance was more accurate with static than with <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> evoked systematic biases in perceptual performance when the surface and the illumination source were simulated as rotating in opposite directions. In these conditions, the surface was incorrectly perceived as rotating {{in the same direction as}} the illumination source. Conversely, the orientation of the simulated surfaces was perceived correctly when the frames making up the apparent-motion sequences of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> were presented as static images. In Experiment 6, moreover, the results obtained with the computer-generated displays were replicated with solid objects...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{research}} agenda for empirically assessing {{the effectiveness of}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> with the eye-movement data collection method. The proposed framework {{is based on the}} relationship between perceptual salience and thematic relevance in static (e. g., visual variables: color hue, color value and orientation) and animated <b>displays</b> (e. g., <b>dynamic</b> variables including transitions). The proposed empirical studies adhere to experimental design standards in cognitive psychology, but are additionally grounded on a solid dynamic design framework borrowed from cartography, computer graphics and cinematography, to investigate how different dynamic and visual variables, and various levels of interactivity affect peoples knowledge construction processes from <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> as compared to static displays...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{employed}} a computer-controlled command-and-control (C 2) simulation and recorded eye movements {{to examine the}} extent {{and nature of the}} inability to detect critical changes in <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> when change detection is implicit (i. e., requires no explicit report) to the operator’s task. Background: Change blindness—the failure to notice significant changes to a visual scene—may have dire consequences on performance in C 2 and surveillance operations. Method: Participants performed a radar-based risk-assessment task involving multiple subtasks. Although participants were not required to explicitly report critical changes to the operational display, change detection was critical in informing decision making. Participants’ eye movements were used as an index of visual attention across the display. Results: Nonfixated (i. e., unattended) changes {{were more likely to be}} missed than were fixated (i. e., attended) changes, supporting the idea that focused attention is necessary for conscious change detection. The finding of significant pupil dilation for changes undetected but fixated suggests that attended changes can nonetheless be missed because of a failure of attentional processes. Conclusion: Change blindness in complex <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> takes the form of failures in establishing task-appropriate patterns of attentional allocation. Application: These findings have implications in the design of change-detection support tools for <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> and work procedure in C 2 and surveillance...|$|R

Participants watched point-light displays of 200 – 1, 000 -ms duration, as well as static displays, of expressive and inexpressive dance performances. The task was to identify the intended expression intensity of the performer. The results indicate that expression intensity could be discerned reliably only from <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays,</b> {{even when they were}} as short as 200 ms, though the accuracy of judgments increased with exposure duration. Judgment accuracy for <b>dynamic</b> <b>displays</b> was positively correlated with self-report empathy indices and confidence in judgments.
