For the {{extremely}} weak echo signal {{and the poor}} anti-interference ability of the long-distance laser fuze, the high signal noise ratio (SNR) receiving system based on laser coding mode was designed. In order to improve the weak signal receiving ability, the avalanche photodiode (APD) with high sensitivity, low noise and high gain was adopted. And the optimum multiplication factor of APD when the system obtains the highest SNR was analyzed and calculated. Then, the amplifying circuit optimum matching with APD and the decoding circuit were designed, and validated by the experiments. The theory and experiment {{results indicate that the}} design is efficiency and capable to the long distance laser fuze, the system can exactly decode the weak laser coding signals received and export the <b>ignition</b> <b>signal...</b>|$|E

The free-piston engine {{generator}} (FPEG) {{is a novel}} type of energy conversion device; it integrates a two stroke combustion engine and a linear electric machine into a single unit. As an alternative to conventional engines, the FPEG is a promising power generation system due to its simplicity and high thermal efficiency and has attracted considerable research interests recently. This paper presents the development for a spark-ignited free-piston {{engine generator}} prototype, and the design of major sub-systems is introduced. The electrical linear machine is operated as a motor to start the engine and switched to a generator after successful ignition. Ignition {{is one of the}} most crucial problems for the generating process, thus a unique control sub-system to generate <b>ignition</b> <b>signals</b> at the correct ignition timing based on the piston position was completed. Then experiments of the starting process were carried out with the prototype. The results indicate that with a fixed motor force of 110 N, the maximum in-cylinder gas pressure can reach 12 bar and the compression ratio can reach 8 : 1. Moreover, the experiment results show a good agreement with the simulation prediction. According to the performance of the starting process, the development of the prototype is acceptable and further research on the generating process will be undertaken soon...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca 2 + releases (Ca 2 + clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger current (INCX). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited cardiac pacemaker cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca 2 + cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca 2 + releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) -based Ca 2 + clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD INCX over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e. g., L-type Ca 2 + current (ICaL) and/or hyperpolarization-activated (“funny”) current (If) conductances]. The system Ca 2 + clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca 2 + fluxes, which optimize cell Ca 2 + balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca 2 + release and late DD INCX as SR Ca 2 + pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1. 8 – 4. 6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca 2 + clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca 2 + clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD INCX <b>ignition</b> <b>signals</b> membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca 2 + clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca 2 + and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates...|$|R

An understanding of the ignition transient of a solid propellant rocket motor becomes increasingly more important as larger and more sophisticated solid propellant rocket motors are developed. Cost considerations alone require the minimal use of empirical methods in rocket development. Consideration of structural strength limitations, possible critical trajectory guidance and vehicle attitude control requirements, and the problem of ignition shock to sensitive instrumentation require that the ignition transient response be known and used as a basis for design. The ignition transient includes the entire time from initiation of the <b>ignition</b> <b>signal</b> to the attainment of design operating conditions within the rocket motor. The ignition transient can be separated into three intervals: the ignition lag interval - the delay between the initial <b>ignition</b> <b>signal</b> and the igniting of the first propellant element; the flame spreading interval - the time required for the propellant surface to become wholly ignited following first ignition; and the chamber filling interval - the time from completion of flame spreading to the attainment of design operating conditions. This research is the logical extension of the modified ignition transient prediction theory of Summerfield, Parker, and Most to small solid propellant rocket motors with practical configurations. The object was to design, develop, and test-fire small rocket motors with practical configurations using a realistic igniter and to compare the experimental results with computer predicted ignition transients. Two case bonded motors were developed, one with a circular port and the other with a star shape port. A combined total of 57 circular and star shape motors were tested using various exit nozzle areas and propellant grain lengths of 3. 5, 7. 625, and 9. 5 inches. A large discrepancy was found between the predicted and experimental results in the flame spreading interval, with a smaller difference occurring in the chamber filling interval. Three possible reasons are considered for the slow pressure rise; back flame spreading, back chamber filling, and cooling-off of the igniter gas as it flows along the motor length. Based on diagnostic firing runs, it was determined that back flame spreading did not occur and that back chamber filling was only a minor contributor to the slow pressure rise. Cooling-off of the igniter gas is considered the major probable cause for the slow pressure increase. Completion of flame spreading was determined to take place after 50 % of the equilibrium chamber pressure was reached. This indicates a need to assign equal importance to the flame spreading and chamber filling intervals when considering ways to control the ignition transient. The ignition prediction theory of Summerfield, Parker, and Most appears to be fundamentally correct. The results of this research indicate a need for refinement in the theory, particularly in the flame spreading interval in order to better predict the performance of rocket motors of practical configuration.

50|$|King Saud had {{announced}} to the new Council of Ministers in his very first speech as King, that, while his father’s reign was noted for military conquests, he intended his reign to be “a war on poverty, ignorance and disease with the equitable application of the dictates of the holy ‘Shariah’ laws to all without exception, {{and the creation of}} a strong army”. He was to make a sincere attempt throughout his reign, to see to it that, Government policy planned and worked towards the realisation of these goals in the shortest time-span possible, no easy task, particularly given the local and regional circumstances. In order to cope adequately with the responsibilities of this challenge, and facilitate realistically the implementation of his programme he initially, doubled the number of ministries to ten by adding the portfolios of Education, Agriculture, Health, Commerce and industry, plus two Directorates: Labour and Broadcasting and the Bureau of Public Inspection” in 1955, to the existing ministries of Foreign Affairs, Finance, Interior, Defence, and Communications. In 1953, the decision had already been taken to move the ministries, then located in Jeddah, to Riyadh, the country's official capital. This had called for the construction of suitable new buildings and the provision of adequate housing for employees. This was <b>ignition</b> of the <b>signal</b> for Riyadh’s modernisation and development. Saud’s next brother and heir, HRH Prince Faisal, was appointed Prime Minister, while retaining his former portfolio of Foreign Minister. A five years plan was started, as mentioned in King Saud's first cabinet speech in 1954.|$|R
