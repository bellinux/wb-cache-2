25|$|In modern times, {{the most}} {{extensive}} restoration took place to the dome during {{the era of the}} Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1915 (1333/1334AH). To facilitate crowd control, the building housing the Zamzam was moved away from its original location, to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way of the Tawaf, when millions of pilgrims would circumambulate the Kaaba. The water of the well is now pumped to {{the eastern part of the}} mosque, where it was made available in separate locations for men and women.|$|E
500|$|With Annie, it is different. The two of {{them have}} fun making a meal of boiled lobster together. He teases her about the unusual men in her past. He met her playing tennis doubles with friends. Following the game, awkward small talk led her to offer him first a ride up town and then {{a glass of wine}} on her balcony. There, what seemed a mild {{exchange}} of trivial personal data is revealed in [...] "mental subtitles" [...] as an escalating flirtation. Their first date follows Annie's singing audition for a night club ("It Had to be You"). He suggests they kiss first to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way. After their lovemaking that night, Alvy is [...] "a wreck", while she relaxes with a joint.|$|E
500|$|The {{composition}} and {{setting of the}} scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns' health is partially inspired by a scene from Citizen Kane where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide. Otto is heard humming [...] "Iron Man" [...] by Black Sabbath. The ghostwriter Mr. Burns hires mentions that he wrote [...] "Like Hell I Can't". The title is a play on Sammy Davis, Jr.'s autobiography Yes, I Can. Homer mistells the story of [...] "Androcles and the Lion", instead referring to it as [...] "Hercules and the Lion". A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. Burns's line about getting [...] "A frabulous, grabulous, zip-zoop-zabulous present" [...] is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books. The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns, and the scene where he and Bart attempt to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mailbox, are inspired by the Honeymooners episode [...] "Letter to the Boss".|$|E

500|$|Whedon {{chose the}} most {{complicated}} scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") [...] "to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way" [...] for more personal numbers later in the episode. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com considers this [...] "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of [...] "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang {{in such a way}} to him on the set. Spike's [...] "Rest in Peace" [...] is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's [...] "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from Ira Gershwin, a Charleston rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' [...] "Standing" [...] is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, [...] "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".|$|E
2500|$|A core is {{a device}} used in casting and {{moulding}} processes to produce internal cavities and [...] angles. The core is normally a disposable item that is destroyed to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> piece. They are {{most commonly used}} in sand casting, but are also used in injection moulding.|$|E
2500|$|Then-L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan {{suggested}} {{some type}} of [...] "trench" [...] construction in which to lay the rails to save money and extend the subway trains to Warner Center: [...] "Some way to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground," [...] Riordan said, referring to a trench's much lower cost to construct compared to deep-burrow tunnel boring machines (TBM), and to address the objections of residents for any elevated line. However, local community groups fiercely opposed such alternatives and, in fact, any rail construction that was not completely underground.|$|E

2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013 in Manassas, Jackson held a {{press conference}} in which he sought to clear the air about his past and counter what he called distortions of his past words and {{statements}} by his opponents. Jackson addressed a number of claims about his theology, which he says has been [...] "twisted and distorted," [...] and said, [...] "I'm not going to spend the campaign talking about these issues, so let's <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way now." [...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What I said was that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E
