5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience {{the merits of the}} original Zelda, but also as a test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful.|$|E

5|$|The Australian coaches rested O'Brien for the heats of the 4 × 100 m medley relay; Peter Tonkin swam the breaststroke leg instead. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{close call}} for the Australians, as they {{finished}} fourth in their heat and qualified seventh fastest, only 1.2s from elimination. In the final, O'Brien was brought into the team to combine with Peter Reynolds, Berry and Dickson. At the end of Reynolds' backstroke leg, Australia were sixth, 3.4s behind the American leaders. O'Brien dived in and completed his leg in 1min 7.8s, a breaststroke split bettered by only Henninger and Prokopenko. This pulled Australia up to fourth position, 1.7s in arrears of the Americans at the halfway mark. Australia progressed further to finish third behind the United States and Germany {{in a time of}} 4min 2.3s, missing the silver by 0.7s.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of 2012–13, Charles {{signed a}} new two-year {{contract}} with the club. He started in the club's first match of the season, a 3–1 home win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup, playing the whole match at left back. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 1–1 draw against Shrewsbury Town on 1 September 2012, after cutting in from the wing to strike into the top corner to restore parity in the match. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his only goal of the season as Charles played most of the season at left back, making 41 appearances during the season. With a year remaining on his current deal, Charles' contract was extended for a further year in June 2013, keeping him contracted to the club until the summer of 2015. He made a goalscoring start to 2013–14, scoring after pouncing on a loose ball in a 4–3 home defeat to Oldham Athletic on the opening day of the season.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 2016, Beyoncé {{released}} a teaser clip {{for a project}} called Lemonade. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a one-hour film which aired on HBO exactly a week later; a corresponding album with the same title was released {{on the same day}} exclusively on Tidal. Lemonade debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Beyoncé the first act in Billboard history to have their first six studio albums debut atop the chart; she broke a record previously tied with DMX in 2013. With all 12 tracks of Lemonade debuting on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, Beyoncé also became the first female act to chart 12 or more songs at the same time. Additionally, Lemonade was streamed 115 million times through Tidal, setting a record for the most-streamed album in a single week by a female artist in history. It was 2016's third highest-selling album in the US with 1.554 million copies sold in that time period within the country as well as the best-selling album worldwide with global sales of 2.5 million throughout the year.|$|E

5|$|The bell frog's current {{distribution}} now ranges from Byron Bay, in northern New South Wales, to East Gippsland, in Victoria; populations mostly occur along the coast. In New South Wales, it has declined severely in range and abundance since the 1960s, although no similar declines {{have been reported}} in Victoria. In New South Wales, it has disappeared from highland areas above , except for a population in Captains Flat. A study of populations along coastal New South Wales indicated many populations were very small, usually of fewer than 20 adults. According to a 1996 study, six populations of more than 300 frogs are known: two in the Sydney metropolitan area, two in the Shoalhaven, and two in the New South Wales mid-north coast. There are now approximately only 40 sites in total where it is found, most of which are in the Sydney area. The green and golden bell frog has disappeared from an estimated 90% of its former range. Some specimens were apparently found in Armidale, but <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a misidentification of L. castanea. The declines in Victoria have been more modest and mostly in at inland areas where habitats have disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Harvey's triple figure average {{from his}} first two Test seasons could not be {{maintained}} when Australia hosted the 1950–51 Ashes series. Following his success in South Africa, Harvey played regularly at either the No. 3 or No. 4 from that point onwards. He managed 362 runs at 40.22 with three half centuries as Australia took the series 4–1. Harvey had trouble with Alec Bedser's in-swingers {{in the early part}} of the series and Bedser was the only Englishman to dismiss Harvey in the first three Tests. On the first day of the series, Harvey top-scored with 74 out of Australia's 228. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crucial as rain created a sticky wicket; England made 7/68 and Australia 7/32, both declared. Australia went on to win by 70 runs. The Second Test in Melbourne was also low scoring; Harvey made 42 and 31 as Australia won after neither team passed 200. He performed steadily through the series, with 39, 43 and 68 in the next two Tests, which were both won. He then made one and 52 in the Fifth Test defeat; it was the first in his 14 Tests and Australia's first since World War II and came on his home ground in Melbourne. Outside the Tests, Harvey scored 141 in a win over South Australia and then added 146 in the second innings of a match against New South Wales to stave off defeat. He ended the season with 1099 runs at 45.79.|$|E
5|$|It seemed {{certain that}} manager Simon Grayson {{was going to}} {{purchase}} Brandon, but instead Grayson bought Brandon's team-mate Gary Taylor-Fletcher. Brandon returned to Huddersfield and was back in first team. However, after he was substituted on 14 October 2007 against Doncaster Rovers, he did not feature again until the New Year. On 5 January 2008, his second game back in the Huddersfield side, Brandon scored another FA Cup winning goal to knock Premier League side Birmingham City out of the competition in a 2–1 defeat at the Galpharm Stadium. He scored his second goal of the season, in the following game against Gillingham, but was sent off {{in the final minute}} of a 1–1 draw with Brighton & Hove Albion the next week. Brandon's red card meant he was suspended for Huddersfield's fourth round FA Cup tie with Oldham Athletic, but following a 1–0 victory, he returned in time for their visit to Chelsea in the fifth round, which Chelsea won 3–1. Brandon scored just one more goal {{during the rest of the}} season, with his last game coming on 15 April 2008 in the Yorkshire derby with Leeds United. With his contract due to expire in the summer, <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his final game for Huddersfield after 135league appearances, during which time he scored 12goals, and a total of 148games.|$|E
