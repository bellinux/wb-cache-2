Following the battle, S.H.I.E.L.D. was secretly called in {{to clean up the}} remains of Mys-Tech's bases and technology as MI-13 didn't have the resources to do it. Brian was made a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s European Division. Years later, Pete Wisdom learned about this and sarcastically remarked he was proud that Brian was acting like him.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} to mid 2000s, {{hostilities}} developed between Scarcella and rival mob figure Michele Modica, who owed money to him and the Hells Angels. Another mobster, Salvatore Calautti ran up over $200,000 in gambling debts to the Rizzuto family and the <b>Hells</b> Angels, refusing <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and the debt {{was believed to be}} assumed by Modica. This led to the April 21, 2004 attempted assassination of Modica in a North York California Sandwiches shop, leaving an innocent victim, mother of three children, Louise Russo paralyzed while Modica and his associates escaped unscathed. Scarcella's nephew Antonio Borrelli sprayed bullets with an AR-15 assault rifle from a van including Hells Angels bikers Paris Christoforou and Mark Peretz as the driver.|$|R

2500|$|In 1990, Dire Straits {{performed}} alongside Elton John and Eric Clapton at Knebworth Festival, playing three songs: [...] "Solid Rock", [...] "Money for Nothing" [...] and a song which Knopfler prefaced as {{an experimental}} song, unsure {{if they should}} record it on a following record. The song, a blues rock piece with solos by both Knopfler and Clapton, was titled [...] "I Think I Love You Too Much". This song also appeared on the 1990 album <b>Hell</b> <b>To</b> <b>Pay</b> {{as a gift to}} Canadian blues/jazz artist Jeff Healey from Knopfler. This was prior to the time that Knopfler, Illsley and manager Ed Bicknell decided to reform the band the following year.|$|E
2500|$|At Jesus Freak Hideout, Bert Gangl {{rated the}} album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that [...] "To be sure, even though I'm Not Your Suicide is neither his strongest band-based or solo effort, {{it may well}} prove to be his most interesting." [...] Chad Bowar of About.com rated the album four stars out of five, stating that this release {{continues}} the great work begun on No More <b>Hell</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pay.</b> At Indie Vision Music, Lee Brown rated the album three stars out of five, cautioning that [...] "As the musical portion of that one-two punch, this album has high musical quality that fans of Sweet's previous works will enjoy, though casual listeners {{may be tempted to}} dismiss." ...|$|E
6000|$|Batard was a devil. This was {{recognized}} throughout the Northland. [...] "Hell's Spawn" [...] {{he was called}} by many men, but his master, Black Leclere, chose for him the shameful name [...] "Batard." [...] Now Black Leclere was also a devil, and the twain were well matched. There is a saying that when two devils come together, <b>hell</b> is <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> This is <b>to</b> be expected, and this certainly {{was to be expected}} when Batard and Black Leclere came together. The first time they met, Batard was a part-grown puppy, lean and hungry, with bitter eyes; and they met with snap and snarl, and wicked looks, for Leclere's upper lip had a wolfish way of lifting and showing the white, cruel teeth. And it lifted then, and his eyes glinted viciously, as he reached for Batard and dragged him out from the squirming litter. It was certain that they divined each other, for on the instant Batard had buried his puppy fangs in Leclere's hand, and Leclere, thumb and finger, was coolly choking his young life out of him.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002, {{he became}} {{active in the}} mob with mobster Michael Marrese, allies with Michele Modica, who had a {{reputation}} as the [...] "king of mortgage frauds". Marrese used Delle Donne as a chauffeur, errand boy and scout for potential properties. Delle Donne was later approached by rival mobster Pietro Scarcella to spy on Marrese and Modica. Hostilities developed between Scarcella and Modica, who owed money to him and the Hells Angels. Another mobster, Salvatore Calautti ran up over $200,000 in gambling debts to the Rizzuto crime family and the <b>Hells</b> Angels, refusing <b>to</b> <b>pay,</b> and the debt was believed to be assumed by Modica. This led to the April 21, 2004 attempted assassination of Modica in a North York California Sandwiches shop, leaving an innocent victim, mother of three children, Louise Russo paralyzed while Modica and his associates escaped unscathed. Scarcella's nephew Antonio Borrelli sprayed bullets with an AR-15 assault rifle from a van including Hells Angels bikers Paris Christoforou and Mark Peretz as the driver. Delle Donne, who had arranged the meeting to unsuspectingly double cross Modica under Scarcella's orders, was also in the shop {{at the time of the}} attempted hit.|$|R
50|$|Parry also {{attempted}} {{to meet with}} the Incarnation of Good {{to figure out how to}} best sort out which souls belonged in Heaven and which in Hell (Parry had no desire for souls that didn't belong in <b>Hell</b> <b>to</b> be there), but was not successful. The Incarnation of Good was too busy contemplating his own greatness <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> any attention. Instead he strikes a bargain with the Archangel Gabriel: if Parry cannot corrupt one influential individual or her children or grandchildren to shift the balance of the world to evil, he must give up his quest. That individual was Niobe Kaftan—meaning Parry had to wait six centuries before he could act.|$|R
2500|$|Many of Paul Kelly's {{popular songs}} feature St Kilda, {{including}} [...] "From St Kilda to Kings Cross" [...] from the album Post {{which included the}} famous lyric [...] "I'd give you all of Sydney Harbour (all that land, all that water) For that one sweet promenade", {{in reference to the}} St Kilda Esplanade. The area also featured in songs such as [...] "Killed her in St Kilda" [...] by Voodoo Lovecats, [...] "St Kilda Nights" [...] by Purple Dentists and [...] "Melodies of St Kilda" [...] by Masters Apprentices.

6000|$|... "Now next {{take what}} Jim said aboot your comin' to chase these sheep-herders {{out of the}} valley.... Jean, I started that talk. I had my tricky reasons. I know these greaser sheep-herders an' I know the respect Texans have for a gunman. Some say I bragged. Some say I'm an old fool in his dotage, ravin' aboot a {{favorite}} son. But they are people who hate me an' are afraid. True, son, I talked with a purpose, but shore I was mighty cold an' steady when I did it. My feelin' was that you'd do what I'd do if I were thirty years younger. No, I reckoned you'd do more. For I figured on your blood. Jean, you're Indian, an' Texas an' French, an' you've trained yourself in the Oregon woods. When you were only a boy, few marksmen I ever knew could beat you, an' I never saw your equal for eye an' ear, for trackin' a hoss, for all the gifts that make a woodsman.... Wal, rememberin' this an' seein' the trouble ahaid for the Isbels, I just broke out whenever I had a chance. I bragged before men I'd reason to believe would take my words deep. For instance, not long ago I missed some stock, an', happenin' into Greaves's place one Saturday night, I shore talked loud. His barroom was full of men an' {{some of them were}} in my black book. Greaves took my talk a little testy. He said. 'Wal, Gass, mebbe you're right aboot some of these cattle thieves livin' among us, but ain't they jest as liable to be some of your friends or relatives as Ted Meeker's or mine or any one around heah?' That was where Greaves an' me fell out. I yelled at him: 'No, by God, they're not! My record heah an' that of my people is open. The least I can say for you, Greaves, an' your crowd, is that your records fade away on dim trails.' Then he said, nasty-like, 'Wal, if you could work out all the dim trails in the Tonto you'd shore be surprised.' An' then I roared. Shore that was the chance I was lookin' for. I swore the trails he hinted of would be tracked to the holes of the rustlers who made them. I told him I had sent for you an' when you got heah these slippery, mysterious thieves, whoever they were, would shore have <b>hell</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Greaves said he hoped so, but he was afraid I was partial to my Indian son. Then we had hot words. Blaisdell got between us. When I was leavin' I took a partin' fling at him. 'Greaves, you ought to know the Isbels, considerin' you're from Texas. Maybe you've got reasons for throwin' taunts at my claims for my son Jean. Yes, he's got Indian in him an' that 'll be the worse for the men who will have to meet him. I'm tellin' you, Greaves, Jean Isbel is the black sheep of the family. If you ride down his record you'll find he's shore in line to be another Poggin, or Reddy Kingfisher, or Hardin', or any of the Texas gunmen you ought to remember.... Greaves, there are men rubbin' elbows with you right heah that my Indian son is goin' to track down!'" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Hell</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pay</b> shares many {{elements}} with the HBO original television series The Wire, on which Pelecanos {{has worked as}} a writer. For example, the (<b>Hell</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pay)</b> character of Granville Oliver, who fought {{his way out of the}} projects to become a high-level crime lord who never touches drugs, and whose tastefully appointed home includes an extensive black history/black power library, bears similarities to both Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell of The Wire. <b>Hell</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pay</b> also contains a dog-fighting scene that seems quite similar to one depicted in the television series. Pelcanos revisits dogfighting in his later novel Drama City.|$|E
