30|$|The {{improvement}} in conductance and reduced percolation threshold is discussed within {{the model of}} the effective electrical resistivity which takes into account the morphology of the carbon filler, its intrinsic electrical conductivity, and the electrical contact resistance between particles in the <b>formed</b> <b>filler</b> chains. The calculations showed that the amount of conductive chains has increased significantly, while the value of the contact resistance between the particles of nanocarbon is more sharply decreased with increasing concentration of filler for composites with UV-treated graphite nanoplatelets. This is possible due to the effect of surface “cleaning” of the filler particles (namely due to the redistribution of the relative intensities of the bands between the carboxyl, ketone, lactone, and carbonyl groups). As a result, we have an improvement of the dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix and new conductive chains are formed in the composites.|$|R

40|$|Forms are a text genre {{in which}} {{integration}} of good writing and good graphical design is of paramount importance. Many studies have taught us which factors affect the effectiveness {{and ease of}} form use, both {{from the perspective of}} <b>form</b> <b>fillers</b> and from the perspective of organizations that use forms to obtain information (cf. Jansen & Steehouder 1999). However, the mushrooming of web forms in the past decade has raised new challenges for researchers and designers. Regrettably, only little research has been published about the effects of the many new design options offered by electronic forms. And, apart from some eclectic web sites, cohesive advisory books about the topic are few and far between. Web form design is one of the first, and the author has certainly succeeded in offering us a useful and informative book with an eye-catching design to boot.

40|$|In this thesis, pupillometry {{was used}} to {{investigate}} how the parser comprehends filler gap dependencies. It {{has been shown that}} the parser automatically searches for and forms dependencies as soon as a gap is encountered. The parser utilizes verb information when positing upcoming gaps; however, in languages in which the verb occurs late in the sentence (e. g. Japanese) {{it has been shown that}} pre-verbal information is used to predict upcoming gaps. In this thesis a series of studies was conducted investigating filler gap dependencies. These dependences are typically unbounded in length; however there are some exceptions known as islands, which do not allow a filler and a gap to be associated. There are also exceptions to island constraints known as parasitic gaps. The first set of studies investigates processing costs involved with parasitic gap-like constructions in order to adjudicate between competing accounts of island constraints. The data suggests that the parser actively searches for gaps and forms dependencies as soon as possible (regardless of semantic fit). The second set of studies in this thesis investigates pre-verbal gap prediction in a verb-medial language (i. e. English). The results suggest that the parser consults transitivity information when positing upcoming gaps. These data support theories of grammar in which the parser forms the simplest (syntactic) interpretation in line with good-enough theories, in order to minimize processing costs when <b>forming</b> <b>filler</b> gap dependencies...|$|R

40|$|A {{process was}} {{developed}} for the microencapsulation of inorg. filler particles with polymethyl methacrylate, to increase {{the interaction between the}} hydrophilic filler particles and a polymer matrix. The filler utilized was aluminum hydroxide with an av. diam. of 1. 9 mm and a sp. surface area of 5 m 2 /g. The process comprised a surface modification, in which a monolayer of isopropoxy titanium isostearate was chem. bound to the surface to render it hydrophobic and to ensure a chem. bond between the filler and the org. phase. Then, an encapsulation reaction was carried out by means of an emulsion-like polymn. process at monomer starved conditions. The modified particles were stabilized in water with sodium dodecyl sulfate. A redox system consisting of cumene-hydroperoxide in combination with sodium-formaldehyde-sulfoxylate and iron(II) salt was applied for the initiation of the polymn. Besides surface polymer, free polymer particles were also formed. The parameters which varied were the filler concn., the concn. of the initiator components and the surfactant concn.

40|$|Abstract The dynamic {{rheological}} properties of a composite composed of solution-polymerized {{styrene butadiene rubber}} (SSBR) filled with starch/silica (SiO 2) compound fillers were studied by means of temperature, frequency and strain sweeps, respectively, {{and the influence of}} the starch content in the compound fillers (SCCF) on the rheological behaviors was discussed. It is found from frequency sweeps that a maximum of loss tangent (tanδ) appears at 20 rad/s, which is independent of SCCF. G ' of the composites decreases whereas tanδ and critical strain (γc) of Payne effect increase with increasing SCCF. The reasons for these are believed to be that both SiO 2 and starch could <b>form</b> <b>filler</b> networks due to interaction of hydrogen bounding between them, and the interactions between SiO 2 and SSBR are stronger than those between starch and SSBR. Moreover, increasing SCCF in the compound fillers is in favor of improving the stability of the filler networks. Furthermore, tanδ values at 0 °C and 60 °C representing the properties for the wet traction and the rolling resistance of SSBR composites respectively can be improved by partial replacing SiO 2 with starch. However, the reinforcement effect of starch to SSBR is weaker than that of SiO 2 due to starch agglomeration...|$|E
