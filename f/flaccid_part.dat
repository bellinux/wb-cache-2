50|$|In human anatomy, Prussak's Space is {{the small}} middle ear recess, bordered {{laterally}} by the <b>flaccid</b> <b>part</b> of Shrapnell's membrane, superiorly by the scutum (a sharp bony spur that is formed by the superior wall of the external auditory canal) and lateral malleal ligament, inferiorly by the lateral process of the malleus, and medially by {{the neck of the}} malleus. From the neck of the malleus, the anterior malleolar fold and the anterior ligament arise, demarcating Prussak's space anteriorly. Ventilation of Prussak's space is only possible posteriorly above the posterior malleus fold.|$|E
