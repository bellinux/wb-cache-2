5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} {{help to keep}} trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from suffering mass infestations. The family is noted <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> to acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E

5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat, {{due to its}} {{extensive}} musculature. Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are increasingly used for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them increasingly used for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding. The breed is known <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> to work in rough, hilly terrain.|$|E
5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to bunch rot. The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> to reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E

In this study, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde-COS (HB-COS) was synthesized and investigated <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>abilities</b> against HO-induced oxidative stress in microglia BV- 2  cells. Under oxidative stress, HB-COS significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and DNA oxidation, and upregulated the protein levels of antioxidative enzymes.

5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> to break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, which increases the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have {{also been shown to}} biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Games in {{the series}} have been praised as being among the best modern {{role-playing}} games. Reviewers mostly aimed their praise at particular elements of the games: visual design, and its resemblance to Studio Ghibli's previous work; characters and story, for their believability and complexity; the soundtrack, and Hisaishi's ability to {{capture the essence of}} the game world; and the unique gameplay, particularly <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> to blend formulas from other role-playing game franchises. The games also won awards from several gaming publications. In March 2014, Bandai Namco reported that the series had sold more than 1.7 million copies worldwide.|$|E

5|$|The NS-10 {{displaced}} the Auratone 5C Sound Cube as the nearfield monitor {{of choice}} in the 1980s and was recognised <b>for</b> <b>its</b> <b>ability</b> to reveal shortcomings in recordings.

The engineer, {{likely to have been}} Greg Ladanyi, monitored a recording session through the speaker in a Japanese studio and brought a pair back on his return to the US. Ladanyi then began using the speakers in a Los Angeles studio. Other engineers heard the NS-10 {{for the first time and}} were impressed by its sound. Its use spread to New York where the NS-10 was adopted at The Power Station and other studios.|$|E
