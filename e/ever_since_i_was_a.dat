25|$|I cannot {{forget that}} <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child Fitzwilliam has been, in all situations, my warmest and most affectionate friend, {{and the person}} in the world of whom decidedly I have the best opinion, and so in most respects I have still, but as a {{politician}} I cannot reconcile his conduct with what I (who have known him for more than five-and-thirty years) have always thought to be his character. I think they have all behaved very ill to me, and for most of them, who certainly owe much more to me than I do to them, I feel nothing but contempt, and do not trouble myself about them; but Fitzwilliam is an exception indeed.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, the Halcyon Gallery in London mounted Mood Swings, an {{exhibition}} in which Dylan displayed seven wrought iron gates he had made. In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid. I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Hindus {{claim that}} the beliefs {{presented}} in the novel conform to the teachings of Hinduism, though Matheson denied any direct influence. Raised a Christian Scientist, Matheson gradually developed what he called his own religion, taking elements from many sources. [...] "As a Pisces," [...] he explained, [...] "I have been fascinated about parapsychology, metaphysics and the supernatural <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> teenager. The concepts in the book are derived from my wide range of reading." [...] One of Matheson's influences was Harold W. Percival, an adherent of Theosophy, a belief system with a strong Eastern and Hindu influence.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, a {{bookseller}} in earnest. I have a {{share in}} a very good business at Bexley; I've <b>been</b> at it <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sixteen.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do--not--know. I have guarded--I mean--cast away--I mean--never entertained {{any such}} thought <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{old enough to}} know how wicked it would be." ...|$|R

2500|$|His {{music has}} been noted for its diversity, with Dusted {{saying that he had}} been [...] "defying strict genre classifications since the early nineties, {{swapping}} labels, styles, partners, motifs, and recording techniques as the desire has struck him". He has been recording for most of his life, telling Foxy Digitalis that [...] "I've made music as long as I can remember - <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child - and recorded the stuff as long as I've had the technology - I began with a cheap cassette player. So, it's strange to think what it'd be like not to make or record music. It seems unnatural!". When reviewing his 1996 CD Festival, Melody Maker described him as [...] "grand-meister of contemporary British improv, spiritual son of Eddie Prevost and Maddy Prior; gentle manipulator of English hymn-notics and religious incantations; protege, challenger and radicaliser of folk, blues, rock, minimalism and improvisation; translator for the sea and the rain and the sky; ambassador to war and peace, to love and anguish".|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've planned out {{my life in}} {{sections}} <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> child, to make it last longer. You see, I'm always afraid that I'm missing something--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Lambourne; [...] "but <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{ten years}} old, I have dreamt {{once a week}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there, and made my fortune." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} have been dying of curiosity <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> waiting behind your lordship's chair at your mother's. I knew you {{suspected}} something then,--confess now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, Miss; <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> in love <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{ten years}} old; I may say <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born in love, {{and hope to}} die in love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Father! how can you?' she cried, with {{a burning}} flush of indignation. He--why--he! He {{has always been}} a sort of uncle, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little girl.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I miss {{most of all}} is my plum-pudding, don't you know," [...] remarked Granbury Lapham. [...] "I've had plum-pudding for Christmas <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> baby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I am {{very fond}} of it. I've fished <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy, and know {{a good deal about}} bait, in spite of what Mr. Sadler said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why shouldn't I?" [...] {{said the}} divine Lillie. [...] "I get one every day; and it's {{all the old}} story. I've heard it <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} hard at work, {{for the last two}} days, in getting rid of the dyes with which <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> coloured, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an infant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mama has <b>been</b> dead <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born,' she said, in {{her quiet}} way. 'I only know her picture, downstairs. I saw {{you looking at}} it yesterday. Did you think whose it was?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't say as I does, Mr Sutherland. I've bin used to {{accommodate}} myself to circumstances, dee see, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> small shaver; so nothin' comes exactly amiss to me--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But not to me," [...] I cried. [...] "It's John Cumming, the {{landlord}} {{of the inn}} at Friar's Oak. I've known him <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy, and I can't be mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "D'you {{think you}} know more about fowls than I, who have handled them <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> nipper? I tell you, all those birds {{that went to the}} Alpha were town bred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wasn't {{thinking}} about that,' sighed Alfred. 'I was wishing I'd {{been a better}} lad; but I've been worse, and crosser, and more unkind, <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ill. O Harold! what shall I do?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> born nigh London, {{but have}} worked in a shop at Birmingham (what you would call Manufactories, we call Shops), almost <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> out of my time. I served my {{apprenticeship}} at Deptford, nigh where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a smith by trade. My name <b>is</b> John. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> called 'Old John' <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> nineteen year of age, on account of not having much hair. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fifty-six year of age at the present time, and I don't find myself with more hair, nor yet with less, to signify, than at nineteen year of age aforesaid.|$|R
6000|$|Victor {{felt the}} burning {{eyes of the}} angry girl upon him as he replied: [...] "I {{know very little about}} it, your honor. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> away to school <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ten years old." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Linda; [...] "I {{remember}} him <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very little girl,--as long as I can remember anything,--and {{he seemed to}} be as old then as he is now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I should fidget about you," [...] she said, indignantly. [...] "After {{knowing you}} <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little child, {{naturally}} I {{should be very}} sorry if anything happened to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Alas! {{now we are}} ruined indeed, {{for that}} was no other than the Fairy Carabosse, {{who has had a}} grudge against me <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy and put sulphur into her {{porridge}} one day for fun.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's {{a friend}} of my governor's. I've known him <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> kid," [...] de Cartienne {{answered}} slowly. [...] "There, I think that'll do!" [...] critically looking at the gleaming muzzle which he held in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I knew you'd {{feel bad}} over that," [...] said Marilla. [...] "I felt bad myself. That tree was there <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> young girl. It blew {{down in the}} big gale we had in March. It was rotten at the core." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad {{to welcome}} you to Elmhurst, sir," [...] {{continued}} the lawyer. [...] "I've known it <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> boy, when it belonged to my dear friend Thomas Bradley. And I hope you'll love {{it as much as}} I do, when you know it better." ...|$|E
