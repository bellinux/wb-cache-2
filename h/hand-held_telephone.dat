50|$|In the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), user {{equipment}} (UE) is any device used directly by an end-user to communicate. It {{can be a}} <b>hand-held</b> <b>telephone,</b> a laptop computer equipped with a mobile broadband adapter, or any other device. It connects to the base station Node B/eNodeB as specified in the ETSI 125/136-series and 3GPP 25/36-series of specifications. It roughly corresponds to the mobile station (MS) in GSM systems..|$|E
5000|$|Channing {{moved to}} Providence, Rhode Island, in 1861 {{and worked with}} Bell in making a commercially {{practicable}} telephone. He worked with Professor John Peirce of Brown University at Providence with experimental telephone ideas that included a mouthpiece. Channing also {{came up with the}} innovation of a <b>hand-held</b> <b>telephone.</b> Many of these experimental electromagnetic telephone ideas were conveyed to Bell in 1876. This below is a letter of 30 July 1877 held at the Library of Congress concerning the electromagnetic telephone idea Channing had with Professor Peirce, describing it to Alexander Graham Bell.|$|E
40|$|The Regional Mobile Satellite (MSAT) concept {{proposes a}} worldwide, {{interconnected}} {{mobile satellite service}} (MSS) network in which MSAT-type satellites provide the space segment services to separate regions (i. e., {{one or a few}} countries). Using this concept, mobile communications users across entire continents can now be served by a handful of regionally controlled satellites in geostationary earth orbit (GEO). All requirements, including <b>hand-held</b> <b>telephone</b> capabilities, can be cost-effectively provided using proven technologies. While other concepts of regional or global mobile communications continue to be explored, the Hughes Regional MSAT system demonstrates the near-term viability of the GEO approach...|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the existing literature}} concerning the effect of telephoning while driving on road safety. Telephone use in the car has increased dramatically in the Netherlands in recent years. The telecom industry expects {{that by the end}} of the year 2000, four million cellular telephones will be in use in the Netherlands; the percentage of hands-free installations is not known. Various studies show that telephoning whilst driving interferes with driving tasks and therefore has a negative effect on the performance of driving tasks. This concerns both <b>hand-held</b> and hands-free <b>telephones,</b> although <b>hand-held</b> equipment appears to have a greater negative effect on driving tasks than hands-free. On the basis of data now available, the SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research concludes that using a mobile phone while driving a car is undesirable. This applies to all forms of telephone use and vehicle operation. Prohibiting the use of <b>hand-held</b> <b>telephones</b> while driving will benefit road safety. Upholding a legal ban on <b>hand-held</b> <b>telephoning</b> would be reasonably feasible; doing so for hands-free telephoning would be almost impossible. (A...|$|R
50|$|Because {{mobile phones}} and their base {{stations}} are two-way radios, they produce radio-frequency (RF) radiation {{in order to}} communicate, exposing people near them to RF radiation giving concerns about mobile phone radiation and health. <b>Hand-held</b> mobile <b>telephones</b> are relatively low power so the RF radiation exposures from them are generally low.|$|R
30|$|Mixed-methods approach. 265 {{patients}} {{contributed to}} the iterative stages of development supported by a patient, caregiver and professional steering group. 85 patients at 5 UK NHS centres completed the 12 -item IPF-PROM to test its reliability. 85 patients continued into the validation study completing the mMRC scale; EQ 5 -D- 5 L; IPF-PROM and FVC at three monthly intervals. Twenty patients are completing weekly FVC measurements using <b>hand-held</b> spirometer with <b>telephone</b> support. Nine patients are using an IPF-App.|$|R
40|$|Switching {{activity}} {{is the primary}} cause of power dissipation in CMOS combinational and sequential circuits. We give a method of estimating power in pipelined sequential CMOS circuits that accurately models the correlation between the vectors applied to the combinational logic of the circuit. We explore the implications of the observation that the switching activity at flip-flop outputs in a synchronous sequential circuit can be significantly less than the activity at the flip-flop inputs. We present a retiming method that targets the power dissipation of a sequential circuit. 1 Introduction For many consumer electronic applications low average power dissipation is desirable and for certain special applications low power dissipation is of critical importance. For applications such as personal communication systems like <b>hand-held</b> mobile <b>telephones,</b> lowpower dissipation may be the tightest constraint in the design. More generally, with the increasing scale of integration, we believe tha [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper developes {{crosslink}} routing {{strategies for}} the Mobile Satellite System Iridium [1, 3, 6, 8]. Motorola's Iridium satellite constellation, based on the orbit design of Adams and Rider [2] is to provide mobile satellite service for <b>hand-held</b> personal <b>telephones.</b> The Iridium system will have 66 satellites in 6 orbital planes {{at an altitude of}} h = 780 km and a minimum elevation angle of q = 8. 2 degrees for an optimal satellite distribution around the globe. It will be a system with direct connections between satellites (Intersatellite Links ISLs). These connections can be established with Intra-Orbit ISLs and with Inter-Orbit ISLs. The problem of routing messages through the satellite network is complicated by the time-varying satellite system geometry. The relative motion between the synchronized orbital planes is relatively small. However, orbital planes 1 and 6 are counterrotating and have large relative motion. Different Inter-Orbit ISL routing strategies are needed for these tw [...] ...|$|R
40|$|I vont {{to do an}} {{emergency}} caesar, quick!” Andre’s voice crackled into my heavy, <b>hand-held</b> emergency <b>telephone,</b> which I had not yet mastered. Andre was a tall, good-natured Dutch general practitioner {{who had been working}} at Dili National Hospital for over a year and did much of the obstetrics when the hospital lacked a specialist obstetrician (a frequent occurrence). I had warmed to him immediately; {{he was one of the}} very few people employed in the hospital who spoke English, and he had an air of confidence that was reassuring. He told me that the operating room was already preparing for the procedure, he would be there in 30 minutes, and he hoped I could have the patient anaesthetised and ready by that time. It was my second day as the only anaesthetist at the only tertiary referral hospital in East Timor, and I had just discovered that, at that time (August 2001), I was the only specialty trained anaesthetist in the country. I was already finding my job challenging...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} recent reports of headaches occurring {{in association with the}} use of <b>hand-held</b> cellular <b>telephones.</b> Are these reported headaches real? Are they due to emissions from telephones? There is {{reason to believe that the}} answer is "yes" to both questions. There are several lines of evidence to support this conclusion. First, headaches as a consequence of exposure to low intensity microwaves were reported in the literature 30 years ago. These were observed during the course of microwave hearing research before there were cellular telephones. Second, the blood-brain barrier appears to be involved in headaches, and low intensity microwave energy exposure affects the barrier. Third, the dopamine-opiate systems of the brain appear to be involved in headaches, and low intensity electromagnetic energy exposure affects those systems. In all three lines of research, the microwave energy used was approximately the same [...] in frequencies, modulations, and incident energies [...] as those emitted by present day cellular telephones. Could the current reports of headaches be the canary in the coal mine, warning of biologically significant effects...|$|R
