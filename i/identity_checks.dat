25|$|On 12 November 2015, {{the cabinet}} {{introduced}} temporary border controls with immediate effect. The cabinet also proposed <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> for every individual passing the Danish-Swedish border and {{closing of the}} Öresund Bridge, giving up the latter on 8 December 2015 after severe criticism. On 17 December 2015, the Riksdag passed legislation to introduce <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> with the votes 175 in favor, 39 against and 135 abstained. On 4 January 2016, the <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> was introduced, which means that {{people who can not}} show a valid identity card, license or passport are not allowed to cross the border into Sweden, breaking with the Nordic Passport Union {{for the first time since}} 1954. Only twelve hours later the Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen announced that Denmark will implement temporary border controls along the German-Danish border with immediate effect as a consequence of Sweden's <b>identity</b> <b>checks.</b>|$|E

25|$|In July 2008, the UK Border Agency (the {{predecessor}} of UK Visas and Immigration) {{published a}} consultation {{paper on the}} CTA that envisaged the imposition of immigration controls for non-CTA nationals, and new measures for <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> of CTA nationals, {{as well as an}} advance passenger information system, on all air and sea crossings between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|For flights {{within the}} Schengen Area (either between Schengen member states or {{within the same}} Schengen member state), law {{enforcement}} agencies, airport authorities and air carriers are only permitted to carry out security checks on passengers and may not carry out border checks. Such security checks can be conducted through the verification of the passenger's passport or national identity card: Such a practice must only be used to verify the passenger's identity (for commercial or transport security reasons) and not his or her immigration status. For this reason, law enforcement agencies, airport authorities and air carriers cannot require air passengers flying within the Schengen Area who are third-country nationals to prove the legality of their stay by showing a valid visa or residence permit. In addition, according to European Commission guidelines, <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> on air passengers flying within the Schengen Area should take place only either at check-in, or upon entry to the secured zone of the airport, or at the boarding gate: passengers should {{not be required to}} undergo a verification of their identity {{on more than one occasion}} before their flight within the Schengen Area. Nevertheless, the <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> function as practical border controls anyway, and are a problem for illegal immigrants who arrive in Greece (which has no land border to another Schengen country) and want to go to some other Schengen country. The requirements as to which identity document to possess varies by country and airline. Normally a passport or EU national identity card is needed. Greece, Iceland and Malta do not share land borders with other Schengen member states.|$|E
500|$|In early 1979, [...] "the Family", a {{group of}} BLA members, began to plan Shakur's escape from prison. They financed this by {{stealing}} $105,000 from a Bamberger's store in Paramus, New Jersey. On November 2, 1979 Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey, when {{three members of the}} Black Liberation Army visiting her drew concealed [...]45-caliber pistols and a stick of dynamite, seized two guards as hostages, commandeered a van and escaped. No one was injured during the prison break, including the guards held as hostages who were left in a parking lot. According to later court testimony, Shakur lived in Pittsburgh until August 1980, when she flew to the Bahamas. Mutulu Shakur, Silvia Baraldini, Sekou Odinga, and Marilyn Buck were charged with assisting in her escape; Ronald Boyd Hill was also held on charges related to the escape. In part {{for his role in the}} event, Mutulu was named on July 23, 1982 as the 380th addition to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, where he remained for the next four years until his capture in 1986. State correction officials disclosed in November 1979 that they had not run <b>identity</b> <b>checks</b> on Shakur's visitors and that the three men and one woman who assisted in her escape had presented false identification to enter the prison's visitor room, before which they were not searched. Mutulu Shakur and Marilyn Buck were convicted in 1988 of several robberies as well as the prison escape.|$|E
2500|$|While {{passport}} {{controls were}} proposed {{to be applied}} to travellers between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, the nature of possible identity controls between Great Britain and Northern Ireland was not clear.

30|$|When the MS sends an EAPOL-start {{message to}} request a FIL re-connection access, the AP {{immediately}} sends EAP request/identity message to the MS for running the identity authentication.

Upon receiving the temporal identity, the AP first runs the <b>identity</b> authentication to <b>check</b> whether the received identity is valid. If the <b>identity</b> <b>check</b> is positive, the AP agrees on using the first round iterative localized re-authentication and also invokes the first round iterative AVs generation function.|$|R
