By studying the international company collapses {{as a result of}} accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle ethical dilemmas.|$|E
5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered {{a key element of}} integrated pest management.|$|E

Congress studied the issue and realized that under patent and regulatory law, it was easy <b>for</b> innovator <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> make it difficult <b>for</b> generic <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> successfully file ANDAs and that the regulatory pathway to get ANDAs approved was irregular and uncertain.

Although it is considered a violation of such laws <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> agree to divide up geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E
5|$|All five forts {{and three}} battery positionsLeåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Södra Slumpbergetwere {{declared}} historic {{buildings in the}} summer of 1998 and are to be preserved for the future. The balloon hangar, the only of its kind in Sweden, was declared a historic building three years later in 2001. Two forts, Rödberget and Södra Åberget, are held in operation, and the former is used as a tourist attraction with guided tours, and there is also a possibility <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> hold smaller conferences inside the fort. Over 10,000 visitors were expected to visit Rödberget Fort in 2002, averaging 300 a day during the summer. Boden Fortress is also still one of the salute batteries of Sweden, which fire a 21-gun salute at special occasions such as the National holiday of Sweden and birthdays of some members of the Swedish Royal Family. The fortress was made a salute battery on 2 June 1931, but since the forts have been decommissioned, the salute is now fired with four cannon located at Kvarnängen in central Boden.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 2010, despite Octopus' {{claims to}} have never sold data, a former {{employee}} of the CIGNA insurance company claimed CIGNA purchased records for 2.4 million Octopus users. On 20 July, Octopus acknowledged selling customers' personal details to Cigna and CPP, and started an internal review of their data practices. Octopus Holdings made 44 million Hong Kong dollars ($5.7M USD) over 4.5 years. Roderick Woo Bun, Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, gave radio interviews and called for transparent investigation, but his term expired {{at the end of}} July 2010. Allan Chiang Yam-wang was announced as the incoming Privacy Commissioner. This news was met with protests and international outrage, due to his prior history of privacy invasions involving cameras used to spy on his employees at the Post Office, and disclosing hundreds of job applicants' personal data to corporations. Outgoing Privacy Commissioner Woo pledged to finish a preliminary report on the Octopus privacy abuse before his term ends, and called for a new law making it a criminal offence <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> sell personal data.|$|E

25|$|The WCML was not {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a single trunk route, but was a number of separate lines built by different companies between the 1830s and the 1880s.

The business practice of the early railway era was <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> promote individual lines between two destinations, rather than to plan grand networks of lines, as it was easier to obtain backing from investors.

25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what they need. The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because it is harder to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it is even more important <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E

These implementations minimized government's role, paved pathways <b>for</b> <b>companies</b> <b>to</b> enter Africa for its resources.

Mobile communications such as smart phones are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using ActiveSync.|$|E
