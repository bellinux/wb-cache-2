5|$|The campus fare-free bus {{transit system}} began in 1990 and runs {{throughout}} {{the campus and}} surrounding neighborhoods. In 2005 the university started testing Hybrid buses on the service's main route. The first <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> on the system used a proprietary diesel-electric propulsion system, known as a Hybrid Booster Drive (HBD), and {{was developed by the}} Electric Vehicle Institute (EVI) within the BGSU College of Technology. The system is made up of four routes. It includes major stops at various residence halls, academic buildings and athletic buildings. The campus has a phone application that allows the students to track the location of the different buses around campus. This application also gives an estimated time on the buses arrival to the bus stops.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2005 General Electric {{introduced}} its hybrid electric gear shifters on the market. Toyota {{claims to have}} started with the Coaster <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Bus</b> in 1997 on the Japanese market. In May 2003 General Motors started to tour with hybrid electric buses developed together with Allison. Several hundreds of those buses have entered into daily operation in the U.S. The Blue Ribbon City <b>Hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> was presented by Hino, a Toyota affiliate, in January 2005. Mitsubishi Fuso have developed a Diesel engine <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> using lithium batteries in 2002, and this model has since seen limited service in several Japanese cities.|$|E

25|$|In October 2010, TARC {{announced}} that the <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> fleet would grow to 21, {{with the addition of}} 9 new buses, with a grant of $3.9 million, from the Federal Transit Authority's Clean Fuels Bus and Bus Facilities Program. A previous grant through the federal stimulus program paid for nine hybrid buses that arrived in July 2010.|$|E
25|$|Long {{distance}} buses depart {{mostly from}} Worcester Street near Cathedral Square. All local buses that {{go through the}} central city use the Bus Exchange. It is envisaged that long distance and local services will all use the Transport Interchange. In addition to normal bus services, the central city has a zero-fare <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> service, the Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|Traverse City {{also has}} a public {{transportation}} system, the Bay Area Transportation Authority (BATA) which serves most of the Grand Traverse and Leelanau region. With link services and a fixed route bus service, called the Loops, serves Traverse City and the urbanized areas of Garfield Township. BATA put into service its first <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> in December 2005. BATA's downtown bus transfer terminal on Hall Street opened July 21, 2006. The terminal is used to transfer riders to different buses on different routes.|$|E

25|$|As of 2014, TARC has a {{fleet of}} 225 buses. 32 are hybrid buses, which combine a {{traditional}} diesel engine and an electric motor to reduce emissions and eliminate tailpipe exhaust during acceleration, but cost nearly {{twice as much as}} a conventional bus. The hybrids were provided through Federal highway bill earmarks by U.S. Senator Jim Bunning. In 2007, a new TARC bus cost $285,000, while a <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> cost $504,000. Now a New clean diesel costs $405,000 dollars a bus while a hybrid costs $600,000 dollars a bus.|$|E
25|$|SEPTA {{placed an}} order with {{delivery}} starting in 2008 for 400 New Flyer hybrid buses—with options {{for up to}} 80 additional buses to replace the NABI Ikarus buses {{at the end of}} their 12-year life. These will not be the first hybrid buses, since SEPTA purchased two small groups of hybrids, 5601H–5612H, which arrived in 2003, and 5831H–5850H in 2004. Before the 2008 purchase, SEPTA borrowed an MTA New York City Transit Orion VII <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> # 6365 to evaluate it in service. SEPTA was the first to purchase New Flyer DE40LFs equipped with rooftop HVAC units.|$|E
25|$|All {{organizations}} can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments. For instance, former Mayor Martin O’Malley pushed the City of Baltimore to use CitiStat, a performance-measurement data and management {{system that allows}} city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of potholes. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency {{in terms of time}} and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million. Even mass transit systems have innovated with <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid {{technology}} for buses has seen increased attention since recent battery developments decreased battery weight significantly. Drivetrains consist of conventional diesel engines and gas turbines. Some designs concentrate on using car engines, recent designs {{have focused on}} using conventional diesel engines already used in bus designs, to save on engineering and training costs. Several manufacturers are currently working on new hybrid designs, or hybrid drivetrains that fit into existing chassis offerings without major re-design. A challenge to hybrid buses may still come from cheaper lightweight imports from the former Eastern block countries or China, where national operators are looking at fuel consumption issues surrounding {{the weight of the}} bus, which has increased with recent bus technology innovations such as glazing, air conditioning and electrical systems. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> can also deliver fuel economy though through the hybrid drivetrain. Hybrid technology is also being promoted by environmentally concerned transit authorities.|$|E
25|$|In the Autumn of 2006 on {{the trade}} fairs in Hannover the world premier {{occurred}} of the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid with hybrid power. The model was made with the cooperation with Allison Transmission and Cummins, which already had been engaged in previous <b>hybrid</b> <b>bus</b> models in North America. The {{main part of the}} model is the Cummins ISLe4 engine with 8.9litre displacement which generates 248kW (340 HP) of power. The second main part of this model is the EP50 system of Allison Transmission with the Allison Ev50 engine. The concept is created by the use of one diesel engine and two electric engines with each having 75kW of power output, which links with the Ev DRIVE module. The system also uses the produced energy when braking, which is accumulated in a nickel-metal hydride batteries located on the roof {{in the front of the}} vehicle. The prototype appeared in mid-2006 and went into production in 2007. The location of the electric and diesel engines is in the front part of the bus between the two doors.|$|E
