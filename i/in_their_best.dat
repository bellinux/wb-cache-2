5|$|Johnson's primary {{interest}} lay {{in improving}} the state's mental and penal institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he was disappointed that he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E

5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about all the things he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|In August 1728, Linnaeus {{decided to}} attend Uppsala University {{on the advice}} of Rothman, who {{believed}} it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> state. In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, {{which was one of the}} richest botanical libraries in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Sportswriters {{and players}} have called Brodeur {{one of the}} {{greatest}} goalies in NHL history. USA Todays Kevin Allen placed Brodeur in a group including Roy and Sawchuk as the leading NHL goalie, noting that Brodeur had the advantage in wins. Writer Steve Politi noted Brodeur's longevity as an advantage on other top all-time goalies such as Roy; Brodeur played 70 or more games in 12 seasons, compared to 0 for Roy. Sportsnet's Chris Boyle, after running a statistical analysis, placed Brodeur eighth in his all-time goaltending list; he offered the rationale that Brodeur's teammates helped him achieve his major records, while goalies such as Roy and Hašek had superior stats <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> seasons.|$|E

5|$|In Stage six (universal ethical {{principles}} driven), moral reasoning {{is based on}} abstract reasoning using universal {{ethical principles}}. Laws are valid only insofar as they are grounded in justice, {{and a commitment to}} justice carries with it an obligation to disobey unjust laws. Legal rights are unnecessary, as social contracts are not essential for deontic moral action. Decisions are not reached hypothetically in a conditional way but rather categorically in an absolute way, as in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. This involves an individual imagining what they would do in another’s shoes, if they believed what that other person imagines to be true. The resulting consensus is the action taken. In this way action is never a means but always an end in itself; the individual acts because it is right, and not because it avoids punishment, is <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interest, expected, legal, or previously agreed upon. Although Kohlberg insisted that stage six exists, he found it difficult to identify individuals who consistently operated at that level.|$|E
5|$|The essay {{begins by}} declaring that anarchists had {{correctly}} resisted the war from its inception, {{and that the}} authors would prefer a peace brought about by an international conference of European workers. It then submits that German workers would most likely also favor such a conclusion to the war, and presents several reasons why it would be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interest to call for an armistice. These reasons were that the citizens, after twenty months of war, would understand {{that they had been}} deceived into believing they were taking part in a defensive war; that they would recognize that the German state had long prepared for such a conflict, and as such it would be inevitably at fault; that the German Empire could not logistically support an occupation of the territory it had captured; and that the individuals living in the occupied territories were free to choose whether or not they would like to be annexed.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological considerations, decisions regarding {{the future of}} the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors. Throughout Atlantic Canada, however most pronounced in Newfoundland, the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural identity. For many families, it also represented their livelihood: most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers, fish plant workers, fish sellers, fish transporters, or as employees in related businesses. Additionally, many companies, both foreign and domestic, as well as individuals, had invested heavily in the boats, equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery, and therefore felt it was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interest to maintain an open-access policy to the ocean and its resources. What this alludes to is the unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access resources and is known by most as the Tragedy of the Commons: what is in the individual's best interest is not always {{in the best interest of}} a society at whole. In the case of Newfoundland and the Northern Cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry, maximizing their catch was <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interest; however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed, leaving everyone worse-off.|$|E

25|$|Claiming {{continental}} European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry {{when they}} next applied {{to join the}} community in December 1967 under the Labour leadership of Harold Wilson.

Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany {{as a result of the}} EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk. After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.|$|E

25|$|The Eastern Question is {{normally}} dated to 1774, when the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74) ended in defeat for the Ottomans. As {{the dissolution of}} the Ottoman Empire was believed to be imminent, the European powers engaged in a power struggle to safeguard their military, strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. Imperial Russia stood to benefit from the decline of the Ottoman Empire; on the other hand, Austria-Hungary and Great Britain deemed the preservation of the Empire to be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interests. The Eastern Question was put to rest after World War I, one of the outcomes of which was the collapse and division of the Ottoman holdings.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 85 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) won medals, 54 of those {{countries}} winning at least one gold medal.

The United States finished {{at the top of}} the table winning 46 gold medals and winning 103 medals overall. China finished second with 38 gold medals and 88 medals overall. Hosts Great Britain came in third place winning 29 gold medals and 65 medals overall <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> performance since London hosted its first Summer Olympic Games back in 1908 pushing Russia into fourth place who won 20 gold medals although they won 70 medals (5 more than Great Britain) overall.|$|E
25|$|In parallel, the Eastern Question {{grew more}} complex {{ever since the}} Ottoman defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774). As the {{dissolution}} of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the Great Powers struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The Russian Empire stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the Habsburg Empire and Britain perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>best</b> interests. Meanwhile, the Serbian revolution (1804) and Greek War of Independence (1821) {{marked the beginning of the}} end of Ottoman rule in the Balkans, which ended with the Balkan Wars in 1912-1913. Formal recognition of the de facto independent principalities of Montenegro, Serbia and Romania ensued at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.|$|E
