5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith holding a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary English-speaking audience of Bleach fans interested {{in the development of}} Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E
25|$|At around 6:20p.m., a {{motorist}} in Orange County notified police {{after seeing}} Simpson {{riding in a}} white Ford Bronco that was being driven by his longtime friend Al Cowlings. The police tracked calls placed from Simpson on his cell phone. At 6:45p.m., police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco head north on Interstate 405. When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson {{was in the back}} seat of the vehicle and had a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own head. The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle at , with up to 20 police cars following him in the chase.|$|E
25|$|To ensure Kurt and {{the enemies}} moved as realistically as possible, their {{movements}} were created using motion capture, {{a relatively new}} technology in video game development at the time. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, {{the most important aspect}} was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble.|$|E
5000|$|He had a mercurial personality. One {{reporter}} {{writes that}} [...] "Woodroof took <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire {{him as a}} patient.'" [...] Woodroof later sent the doctor roses, and the doctor took him back.|$|R
50|$|During the African {{campaigns of}} World War II in 1941, the Italians in East Africa faced the British. The Italian commander, the Duke of Aosta, gave his {{personal}} collection of elephant <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Italian soldiers <b>to</b> aid in armour penetration of British armoured cars, as Italian AT guns were in short supply.|$|R

25|$|He tracks down Grinda, who {{has made}} a lot of money from the Russian roulette-playing Nick. He finds Nick in a crowded {{gambling}} club, but Nick appears to have no recollection of his friends or his home. Mike enters the game of Russian roulette against Nick, hoping to jog his memory and persuade him to come home, but Nick's mind is gone. To keep him from taking another turn, Mike grabs Nick's arms, which are covered in scars. At the last moment, after Mike reminds Nick of their hunting trips together, Nick recognizes Mike and smiles. Nick raises the <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> temple, and pulls the trigger, killing himself. Mike tries reviving him, but to no avail.|$|E
500|$|Hrothgar Mathews {{was chosen}} as the suicidal gunman out of several actors, one of whom had even brought a fake <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> audition. During his audition, he tried out the test reading several ways, {{including}} a style that had a [...] "messianic quality". Mathews was chosen for the role and told by Chris Carter that, despite his character's life-changing event, he was [...] "still a lunatic".|$|E
500|$|When {{the party}} of {{settlers}} arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying. Heegan [...] "was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and blew it to pieces." [...] The settlers cut Yagan's head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.|$|E
5000|$|Nelson was outnumbered and outgunned, {{the enemy}} totalling nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire. There {{was no way}} for some of Nelson's ships to avoid being [...] "doubled on" [...] or even [...] "trebled on".|$|R

500|$|... {{continually}} draw {{our attention}} to the key props of the gun and the teacups. The camera follows Squires' <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> desk drawer and we're kept aware of its presence thanks to Nina and Squires' [...] "If I’d shot you, here in the dark/With an empty gun? Good luck" [...] exchange. Nina is shown drinking from the poisoned cup one of two times she admiringly calls Squires [...] "devious" [...] (a hint at her true feelings about him) and once again when she emphasises the word [...] "plan". While Squires is telling the story of the Sphinx and she seems to be gazing at the statue of it, she's actually looking at the photograph of her brother on display directly below.|$|E
500|$|About five {{ambulances}} reached Pearl Roundabout, {{where they}} were confronted by police and army forces; three drivers and nine paramedics were attacked. One of the injured drivers claimed that police had clubbed him and that a senior officer had told him: [...] "If I see you again, I’ll kill you." [...] Another ambulance driver, who was unharmed, said that police removed injured protesters from his vehicle by force and a military officer– whom he {{believed to be a}} Saudi, based on his Arabic dialect– held a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and warned him to drive away or be shot. One ambulance was reportedly confiscated by police, who then took it to an unknown location after beating its driver and other paramedics, who had to walk back to the SMC.|$|E
500|$|After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra {{believed}} {{he needed to}} go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry. [...] A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, [...] "I hope you fall on your ass". He replaced Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened {{by the fact that}} Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as [...] "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".|$|E
60|$|Those words, {{and still}} more her tone, stunned him as if {{somebody}} had fired a <b>gun</b> close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ear. He stared back at her stupidly.|$|R
5000|$|The six British ships {{dispatched}} {{earlier to}} Gibraltar had not returned, so Nelson {{would have to}} fight without them. He was outnumbered and outgunned, nearly 30,000 men and 2,568 <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> 17,000 men and 2,148 guns. The Franco-Spanish fleet also had six more ships of the line, and so could more readily combine their fire.

50|$|Since May 2011, Jackson has {{starred in}} a reality TV series {{produced}} by Animal Planet titled My Cat From Hell, {{in which he}} helps cat guardians - often couples - resolve conflict and behavioral issues between them and their cats. Since December 2013, he has been host of the web series Cat Mojo on the Animalist Network, where he shares his thoughts on everything from cat-related issues like declawing and use of squirt <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> craziest behind-the-scenes stories as a cat behaviorist.|$|R
500|$|Another {{well-known}} duel in the American West {{happened in}} Fort Worth, Texas, and {{was known as}} the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel. Timothy Isaiah [...] "Longhair Jim" [...] Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided [...] "protection" [...] to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright's, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to [...] "go to Hell," [...] that he could do anything that was necessary {{to take care of his}} business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short's side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, blowing off Courtright's thumb. Courtright attempted the [...] "border shift", a move where a gunfighter switches his <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> uninjured hand, but he was too slow. Short shot him in the chest, killing him.|$|E
2500|$|At mid-afternoon Wednesday, a {{ship-to-shore}} {{radio broadcast}} {{was made by}} Captain De Rosa, [...] "I am the captain. I am speaking from my office, and my officers and everybody is in good health." [...] It was later discovered that De Rosa had made this false claim because Molqi was holding a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|E
2500|$|On Thursday morning, June 27, Cyrus Wheelock went {{to visit}} Joseph Smith. [...] He had a pass from the {{governor}} instructing the jailors to let him pass unmolested. [...] It was raining, and he used the opportunity to hide a small pepper-box pistol in his bulky overcoat, which had belonged to John Taylor. [...] Most visitors were rigidly searched, but the guards forgot to check Wheelock's overcoat, {{and he was able}} to smuggle the gun to Smith. [...] Smith took Wheelock's gun and gave Fullmer's <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother Hyrum.|$|E
50|$|Ethan later discovers, quite by chance, that Dwight is the perpetrator. Fearing that Dwight {{would be}} incarcerated {{for only a}} few years via the court system, he buys a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> {{dispense}} <b>his</b> own form of justice.|$|R
60|$|The ranch boy had <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} {{and there was}} a determined look on his sunburnt face. He was fighting for Rush as much as for anything else.|$|R
60|$|The {{stock of}} the <b>gun</b> came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. His fingers sought the trigger. Cautiously he thrust it through {{the bars of the}} gate. Bending down, he took a long and {{deliberate}} aim. The fates seemed <b>to</b> be on <b>his</b> side. Rochester suddenly stiffened into attention, <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, as with a loud whir a pheasant flew out of the wood before him. The two reports rang out almost simultaneously. The pheasant dropped to the ground like a stone. Rochester's arms went up to the skies. He gave a little cry and fell over, a huddled heap, upon the grass.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} this segment, the {{unidentified}} boy tells Anthony that his brother is not [...] "cut out" [...] for their line of work, an ironic foreshadowing of what would happen to Anthony some years later. After bungling a jewelry store heist, Anthony was pursued by police. Apparently sensing he was about to be caught, and unwilling to do hard time, Anthony put a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> chest and pulled the trigger. He survives the suicide attempt, however; only receiving a contact wound. [...] After this incident, he earned the derisive nickname [...] "No Heart" [...] Anthony.|$|E
2500|$|While {{waiting for}} the elevator, they bump into Jessica and D.L., with Jessica {{surprised}} to see Matt still alive. The four go up in the elevator together, with Bennet telling them where to find Linderman. Bennet and Parkman then get off at the floor where the tracking system is, only to find Thompson {{waiting for the}}m. Parkman saves Bennet from getting shot, only to have Bennet leave him defenseless against Thompson. Thompson then comes up behind Parkman, puts a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head, and asks him, [...] "What am I thinking now, Parkman?" [...] Bennet comes from the side and says, [...] "Your last thought." [...] killing Thompson with two point blank gunshots to the head.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, in Baltimore, the Maryland State Legislature became {{involved}} in the dispute. On March 27, 1984, the Maryland Senate passed legislation giving the city of Baltimore the right to seize ownership of the Colts by eminent domain, an idea first floated in a memo written by Baltimore mayoral aide Mark Wasserman. Robert Irsay said that his move was [...] "a direct result" [...] of the eminent domain bill. Chernoff would say of the move by the Maryland legislature: [...] "They not only threw down the gauntlet, but they put a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and cocked it and asked, 'Want to see if it's loaded?' They forced him to make a decision that day." ...|$|E
60|$|Quick as the {{lightning}} flash <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> flew <b>to</b> <b>his</b> shoulder. Dechamp was a first-rate shot. He fired, and, {{as we have}} seen, the wolf stretched himself in death upon the plain.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Coote sent orders <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cavalry <b>to</b> harass the enemy.

50|$|Just as Bun dies, he sees Ho's inner personality, the scared boy, {{being led}} by a business-like woman, which looks eerily similar to the woman that led Chi-Wai. Ho then begins to {{endlessly}} arrange and rearrange everyone's <b>guns</b> <b>to</b> fabricate <b>his</b> own story, like Chi-Wai did.|$|R
2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. [...] "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Willis {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois on May 31, 1963, to Walter and Annie Willis.

2500|$|American {{ambassador}} Nicholas Vliotes {{boarded the}} Achille Lauro to confirm Craxi's information about Klinghoffer's death. He found De Rosa distraught, learned that Molqi {{had held the}} <b>gun</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> head during the ship-to-shore communication that claimed all the hostages were healthy. De Rosa in tears handed the ambassador Klinghoffer's passport. Veliotes called the American embassy with the ship-to-shore radio to give orders [...] "Leon Klinghoffer was murdered by the terrorists off of Tartus when {{they were trying to}} get the attention of the Syrians. In my name, I want you to call the [...] foreign minister, tell him what we learned, tell him the circumstances, tell him in view of this and the fact that we – and presumably them – didn't have those facts, we insist that they prosecute those sons of bitches." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get behind me, {{and hold}} your hand over the light," [...] he whispered, and then he shouted, as he brought the <b>gun</b> up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{shoulder}} in a very threatening manner, [...] "Come out here, and give yourselves up at once." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{teaching}} the uniformed police officer the basic course, McDaniel then trained him to hit targets {{on the ground}} with the BB <b>gun,</b> <b>to</b> quick-draw <b>his</b> [...] "carry" [...] gun, a double-action revolver in the 1950s, from a correctly designed belt holster, and finally to hip-shoot it accurately.|$|R
