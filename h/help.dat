40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PsychologyMark A. BarnettWhen {{adolescents}} are {{the subjects of}} developmental research into prosocial behaviors, {{the evidence suggests that}} both peers and parents are contributors to adolescents’ <b>helping</b> behavior. However, these two predictors are rarely studied concurrently. The present study explored the relative influence of parents and peers on (1) different types of adolescent <b>helping</b> (i. e., planned and spontaneous) and (2) different targets of spontaneous <b>helping</b> (i. e., friends, non-friends, and strangers) in 51 early (mean age = 12. 54 years, 24 boys and 27 girls) and 57 middle (mean age = 16. 82 years, 25 boys and 32 girls) adolescents. Adolescents and their parents completed parallel forms asking them to describe their planned <b>helping</b> as well as a questionnaire assessing past and anticipated future spontaneous <b>helping</b> of friends, strangers, and (for adolescents only) non-friends. Adolescents also reported their perception of their friendship group’s norm of <b>helping</b> as well as their level of identification with their friendship group. There was no clear age-related <b>helping</b> pattern, though a sex difference (females were generally more helpful than males) and an effect of target (friends were <b>helped</b> more than non-friends, who were in turn <b>helped</b> more than strangers) found in the adolescents was paralleled in the adults. Fathers’ planned <b>helping</b> was generally more strongly related to their adolescents’ planned <b>helping</b> than was mothers’ planned <b>helping,</b> though both mothers’ and fathers’ spontaneous <b>helping</b> of friends and family (though not of strangers) was strongly associated with their adolescents’ spontaneous <b>helping.</b> In contrast to parental variables’ relationship with both adolescent planned and spontaneous <b>helping,</b> peer variables were more consistently related to spontaneous than planned <b>helping.</b> Implications of the present findings, and proposed directions for future research, are discussed...|$|R

Participants, 108 students, were asked to rate the Narcissistic Personality Inventory-Short Version （NPI-S）, the normative attitude toward <b>helping,</b> <b>helping</b> ability, and daily <b>helping</b> behaviors. Results indicated that the higher the sense of superiority and competence, which was an aspect of the narcissistic personality, the higher they rated their <b>helping</b> ability. On the other hand, the higher the need for attention and praise, another aspect of the narcissistic personality, the more they rated positively on their normative attitude. Moreover, <b>helping</b> ability and the normative attitude were positively related to the daily <b>helping</b> behaviors. These results suggested that there would be two processes in the influences of narcissism on <b>helping</b> behavior. 本研究では、対象者（ 108 名の学生）に自己愛人格目録短縮版（NPI-S）と、援助規範意識、援助能力評価、援助行動について回答してもらい、自己愛傾向の程度によって援助行動に差異が見られるかどうかを検討した。その結果，自己愛傾向のうち、優越感・有能感が高いほど、援助能力評価が高いことが明らかとなった。また、注目・賞賛欲求が高いほど、肯定的な援助規範意識を持ちやすいことも明らかとなった。さらに、援助規範意識、援助能力評価は、援助行動に対して正の影響を及ぼしていた。これらの結果は、自己愛傾向は 2 つのプロセスを通じて援助行動に影響を及ぼしていることを示唆している...|$|R
40|$|Third party-hosted {{consumer}} {{communities in}} general, and brand communities in particular, have been touted {{for their ability}} to generate value for firms by promoting consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) <b>helping.</b> However, little research has examined whether consumer communities actually foster C 2 C <b>helping,</b> and who is <b>helped.</b> In contrast, the brand-community literature suggests community strategies may reduce the likelihood of community members <b>helping</b> non-community members. If so, strategies that promote third party-hosted brand or product-category communities may be counterproductive in fostering C 2 C <b>helping.</b> Should firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category communities, or both? On the basis of a hazard model analysis of 9, 192 actual C 2 C <b>helping</b> events over a 25 -month period, and supported by a second cross-sectional study, this article examines how participation in brand and product-category communities influences one's likelihood of <b>helping</b> others. We find that brand-community participation increases one's likelihood of <b>helping</b> fellow members while reducing the likelihood of <b>helping</b> members of rival brand communities.

40|$|A {{promising}} line {{of inquiry}} in sexual violence prevention involves training potential bystanders to intervene in situations where there is risk for violence. Theories of bystander intervention often discuss barriers to <b>helping</b> behavior, {{but there has been}} little empirical inquiry into this question. We will present findings of a study of both barriers and facilitators of <b>helping</b> behavior in the context of sexual violence among first-semester college students. Two hundred and forty-two first year college students completed surveys during their first year of college. Measures included assessment of bystander behavior, perceived barriers to <b>helping,</b> as well as a variety of other variables identified in the literature as key correlates of <b>helping.</b> Quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to (a) describe barriers and facilitators of <b>helping,</b> (b) examine the relationship between barriers and self-reports of <b>helping,</b> and (c) model individual differences in <b>helping</b> behavior. In quantitative analyses, barriers, as assessed in this study, were better predictors of <b>helping</b> behavior directed at strangers than <b>helping</b> of friends. Results suggested that open-ended responses about the facilitators and barriers to <b>helping</b> for sexual violence map well onto social-psychological models of bystander behavior, and that greater prosocial tendencies, an intrapersonal variable, increase actual <b>helping</b> behavior. A more specific understanding of what promotes and hinders <b>helping</b> can be used to enhance prevention education efforts focused on increasing helpful bystander actions...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} established three objectives in examining <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations. First, a need was identified {{to focus on}} a broader range of <b>helping</b> behaviors than previous organizational research has typically focused on. Second, a need was identified to examine a comprehensive model of <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations which included antecedents from across several of the <b>helping</b> literatures. Finally, a need to examine a cross-level model of <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations, including both individual-level and group-level antecedents, was identified. Two hypothesized models were developed, one including the antecedents of <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward coworkers and one including the antecedents of <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward the supervisor. ^ A measure capturing a broad conceptualization of <b>helping</b> behavior in organizations was developed and the models were tested using management teams in a freight delivery firm. The cross-level models were analyzed using Hierarchical Linear Modeling. The results from the model of <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward coworkers supported the effects of the group, with both group size and proximity to coworkers being significantly related to <b>helping</b> behavior. No individual-level antecedents were found to have significant effects on <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward coworkers. The results from the model of <b>helping</b> behavior directed toward the supervisor supported the role of both the individual and the group. Specifically, the supervisor played an instrumental role both through the quality of the exchange relationship, an individual-level process, and through the leader 2 ̆ 7 s positive mood, a group-level or contextual effect. Implications for the study of <b>helping</b> behavior are discussed including the need {{to focus on a}} broader range of <b>helping</b> behaviors and the need to consider the <b>helping</b> process and its antecedents from a multiple-level perspective. ...|$|R
