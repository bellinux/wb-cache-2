We study two such models that can be efficiently simulated since no Ewald summation is required. We first consider the Wolf method, where the Coulomb interactions are truncated at a cutoff distance r_c such that the requirement of charge neutrality holds. Various static and dynamic quantities are computed and compared to results from simulations using Ewald summations. We find very good agreement for r_c ~ 10 Angstroms. For lower values of r_c, the long [...] range structure is affected which {{is accompanied by a}} slight acceleration of dynamic properties.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{experimental work}} that was carried out to study the influence of cyclic temperature variation on the fatigue life of fastener holes in an aerospace aluminium alloy after they had been subjected to cold expansion. Three different batches of specimen were produced for fatigue testing. The first samples had the fastener hole left in the 'as drilled' state, {{the second and third}} batches had their drilled holes cold expanded by directly <b>force</b> <b>fitting</b> an oversized pin through the hole. In addition, the third batch with cold expanded holes was then subjected to a representative range flight cycle temperature variations. The results reveal that the cyclic temperature variation, rather than relaxing the residual stress and thus the cold expansion effect, as was feared, has actually extended the fatigue life of the cold expanded holed specimens tested. It is believed that this is because the temperature changes have tended to neutralise the local peak residual stresses which can occur at the surface faces. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|Albermani and Kitipornchai [28] {{present an}} {{analytical}} technique {{that takes into}} account both geometric and material non-linearities. The geometric non-linearity analysis considers the effects of accumulated stresses and the effect of the changes in the geometry on the structural stiffness of the elements as the load is increased. The material non-linearity considers the effect of plasticity occurring in the sections if the elastic limit is exceeded. Their investigation was used to upgrade old towers by reinforcing them using a horizontal diaphragm bracing system. They also used their analysis to verify a new tower design which showed good agreement with the actual full-scale tower test. Very large towers considered in the literature usually use a K-type truss bracing system to support the main leg, and within these bracings there are secondary and redundant members. As discussed in [29], linear analysis calculates the forces in these secondary bracing members to be negligible. However, results from real tests show that these members are substantially loaded and {{play a role in the}} stability of the main members. In fact, in one of the full-scale tower tests carried out in [13], the main member buckled because of end tearing failure of these ‘redundant’ members. Other literature compares results from the non-linear structural analysis to full-scale tower tests subjected to the same load cases [6, 7, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 29, 30, 31]. Albermani et al. [30] concluded that the predicted failure loads and failure modes of their models were in good agreement with those obtained in tests. The same conclusion was made by Rao et al. [29], in which the forces acting on the bracing members of the tower before failure were consistent with test results. On the other hand, Rao et al.’s [31] results from the non-linear analysis slightly over-predicted the experimental buckling failure load for two of the towers analysed by a few percent. They put forward a number of observations which might have contributed to this difference, mainly bolt hole clearances, <b>force</b> <b>fitting</b> of members, non-triangulated bracings and other imperfections which were claimed to be difficult to incorporate into the finite element model.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{considerable}} amount of research into the deformation behaviour of metallic foams. The majority of this research has only addressed size-independent bulk material properties, obtained through uniaxial compression and indentation tests of thick blocks. There is little information in the literature on the indentation response of thin panels, which has motivated the current study. Thin panels of ALPORAS closed-cell foam of ~ 0. 25 g/cm 3 density were tested in uniaxial compression, and were indented with long flat-plate punches and long cylindrical punches. Cross-sectioning of the samples following interrupted testing revealed the plastic strain evolution process. The deformation was attributed to the progressive crushing of the cell bands, and the combined action of shearing and tearing resistance. Based on energy formalism, a model was developed to estimate the crushing <b>force.</b> By <b>fitting</b> the experimental load-displacement curves, the foam ligament tearing energy was deduced for all types of indentation.

40|$|Transverse {{galloping}} {{is a type}} of {{aeroelastic instability}} characterized by large amplitude, low frequency, normal to wind oscillations that appear in some elastic two-dimensional bluff bodies when subjected to a fluid flow, provided that the flow velocity exceeds a threshold critical value. Such an oscillatory motion is explained because of the energy transfer from the flow to the two-dimensional bluff body. The 7 amount of energy that can be extracted depends on the cross section of the galloping prism. Assuming that the Glauert-Den Hartog quasistatic criterion for galloping instability is satisfied in a first approximation, the suitability of a given cross section for energy harvesting is evaluated by analyzing the lateral aerodynamic <b>force</b> coefficient, <b>fitting</b> a function with a power series in tan a (a being the angle of attack) to 10 available experimental data.

40|$|The {{transmission}} line (TL) tower {{is an important}} component in electrical network system. These towers consist of members (angle sections) and connections (bolted connections) plus foundation, which act together to resist externally applied loads. The latticed towers are used to support conductors in transmission network for transmission and distribution of electricity. These towers are constructed in large numbers all over the world. The connections in electric TL classical latticed towers are peculiar compared to other types of bolted connections in buildings and bridges because (i) the angle members are connected directly or through gusset plates with bolts, (ii) the eccentric application of load due to the non-coincidence of centroid axes of angle members near the connection and (iii) members are designed as beam column element to sustain tensile or compressive forces. Bearing type bolts are used in TL towers in preference to friction type bolts, because they (i) connect thin walled angle members, (ii) are easy to use for erection at all heights, (iii) can be galvanized, (iv) erosion of galvanizing can be remedied and (v) do not require skilled personnel for installation. However, these connections are subjected to reversal of stresses due to wind load. Damage in the bolted connections generally occur due to loosening of bolts due to stress reversals (Feenstra et al. (2005) [23). The damage induced after extreme wind and earthquake may lead to collapse of the whole tower. The failure of a TL tower results in power shut down, which has huge impact on national economy. Hence, the structural safety and reliable performance of these towers are extremely important. The design of TL tower is based on minimum weight philosophy. The TL towers are highly repetitive and therefore, their designs need to be commercially competitive. The TL tower design has the following deficiencies such as misappropriate design assumptions, deficit detailing, defects in material, errors in fabrication, <b>force</b> <b>fitting</b> of members during erection, variation in grade of bolts, improper gusset plate detailing, notch cutting of member, vocalization of bolt holes, etc. Hence, to check the design and detailing aspects of members along with bolted connections and to study the behavior of tower under complex loading conditions, the prototype testing of tower is made mandatory requirement in many countries throughout the world. The structural behavior of TL tower is determined from its deflection response. Thus, the full scale testing of the towers is the only way that one can counteract the un conservatism due to structural analysis. The premature failure of TL towers occurs during prototype testing due to deficiencies in joint detailing, uncertainties in framing eccentricity, <b>force</b> <b>fitting</b> of members, unequal force distribution in bolts and gusset plate connections, etc. To have better structural response of TL tower to be tested, there is need to develop reliable model for bolted connections in TL towers. The bolted connection model {{plays an important role in}} determining the deflection response and predicting the premature member buckling failure of TL towers. The issues related to prototype testing of full scale TL towers such as fabrication errors, <b>force</b> <b>fitting</b> and notch cutting of members, application of loads, joint and crossarm detailing are discussed. The need to develop bolt slip model to simulate the actual behaviour of bolted connection in TL towers is also discussed. The bolted connections in TL towers play an important role in determining its structural behavior. The angle members used in TL towers are subjected to bi-axial bending in addition to axial load. The slip will occur in the bolted connections, due to the provision 1. 5 mm bolt hole clearance. In the conventional Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the bolted connections are modeled as pin joint assuming the axial load transfer. The deflection predicted from pin joint analysis in TL towers generally does not match with experimental results. The analytical and experimental deflection value varies in the range of 30 to 50 %. Hence, there is need to develop model to account bolt slip for accurate deflection and dynamic characteristic prediction of TL towers. Experimental and analytical investigations have been carried out to develop and validate bolt slip model for bolted connections in TL towers. All six degrees of freedom (both translational and rotational) have been considered to simulate the exact behaviour of bolted connections in TL towers. The model is developed based on experimental results of Ungkurapinan’s bolt slip model for axial stiffness. The rotational stiffness is formulated based on the component level experiment conducted on lap joint made of steel angle with single and double bolt subjected to tensile loading. The axial and rotational stiffness for different stages of bolt tightening is also formulated based on component level experimental investigation on lap joint. The proposed model is validated by comparing with experimental results at sub-structural level on full scale king post truss subjected to tensile loading. Further the bolt slip model is validated for different bolt tightening and failure prediction of TL tower sub panel subjected to tensile loading. Finally the proposed model is also validated for full scale TL tower for deflection prediction. NE NASTRAN, a nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) software is used for analytical simulation and the load-deflection predictions, which are compared with the corresponding experimental results. The experimental and analytical results are in good agreement with each other. The steel pole structures are replacing the conventional lattice towers, because they have smaller plan dimension and occupy less space, when compared to lattice towers. The steel pole structures are dynamically sensitive structures and the determination of their natural frequency is extremely important. For the calculation of wind load through gust factor method, the preliminary estimation of natural frequency is required. Hence, the primary step involved in dynamic analysis is the evaluation of its natural frequency. Hence, a simplified model is proposed based on model order reduction technique for the evaluation of natural frequency of TL towers and steel pole structures. For the development of base line model to detect damage in TL towers, the natural frequency has to be updated. A semi empirical approach is proposed based on the deflection by using the proposed bolt slip model. The proposed approach of updating natural frequency is validated for different cases of member damage in TL tower sub panel, such as removal of tension, compression and hip bracing members. The transmission pole structures accumulate damage during their service life. Damage in these structures will cause a change in stiffness of the system and the physical properties of these structures, such as modal frequencies and mode shapes. Hence in the present study, the damage localization study based on modified modal strain energy approach is carried out for steel pole structures and the location of damage is identified correctly. To prevent premature failure of towers during its service life testing and failure analysis of TL towers is a mandatory requirement. In the present study, forensic failure investigation of a full scale TL tower due to deficient design of a redundant member is emphasized and the remedial measures are explained in detail. The stub failure of TL tower due to reduction in cross sectional area due to unfilled bolt hole is also discussed. To investigate the effect of unfilled bolt holes on the compression capacity of leg member, detailed FEA is carried out and compared with experimental results. The reason for failure of 9 m roof top communication tower due to redundant member deficiency is also discussed. The importance of guyed tower accessories in the guy rope design of 7 m roof top guyed pole structure is also investigated. Finally, failure investigation of compression bracing member, which has failed during testing of TL tower sub panel has been investigated. The failure load is predicted by using the proposed bolt slip model in the analysis. Thus the overall research contributions emerging from this thesis are, i) development of bolt slip model accounting for rotational stiffness, ii) development of direct method of damage detection for steel pole structures based on modified modal strain energy approach, iii) development of simplified model for prediction of natural frequency of TL tower and steel pole structures, iv) development of model updating technique through natural frequency based on semi-empirical approach and v) prediction of failure load for TL tower panel using the proposed bolt slip model...|$|R

A recently developed Fast Bayesian FFT Method was used to identiify the modal properties using the ambient data, where the mode sshapes from individual setups were assembled by least square <b>fitting.</b> <b>Forced</b> vibration tests were performed by exciting the slabs with a long-stroke electromagnetic shaker, resulting in vibration amplitudes of the order of a few milli-g. A frequency sweep was carried out in the forced vibration tests and the modal properties were identified by least square fitting of steady-state amplitude spectra. The dynamic properties identified from the ambieent and forced vibration tests will be compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{model is}} presented as a framework for muscle activation, fatigue, and recovery. By describing the effects of muscle fatigue and recovery in terms of two phenomenological parameters (F, R), we develop a set of dynamical equations to describe the behavior of muscles as a group of motor units activated by voluntary effort. This model provides a macroscopic view for understanding biophysical mechanisms of voluntary drive, fatigue effect, and recovery in stimulating, limiting, and modulating the force output from muscles. The model is investigated under the condition in which brain effort is assumed to be constant. Experimental validation of the model is performed by <b>fitting</b> <b>force</b> data measured from healthy human subjects during a 3 -min sustained maximal voluntary handgrip contraction. The experimental results confirm a theoretical inference from the model regarding the possibility of maximal muscle force production, and suggest that only 97 % of the true maximal force can be reached under maximal voluntary effort, assuming that all motor units can be recruited voluntarily. The effects of different motor unit types, time-dependent brain effort, sources of artifacts, and other factors that could affect the model are discussed. The applications of the model are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Variational Level Set (LS) {{has been}} a widely used method in medical {{segmentation}}. However, it is limited when dealing with multi-instance objects in the real world. In addition, its segmentation results are quite sensitive to initial settings and highly depend {{on the number of}} iterations. To address these issues and boost the classic variational LS methods to a new level of the learnable deep learning approaches, we propose a novel definition of contour evolution named Recurrent Level Set (RLS) } to employ Gated Recurrent Unit under the energy minimization of a variational LS functional. The curve deformation process in RLS is formed as a hidden state evolution procedure and updated by minimizing an energy functional composed of <b>fitting</b> <b>forces</b> and contour length. By sharing the convolutional features in a fully end-to-end trainable framework, we extend RLS to Contextual RLS (CRLS) to address semantic segmentation in the wild. The experimental results have shown that our proposed RLS improves both computational time and segmentation accuracy against the classic variations LS-based method, whereas the fully end-to-end system CRLS achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches.

40|$|It {{is shown}} in this paper {{that it is not}} only possible, but indeed {{expedient}} and advisable, to perform a simultaneous calibration of a log-normal BGM interest-rate model to the percentage volatilities of the individual rates and to the correlation surface. One of the contributions of the paper it to show that the task can be accomplished in two separate and independent steps: {{the first part of the}} calibration (i. e. to cap volatilities) can always be accomplished exactly thanks to straightforward geometrical relationships; the fitting to the correlation surface, thanks to a simple theorem, can then be carried out in a numerically efficient way so that the calibration to the volatilities is not spoiled by the second part of the procedure. The ability to carry out the two tasks separately greatly simplifies the overall task. Actual calculations are shown for a 3 - and 4 -factor implementation of the approach, and the quality of the overall agreement between the target and model correlation surfaces is commented upon. Finally, the dangers of overparametrization, i. e. of <b>forcing</b> (near) exact <b>fitting</b> to certain portions of the correlation matrix, are analysed by looking at the cases of a trigger swap, a Bermudan swaption and a oneway floater (resettable cap). ...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{quantitative}} analysis of Talin turnover {{in response to}} force ABSTRACT Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) allows cells to form and maintain three-dimensional tissue architecture. Cell–ECM adhesions are stabilized upon exposure to mechanical force. In this study, we used quantitative imaging and mathematical modeling to gain mechanistic insight into how integrin-based adhesions respond to increased and de-creased mechanical forces. A critical means of regulating integrin-based adhesion is provided by modulating the turnover of integrin and its adhesion complex (integrin adhesion complex [IAC]). The turnover of the IAC component Talin, a known mechanosensor, was analyzed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Experiments were carried out in live, intact flies in genetic backgrounds that increased or decreased the force applied on sites of adhesion. This analysis showed that when force is elevated, the rate of assembly of new adhesions increases such that cell–ECM adhesion is stabilized. Moreover, under conditions of decreased force, the overall rate of turnover, but not the proportion of adhesion complex components undergoing turnover, increases. Using point mutations, we identify the key functional domains of Talin that mediate its response to <b>force.</b> Finally, by <b>fitting</b> a mathematical model to the data, we uncover the mechanisms that mediate the stabilization of ECM-based adhesion during development...|$|R
40|$|During the recessional flow {{period of}} 2004, benthic diatoms were sampled from four {{catchments}} {{in the tropics}} of the Northern Territory of Australia. Each of the catchments showed evidence of acid mine drainage. Diatoms were {{used in conjunction with}} physical and chemical water parameters to provide a biomonitoring approach with the ultimate goal to assess the water quality of the mine impacted catchments. A total of 267 species of diatoms from 45 genera were recorded from 50 sites in the Northern Territory. One of the primary aims {{of this study was to}} assess diatom classification techniques, morphological and genetic, for the accurate identification of the morphologically variable taxon, Nitzschia palea. A second primary aim was to determine the degree to which diatom taxa and community structures can be effectively used as biological indicators and monitors of heavy metal pollution in tropical aquatic environments. To address the lack of diatom floristic studies from the Northern Territory, an iconograph of the most abundant taxa was created. Forty eight Nitzschia palea-like cells were cultured and then grouped by hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward’s method). The reliability of the groups was tested with discriminant analysis. The morphological groups were compared to the phylogenetic grouping of 20 of the cultures which were each genetically sequenced using the nuclear-encoded small subunit rDNA. For monitoring studies, multivariate statistical techniques were used to produce models to infer environmental variables from diatom distributions. The three datasets used varied in terms of the level of taxonomic identification and the inclusion of bioavailable or total metal concentrations. The program AquaRisk was employed to determine the bioavailable concentrations of the heavy metals. Each dataset was related to water quality parameters using canonical correspondence analysis. The Simpson’s index and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were statistically related, together with species richness, to the variables pH and copper through bivariate regression analysis. To determine the usefulness of individual diatom taxa as indicators, species were selected based on their occurrence, weighted average optima and tolerance values, and species response curves. Additionally, teratogenic frustules were statistically correlated with environmental variables by bivariate and linear regression. Although the Nitzschia palea-like cultures displayed morphological variation, which could be used separate the cultures into five distinct groups, the cultures were not found to be genetically variable. However, one new species, Nitzschia sp. 39, was defined genetically and described morphologically. As with other analyses of mine impacts, canonical correspondence analysis identified pH and aluminium as the principal environmental factors structuring the diatom communities. The calibration set models generated to infer pH and heavy metals had high predicative capabilities. Overall, the species dataset, rather than the datasets utilising genus level identification or bioavailable metal fractions, provided the statistically strongest results. Monitoring using diversity indices was less successful for indicating pollution. Contrary to findings from other studies, species richness tended to be higher in polluted waters than control sites. Unlike other studies of acidic environments, the species Chamaepinnularia mediocris, Naviculadicta subtilissima, Nitzschia vasta and Pinnularia schoenfelderi were found to be the best indicators. Nitzschia vasta was the only teratogenic diatom within the dataset. However, as with other analyses, the relationship between teratogenic valves and mine impact was not significant. This study demonstrates the continued need for research in the tropics in order to better understand biological responses and enable study comparisons. Although at least one new xii species was identified, the genetic research indicated that taxonomic texts produced for northern hemisphere regions can be applied to tropical diatom taxa as long as the risk of taxonomic <b>force</b> <b>fitting</b> is avoided. Additionally, the benefit of diatoms as biological monitors varies depending on the method utilised. In these highly impacted systems, transfer functions produced the strongest results. In contrast, it is evident that the abundance and distribution of teratological forms of diatoms are poor indicators of impact. Further work culturing diatoms and combining this technique with ecotoxicological work will help verify autecologies of taxa and their responses to co-varying pollutants. This will strengthen use of diatom taxa as indicator species. Continued monitoring of these sites can add much to our ecological understanding of these highly impacted systems which, in turn, will lead to better management of the systems for both sustainable resource development and conservation.

40|$|Background and Objectives: High {{prevalence}} of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, especially in jobs such as nursing which covers tasks like patients' repositioning, has attracted great attentions from occupational healthcare experts to necessitate {{the knowledge of}} ergonomic science. Therefore, this study was performed aiming at ergonomic relationship during work in nursing staff of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with operating room. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study (cohort), fifty personnel of ICU staff and fifty of operating room staff were selected through a census method and were assessed using tools such as Nordic questionnaire and Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) standards in terms of body posture ergonomics. The obtained data were analyzed by SPSS software and Chi-Square test after collection. Results: The most complaints were from the operating room group (68 %) and ICU staff (60 %) for the lumbar musculoskeletal system. There was {{a significant relationship between}} the total REBA scores of body, legs, neck, arm, <b>force</b> status, load <b>fitting</b> with hands and static or dynamic activities in the operating room and ICU staff groups (P < 0. 05). In operating room and ICU groups, most subjects obtained score 11 – 15 and very high-risk level. Conclusion: Nurses working at operating room and ICU ward are subjected to high-risk levels and occupational injuries which is dramatically resulted from inappropriate body posture or particular conditions of their works. As a result, taking corrective actions along with planning and identifying ways will help prohibiting the {{prevalence of}} disorders in the future...|$|R
40|$|Summary According to {{prevailing}} theory, {{air temperature}} {{is the main}} environmental factor regulating the timing of bud burst of boreal and temperate trees. Air temperature has a dual role in this regulation. First, after the cessation of growth in au-tumn, prolonged exposure to chilling causes rest completion, i. e., removes the physiological growth-arresting conditions in-side the bud. After rest completion, prolonged exposure to warm conditions causes ontogenetic development leading to bud burst or flowering. During the past three decades, several simulation models based on chilling and forcing have been de-veloped and tested. In recent modeling studies of the timing of bud burst in mature trees, the simpler thermal-time models that assume forcing starts on a fixed date in the spring have outper-formed the chilling-forcing models. We hypothesize that this discrepancy {{may be due to}} some element missing from the chilling-forcing models. We tested two new model formulations by introducing re-versing, temperature-driven elements that precede <b>forcing</b> and by <b>fitting</b> the models to seven historical time series of data of flowering and leaf bud burst of common boreal tree species. In these tests, both of the new models were generally more accu-rate in predicting the timing of bud burst than a classical chill-ing-forcing model, but less accurate than the simple thermal-time model. We therefore conclude that besides chilling, other environmental factors are involved in the regulation of the tim-ing of bud burst. Further work is needed to determine if the regulatory factors derive from air temperature or from some other environmental condition such as changes in light condi-tions, like day length or night length...|$|R
2500|$|Early revolvers were caplocks {{and loaded}} as a muzzle-loader: the user poured black powder into each chamber, rammed down a bullet {{on top of}} it, then placed {{percussion}} caps on the nipple {{at the rear of}} each chamber, where the hammer would fall on it. This was similar to loading a traditional single-shot muzzle-loading pistol, except that the powder and shot could be loaded directly into the front of the cylinder rather than having to be loaded down the whole length of the barrel. Importantly, this allowed the barrel itself to be rifled, since the user wasn't required to <b>force</b> the tight <b>fitting</b> bullet down the barrel in order to load it (a traditional muzzle-loading pistol had a smoothbore and relatively loose fitting shot, which allowed easy loading, but gave much less accuracy). When firing the next shot, the user would raise his pistol vertically as he cocked the hammer back so as to let the fragments of the burst percussion cap fall out so as to not jam the mechanism. Some of the most popular cap-and-ball revolvers were the Colt Model 1851 [...] "Navy" [...] Model, 1860 [...] "Army" [...] Model, and Colt Pocket Percussion revolvers, all of which saw extensive use in the American Civil War. Although American revolvers were the most common, European arms makers were making numerous revolvers by that time as well, many of which found their way {{into the hands of the}} American forces, including the single action Lefaucheux and LeMat revolver and the Beaumont–Adams and Tranter revolvers, which were early double-action weapons, in spite of being muzzle-loaders.|$|R
