5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming from the experience of the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Sir James, Mac Fhirbhisigh may have {{travelled}} to Gort, seeking patronage from Diarmuid Ó Seachnasaigh (Sir Dermot O Shaughnessey), as indicated by a poem he apparently composed in 1667. It is thought that also in this year or shortly after he obtained {{a copy of the}} important early Irish law tract, Senchas Már. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> also travelled to Larne in County Antrim, seeking patronage from Randall MacDonnell, Marquess of Antrim. Here <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> left or sold about twelve or more manuscripts to a local bard, Eoin Ó Gnímh.|$|E

25|$|In September 1670, Flamsteed visited Cambridge {{and entered}} {{his name as}} an {{undergraduate}} at Jesus College. While <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> never took up full residence, {{he was there for}} two months in 1674, and had the opportunity to hear Isaac Newton's Lucasian Lectures.|$|E
25|$|Mars Rigonemetis ("King of the Sacred Grove"). A {{dedication}} to Rigonemetis and the numen (spirit) of the Emperor inscribed {{on a stone}} was discovered at Nettleham (Lincolnshire) in 1961. Rigonemetis is only known from this site, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> {{may have been a}} god belonging to the tribe of the Corieltauvi.|$|E
25|$|The {{story was}} even told that Titus was {{reclining}} next to Britannicus, {{the night he}} was murdered, and sipped of the poison that was handed to him. Further details on his education are scarce, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> showed early promise in the military arts and was a skilled poet and orator both in Greek and Latin.|$|E

25|$|From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held {{in trust}} for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of his}} mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.|$|E
25|$|Manding Bory was crowned {{under the}} throne name Mansa Abubakari (a Manding {{corruption}} of the Muslim name Abu Bakr). Mansa Abubakari's mother was Namandjé, the third wife of Maghan Kon Fatta. Prior to becoming mansa, Abubakari {{had been one of}} his brother's generals and later his kankoro-sigui. Little else is known about the reign of Abubakari I, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was successful in stopping the hemorrhaging of wealth in the empire.|$|E
25|$|In the north, {{he brought}} Comino, Aquino, Traetto (May 1039), Venafro (October 1040), Pontecorvo, and Sora under his rule. In June 1040, he took Gaeta, {{which had been}} conquered by Pandulf in 1032. After October 1041, Guaimar ceases {{to appear in the}} acts of Gaeta and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was {{replaced}} by a popular usurper related to the old dynasty, Leo. By December 1042, however, Gaeta was in the hands of Rainulf, holding it from Guaimar.|$|E

25|$|During {{his office}} as vicarius Africae he {{received}} a law against Donatism; however <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> somehow sided with the Donatists, if in 405 Augustine of Hippo misbelieved him a Donatist. In this office he, together with Decimius Hilarianus Hesperius, {{was in charge of}} the investigations around a scandal involving the city of Leptis Magna, but his conclusions, included into a report, had the citizens cleared of the charges and not guilty; afterwards the citizens of Leptis Magna erected him a statue.|$|E
25|$|Evans {{was educated}} at Cheltenham College, Rugby School and Exeter College, Oxford, {{from where he}} {{graduated}} with a third in Classical Moderations and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> devoted {{most of his time}} to games. He made his first-class debut for Oxford University against MCC at Magdalen College in 1863 and was awarded his blue that year, top-scoring with 25 in Oxford' first innings at Lord's. He won blues in the subsequent two seasons and in the match against Cambridge in 1865 he made his highest first-class score of 43. In that season he was also selected for the Gentlemen versus Players in {{what turned out to be}} his final first-class appearance and he returned his best bowling figures of 5-32.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1256 (probably in December), a {{group of}} boyars, who had decided to kill Tsar Michael and replace him with his first cousin, Koloman, {{attacked}} the former, who died soon afterwards from his wounds. To further his claims, Koloman II forcibly married Michael’s widow, the daughter of Rostislav, {{but he could not}} consolidate power and was killed almost immediately. To protect his daughter, Rostislav now, early in 1257, invaded Bulgaria; <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was using her as an excuse to acquire the Bulgarian throne for himself. Rostislav appeared at the gates of Tărnovo and recovered his daughter; though it is sometimes stated that he briefly obtained Tărnovo, but it seems that he probably never actually gained possession of the city.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 1856, Murphy {{attached}} to the 17th Lancers, who were now en route from the Crimea, via Ismid in Turkey, to help contain {{the early stages of}} the Indian Mutiny. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> intended to catch up with his regiment in India. Something must have affected this plan, since on 18 October 1856, he joined the 2nd Battalion Military Train (later the Royal Army Service Corps and nowadays the Royal Logistic Corps) instead. In March 1857, Murphy left the Curragh Camp and boarded the steamer Calypso at Dublin bound for Woolwich. On 28 April, he embarked for Hong Kong. On reaching Indonesia, the battalion was diverted to Calcutta on news of the Indian Mutiny. They arrived in Calcutta on 27 August, and after a series of moves were deployed to relieve Lucknow. The battalion was subsumed into the Azimghur Field Force on 29 March 1858.|$|E
25|$|From 1491 to 1518, Kynaston {{supposedly}} lived a {{life that}} would match the fictional character Robin Hood. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> {{had a reputation for}} robbing from the rich, and giving to the poor. In return, the locals protected him, and gave him and his horse ('Beelzebub') food. One time, in an attempt to capture Kynaston, the local sheriff removed several planks from Montford Bridge, to keep him from crossing the River Severn, but his horse managed to leap and safely clear the distance. It is also said that he was a regular patron at the Old Three Pigeons tavern at Nesscliffe in Shropshire, and his original seat is still there. He may have been pardoned by Henry VII in 1493, but some accounts state that in 1513, Humphrey provided 100 men to aid Henry VIII in France, and in return received a royal pardon 3 to 5 years later.|$|E
25|$|The reports {{created a}} sensation. Oliver was not slow to try adrenal {{extracts}} in patients, orally again and rather indiscriminately, from Addison's disease, hypotension (″loss of vasomotor tone″), Diabetes mellitus and Diabetes insipidus to Graves' disease (″exophthalmic goitre″). <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> adhered to contemporary ideas of organotherapy, believing that powerful substances existed in tissues {{and ought to}} be discovered for medicinal use. In fact he immediately went on to extract the pituitary gland and, again with Schäfer, discovered vasopressin. In 1903 adrenaline, meanwhile purified, was first used in asthma. The use was based, not on the bronchodilator effect, which was discovered later, but on the vasoconstrictor effect, which was hoped to alleviate the “turgidity of the bronchial mucosa” – presumably vascular congestion and edema. Also as of 1903, adrenaline was added to local anesthetic solutions. The surgeon Heinrich Braun in Leipzig showed that it prolonged the anesthesia at the injection site and simultaneously reduced ″systemic″ effects elsewhere in the body.|$|E

25|$|Hipparchus applied his {{knowledge}} of spherical angles {{to the problem of}} denoting locations on the Earth's surface. Before him a grid system had been used by Dicaearchus of Messana, but Hipparchus was the first to apply mathematical rigor to the determination of the latitude and longitude of places on the Earth. Hipparchus wrote a critique in three books on the work of the geographer Eratosthenes of Cyrene (3rd century), called Pròs tèn 'Eratosthénous geografían ("Against the Geography of Eratosthenes"). It is known to us from Strabo of Amaseia, who in his turn criticised Hipparchus in his own Geografia. Hipparchus apparently made many detailed corrections to the locations and distances mentioned by Eratosthenes. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> did not introduce many improvements in methods, but he did propose a means to determine the geographical longitudes of different cities at lunar eclipses (Strabo Geografia 1 January 2012). A lunar eclipse is visible simultaneously on half of the Earth, and the difference in longitude between places can be computed from the difference in local time when the eclipse is observed. His approach would give accurate results if it were correctly carried out but the limitations of timekeeping accuracy in his era made this method impractical.|$|E
25|$|A {{new chapter}} was opened when Max Lewandowsky in 1899 in Berlin {{observed}} that adrenal extracts acted {{on the smooth}} muscle of the eye and orbit of cats – as the iris dilator muscle and nictitating membrane – {{in the same way}} as sympathetic nerve stimulation. The correspondence was extended by John Newport Langley and, under his supervision, Thomas Renton Elliott in Cambridge. In four papers in volume 31, 1904, of the Journal of Physiology Elliott described the similarities organ by organ. His visionary hypothesis stands in the abstract of a presentation to the Physiological Society of May 21, 1904, a little over ten years after Oliver and Schäfer’s presentation: ″Adrenalin does not excite sympathetic ganglia when applied to them directly, as does nicotine. Its effective action is localised at the periphery. … I find that even after … complete denervation, whether of three days’ or ten months’ duration, the plain muscle of the dilatator pupillae will respond to adrenalin, and that with greater rapidity and longer persistence than does the iris whose nervous relations are uninjured. Therefore, it cannot be than adrenalin excites any structure derived from, and dependent for its persistence on, the peripheral neurone. … The point at which the stimulus of the chemical excitant is received, and transformed into what may cause the change of tension of the muscle fibre, is perhaps a mechanism developed out of the muscle cell in response to its union with the synapsing sympathetic fibre, the function of which is to receive and transform the nervous impulse. Adrenalin might then be the chemical stimulant liberated on each occasion when the impulse arrives at the periphery.″ The abstract is the ″birth certificate″ of chemical neurotransmission. Elliott was never so explicit again. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> was discouraged by the lack of a favourable response from his seniors, Langley in particular, and a few years later he left physiological research.|$|E
500|$|Belevitch {{dominated}} international {{conferences and}} {{was prone to}} asking searching questions of the presenters of papers, often causing them some discomfort. [...] The organiser of one conference at Birmingham University in 1959 made Belevitch {{the chairman of the}} session in which the organiser gave his own presentation. [...] <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>he</b> did this to restrain Belevitch from asking questions. [...] Belevitch stopped attending conferences in the mid-1970s {{with the exception of the}} IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems in Montreal in 1984 in order to receive the IEEE Centennial Medal.|$|E
