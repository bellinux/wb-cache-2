5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This is not due to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway <b>intersexual</b> selection.|$|E

In some species of salamanders, females that are territorial and aggressive also intimidate males. Plethodon cinereus females aggressively punish males who are exhibiting social polygyny.

In organisms where males have genitalia harmful to females, such as in certain insects, females tend to evolve thicker, less sensitive copulatory tracts. Also, they may evolve shield over their genital openings to prevent intromission. Females of some species of water striders have evolved protection from forceful insemination, such as abdominal spines and downward-bent abdomens {{to make it harder}} for males to mate. In response, however, males have counter evolved, also changing the shape of their abdomens to those that would facilitate forceful mating.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka, who had previously worked on the main Drakengard series. Two character designs for the protagonist were created for Nier. The developers believed that the Japanese audience would respond more strongly to a younger protagonist, while non-Japanese audiences would prefer an adult Nier character. Other than changing Nier's appearance and modifying a few lines of dialogue to fit with Nier being a father rather than a brother to Yonah, the developers made no changes between the two versions; while it was initially believed that the older Nier was the character's original design, an interview with Yoko clarified that the young Nier was the original vision. Many characters underwent changes during development, and some needed to be cut: there were originally thirteen Grimoires, with all but three being cut: those that remained were Weiss, Noir and Rubrum. Emil's character was derived from a female character named Halua, while Kainé was originally a far more feminine type who hid her violent nature. Yonah's original Japanese name {{was derived from the}} Biblical name Jonah: this could not be taken verbatim into its localized form due to the name being associated with a man, so the name was changed to [...] "Yonah".

The criteria for classification can be genitalia at birth chromosomal typing before birth, and they do not necessarily agree with one another". The differentiation between gender and sex did not arise until the late 1970s, when researchers began using [...] "gender" [...] and [...] "sex" [...] as two separate terms, with [...] "gender" [...] referring to one's self-identity and [...] "sex" [...] referring to one's chromosomal makeup and sex organs. The binary of male and female leaves out everyone who does not fit into these categories because of genital make up, chromosomes, or hormone levels. Anne Fausto-Sterling addresses the issues facing intersex people in her article The Five Sexes. She claims that there is at minimum five sexes but probably more; this is based on the vast range of ways bodies show up in nature. She points out that, [...] "recent advances in physiology and surgical technology now enable physicians to catch most <b>intersexuals</b> at birth...infants are entered into a program of hormonal and surgical management..."

40|$|Organisms {{have evolved}} a bewildering {{diversity}} of mechanisms {{to generate the}} two sexes. The honeybee (Apis mellifera) employs an interesting system in which sex is determined by heterozygosity at a single locus (the Sex Determination Locus) harbouring the complementary sex determiner (csd) gene. Bees heterozygous at Sex Determination Locus are females, whereas bees homozygous or hemizygous are males. Little is known, however, about the regulation that links sex determination to sexual differentiation. To investigate the control of sexual development in honeybees, we analyzed the functions and the regulatory interactions of genes involved in the sex determination pathway. We show that heterozygous csd is only required to induce the female pathway, while the feminizer (fem) gene maintains this decision throughout development. By RNAi induced knockdown we show that the fem gene is essential for entire female development and that the csd gene exclusively processes the heterozygous state. Fem activity is also required to maintain the female determined pathway throughout development, which we show by mosaic structures in fem-repressed <b>intersexuals.</b> We use expression of Fem protein in males {{to demonstrate that the}} female maintenance mechanism is controlled by a positive feedback splicing loop in which Fem proteins mediate their own synthesis by directing female fem mRNA splicing.

40|$|This dissertation, The Doctor will Fix Everything: Intersexuality in Contemporary Culture, {{authored}} by Michelle Morgan LeFay Holmes, is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of the}} doctoral degree in Interdisciplinary Humanities. Using an interdisciplinary approach, this work examines the development of {{diagnosis and treatment of}} "intersexuality". I argue that intersexuality is not a medical condition per se, and that standard treatments contravene the ethical and legal standards regarding the treatment and care of minors. I situate medical discourse, fiction and (auto) biography as forms of narrative within a contemporary culture, and I examine how each narrative form respectively creates and contests {{what it means to be}} "intersexed". Various representations of intersexuality interest me for their ability to shape the category. This dissertation sets out to demonstrate that the scientific narratives are no less cultural products than are fictional and personal accounts, and argues that scientific texts are merely specific forms of cultural product. Therefore, I do not structure scientific or medical texts as opposites of personal or fictional ones. Instead, I read each for the ways in which it structures what is possible, knowable, and true about sex, gender and sexuality. This dissertation weighs the narratives of <b>intersexuals</b> against these cultural and scientific representations to contest standard beliefs and mythological stories about hermaphroditism. The work begins with a historical perspective, moves through narrative and cultural analysis and ends with an ethical discussion of current treatment standards.

Race and gender are not ontologically or epistemologically symmetrical. Ontologies of human races are more recent historical ideas than male-female taxonomies of gender, although ontologies of gender that include <b>intersexuals,</b> trans-sexuals and non-sexuals are new. Taxonomies of race rely on justification from the physical sciences, while taxonomies of gender have been more dependent on ordinary life. Current biological science does not support racial ontologies, although belief in biological race is recalcitrant. I explain this with criticism of “the new biology” of race as advanced by Michael Hardimon and Robin Andreasen in recent Journal of Philosophy articles {{that are related to}} a 1999 anthology article by Philip Kitcher. It is not necessary to have a biological notion of race to talk about or oppose racism. However, even politically viable racial identities could not address that rule by men through their gender constructions, which is violent and exploitative. But with gender, post intersectionality, {{it may be possible to}} revise men’s rule given a unifying relational definition of women, based on their history. Women are those human beings who are assigned to or identify with the disjunction of biological mothers or men’s heterosexual choices or females birth designees (category FMP).

5000|$|A more abrupt and {{sweeping}} re-evaluation of reconstructive genital surgery began about 1997, {{triggered by a}} combination of factors. One of the major factors was the rise of patient advocacy groups that expressed dissatisfaction with several aspects of their own past treatments. The Intersex Society of North America was the most influential and persistent, and advocated postponing genital surgery until a child is old enough to display a clear gender identity and consent to the surgery. Recommendations from these voices ranged from the unexceptionable (ending shame and secrecy, and providing more accurate information and counseling) to the radical (assigning a third sex or no sex at all to intersex infants). The idea that possession of abnormal genitalia in and of itself does not constitute a medical crisis was stressed. The claims of advocacy groups have been resisted.

I analyze {{the role of}} physicians as writers and as intellectuals in Spanish peninsular literature, and I illustrate not only how they use science and medicine to define and critique nation, nationalism, culture, and politics in Spain, but also how politics can be read in these four physicians? literary production, by analyzing the metaphors of science, medicine, doctor, patient, sickness, and cure. Physician writers produce a space for social and political critique in which medical discourse becomes political discourse. Through the four chapters of my dissertation, I show that Spanish nationalism imposes a centralistic, homogeneous, and unified vision of Spain. This homogeneity leads {{to the construction of}} a Spanish nation in which the particularities of three historical nations (Catalonia, Galicia, and Basque Country) are ignored, and imposes Castilian culture in order to legitimize such a construction. Ramon y Cajal, Baroja, Maranon, and Vallejo Nagera construct a singular Spanish national culture by using the metaphor of the sick body as an opposition to the ideal healthy body, defining Spanish national culture in opposition to the other nations that constitute Spain. In order for these physicians to talk about the sick body, they refer to the Other: Americans, Catalans, Basques, <b>intersexuals,</b> homosexuals, Communists, and Marxists, among others. I also show that the fictionalization of the pathological body and the symbolic representation of sickness underscore these physician writers? political anxieties. Not only do these authors reproduce the ideology of the hegemonic group, but they also produce this ideology by building it from within the State, where medical discourse is institutionalized. They support an authoritarian, colonialist, imperialist, and totalitarian political regime, representing Castilian values.

Naturally enough, apart from an interpretation of the androgyne as the archetype of the unity of oppossing energies (the androgynous soul in, for example, June Singer 2 ̆ 7 s definition), I also take into account Kari Weil 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation of the androgyne, according to whose unmasking the androgyne also figures as the misogynous ideal, a construct of the patriarchal ideosphere. Or, as Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar have proposed - the alternative term gynandrous (whole), since the very structure of the lexeme androgyny reflect the power of the male symbolic vision over the female view of the Universe. Under the circumstances in Croatia, transgenderism is perceived in the text as an ignored state of affairs, since <b>intersexuals</b> (hermaphrodites) are not categorised in the »Statute on the Structure and Method of Work of the Expert Opinion Component in Implementing Rights from Social Welfare and Other Rights According to Specific Regulations«, which simply means that they have no specific rights under the present social welfare system. By way of the identity of the androgyne (he/she androgyne) as a third gender, which unifies the categories of masculinity and femininity, or, more specifically, by the ecological androgynous paradigm, I consider the attempt to delete the dichotomy of neglected Nature (woman, non-Europeans, animals, the working class) versus culture (man, Europeans, people, the upper and middle classes), as explicated, for example, by the feminist biologist Lynda Birke, and the attempt to achieve a bioethical encounter between the human animal and the “nonhuman” animal, which I define conditionally with the term transspeciesism, which covers the ethical negation of speciesism. Namely, within the framework of eco/feminist theory, the socio-cultural anthropologist Barbara Noske (1989) was one of the first to put forward the question of the human relation towards other animals, demanding the establishment of an anthropology of animals, since – even now – only an (anthropocentric) anthropology of human exist in relation to animals...|$|R
