The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane <b>drove</b> <b>a</b> tank to the roadblock and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the roadblock with mines, opening the road {{before the end of the}} night.|$|E
