5000|$|In 1793, Samuel Slater showed Hannah {{some very}} smooth yarn he had spun from long staple Surinam cotton. He {{intended}} {{to use it to}} produce cloth, however Hannah and her sister used a <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> to spin it into thread; the resultant thread proved to be stronger than linen thread. The same year, Hannah Slater applied to the U.S. Patent Office for a patent for an invention - a new method of producing sewing thread from cotton. The patent was issued in the name of [...] "Mrs Samuel Slater".|$|E
50|$|Historical {{documents}} (including Ain-e-Akbari by Abul Fazal in 1590) {{state that}} the poor villagers of India used to wear clothes made of jute. Simple handlooms and <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> were used by the weavers, who used to spin cotton yarns as well. History also suggests that Indians, especially Bengalis, used ropes and twines made of white jute from ancient times for household and other uses. It is highly functional in carrying grains or other agricultural products.|$|R
50|$|Until the 1740s all {{spinning}} {{was done}} by <b>hand</b> using a <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel.</b> The {{state of the art}} <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> in England was known as the Jersey wheel however an alternative wheel, the Saxony wheel was a double band treadle <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> where the spindle rotated faster than the traveller in a ratio of 8:6, drawing on both {{was done by}} the spinners fingers.|$|R

He was quick and sure, much more capable, and even masterful, than you would have supposed, seeing his tawny Mediterranean <b>hands.</b> He <b>spun</b> the <b>wheel</b> round, patting it lightly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>spinning</b> {{can be done}} {{by using}} a spindle or the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>Spinning</b> turns the carded wool fibres into yarn which can then be {{directly}} woven, knitted (flat or circular), crocheted, or by other means turned into fabric or a garment.|$|R
50|$|The pre-industrial {{techniques}} of <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> with spindle or <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> {{continue to be}} practiced as a handicraft or hobby, and enable wool or unusual vegetable and animal staples to be used.|$|R
50|$|In 1760 England, yarn {{production}} from wool, flax and cotton {{was still a}} cottage industry in which fibres were carded and <b>spun</b> by <b>hand</b> using a <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel.</b> As the textile industry expanded its markets and adopted faster machines, yarn supplies became scarce especially due to innovations such as the doubling of the loom speed after {{the invention of the}} flying shuttle. High demand for yarn spurred invention of the spinning jenny in 1764, followed closely by the invention of the spinning frame, later developed into the water frame (patented in 1769). Mechanisms had increased production of yarn so dramatically that by 1830 the yarn cottage industry in England could no longer compete and all spinning was carried out in factories.|$|R
50|$|The spindle {{is closely}} {{associated}} with many goddesses, including the Germanic Holda, Norse Frigg and Freya, Egyptian Isis, Greek Artemis and Athena. It is often connected with fate, as the Greek Fates and the Norse Norns work with yarns that represent lives. Because the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> was not in common use before the 16th century in Europe, the older stories are certainly referring to <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> done on a spindle. Chief among these is the French fairy tale The Sleeping Beauty, where the princess is erroneously shown to prick her hand on some part of a <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> in modern illustrations, rather than a spindle.|$|R

The final, published version is available online at: [URL] article outlines an argument about the origins of the Industrial Revolution in textiles. It arises from the research project Spinning in the Era of the <b>Spinning</b> <b>Wheel,</b> 1400 - 1800, a study of spinning in England from the introduction of the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> during the later Middle Ages to its eclipse by the powered spinning machine early in the nineteenth century. A focus on <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution enabled Spinning in the Era of the <b>Spinning</b> <b>Wheel</b> to address issues frequently ignored by economic historians. They have typically dismissed <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> as a low-skill, low-productivity, feminised bottleneck to be overcome in the forward march of technological progress, devoting much more effort to understanding the new, mechanical technologies of the Industrial Revolution than the hand techniques they replaced. To avoid this pitfall, the project researched the fibre content of surviving early-modern yarns and fabrics, and explored the relationships between their materiality and their markets. Applying this approach to eighteenth-century linen and cotton textiles generated new perspectives on the origins of the British Industrial Revolution, which challenge currently influential views...|$|R

50|$|A <b>{{spinning}}</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{a device}} for spinning thread or yarn from natural or synthetic fibres. <b>Spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> were first used in India, between 500 and 1000 C.E. Spinning machinery, {{such as the}} spinning jenny and spinning frame, displaced the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> during the Industrial Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Spinning</b> <b>Wheel</b> {{replaced}} the earlier method of <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> with a spindle. The first stage in mechanizing {{the process was}} mounting the spindle horizontally {{so it could be}} rotated by a cord encircling a large, hand-driven wheel. The great wheel is an example of this type, where the fibre is held in the left hand and the wheel slowly turned with the right. Holding the fibre at a slight angle to the spindle produced the necessary twist. The spun yarn was then wound onto the spindle by moving it so as to form a right angle with the spindle. This type of wheel, while known in Europe by the 14th century, was not in general use until later. The construction of the Great Wheel made it very good at creating long drawn soft fuzzy wools, but very difficult to create the strong smooth yarns needed to create warp for weaving. <b>Spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> ultimately did not develop the capability to spin a variety of yarns until the beginning of the 19th century and the mechanization of spinning.|$|R
50|$|While in India, Frydman {{became a}} disciple of Mahatma Gandhi {{and lived in}} his ashram, where he made the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> that Gandhi himself used. Frydman used his {{engineering}} skill to create several new types of <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> for Gandhi, which piqued his interest in finding the most efficient and economical <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> for India.|$|R
25|$|The <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was invented}} in India, between 500 and 1000 AD. The {{earliest}} clear illustrations of the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> come from the Islamic world in the eleventh century.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Spinning</b> <b>Wheel</b> {{was invented}} in India, between 500 and 1000 C.E. The {{earliest}} clear illustrations of the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> come from Baghdad (drawn in 1234), China (c. 1270) and Europe (c. 1280), and {{there is evidence that}} <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> had already come into use in both China [...] and the Islamic world during the eleventh century. In France the spindle and distaff were not displaced until the mid 18th century.|$|R
25|$|The {{spinning}} jenny, a multi-spool <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> invented c. 1764 by James Hargreaves, dramatically {{reduced the}} amount of work needed to produce yarn of high consistency, with a single worker able to work eight or more spools at once. At roughly the same time, Richard Arkwright and a team of craftsmen developed the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny. Too large to be operated by <b>hand,</b> a <b>spinning</b> frame powered by a waterwheel became the water frame.|$|R
50|$|Another folk {{tale that}} {{incorporates}} <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> {{is the classic}} fairy tale Sleeping Beauty, in which the main character pricks her hand or finger on the poisoned spindle of a <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> and falls {{into a deep sleep}} following a wicked fairy or witch's curse. Numerous variations of the tale exist (the Brothers Grimm had one in their collection entitled Little Briar Rose), and in only some of them is the spindle actually attached to/associated with a <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|Elvin {{says that}} cotton began {{replacing}} hemp {{as the main}} fiber crop shortly after the mechanical <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> was invented. Cotton produced far higher fiber yields per unit of land than hemp, and was thus far more profitable, so it largely replaced hemp. As hemp fibers are much longer than cotton fibers, existing mechanical <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> designed for hemp {{could not be used}} to spin cotton fibers without substantial mechanical modifications to the apparatus. Apparently, no such modifications were ever made. All spinning in China reverted to far less efficient hand-spinning, and the automatic <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> was forgotten. Elvin proposes several factors whose confluence prevented any further technical development of the automatic <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R

50|$|Louisa May Alcott, {{most famous}} {{as the author}} of Little Women, wrote a {{collection}} of short stories called Spinning-Wheel Stories, which were not about <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> but instead meant to be read while engaging in the rather tedious act of using a <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> {{increased}} {{the productivity of}} thread making {{by a factor of}} greater than 10.

5000|$|Chorkhi :- [...] "Chorkhi" [...] means <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel</b> in Kau Bru. The name owes {{itself to}} a Reang chief who was talking ill of his own daughter-in-law.

2500|$|In mediæval times, poor {{families}} {{had such a}} need for yarn {{to make their own}} cloth and clothes that practically all girls and unmarried women would keep busy spinning, and [...] "spinster" [...] became synonymous with an unmarried woman. Subsequent improvements with <b>spinning</b> <b>wheels</b> and then mechanical methods made hand-spinning increasingly uneconomic, but as late as the twentieth century hand-spinning remained widespread in poor countries: in conscious rejection of international industrialization, Gandhi was a notable practitioner. The <b>hand</b> <b>spinning</b> [...] movement that he initiated {{as a part of the}} Indian freedom struggle has made the handwoven cloth known as [...] "Khadi" [...] made from handspun cotton yarn world-famous. Women spinners of cotton yarn still continue to work to produce handspun yarn for the weaving of Khadi in Ponduru, a village in South India.|$|R
