40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to predict {{retention}} in residential rehabilitation (RR) services for drug users, focusing on service provider factors. A national postal survey of RR services in England and Wales was carried out and information was obtained from 57 of 87 services identified (65. 5 %). Service managers were asked to complete a questionnaire asking about treatment philosophy, treatments provided, staff characteristics and staffing levels, as well as overall service size and funding. Services also provided information on the number of clients admitted and the number who had completed, dropped out and been asked to leave in the past year. Completion rates varied widely, from 3 % to 92 %, with an average of 48 %. Higher completion rates were associated with lower counsellor caseloads, fewer beds, single rooms, shorter scheduled treatment durations, higher <b>fees</b> <b>per</b> <b>client</b> and provision of what could be termed a balanced treatment programme containing adequate amounts of individual counselling and programme-free time, and with only moderate demands for domestic duties. Programmes with more drug than alcohol users had lower completion rates, but the proportion of dual diagnosis or criminal justice referred clients did not appear to affect retention. Completion rates varied as a function of a number of service factors that are amenable to manipulation. To retain clients successfully, programmes should not be too large and should have adequate levels of therapeutic staff, a well-developed treatment schedule which is not too demanding for the client in terms of duties or overall time spent in structured activities, and which incorporates sufficient levels of individual counselling.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about typical service contact {{profiles}} and associated factors among clients with co-occuring mental health and substance use problems. Aim: Findings are reported from a 12 -month audit of clients presenting to regional (NSW, Australia) adult community mental health and drug and alchohol services. Method: Raw data for this service evaluation project were extracted from an electronic clinical information database, comprising 61, 062 community-based service contacts by 3344 clients (average age, 38. 7 years; 49. 8 % male). Results: Several broad care pathways were identified. Substance use problems were experienced by 25. 1 %, with higher rates among males and younger clients. This group accounted for 35. 4 % of annual community-based server contacts, with substantially higher rates among clients with opiate dependence (133 contacts <b>per</b> <b>client)</b> and those with comoroid psychosis (44 <b>per</b> <b>client),</b> compared to the typical dual diagnosis <b>client</b> (18 <b>per</b> <b>client).</b> Clients actively engaged with a specialised dual diagnosis service had half the rate of service contacts (9 <b>per</b> <b>client),</b> reflecting a mixture of client characteristics, group-based treatment programmes, and enhanced engagement strategies. Conclusions: Comorbidity and service contact profiles are highly variable across treatment settings, reinforcing the value routine of audits for identifying typical care pathways and targeting shared interventions...|$|R
