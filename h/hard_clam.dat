40|$|An area in Great South Bay, NY {{which has}} been closed to shellfishing {{on the basis of}} {{coliform}} bacteria standards was shown to have elevated levels of heavy metals in <b>hard</b> <b>clams,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, and sediments. Clams from this area were transplanted into the central portion of the Bay which is open to shellfishing. The behaviour of heavy metals in the transplanted clams was primarily affected by long-term trends based on seasonal fluctuations in the organisms. While these clams were being depurated of bacteria, no depuration of any heavy metal analysed (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) was noted over the 50 -day duration of this study. On the contrary, significant increases in the total body content of Cd, Ni, and Pb occurred.

As with all bivalve mollusks, they possess two valves or shells that are connected by a hinge. The pair of whitish/gray shells surrounds and protects a mantle, visceral mass and muscular foot. The elongate shells are relatively thin and brittle, leading to the name “softshell. ” Unlike <b>hard</b> <b>clams</b> and oysters, the softshell clam cannot close its shells completely, resulting in a gape most notable at the anterior and posterior ends.

40|$|Ecological {{epizootiology}} is {{the study}} of environmental influences on the health of animals including disease incidence, persistence and transmission. It is a conceptual approach that unifies molecular biology, environmental sciences, and epidemiology for the purpose of identifying causes, classifying risks, and controlling health problems. Ecological epizootiology has been successfully applied in terrestrial systems, but its adaptation to marine ecosystems is relatively new. My dissertation uses this approach to evaluate the role of marine aggregates (i. e., marine snow, organic aggregates, flocs) in the ecology of Quahog Parasite X (QPX), a disease of northern quahogs (=hard clam), Mercenaria mercenaria. Marine aggregates are a ubiquitous feature of aquatic ecosystems, but have no terrestrial counterpart. They have the potential to serve as a link between aquatic pathogens (e. g., QPX) and benthic hosts (e. g., <b>hard</b> <b>clams)</b> in two ways: (1) as environmental reservoirs for pathogens embedded in aggregates; and (2) as vectors for aggregate-bound pathogens transported between hosts. The results of this research include the descriptive epizootiology of QPX disease in <b>hard</b> <b>clams,</b> along with the first quantitative assay for the QPX organism, and data to support QPX as a facultative pathogen. Evidence that QPX is facultative is critical because it supports that once QPX is established in a location, eradication will be difficult because QPX is capable of surviving on environmental resources other than <b>hard</b> <b>clams.</b> In this research, marine aggregates were characterized using underwater video surveys coupled with direct collection of suspended aggregates in modified settling cones. The results provide a starting point for determining the temporal and spatial scales at which aggregates influence persistence and transmission of aquatic pathogens. Overall, these results have important implications for the way in which aquatic pathogens are collected, quantified, and monitored for water quality assessments in shallow-water ecosystems. ...|$|R

40|$|Hobbyist and {{researchers}} often use commercially available phytoplankton concentrates to maintain filter feeding organisms held in their ornamental or experimental tanks. This {{study investigated the}} nutritional value of 10 products available commercially for juvenile <b>hard</b> <b>clams,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria. Growth and mortality rates in clams fed these products were compared with those found in clams fed fresh cultures of the microalgae Isochrysis galbana, which is considered an industry standard for supporting growth of juvenile bivalves. Our results show a clear difference in feed nutritional value between non-living and living commercial diets, and among commercial diets advertised as containing live algae. Overall, results showed that juvenile <b>hard</b> <b>clams</b> fed fresh cultures of I. galbana displayed the best growth and lowest mortality rates, followed by those fed the commercial diet DT’s Live Marine Phytoplankton. Growth and mortality rates in unfed controls {{were similar to those}} found in clams fed commercial non-living algae mixes or diets advertised as containing live algae (Phyto-Feast Live product). Results also showed that the nutritional value of fresh algae (I. galbana) cultures is lost rapidly when cultures are maintained at 41 C, suggesting that algae present in some commercial diets may lose their nutritional value during processing or refrigerated storage. The commercial blend, DT’s Live Marine Phytoplankton, seems to represent a good substitute to lab grown algae for clams held in ornamental or experimental aquariums.
