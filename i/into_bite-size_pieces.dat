5000|$|The {{meal was}} {{originally}} developed by sailors who were often at sea for weeks, and even months, where few fresh ingredients {{were able to}} withstand such lengthy trips.

50|$|Indonesian {{meals are}} {{commonly}} eaten with {{the combination of}} a spoon in the right hand and fork in the left hand (to push the food onto the spoon).

Although, {{in many parts of the}} country, such as West Java and West Sumatra, it is also common to eat with one's bare hands. In restaurants or households that commonly use bare hands to eat, such as seafood food stalls, traditional Sundanese and Minangkabau restaurants, or East Javanese pecel lele (fried catfish with sambal) and ayam goreng (fried chicken) food stalls, kobokan is usually served along with the food. Kobokan is a bowl of tap water with a slice of lime in it to give a fresh scent, this bowl of water is not intended for consumption, rather it is used to wash one's hand before and after eating. Eating with chopsticks is generally only found in food stalls or restaurants serving Indonesian adaptations of Chinese cuisine, such as bakmie or mie ayam (chicken noodle) with pangsit (wonton), mie goreng (fried noodles), and kwetiau goreng (fried flat rice noodles).|$|E
