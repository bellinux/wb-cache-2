50|$|Like the London self-portrait, the {{painting}} is dominated by black and dark brown hues, with red overtones. De Leeuw {{is presented as a}} serious young man with a rather intense gaze. He is wearing a black chaperon and black <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> <b>jacket.</b> He turns to look at the viewer while holding a gold ring band with a red jewel, a symbol of his profession, although some have suggested that it might indicate a recent marriage engagement, or even, given his direct gaze, that the painted is meant for his intended.|$|E
500|$|Nomura's {{design of}} Squall {{included}} <b>fur</b> <b>lining</b> along his <b>jacket</b> collar {{as a challenge}} for the game's full motion video designers. In Final Fantasy VIII Nojima worked to give players insight into what Squall was thinking, in contrast to Final Fantasy VII (which encouraged players to speculate). In retrospective, Nojima believes the staff made him particularly [...] "cool". Across the video game it is implied that the character of Laguna Loire is Squall's father. However, Square Enix never confirmed it. Nomura designed Squall to contrast with Laguna.|$|R
5000|$|The man {{is shown}} in three-quarters view with his face {{dramatically}} lit by light falling from the left. This device provides both striking contrasts {{of light and shadow}} and draws the viewer's attention on to the man's face. He has brown eyes, and while his expression is impassive there are traces of melancholy, especially in the down-turn of his mouth. He is obviously a member of the nobility, being very well dressed in a <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> brown <b>jacket</b> over a black undervest. His headdress, a chaperon, contains two wings which hang down over the man's shoulders and extend to his chest. The edges of the cloth are given a shredded look at the edges of their trains. The hood is brightly and dramatically coloured using pigment extracted from the expensive lapis lazuli gemstone to give it its bright, intense hue. The headdress is of a similar but less extravagant type to that seen in van Eyck's c. 1433 Portrait of a Man, and worn by a figure in the distance in his c. 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin. This type of headdress was to go out of fashion by the mid 1430s, conveniently and definitively dating the painting as having been completed before then.|$|R
50|$|The open {{airplane}} {{was used}} for patrol purposes on floats {{in the summer and}} skis in the winter. For the latter MacDougall had <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> pants up to his armpits, <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> boots, <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> helmet, <b>fur</b> trimmed goggles and his mitts were also <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> up to his elbows. He would return from a winter trip in this gear shivering with cold but the poaching trade took a sharp decline. Around 1939 he finally acquired a closed cabin airplane, the Stinson Reliant SR-10, and this served for many years until, during a routine maintenance, serious corrosion problems were discovered and the plane had to be retired.|$|R

50|$|Portrait of a Man with Carnation {{is a small}} oil on oakwood {{painting}} usually {{attributed to}} the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, {{or a member of}} his workshop. Based on dendrochronological examination of the wood, it is thought to have been completed relatively late in van Eycks career, perhaps around 1436. It is now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. The sitter wears a large grey <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> hat, and grey clothes, <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> at the neck. holds a small bunch of carnations, symbols of marriage. He has not been identified, but wears the medal of the Order of Saint Anthony, established by Albert I, Duke of Bavaria. The man is older, probably in his early 50s, and has a coarse, rough look, which the artist does not shy from depicting.|$|R
50|$|A pelisse was {{originally}} a short <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> or <b>fur</b> trimmed <b>jacket</b> that was usually worn hanging loose over the left shoulder of hussar light cavalry soldiers, ostensibly to prevent sword cuts. The name was also {{applied to a}} fashionable style of woman's coat worn in the early 19th century.|$|R
50|$|When Welles did The Black Rose in 1950 {{he insisted}} that the coat his character, Bayan, wore be lined with mink, even though {{it would not be}} visible.

From his shoulders depended a short cape of white <b>fur</b> <b>lined</b> with brilliant scarlet silk.|$|R

50|$|The first {{appearance}} of a modern Santa Claus, complete with what we {{consider to be the}} Santa suit was in drawings by Thomas Nast.

50|$|The rarest find {{from these}} sacrifices is a {{complete}} coat of mail armor. Reconstruction shows it to have had 20-23,000 rings and weighed just under 10 kg. Perhaps even more interesting are the scabbards. A number have been recovered. Two of the more decorative from Nydam, one from the third century and one from the fifth had <b>fur</b> <b>lining</b> on the inside. We can reasonably speculate that this fur was oily and designed to keep the blade absolutely free from rust. The further speculation is that a pristine appearance of the blade would only have been so highly valued for pattern-welded blades.|$|R
