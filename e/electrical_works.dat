Waves damaged wharves and capsized several {{vessels in the}} harbor. Some areas {{on the south side}} of the island were left completely devoid of crops. Although the western areas of Jamaica were not as devastated as other portions of the island, some banana plantations there were partially destroyed and there was a loss to orange and coffee crops. Throughout Jamaica, devastation to the banana crop was [...] "complete", forcing many growers into bankruptcy. It was estimated that the fruit trade would be paralyzed for as much as a year. Damage reached $10million and there were at least 65deaths, while other reports indicate as many as 90fatalities.|$|E

60|$|If Tivoli {{does not}} {{flourish}} so frankly on its oil as Frascati on its wine, {{it is perhaps}} because it has of late years tacitly prospered as much on the electricity which its wonderful and beautiful waterfalls enable it to furnish as abundantly to Rome as our own Niagara to Buffalo. The scrupulous Hare, whose Walks in Rome include Tivoli, does not, indeed, advise you to visit the <b>electrical</b> <b>works,</b> {{but he says that}} if you have not strength enough for all the interests and attractions of Tivoli it will be wise to give yourself entirely to the cascades and to the Villa d'Este, and this was what we instinctively did, but in the reverse order. Chance rewarded us before we left the villa with a sight of the electric plant, which just below the villa walls smokes industriously away with a round, redbrick chimney almost as lofty and as ugly as some chimney in America. On our way to and fro we necessarily passed through the town, which, with its widish but not straightish chief street, I found as clean as Rome itself, and looking, after the long tumult of its history, beginning well back in fable, as peaceable as Montclair, New Jersey. It had its charm, and, if I could have spent two weeks there instead of two hours, I might impart its effect in much more circumstance than I can now promise the reader. Most of my little time I gladly gave to the villa, which, with the manifold classic associations of the region, attracts the stranger and helps the cataracts sum up all that most people can keep of Tivoli.|$|E
40|$|Working with {{electricity}} causes injuries and deaths {{around the world}} every year. At the same time, the employers {{are more interested in}} their employee’s safety at work. The purpose of this thesis is to create a base to <b>electrical</b> safety in <b>work</b> instruction leaning strongly on existing standards. This electrical safety instruction is made to reduce injuries and possible deaths, as well as to improve overall electrical safety in all Motors and Generators business units around the world. In this thesis <b>electrical</b> <b>work</b> is thought to mean <b>electrical</b> <b>work</b> and testing related to manufacturing motors and generators. This thesis discusses the path of <b>electrical</b> <b>work</b> from need to do <b>electrical</b> <b>work</b> to completion of the work. This chain begins with a risk assessment, which is used to identify potential hazards associated with the work. By using this information it is possible to create work instructions and measurement plans. Needed tools and work place can be found with the help of these instructions. <b>Electrical</b> <b>work</b> cannot be carried out without working people, so organization around <b>electrical</b> <b>work</b> is reviewed from employee level to management level not forgetting responsibilities and tasks including to every level. All the levels have their own significances and all these levels should work conveniently together to ensure safety in work...|$|R

6000|$|And {{while the}} New Republic is thus {{developing}} its idea of itself and organizing its mind, {{it will also}} be growing out of the confused and intricate businesses and undertakings and public services of the present time, into a recognizable material body. The synthetic process that {{is going on in the}} case of many of the larger of the businesses of the world, that formation of Trusts that bulks so large in American discussion, is of the utmost significance in this connection. Conceivably the first impulse to form Trusts came from a mere desire to control competition and economize working expenses, but even in its very first stages this process of coalescence has passed out of the region of commercial operations into that of public affairs. The Trust develops into the organization under men far more capable than any sort of public officials, of entire industries, of entire departments of public life, quite outside the ostensible democratic government system altogether. The whole apparatus of communications, which we have seen to be of such primary importance in the making of the future, promises to pass, in the case of the United States at least, out of the region of scramble into the domain of deliberate control. Even to-day the Trusts are taking over quite consciously the most vital national matters. The American iron and steel industries have been drawn together and developed in a manner that is a necessary preliminary to the capture of the empire of the seas. That end is declaredly within the vista of these operations, within their initial design. These things are not the work of dividend-hunting imbeciles, but of men who regard wealth as a convention, as a means to spacious material ends. There is an animated little paper published in Los Angeles in the interests of Mr. Wilshire, which bears upon its forefront the maxim, [...] "Let the Nation own the Trusts." [...] Well, under their mantle of property, the Trusts grow continually more elaborate and efficient machines of production and public service, while the formal nation chooses its bosses and buttons and reads its illustrated press. I must confess I do not see the negro and the poor Irishman and all the emigrant sweepings of Europe, which constitute the bulk of the American Abyss, uniting to form that great Socialist party of which Mr. Wilshire dreams, and with a little demonstrating and balloting taking over the foundry and the <b>electrical</b> <b>works,</b> the engine shed and the signal box, from the capable men in charge. But that a confluent system of Trust-owned business organisms, and of Universities and re-organized military and naval services may presently discover an essential unity of purpose, presently begin thinking a literature, and behaving like a State, is a much more possible thing....|$|E
