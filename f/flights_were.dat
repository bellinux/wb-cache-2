5|$|Blizzard {{conditions}} were reported across {{most of the}} Midwest from Illinois to Ohio. Numerous <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> canceled due to the snow and ice across various airports including in Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal, Kansas City, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cleveland, Boston and Cincinnati. 900 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.|$|E
5|$|All <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{based at}} Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. For the summer routes of 1999, Color Air {{operated}} four daily round trips to Ålesund Airport, Vigra, and five daily round trips to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Trondheim Airport, Værnes. In addition, {{there was a}} single daily round trip to London Stansted Airport, and a weekly round trip to Alicante Airport. From each domestic destination, <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> made to correspond with the Color Line cruiseferries departing from Oslo to Kiel, Germany, and Hirtshals, Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Since March 27, 2011, all of JAL Express <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> {{operated}} as JAL flights, {{with full}} merger {{of the two}} carriers by September 2014.|$|E
5000|$|...Notes: <b>Flights</b> <b>are</b> routed Keflavik-Bergen-Stavanger-Keflavik. <b>Flights</b> <b>are</b> routed Stavanger-Sandefjord-Copenhagen. This <b>is</b> why the <b>flight</b> {{departs from}} the {{domestic}} terminal.|$|R
50|$|When {{the fourth}} <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> first {{announced}} in August 2008, {{shortly after the}} third <b>flight</b> failed, it <b>was</b> planned for launch in September. The rocket {{that was used to}} conduct the test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> originally built to launch the RazakSAT satellite. The test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> introduced into the launch schedule because Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd (ATSB) required a successful <b>flight</b> to <b>be</b> conducted before RazakSAT could be launched.|$|R
50|$|Commercial <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> not {{currently}} available to Joseph. The nearest commercial <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> at the Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton.|$|R
5|$|Soon {{after the}} earthquake, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered a ground stop along the East Coast, causing some flight delays. The Air Traffic Control tower at John F. Kennedy International Airport was evacuated. <b>Flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed at several airports, {{including}} John F. Kennedy International Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Dulles International Airport, and Philadelphia International Airport. At Ronald Reagan National Airport, ceiling tiles fell in one terminal, and <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> halted.|$|E
5|$|Ava {{was given}} the most {{advanced}} measurement and reconnaissance available at the time. Recon <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> conducted and meteorological equipment was tested. The hurricane was also photographed from space by satellites and Skylab astronauts.|$|E
5|$|By September5, or {{two days}} after the hurricane's landfall, floods were {{receding}} across Honduras, and <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> restored to the Bay Islands. Floods receded a day later in Guatemala and not until September9 in El Salvador.|$|E
40|$|Wind velocity, light intensity, soil temperature, vapor {{pressure}} {{deficit in the}} colony, {{vapor pressure}} deficit at {{the surface of the}} flight slits, and vapor pressure deficit at 1 m above the soil were measured during the swarming season. The vapor pressure deficits and soil temperature were not critical factors for <b>flight</b> since they <b>were</b> in a favorable range during the observation period. Light intensity had to drop to 10. 8 lumen/m 2 before <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> initiated. <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> terminated when the light was reduced to 0. 14 lumen/m 2. Light intensity, however, was not limiting since the intensity dropped every evening. The key microenvironmental factor regulating <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> the wind velocity at the <b>flight</b> slits. <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> initiated if the wind velocity was below 3. 7 km/h. If the wind increased to over 3. 7 km/h after <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> started, <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> terminated...|$|R
40|$|The first <b>flight</b> (47) <b>was</b> for Will's {{baseline}} controller validation with Thor using varying doublet {{patterns in}} the pitch and roll axes. This <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> used to compare to simulation data for the same inputs. This <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> completely closed-loop. The data looked very good, so an additional <b>flight</b> test <b>was</b> not needed. The software used for this <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> branches/WayPointTrack/Software/FlightCode rev 851.

5|$|Concorde was {{normally}} {{perceived as}} a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by other flight or ship) charter <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.|$|E
5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, unlike the YF-23, weapon firings and high (60°) {{angle of attack}} (AoA, or high-Alpha) <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> carried out on the YF-22. Though not a requirement, the {{aircraft}} fired AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles from internal weapon bays. Flight testing also demonstrated that the YF-22 with its thrust vectoring nozzles achieved pitch rates more than double that of the F-16 at low-speed maneuvering. The first prototype, PAV-1, achieved Mach1.58 in supercruise, while PAV-2 reached a maximum supercruise speed of Mach1.43; maximum speed was in excess of Mach 2.0. Flight testing continued until 28December1990, by which time 74 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> completed and 91.6 airborne hours were accumulated. Following flight testing, the contractor teams submitted proposals for ATF production.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the {{government}} opened {{the service to}} private tour operators for the first time. The initial private <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> plagued with delays, with both outgoing and return flights postponed {{for as long as}} nine days, which caused the Bangladesh government to return the Hajj flights' monopoly to Biman.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> {{exempted}} from regulation. For instance time-critical flights carrying human organs for organ transplantation. If such <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> scheduled, regular traffic will be delayed instead.|$|R
50|$|North Eastern Province {{is served}} by the Wajir Airport. It handles about seven flights per day. As of September 2012, civil <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> offered twice a week by Echo. Most <b>flights,</b> however, <b>are</b> cargo. Some charter and {{military}} <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> additionally accommodated.|$|R
50|$|All 61 {{passengers}} and 7 {{crew of the}} Iberia <b>flight</b> <b>were</b> killed including Michael Jeffery, the former manager of Jimi Hendrix. No-one aboard the Spantax <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> harmed.|$|R
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, Cuban {{officials}} forced about 36,000 residents to evacuate from low-lying areas, along with 35,000 livestock. All <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> canceled {{in and out of}} Havana during the storm's passage. Many classes were canceled in the region, and workers took steps to minimize damage to the tobacco crop.|$|E
5|$|In the {{six years}} after Beulah, no {{seedings}} were conducted for several different reasons. In 1964, measurement and observation equipment {{was not ready to}} be used. The year after that, all <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> used for additional experimentation in non-hurricane clouds.|$|E
5|$|On 13 October 2017, Cebu Pacific Air Flight 461 (registration RP-C3237) overran {{the runway}} on landing after {{a flight from}} Ninoy Aquino International Airport. All 180 {{passengers}} plus the crew safely evacuated the aircraft. All <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> diverted in Roxas Airport.|$|E
50|$|Valuair <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> {{operated}} by Jetstar Asia crew, with the in-flight menu and entertainment {{virtually the same}} as Jetstar Asia's. Sometimes, JetStar <b>flights</b> <b>are</b> used with Valuair aircraft.|$|R
50|$|No. 4 Forward Air Control <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> a Royal Australian Air Force forward {{air control}} {{training}} unit. The <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> formed on 1 April 1970 at RAAF Base Williamtown and {{was equipped with}} four CAC Winjeel aircraft. The <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> responsible for training RAAF, Royal Australian Navy and Australian Army pilots and participated in most Australian military exercises. No. 4 Forward Air Control <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> disbanded on 1 January 1989 and became 'C' Flight of the newly reformed No. 76 Squadron. No. 4 Squadron is the RAAF's current forward air control unit.|$|R

5|$|Over {{a period}} of six months, a total of 24 test <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> conducted. Most of the complex {{electronics}} were not fitted to the first aircraft, so these <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> all concerned with the basic flying qualities of the aircraft which, according to the test pilots involved, were outstanding. Speeds of Mach 1.12 and sustained low-level flights down to 200ft (above the Pennines) were achieved. Undercarriage vibration problems continued, however, and only in the final few flights, when XR219 was fitted with additional tie-struts on the already complex landing gear, was there {{a significant reduction in}} them. The last test flight took place on 31 March 1965.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, around 10provinces, {{including}} most of Luzon, was placed under a typhoon alert. However, many fisherman ignored the alerts {{and refused to}} flee to higher ground. Furthermore, Philippine Air Lines cancelled 21domestic flights and three international flights. Numerous other <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> delayed. Local authorities also suspended school classes.|$|E
5|$|The 1970 and 1971 seasons {{provided}} no suitable seeding candidates. Despite this, <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> conducted into Hurricane Ginger. Ginger {{was not a}} suitable storm for seeding, due to its diffuse, indistinct nature. The seeding had no effect. Ginger was the last seeding done by Project Stormfury.|$|E
50|$|The Governor-General's <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> a Royal Australian Air Force {{transport}} unit. The Governor-General's <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> {{formed at}} RAAF Station Canberra on 4 April 1945. The unit {{was equipped with}} an Avro York named 'Endeavour', an Avro Anson and a Percival Proctor. Although the Flight initially only provided transport for the Governor-General of Australia its role was later expanded to include carrying the Prime Minister and other dignitaries. The Governor-General's <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> disbanded on 10 July 1947 and No. 1 Communication Unit assumed responsibility for VIP transport. The <b>Flight</b> <b>was</b> re-raised on 1 July 1948 equipped with a B-24 Liberator and a Dakota.

5|$|Tropical storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, {{and from the}} Jupiter Inlet coast southward to Cape Sable on September28. A tropical storm watch was {{in place for the}} mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet and north of East Cape Sable to Chokoloskee. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next day, after a direct impact was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, and Monroe counties into September30. An airport weather warning was issued for Orlando International Airport and Executive Airport on September 28; arriving <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight Southwest Airlines <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> diverted to the airports of Tampa and Jacksonville, and one JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach. Though airport officials later reported normalized conditions, an additional 26 <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> canceled at Miami International Airport the next day.|$|E
5|$|After Betsy, {{two other}} hurricanes {{came close to}} being seeded. Hurricane Faith was {{considered}} a likely candidate, but it stayed {{out of range of}} the seeding planes. That same year, recon <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> conducted into Hurricane Inez, but there were no seedings. Both the 1967 and 1968 seasons were inactive. Because of that, there were no suitable seeding targets in either of those two seasons.|$|E
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident {{that some of}} the other inbound <b>flights</b> <b>were</b> performing missed approaches, as they had been unable to complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|E
