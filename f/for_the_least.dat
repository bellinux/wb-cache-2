5|$|In {{addition}} to winning more Super Rugby titles {{than any other}} team, the franchise also holds several competition records, including most points in a game and most tries in a game, both achieved in their 96–19 victory over the Waratahs in 2002. Ironically the Crusaders also hold the record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> points scored in a game when they were defeated by the Highlanders 6–0 in 2009. They have also scored the most points (541) and most tries (71) in one season, both achieved in 2005.|$|E

The first of these records was first surpassed by Dark of the Moon {{and the other two}} by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. After 46 days in theaters (July 2, 2011), it became the eighth film in cinema history and the fourth film released by Walt Disney Studios to cross the $1-billion-mark. It set a record for the fastest Disney-distributed film to reach the milestone (first surpassed by Marvel's The Avengers) and it is the fifth-fastest film overall to achieve this.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 15head coaches for the Capitals franchise. The franchise's first head coach was Jim Anderson, who coached {{for less than}} a season. Bryan Murray is the franchise's all-time leader for the most regular-season games coached (672), the most regular-season game wins (343), the most regular-season points (769), the most playoff games coached (53), and the most playoff-game wins (24). Murray's brother, Terry, has also coached the Capitals, right after his brother Bryan. Roger Crozier, who only coached one game for the Capitals, is the franchise's all-time leader <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> regular-season game points (0). Ron Wilson is the only coach to win the Prince of Wales Trophy with the Capitals, but lost the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals against the Detroit Red Wings. Bryan Murray and Bruce Boudreau are the only Capitals coaches to have won the Jack Adams Award. None of the Capitals coaches have been elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a builder. Anderson, Danny Belisle, Gary Green, Crozier, Bruce Cassidy, Glen Hanlon, Dale Hunter and Adam Oates have spent their entire NHL head {{coaching}} careers with the Capitals.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the 2010 Pacific {{hurricane}} season, which tied 1977 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> active {{year in the}} reliable records, the 2010 Atlantic {{hurricane season}} ended {{as one of the}} most active in recorded history. It began on June1 and ended on November30, dates that conventionally delimit the period during each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean. The first system of the season, Hurricane Alex, developed on June25; the final system of the season, Hurricane Tomas, dissipated on November7. A total of 21 tropical depressions formed within the basin, of which 19 intensified into tropical storms, 12 intensified into hurricanes, and 5 further intensified into major hurricanes. The season's 19 tropical storms tied with previous years 1887 and 1995, as well as subsequent years 2011 and 2012, for the third highest count on record; only 2005 and 1933 featured more activity. The year's 12 hurricanes matched 1969 for the second highest count on record, exceeded only by 2005. There were more tropical storms in the Atlantic than the West Pacific in 2010, the second such occurrence on record after 2005. Throughout the entire Atlantic tropical cyclone database, 2010 is the only year with more than 10 hurricanes not to feature a hurricane landfall on the United States.|$|E

25|$|Stellar {{evolution}} {{is the process}} by which a star changes over the course of time. Depending on the mass of the star, its lifetime can range from a few million years for the most massive to trillions of years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> massive, which is considerably longer than the age of the universe. The table shows the lifetimes of stars as a function of their masses. All stars are born from collapsing clouds of gas and dust, often called nebulae or molecular clouds. Over the course of millions of years, these protostars settle down into a state of equilibrium, becoming what is known as a main-sequence star.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} web {{theory was}} {{based on the idea that}} the economic strength of an industrial nation is composed of interdependent sectors such as manufacturing, mining, utilities and transportation. Any one of the sectors could be targeted with bombs to make the whole system suffer breakdowns and shortages. From 1935, instructors such as Robert M. Webster and Muir S. Fairchild at ACTS studied the industrial interdependence of the United States as a model for targeting an aggressor enemy state. They drew up lists of optimal targets that would produce the greatest disruption <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> expenditure of bombs. Transportation and electric power industries were seen as vital targets, as well as iron ore mining and steel manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|BR {{adopted a}} {{slightly}} {{modified version of}} the LMS classification system, itself based on the Midland Railway's system. Each locomotive class was given a number 0–9 that signified its power, 0 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> powerful and 9 for the most, with a suffix of F or P, indicating freight and passenger roles respectively. Freight power ranged from 0–9, passenger from 0–8. Many locomotives were used for both roles, in which case they were given two class numbers, the P-rating first e.g. 3P4F or 6P5F. A slight change from the LMS system saw those where the freight classification (x) equalled the passenger classification (also x) reclassified as xMT, MT standing for mixed traffic, e.g. for the LMS Black Five locomotives, LMS 5P5F became BR 5MT. Mixed traffic locos had power in the range of classes 2–6.|$|E

25|$|Cultural {{resources}} management has, however, been criticized. CRM {{is conducted}} by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining {{the work to}} be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>least</b> funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.|$|E
