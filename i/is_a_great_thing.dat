500|$|In {{the years}} after the 1918 Armistice, Pankhurst {{continued}} to promote her nationalist vision of British unity. She maintained a focus on women's empowerment, but her days of fighting with government officialdom were over. She defended the presence and reach of the British Empire: [...] "Some talk about the Empire and Imperialism {{as if it were}} something to decry and something to be ashamed of. t <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to be the inheritors of an Empire like ours... great in territory, great in potential wealth.... If we can only realise and use that potential wealth we can destroy thereby poverty, we can remove and destroy ignorance." [...] For years she travelled around England and North America, rallying support for the British Empire and warning audiences about the dangers of Bolshevism.|$|E
500|$|On March 20, they sailed {{first to}} England, where Crane was warmly received. [...] They arrived in Athens in early April; between April 17 (when Turkey {{declared}} war on Greece) and April 22, Crane wrote his first published report of the war, [...] "An Impression of the 'Concert'". [...] When he left for Epirus in the northwest, Taylor remained in Athens, where she became the Greek war's first woman war correspondent. [...] She wrote under the pseudonym [...] "Imogene Carter" [...] for the New York Journal, a job that Crane had secured for her. [...] They wrote frequently, traveling throughout the country separately and together. [...] The first large battle that Crane witnessed was the Turks' assault on General Constantine Smolenski's Greek forces at Velestino. [...] Crane wrote, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to survey {{the army of the}} enemy. [...] Just where and how it takes hold upon the heart is difficult of description." [...] During this battle, Crane encountered [...] "a fat waddling puppy" [...] that he immediately claimed, dubbing it [...] "Velestino, the Journal dog". Greece and Turkey signed an armistice on May 20, ending the 30-day war; Crane and Taylor left Greece for England, taking two Greek brothers as servants and Velestino the dog with them.|$|E
500|$|Before Megan Mullally {{was given}} the role of Karen, she had {{previously}} been cast as a series regular on sitcoms such as The Ellen Burstyn Show, My Life and Times, and Rachel Gunn. Mullally guest starred on many other shows, including Ned & Stacey, on which she first worked with Messing. Mullally informed her agent {{that she did not}} want to do any more sitcoms or auditions for sitcoms, during the time that Will & Grace came around. [...] "Because my feeling was, like, Look, I've done it. It's not clicking. It's not for me. But he [...] was always arguing the point that the right thing hadn't come along yet." [...] She initially auditioned for the role of Grace, but admitted that {{she did not want to}} audition for the part of Karen. When asked about Karen's voice, Mullally revealed that the voice was an [...] "instinctive thing". She also said, [...] "...I think it was just a feeling that I had that it would be better for the pace of the show and it would be funnier in some way, but I didn't know why. Karen has a lot of joy, even when she's in a bad mood. She's pretty much happy with who she is, and that is something I think <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to play, because the character of Karen could have been very unlikeable, and I think she's likeable because she has joy and she can be very childlike." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{his group}} escapes from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Jenner whispers to Rick about {{the virus that}} has caused the zombie apocalypse. Initially there was no {{indication}} as to what Jenner said to him; the dialogue was previously inserted into the episode's script but was later removed. [...] "I'm so pleased they didn't reveal it," [...] said Andrew Lincoln, [...] "because it was scripted, and extremely powerful, and I said to everyone, 'Burn this page: No one should know apart from Rick and Frank.' It's brilliant that they left it —it's perfect, it's so classy." [...] Kirkman was content with the idea of teasing Jenner's revelation in lieu of blatantly revealing anything about the origins of the virus. [...] "I {{thought it was a great}} addition. I'm very much opposed to showing what the actual cause [...] is and explaining how things work, but teasing a little bit <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing.</b> If it adds an extra layer to the drama, then I'm all for it," [...] he stated. [...] "It also led up to the fantastic mystery of the whisper Jenner gives to Rick at the end of that scene. That's going to play into Season 2 quite a bit. I know where that's going and it's really a cool bit." [...] It is not until the second season finale, [...] "Beside the Dying Fire", that Rick reveals Jenner's message to the group.|$|E

2500|$|I soon {{got used}} to this singing; for the sailors never touched a rope without it. Sometimes, when no one {{happened}} to strike up, and the pulling, whatever it might be, {{did not seem to}} be getting forward very well, the mate would always say, [...] "Come, men, can't any of you sing? Sing now, and raise the dead." [...] And then some one of them would begin, and if every man's arms were as much relieved as mine by the song, and he could pull as much better as I did, with such a cheering accompaniment, I am sure the song was well worth the breath expended on it. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> in a sailor to know how to sing well, for he gets a great name by it from the officers, and a good deal of popularity among his shipmates. Some sea-captains, before shipping a man, always ask him whether he can sing out at a rope.|$|E

We of course had Chinese to wait on us here". Vernon introduced several improvements, including a series of [...] "Elite Dinners" [...] accompanied by the Shanghai Municipal Symphony. Vernon added a suite of eighteen bedrooms and saloons to the Hotel. In 1901 the first telephones were installed in Shanghai, with the Astor House having the first telephone used. In the first Yellow Pages telephone directory published in Shanghai, its number was [...] "200". The North-China Herald praised the Astor House Hotel in January 1902: [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> that we have at last in Shanghai a hotel which is a credit to the place, and whose vast improvement has stimulated its rivals to renewed efforts to satisfy the travelling and homeless public".

To be given the freedom to {{represent}} a moment in our cultural and social zeitgeist—she has left a great imprint on me. I will miss her. May we meet again." [...] While at Paleyfest 2016 promoting Fear the Walking Dead, she addressed Lexa's death publicly for the first time. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>thing</b> to pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And I hate that people feel like that. That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted." [...] At her second Q panel weekend at Copenhagen Comic-Con, she said, [...] "It saddens me to think that this was an event that tarnished the show." ...|$|E
