40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} linear off-diagonal MIMO can-celler (ODMC) that aims at mitigating the upstream self <b>far-end</b> <b>cross-talk</b> (FEXT) that severely impacts {{the performance of}} very high speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) services at the central office (CO). The ODMC operates per frequency and is thus well suited for DMT-based VDSL systems. We in-troduce a low complexity and low latency adaptive algorithm that converges towards the optimum ODMC that simultane-ously maximizes the distributed Shannon capacities of the upstream links, under mild assumptions for nominal VDSL systems. The adaptive algorithm does not require any matrix inversion and is designed to learn and engage the ODMC seamlessly while operating in data mode. Further, we prove that the optimum ODMC approximately achieves FEXT-free capacity. Simulations show that the FEXT-free capacity can be achieved in roughly 200 iterations. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{low-power}} receiver that supports high data rates over bandwidth-limited and coupled links. The receiver employs a half-rate 2 -tap speculative DFE architecture with a <b>far-end</b> <b>cross-talk</b> (FEXT) cancellation technique. Figure 25. 6. 1 shows the top-level architecture of the DFE receiver. Conventionally, analog taps of the equalizer are implemented using current mode summers, thus the power consumption of the DFE increases proportion ally {{with the number of}} taps. In the proposed architecture, a switched-capacitor S/H is employed to sample the input signal and combine it with the feedback coefficients at the front-end of the receiver, as shown in Fig. 25. 6. 2 (S/H/summer). In this design, the switched-capacitor network is modified to support two taps of DFE without any signal loss. This technique can be further extended to realize more number of taps. The extra power due to sampling capacitors, switches and voltage-mode DACs is very small...|$|E
