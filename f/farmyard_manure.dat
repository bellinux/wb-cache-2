40|$|Thesis (MSc (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. As {{with any}} form of {{intensive}} agriculture, there are potential environmental impacts associated with the management and housing of livestock on dairy farms. Within the field of dairy farming, particular focus falls {{to the issue of}} environmental degradation of water resources, as this form of pollution is currently a major environmental issue around the world. Conventional agricultural practices involving the application of chemical fertilizers to land and crops are causing environmental problems as a result of poor management practices. Dairy wastewater and manures could however be a valuable resource for agricultural producers {{in the form of an}} alternate fertilizer for their crops. Waste application as a fertilizer is more environmentally friendly than chemical fertilizers, and could drastically reduce costs for farmers, whilst alleviating storage and management problems often associated with <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> (FYM). The application of organic wastes, notably livestock manures, to land has historically been important for maintaining soil fertility on farms in terms of nutrient status and organic matter levels, as well as helping to reduce soil erosion and improve waterholding capacity. The research sought to investigate the environmental and economical feasibility of using dairy wastewater and manures as an alternative form of fertilizer within agriculture in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|A common {{practice}} in stockless organic farming systems is to leave the biomass from clover/grass-ley and crop residues {{in the field for}} their residual fertility effect. No <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> for transfer of nutrients within the system are available. Clover/grass-ley biomass and crop residues represents an unexploited energy potential that could be harnessed by the digestion in biogas plants for production of methane, thus replacing ruminants by the biogas digester. In field trials by implementing a whole crop rotation comprehending six crops were carried out in 2002 - 2005 to evaluate whether the use of N could be improved by processing biomass described above in a biogas digester and using the effluents as a fertilizer, compared to general practice. Results indicate that digestion of crop residues resulted in more efficient manuring systems, not only by the implementation of an additional “product” (power energy), but also by getting more efficient cropping systems with higher DM and N yields of most of the non-legume crops, combined with a reduction of N losses due to denitrification and a reduction of the nitrate leaching risk. The causes were a better and more evenly allocation of nutrients within the whole crop rotation, a higher N input via N 2 fixation, lower N losses and probably a higher N availability of digested in comparison to the same amounts of nutrients in undigested organic manures. ...|$|R
40|$|In Vietnam, sandy {{soils are}} {{distributed}} {{mainly in the}} coastal central provinces where they occupy 337, 768 ha comprising 63 % of the nation’s sandy soils, and they are also important to regional economic growth where more than 10 million people are living i. e. 14 % of the Vietnamese population. The sandy materials in the central coastal Vietnam originate from mostly in situ weathering of granite although aeolian sediments are parent materials for sandy soils also. Sandy soils have {{a wide range of}} limiting factors for agricultural production, including nutrient deficiencies, acidity, low water holding capacity and wind erosion risk (on coastal dunal sands). Although there are soil fertility constraints to the use of sandy soils in Vietnam, 79, 076 ha has been utilized in agriculture. Developing integrated nutrient management practices are needed to improve soil physical, chemical and biological fertilities of sandy soils.

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{identified}} reasons for declining agriculture sustainability is poor soil condition due to reduced application of organic matter into the farms and non-conservational practices that majorly disturb top soils (Kibblewhite et al. 2008; Hobbs et al. 2008). Huge volume of agricultural wastes in farmer’s fields has economic and environmental benefits {{as suggested by the}} studies on pyrolysis and biochar of rice straw, corn stover, orchard, and animal wastes (Kung et al. 2015). Crop wastes blended with the cow dung for biogas production after anaerobic digestion using anaerobic bacteria (acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria) generate electricity through potential technologies (Muthu et al. 2017). The product of anaerobic digestion after waste treatment or the digestate remains can add value through decomposition. Prominent microbial community dynamics was observed when the anaerobic digestate from the municipal food residues, and green and kitchen wastes were composted under natural composting conditions (Franke-Whittle et al. 2014). Understanding on microbial dynamics during different phases of composting helped better control of bio-oxidative processes followed by stabilization and maturation phases that use specific technology in static reactor of high capacity (up to 600  L or more) (Villar et al. 2016). Studies have opened new avenues for better utilization of anaerobic digestate after improved composting using beneficial microorganisms, the products of which could be directly utilized in the farms for improving soil organic content (Zeng et al. 2016). Such composts proved to be good alternatives of <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> for field application.|$|R

Soil amendments had a significant impact on disease and yield. A real-time PCR assay was used to detect and quantify P. infestans in tubers. The level of pathogen DNA was greatest in tubers from highest yielding plots that received combinations of inorganic nitrogenous and mineral fertilizers and least in tubers from plots with organic <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> or non-nitrogenous mineral fertilizers.

However, diffuse sources of pollution, such as leaching or runoff of nutrients from agricultural fields, and micro-point sources including <b>farmyards,</b> <b>manure</b> heaps and septic tank sewerage systems, particularly systems without soil adsorption beds, are now hypothesised to contribute {{a significant proportion of}} the nutrients delivered to surface watercourses.

50|$|Most {{animal manure}} {{consists}} of feces. Common forms of animal manure include <b>farmyard</b> <b>manure</b> (FYM) or farm slurry (liquid manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), {{which has been}} used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more intensive livestock rearing systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of straw bedding. Manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties.|$|E

30|$|Organic farming of Basmati rice-based {{cropping}} system is another alternative system for sustainability of crop production and natural resources. Moreover, {{there is a}} great demand of organically grown food in European and Middle East countries and offer two to {{two and a half times}} higher prices for organic produce (Partap 2006). Organic farming often has to deal with a scarcity of readily available nutrients in contrast to inorganic farming which relies on soluble fertilizers. The aim of nutrient management in organic systems is to optimize the use of on-farm resources and minimize losses (Kopke 1995). Maximum use of crop residues has been suggested towards building soil fertility (Jasdan and Hutchaon 1996). Rice and wheat straw have large potential for plant nutrients in organic farming of rice-wheat system. The straw in the system accounts about 35 % to 40 % N, 10 % to 15 % of P, and 80 % to 90 % of K removal by these crops (Sharma and Sharma 2004). Incorporation of straw, thus, results in recycling of a sizable amount of plant nutrients. However, {{there is a great}} difficulty in using the plant residue of cereals due to higher C/N ratio. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop a suitable technology to use crop residue in organic farming. We have to mix the plant residues of cereals with well-decomposed <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> or plant residue of legumes for narrowing down of C/N ratio so as to overcome the adverse effect of immobilization of native plant nutrients. Sharma and Prasad (1999) reported that incorporation of mung bean residue was found to be at par with Sesbania green manure in rice-wheat system.|$|R

Representative soil samples for laboratory analysis were collected by means of auger at a depth of 0 - 30 cm, only surface soils were sampled and a total of nine (9) soil samples were collected for the analysis. The principles and methods given in the Framework for Land Evaluation by means of land suitability classification was adopted for the evaluation of the study area which was "qualitative classification", in which the relative suitability of different land units recognized and mapped are expressed in qualitative terms only. Results for land suitability evaluation shows that mapping unit A 3, A 5, A 6, A 7 and A 9, are considered to be highly suitable for soyabean, groundnut, cowpea, sesame, rice and onion provided sufficient moisture is provided.

The mean values of 74. 0, 12. 0 : and 12. 6 for sand, silt and clay were obtained respectively. While infiltration rates were well above the recommended values for crop production. Result from different locations proved that the area has monolithic soil characteristics.

40|$|In Vietnam, {{more than}} 36 % of {{agricultural}} soils {{are classified as}} light textured degraded soils that have a low inherent nutrient supplying capacity, low organic matter content and limited water holding capacity. Among these soils, about half a million hectares are sandy soils mainly located in coastal areas. Communities that are economically marginalized and have few viable options available to address issues of food insecurity, poverty and unsustainable resource management often dominate these soils. This has a direct {{negative impact on the}} economic and social fabric of communities that are dependant on natural resources for goods and services in order to sustain already tenuous livelihoods. In this paper, the authors report the results collected from different studies on sandy and light textured soil management in Vietnam including a cooperation project with Belgian universities focused on coastal sandy soils of Central Vietnam and a North Vietnam sandy soils monitoring project. The main hysico-chemical characteristics of sandy soils, nutrient problems and Vietnamese farmers’ experiences on mineral and organic fertility management of sandy soil to overcome the shortages in food and toward a sustainable production are described. The management of these soils requires integrated practices that can increase fertility, and the nutrient and water holding capacity of these soils. Biological management of these soils can be an effective way to increase soil quality through management of biomass, i. e. <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures,</b> crop residues, green manures, and alley cropping. In addition, the effective management of these soils needs careful consideration of appropriate techniques that not only address the issue of low productivity, but to also protect the environment. These soils are prone to significant losses of nutrients through leaching, so that any intensification of production needs to recognize this potential adverse effect and develop management strategies that minimize off-site pollution. These technologies need to be assessed in pilot demonstration plots under local conditions prior to recommending their adoption by the wider agricultural community in coastal areas...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{nutrient}} management of soybean-wheat systems in central India {{has become a}} cause for concern because of stagnation of grain yields of soybean and wheat. The reduction in grain yield was mainly attributed to a suboptimal supply of nutrients to both the crops, use of poor quality <b>farmyard</b> <b>manures</b> and erratic distribution of rainfall during soybean 2 ̆ 7 s growing season and unavailability of irrigation water during wheat season. In this connection, the crop growth simulation models are handy in identifying the constraints to yield and recommending appropriate management practices to optimize the productivity of soybean-wheat system. To achieve this, the APSIM model was parameterized and validated for soybean and wheat crop of subtropical central India. Independent data set was used to parameterize soybean cultivar (JS 335) and wheat cultivar (Sujata) to be used for APSIM simulation. Genetic coefficient generated from this study was used for subsequent model validation. The data on water use, N uptake, grain yield and soil organic C from an ongoing long-term experiment was used for validation purpose. Three nutrient treatments, viz., control (no nutrient), inorganic (recommended rate) and FYM (8 tha to soybean and 16 tha to wheat) were used to validate the APSIM model. For organic treatments, we simulated N management using the FYM as the source of plant available N under field condition. The model was parameterized by specifying the N mineralized from the manure in the laboratory incubation. The model predicted successfully grain yield and N uptake under FYM treatments in soybean and wheat. For other treatments, model prediction was satisfactory in most of the cases in simulating water and organic carbon, grain yield and N uptake by both the crops. The discrepancy observed between the observed and predicted yield in the control under soybean was due to the P limiting condition of the treatment rather than the model. The predicted variability of crop yield was also due to the variation of weather during soybean growing season and amount of irrigation and N used during wheat growing season. Therefore, this APSIM simulation study can satisfactorily be used to make appropriate management decisions to provide farmers and others with alternative options for {{nutrient management}} for soybean-wheat cropping systems...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the effect of <b>farmyard</b> (cattle) <b>manure</b> (FYM) and inorganic nitrogen (N) phosphorus (P) fertilizers on growth and tuber yield of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). The treatments consisted of factorial combination of 4 levels of FYM (0. 10, 20 and 30 t h- 1) and three levels of inorganic NP fertilizers (0, 33. 3 %, 66. 6 % recommended rates) {{laid out in a}} Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated three times. Results demonstrated that the application of 20 or 30 t ha- 1 FYM + 66. 6 % of the recommended inorganic NP fertilizers significantly increased total tuber yield over the application of full dose of inorganic NP fertilizers without FYM in vertisol whereas in nitosol, the highest level of FYM (30 t ha- 1) + 66. 6 % of the recommended inorganic NP fertilizers significantly improved total tuber yield over the application of full dose of inorganic NP fertilizers without FYM. The application of 10 t ha- 1 FYM + 66. 6 % of the recommended inorganic NP fertilizers and 20 or 30 t ha- 1 FYM + 33. 3 % of the recommended inorganic NP fertilizers gave a total tuber yield, which was on par with the tuber yield obtained due to the application of full dose of inorganic NP fertilizer alone, in both soils. Thus, the application of 10 t ha- 1 and 20 or 30 t ha- 1 FYM resulted in a saving of 33. 3 % and 66. 6 % of the recommended NP fertilizers, respectively without significantly reducing the total tuber...|$|R
