2500|$|In {{a number}} of dialects {{unstressed}} [...] can merge with [...] (Eastern dialects) or [...] (Western dialects) according to the previous or following vowel (i.e. through assimilation when these vowels are high or <b>dissimilation</b> when they are mid or low). This merger is especially common in words with the prefix in or im.|$|E
2500|$|In {{very early}} Semitic languages, definiteness was {{achieved}} through gemination {{of the first}} letter in a word. For example, the word kitāb would be made definite by ak-kitāb. An additional benefit of this construction was to connote [...] "determination". The lām in the Arabic al- was thus {{a result of a}} <b>dissimilation</b> process.|$|E

2500|$|Consonant cluster {{simplification}} in Russian includes degemination, syncope, <b>dissimilation,</b> {{and weak}} vowel insertion. For example, [...] is pronounced , as in [...] ('cleft'). There {{are also a}} few isolated patterns of apparent cluster reduction (as evidenced by the mismatch between pronunciation and orthography) arguably the result of historical simplifications. For example, dental stops are dropped between a dental continuant and a dental nasal or lateral: [...] 'flattering'. Other examples include: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} perth- is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the {{possible}} root as *bher-, from which Latin ferio, [...] "strike". This corresponds to Julius Pokorny’s *bher-(3), “scrape, cut.” Ordinarily *bh- descends to Greek as ph-. This difficulty {{can be overcome}} by presuming a <b>dissimilation</b> from the–th– in perthein; that is, the Greeks preferred not to say *pherthein. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the perse- in Persephone, goddess of death. John Chadwick in the second edition of Documents in Mycenaean Greek speculates about the Mycenaean goddess [...] pe-re-*82, attested on the PY Tn 316 tablet (Linear B: [...] ) and tentatively reconstructed as *Preswa: ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Dissimilation,</b> like assimilation, {{may involve}} {{a change in}} {{pronunciation}} relative to a segment that is adjacent to the affected segment or at a distance, and may involve a change relative to a preceding or a following segment. As with assimilation, anticipatory <b>dissimilation</b> is much more common than lag <b>dissimilation,</b> but unlike assimilation, most <b>dissimilation</b> is triggered by non-contiguous segments. Also, while many kinds of assimilation have {{the character of a}} sound law, few dissimilations do; most are in the nature of accidents that befall a particular lexical item.|$|E

50|$|The Vowel Ablaut is {{a change}} in the height (gradation) of the root-syllable vowels and it affects the vowel quantity.In Wintu, the vowel ablaut occurs only in the {{mutations}} of some verb-root vowels (called <b>dissimilation),</b> or in some root-deriving suffixes (assimilation).Root-vowel <b>dissimilation</b> is conditioned by the height of the vowel in the following syllable, while the suffix vowel assimilation is conditioned by the quantity of the vowel in the preceding syllable.An example of <b>dissimilation</b> takes place when /e/ and /o/, which occurs only in root syllables, are raised in height when they are preceded by a single consonant and followed by the low vowel /a/ in the next syllable.|$|E

5000|$|Dissimilation: The {{opposite}} of assimilation. One sound becomes less like another, or (much more rarely) two sounds become less like each other. Examples: Latin quīnque [...] "five" [...] > Proto-Romance *kinkʷe (whence French cinq, Italian cinque, etc.); Old Spanish omne [...] "man" [...] > Spanish hombre. The {{great majority of}} dissimilations involve segments that are not contiguous, but, as with assimilations, the great majority involve an earlier sound changing with reference to a later one. <b>Dissimilation</b> is usually a sporadic phenomenon, but Grassmanns Law (Sanskrit and Greek) {{is an example of}} a systematic <b>dissimilation.</b> If the change of a sequence of fricatives such that one becomes a stop is <b>dissimilation,</b> then such changes as Proto-Germanic *χs to [...] (spelled x) in English would count as a regular sound law: PGmc. *seχs [...] "six" [...] > Old English siex, etc.|$|E
