Several changes in sea level {{occurred}} and the coal deposits of Lanarkshire and West Lothian and limestones of Fife and Dunbar date from this time.

Fossil Grove in Victoria Park, Glasgow contains the preserved remains of a Carboniferous forest.

40|$|In this research, {{dense and}} porous <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> were {{produced}} at a firing temperature of 1300 °C. The flexural strength {{data of the}} dense and the porous <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> were determined using three point bending test. Two-parameter Weibull and normal probability distributions were used to estimate {{the reliability of the}} flexural strength data of the dense and the porous <b>fired</b> <b>clay.</b> From the result, the Weibull probability distribution scale parameter for the dense (36. 31 MPa) and Porous (18. 85 MPa) <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> are higher than the mean strength value for the dense (33. 84 MPa) and the porous (17. 87 MPa) of the normal distribution. Distributions of flaws in the dense and the porous <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> {{have a significant effect on}} the Weibull and normal distribution parameters. The fractured surface of the dense <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> shows a random distribution of cracks while that of the porous <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> shows a distribution of pores in the morphology. The normal distribution considers failure at 50 % of the flexural strength data while Weibull probability distribution is failure at 62. 3 % of the strength data. Therefore, two-parameter Weibull is the suitable tool to model failure strength data of the dense and porous <b>fired</b> <b>clay...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{adsorption}} of fluoride ion from aqueous solutions by using <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil, pillared with tea leave ash components. The potential of low cost material <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil and <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil pillared with tea leave ash components for fluoride removal from aqueous solution was evaluated by using fluoride ion selective electrode. Pillaring of clay soil with tea leave ash was done by thoroughly mixing fifteen gram of tea leave ash and three hundred gram of clay soil using distilled water and it was aged for 96 hours until it was dried. Untreated clay soil and clay soil pillared with tea leave ash components were fired in an electrical furnace at 570 C for 3 hrs. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out {{and the effects of}} pH, contact time, initial adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose and temperature of the solution were investigated. Adsorption of fluoride by <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil and <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil pillared with tea leave ash was observed to sharply increase from pH 4 to 7 then decreased. The maximum adsorption efficiencies obtained were 75 % for <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil and 90 % for <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil pillared with tea leave ash components at pH 7 for both adsorbents. The maximum adsorption capacity obtained was 0. 913 mg/g for <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil and 2. 746 mg/g for <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil pillared with tea leave ash components. It can be concluded that <b>fired</b> <b>clay</b> soil pillared with tea leave ash is a good and cheap adsorbent with high potential for the adsorption and removal of fluoride from fluoride contaminated water and could therefore serve as effective and efficient adsorbent for treatment of drinking waters in terms of high adsorption capacity...|$|R

500|$|Trade {{steadily}} grew. Three {{small private}} branches were built {{to serve the}} industries of the valley. Near {{the top of the}} canal, a branch was constructed in 1800, which ran towards Maesmarchog, and was connected to collieries by nearly [...] of tramroad. At Aberclwyd, a branch built in 1817 served the Cnel Bach limekiln on the river bank. Below Neath, a [...] branch left the main line at Court Sart to connect to a tramroad serving the collieries at Eskyn. Although there are no figures for the tonnage carried, apart from a mention of 90,000 tons of coal in 1810, receipts increased from £2,117 in 1800 to £6,677 in 1830. Subscribers had paid a total of £107.50 for their shares, and dividends were paid from 1806, rising from £2 in 1806 to £18 in 1840.

[...] The specimens, collected in November 1994 from the area of East Brunswick, New Jersey, by G.R. Case, P.D. Borodin, and J.J.

The specimen was found above the South Amboy <b>Fire</b> <b>Clay,</b> part of the Raritan Formation, suggesting that it is Turonian in age (Upper Cretaceous, about 90 to 94 million years ago). Due to weathering, the amber specimen AMNH NJ-90 fractured {{into a number of}} chips along fractures and flow lines. [...] The chips with the holotype specimens, AMNH NJ-90Y and AMNH NJ-90Z, were first studied by a group of researchers consisting of David Hibbett and Michael Donoghue from Harvard University with David Grimaldi of the AMNH. [...] Hibbett and colleagues published their 1997 type description in the American Journal of Botany. [...] The generic epithet Archaeomarasmius is a combination of the Greek archaeo- meaning [...] "ancient" [...] and [...] "Marasmius", a modern genus which it resembles.
