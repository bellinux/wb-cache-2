5|$|Tropical Storm Miriam <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> {{coast of}} Central America and {{reached its peak}} of 986millibars on October 24. Ordinarily, a {{pressure}} this low would indicate a Category1 hurricane, but due to its disorganized convection, Miriam was not upgraded to a hurricane. Land interaction and wind shear weakened Miriam to a tropical depression on October 26. Low-level winds carried the system out to sea, and its convection dissipated on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius and Tong Yabghu (called Ziebel in the Byzantine sources) met {{under the}} walls of Narikala. The yabgu rode up to the emperor, kissed his {{shoulder}} and made a bow. In return, Heraclius <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> barbarian ruler, called him his son, and crowned him with his own diadem. During the ensuing feast the Khazar leaders received ample gifts {{in the shape of}} earrings and clothes, while the yabghu was promised the hand of the emperor's daughter, Eudoxia Epiphania.|$|E
5|$|The 1910Cuba hurricane, {{popularly known}} as the Cyclone of the Five Days, was an unusual and {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that struck Cuba and the United States in October1910. It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> coast of the Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E

5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|Steered by {{currents}} {{from an area}} of {{high pressure}} to the north, the storm began to drift northwestward and rapidly deepen over warm waters of the Gulf. It executed a tight counterclockwise loop, and continued to mature; on October 16 it reached peaked winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) with a minimum barometric pressure of 924 mbar (hPa; 27.29 inHg). The hurricane turned northeastward, again approaching western Cuba, and began to accelerate towards the Florida Peninsula on October 17. Its center passed west of Key West and made landfall near Cape Romano. The storm moved due north for a time as it moved inland, and deteriorated into a tropical storm. From northeastern Florida, the cyclone curved northeastward and <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> coast of the Southeast United States before heading out to sea. The storm is estimated to have dissipated on October 23.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army's pace was {{dictated}} by the infantry and baggage train; the Ayyubid army, being largely mounted, {{had the advantage of}} superior mobility. Efforts to burn crops and deny the countryside to the Frankish army were largely ineffective as it could be continuously provisioned from the fleet, which moved south parallel with it. On 25 August the Crusader rearguard was crossing a defile when it was almost cut off. However, the Crusaders closed up so speedily that the Muslim soldiery was forced to flee. From 26 to 29 August Richard's army had a respite from attack because while it <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> coast and had gone round the shoulder of Mount Carmel, Saladin's army had struck across country. Saladin arrived in the vicinity of Caesarea before the Crusaders, who were on a longer road. From 30 August to 7 September Saladin was always within striking distance, and waiting for an opportunity to attack if the Crusaders exposed themselves.|$|E

25|$|South of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, a {{tropical}} cyclone formed on August 17. It remained poorly organized and moved slowly, making landfall on August 20. It had moved back off shore by August 21. It headed northwest, passing west of Cabo San Lucas, and <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> Pacific {{coast of the}} Baja California Peninsula. It rapidly weakened as it headed north, and its remnants made landfall near Point Conception, California, on August 26 and dissipated after that.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{examination}} of German records showed the submarine attacked was the , badly damaged after being rammed by the Flower-class corvette HMS Crocus {{off the coast}} of West Africa. German lookouts had seen the torpedoes' tracks, enabling U-333 to evade the torpedoes; the torpedoes then self-detonated for unknown reasons. The commander of U-333 was Peter-Erich Cremer. In his post-war account of the attack, he suggested the rattling and banging noises Graphs crew had heard were due to the severe damage previously inflicted on U-333. His route back to France closely <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> Spanish coastline, a pattern followed by other U-boats, and he had also believed that Marriott was aware of this and had been lying in wait.|$|E
25|$|As per his destiny, the {{messengers}} of Yama came to {{take away}} Markandeya's soul, but failed to approach him as he ceaselessly repeated Shiva's name. Yama came himself to take Markandeya's soul and told Markandeya to stop his worship and come with him as per his fate. Markandeya refused, warning Yama that he was committing an offence against Shiva. Yama, however, proclaimed that not even Shiva could stop him. The wrathful Yama assumed a fearsome form and threw his noose to capture Markandeya, who <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> linga tightly. When the noose touched the linga, Shiva emerged from it and struck Yama with his Trishula and kicked his chest, killing the lord of death.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{in about}} 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was {{developed}} as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down {{the south side of}} the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day Ontario, Oregon. It <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water. Travellers on this route avoided two dangerous crossings of the Snake River. Today's Idaho State Route 78 roughly follows the path of the South Alternate route of the Oregon Trail.|$|E

25|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to find a salt water exit west from Hudson Bay, but the Fury and Hecla Strait in the far north is blocked by ice. The eastern entrance and main axis of the northwest passage, the Parry Channel, was found in 1819. The approach from the west through Bering Strait is impractical because of the need to sail around ice near Point Barrow. East of Point Barrow the coast is fairly clear in summer. This area was mapped in pieces from overland in 1821–1839. This leaves the large rectangle north of the coast, south of Parry Channel and east of Baffin Island. This area was mostly mapped in 1848–1854 by ships looking for Franklin's lost expedition. The first crossing was made by Amundsen in 1903–1905. He used a small ship and <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> coast.|$|E
25|$|The final assault {{began at}} 10:55 am on 31 August when James Leith's 5th Division rushed the main breach {{from the south}} while Thomas Bradford's Portuguese brigade stormed the smaller one from the east. After running the {{gauntlet}} of mines and small-arms fire, both columns reached the tops of their respective breaches and came under murderous fire. After enduring the one-sided slaughter for nearly 30 minutes, both columns retreated {{to the base of}} the wall where the troops <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> ground to escape the intense fire. In this emergency, Graham ordered his siege guns to fire over the heads of the surviving attackers. This expedient saved the day for the Allies, as the fire ripped apart the inner defenses, inflicting heavy losses on the French. As some of the 5th Division managed to make progress, an accident set off a store of bombs, killing 60 Frenchmen and injuring many more.|$|E
25|$|From the {{evidence}} that could be gathered, it appeared Waterhouse and Connolly became lost in a rainstorm and <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> coast of Baja California southward, thinking they were headed north along the Pacific Coast. They landed safely on the beach about twenty miles north of Bahia de Los Angeles. Their sole chance for survival seemed to be staying with the plane until found. Tortured by heat, thirst, and hunger, they waited seventeen days, but the search never reached that far south. Finally two fishermen came along and took them in a canoe to Bahia de Los Angeles. There the Americans were murdered, apparently for the little money they had. Their bodies, buried in the sand, were discovered {{within a day or}} two by an American geological survey party and rediscovered a week later by an American mining engineer. The news, however, did not reach Rockwell Field until 13 October. Three days later, a Navy ship, USS Aaron Ward, sailed from San Diego with a group of Army officers to recover the bodies.|$|E

25|$|By zero hour, {{some of the}} attacking battalions were in {{position}} and were met by massed machine-gun fire, when they advanced after a hurried bombardment. Disorganisation hampered {{the attack on the}} left, where the 166th Brigade was replacing the 164th Brigade. One battalion <b>hugged</b> <b>the</b> barrage and reached the German wire, where it had many casualties attempting to press on. The left-hand battalion was delayed, only beginning its advance after the British barrage had lifted; it was quickly forced under cover by German small-arms fire. Later in the day, an attack by the 165th Brigade, from the positions captured on 8 August also failed. To the north, the 2nd Division attacked again with a battalion of the 6th Brigade, south of the railway line, which was repulsed and an attack from Waterlot Farm also failed. The parties from the 55th Division, which had got into Guillemont either side of the quarry on 8 August and that of the 2nd Division, which had bombed its way along ZZ Trench, into {{the north end of the}} village amid much smoke and confusion, were quickly counter-attacked by German local reserves, until two more German battalions arrived and overwhelmed them. Isolated groups held out for a while at the quarry and more held out at the station, until overrun late on 9 August, being seen from the British lines moving towards Ginchy under German escort.|$|E
