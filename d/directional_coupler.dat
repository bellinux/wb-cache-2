25|$|The {{microwave}} bridge contains {{both the}} microwave source and the detector. Older spectrometers used a vacuum tube called a klystron to generate microwaves however modern spectrometers use a Gunn diode. Immediately after the microwave source {{there is an}} isolator which serves to attenuate any reflections back to the source which would result in fluctuations in the microwave frequency. The microwave power from the source is then passed through a <b>directional</b> <b>coupler</b> which splits the microwave power into two paths, one directed towards the cavity and the other the reference arm. Along both paths there is a variable attenuator that facilitates the precise control {{of the flow of}} microwave power. This in turn allows for accurate control over the intensity of the microwaves subjected to the sample. On the reference arm, after the variable attenuator there is a phase shifter that sets a defined phase relationship between the reference and reflected signal which permits phase sensitive detection.|$|E

500|$|A simple form of <b>directional</b> <b>coupler</b> is two {{parallel}} transmission lines coupled together over a λ/4 length.

500|$|A {{directional}} filter is {{a device that}} combines the functions of a <b>directional</b> <b>coupler</b> and a diplexer.

[...] In reverse, power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1, but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4.

500|$|Power {{dividers}} (also power splitters and, {{when used}} in reverse, power combiners) and directional couplers are passive devices used mostly {{in the field of}} radio technology.

[...] An essential feature of directional couplers is that they only couple power flowing in one direction.
