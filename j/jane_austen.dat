5|$|The {{reception}} {{history of}} <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen</b> follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen</b> (1775–1817), {{the author of}} such works as Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Emma (1815), {{has become one of}} the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.|$|E
50|$|As {{its title}} suggests, Jane Fairfax: A New Novel (1940) is {{inspired}} by <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens</b> novel Emma. It is somewhat experimental in that it mixes together characters from Emma, characters devised by Royde-Smith, and the two authors themselves.|$|R

5|$|Women's {{literature}} in Britain {{has had a}} long and often troubled history, with many female writers producing work under a pen name, such as George Eliot.

50|$|Mr. Weston is a {{supporting}} character in <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens</b> novel Emma, written in 1815. He marries the governess of the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, {{and it is}} the arrival of his son, Frank Churchill, in Highbury that sets the events of the plot in motion.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{book review}} written by Dinah Birch, a {{professor}} at the University of Liverpool, she examines the role of Mr. Collins as a clergyman in <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens</b> writing. Birch says that [...] "one of the strongest points of Pride and Prejudice is its understanding that <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens</b> Christianity ... is also an imaginative force in her writing", because Austen is [...] "deeply interested {{in the role of the}} church", in her society. She writes about the lack of religious dedication she sees in some clergyman through her character Mr. Collins who is [...] "by no means an aspirant to sainthood". [...] Margaret Kirkham regards the [...] "asinine" [...] Mr. Collins, who will inherit Longbourn, as a way that Austen [...] "mocks sexist pride and prejudice" [...] in legal customs.|$|R
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} examine {{displays}} of ageism within <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen???s</b> six core novels. Ageism {{is defined as}} prejudice and discrimination against an individual based upon age. First, I studied a specific character who demonstrates ageism, Emma Woodhouse. The possession of wealth blinds her to her obligations towards the elderly Mrs. Bates and singlewoman Miss Bates, while also enabling her father???s hypochondria via benign ageism. Secondly, I examine <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen???s</b> commentary (through her narration) on older men and older women. During these assessments, I found that ageist attitudes come in two varieties in the novels of Jane Austen: characters who are overtly ageist are {{to be seen as}} erring in judgment (no matter how benign the behavior), while Austen???s use of ageist stereotypes serves to promote the independence of her heroines by weakening their figures of authority...|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} {{transition in}} her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and {{sold as a}} set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen</b> introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.|$|E
5|$|Clarke {{was born}} on 1 November 1959 in Nottingham, England, the eldest {{daughter}} of a Methodist minister and his wife. Due to her father's posts, she spent her childhood in various towns across Northern England and Scotland, and enjoyed reading the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Charles Dickens, and <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen.</b> She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy, politics, and economics from St Hilda's College, Oxford in 1981.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} {{draws on}} various Romantic literary traditions, {{such as the}} comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. The novel's language is a pastiche of 19th-century writing styles, {{such as those of}} <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen</b> and Charles Dickens. Clarke describes the supernatural with careful detail. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a similar}} vein as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters lays {{numerous}} allusions and motifs commonly associated with tales of sea monsters on top of <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens</b> original tale, Sense and Sensibility. The sea monster elements are woven into the story as an alternate means of driving plot {{events such as the}} deaths of certain characters.|$|R

5000|$|O'Rourke types his manuscripts on an IBM Selectric typewriter, {{though he}} denies {{that he is}} a Luddite, asserting that his short {{attention}} span would make focusing on writing on a computer difficult. In a January 2007 interview, O'Rourke gave an example of his view of computers and writing by referencing novelist Stephen King, whom he paraphrased - saying had he a computer, he could have written three times as much in his early days. To which O'Rourke remarked, [...] "Does the world need three times as many Cujos? Three times as many <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens,</b> maybe." ...|$|R

5|$|Most reviews {{were very}} favourable, commenting on Rowling's imagination, humour, simple, direct style and clever plot construction, {{although}} a few complained that the final chapters seemed rushed. The writing {{has been compared to}} that of <b>Jane</b> <b>Austen,</b> one of Rowling's favourite authors, Roald Dahl, whose works dominated children's stories before the appearance of Harry Potter, and the Ancient Greek story-teller Homer. While some commentators thought the book looked backwards to Victorian and Edwardian boarding school stories, others thought it placed the genre firmly in the modern world by featuring contemporary ethical and social issues.|$|E

While Strange focuses {{on the relationship of}} two men, Jonathan Strange and Gilbert Norrell, the stories in Ladies focus on the power women gain through magic.|$|E

5000|$|Fitzwilliam Darcy, {{generally}} {{referred to}} as Mr. Darcy, {{is one of the}} two central characters in <b>Jane</b> <b>Austens</b> novel Pride and Prejudice. He is an archetype of the aloof romantic hero, and a romantic interest of Elizabeth Bennet, the novels protagonist. The storys narration is almost exclusively from Elizabeths perspective; she is portrayed as the sympathetic figure, and Darcy hardly so until the later chapters of the novel—as knowledge and ironic events are revealed to Elizabeth. Usually referred to only as [...] "Mr. Darcy" [...] or [...] "Darcy" [...] by characters and the narrator, his first name is mentioned twice in the novel.|$|R
