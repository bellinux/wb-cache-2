25|$|A <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a device}} {{used to create}} knitted fabrics in a semi or fully {{automated}} fashion.|$|E
2500|$|The fabric {{produced}} using a <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is of a {{more even}} texture than hand-knitted fabric, which is particularly noticeable on large areas of plain stockinette stitch, and can be an advantage. [...] Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with machine knitting but can take a little longer but still much faster than hand knitting. [...] The standard gauge 200-needle machine can knit the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight, while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|With the {{invention}} of the stocking frame, an early form of <b>knitting</b> <b>machine,</b> knitting [...] "by hand" [...] became a craft used by country people with easy access to fiber. Similar to quilting, spinning, and needlepoint, hand knitting became a leisure activity for the wealthy.|$|E
50|$|Clothing {{can also}} include {{knitted or crocheted}} {{clothing}} and accessories. Some knitters may use <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> {{with varying degrees of}} automatic patterning. Fully electronic <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> can be interfaced to computers running computer-aided design software. Arduino boards have been interfaced to electronic <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> to further automate the process.|$|R
5000|$|The Knitting Laboratory is {{equipped}} with warp and weft knitting machinery. Warp knitting machinery includes raschel and tricot <b>machines</b> and weft <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> include circular (single jersey, interlock, rib, jacquard) and flat <b>knitting</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fully {{fashioned}} <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> {{are those}} flat and circular <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> that produce custom pre-shaped {{pieces of a}} knitted garment. Instead of knitting a whole rectangular sheet of fabric, instructions from a knit pattern on a punch card or computer file guide a fully fashioned <b>knitting</b> <b>machine's</b> needles to add or drop stitches to create custom two-dimensional shapes appropriate to the desired finished garment structure. The pieces emerge from the machine ready to be sewn together.|$|R
2500|$|It was the {{development}} of the <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> that introduced hooked needles and enabled faultless, automated knitting. Most knitters probably aren’t even aware of the many processes that their fingers perform in the making of a single stitch. [...] However, large gauge needles emphasize those actions and knitting becomes increasingly more awkward when the needle diameter is greater than the width of the knitter's finger. [...] On a one-inch diameter (size 50) needle for instance, the shaft begins to taper one and three quarter inches from the tip. This means that the stitches are spread much further apart on mega knitting needles, making them more difficult to control. [...] The hook catches the loop of yarn as each stitch is knitted, meaning that wrists and fingers don’t have to work so hard and there is less chance of stitches slipping off the needle. The position of the hook is most important. [...] Turn the left (non-working) hook to face away at all times; turn the right (working) hook toward you up whilst knitting (plain stitch) and away whilst purling.|$|E
2500|$|Williams {{was the son}} of Thomas Williams (Gosport, England, 27 May 1753 – Nottingham 6 January 1804) and Mary Marsh (10 April 1756 – 7 November 1831) who {{had married}} in Gosport on 17 April 1783. Thomas Williams was a {{supplier}} of uniforms to the Royal Navy in Gosport. In 1794 Thomas and Mary Williams and their six children moved to Nottingham, then the thriving centre of the East Midlands industrial revolution. Thomas Williams was listed in the Nottingham trade directories as a hosier. The industry was based on William Lee's stocking frame <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> The [...] business was successful. Thomas Williams received recognition as a Burgess of Nottingham in 1796 and as a Sheriff of Nottingham in 1803. However the prosperity which had been such a feature of the hosiery industry {{in the second half of}} the 18th century ended. In 1804, when Thomas Williams died of typhus at the age of 50, his wife was left with a heavily mortgaged business with five sons and three daughters to look after.|$|E
2500|$|Canada {{came to be}} at {{war when}} in 1914 King George V {{declared}} that the British Empire was at war with its German counterpart. At the time, Canada had in Ottawa a royal viceroy {{in the form of}} Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; though well intended, the Prince donned his Field Marshal's uniform and, without ministerial advice, went to military training grounds and barracks to address the troops and see them off on their voyage to Europe. This was much to the chagrin of the prime minister at the time, Robert Borden, who saw the Governor General as overstepping constitutional conventions. Though Borden blamed the military secretary of the day, Edward Stanton, he also opined that Prince Arthur [...] "laboured under the handicap of his position {{as a member of the}} Royal Family and never realised his limitations as Governor General." [...] Arthur's wife, Princess Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught, also helped in the war effort, forming volunteer groups to make supplies for Canadian soldiers overseas; for Christmas in 1915, she sent a card and a box of maple sugar to every Canadian serving in Europe and she had a <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> installed at Rideau Hall, on which she made thousands of pairs of socks for soldiers. Princess Patricia, the Connaughts' daughter, became so active with the military that Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry was in 1914 named in her honour; the Princess personally chose the infantry's colours, designed its badge, and was appointed as its colonel-in-chief at the cessation of hostilities in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Domestic <b>{{knitting}}</b> <b>machines</b> use the {{weft knitting}} method which produces a fabric similar to hand knitting. Knitting proceeds {{more quickly than}} in hand knitting, where (usually two) straight needles are held in the hand and each stitch is manipulated individually across the row. <b>Knitting</b> <b>machines</b> work an entire row of loops in a single movement.|$|R

50|$|The city of Nottingham, {{particularly}} the district known as Lace Market, {{was a major}} producer of machine-knitted lace. Leicestershire and neighboring counties had long had an association with the hosiery industry. This continued particularly growing with the invention of portable circular <b>knitting</b> <b>machines.</b> Machines could be hired and worked from home {{rather than relying on}} a large stocking frame or the much slower hand knitting. One manufacturer of these machines was Griswold, and such work was often called Griswold work.Some framework knitters were among the Luddites, who resisted the transition to factories. By {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, the knitting industry had still not made the transition to factories. With the improvement of steam-powered <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> in the mid-nineteenth century, <b>machine</b> <b>knitting</b> increasingly shifted to factories to accommodate the larger machines.|$|R
50|$|Complete garment {{knitting}} requires two needle {{beds for}} three-dimensional structures (such as clothing).
