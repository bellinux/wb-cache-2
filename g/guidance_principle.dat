It proposes a new variant of Williams’ agent-regret, but concludes that its scope does not coincide with cases of moral luck. It then distinguishes different ways in which factors beyond our control feature in our engagement with the world and shows how the <b>guidance</b> <b>principle</b> (we are responsible for actions guided by our rational powers) recognises a narrower range of situations of moral luck than is often supposed, allowing us to distinguish between responsibility for intentions, for (some) attempts and for actions, as well as to assign responsibility for thoughts and emotions. Finally, relying on the fact that for each person some actions are within his or her range of secure competence the paper argues that responsibility extends beyond the <b>guidance</b> <b>principle.</b> It concludes with a brief outline discussion of the relations between responsibility and blame...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Integrating risk {{assessment}} {{in an organization}} {{is a process that}} generally follows a sequence of phases. To be effective, the company culture must be willing to embrace the {{risk assessment}} process, and cultural acceptance stems from management leadership. Emphasizing some of the major benchmarks in occupational risk assessment approaches, the paper summarizes and outlines several basic principles directed towards practical risk assessment process improvement. The article discusses the principles that underlie a coherent and efficient assessment for occupational health, safety and well-being: the need of a global approach of these problems not only at the workplace but for the whole of the living conditions at work; a clear understanding of the complementary character between the different partners of this prevention; the role of actor of the workers and therefore the absolute necessity of a participative approach; the real usefulness of measurements and of risk quantification in general; the differences between risk assessment and risk management.

40|$|The X- 33 Advanced Technology Demonstrator is a half-scale {{prototype}} {{developed to}} test the key technologies needed for a full-scale single-stage reusable launch vehicle (RLV). The X- 33 is a suborbital vehicle that will be launched vertically, and land horizontally. The goals of this research were to develop an alternate entry guidance scheme for the X- 33 in parallel to the actual X- 33 entry guidance algorithms, provide comparative and complementary study, and identify potential new ways to improve entry guidance performance. Toward these goals, the nominal entry trajectory is defined by a piecewise linear drag-acceleration-versus-energy profile, which is in turn obtained by the solution of a semi-analytical parameter optimization problem. The closed-loop guidance is accomplished by tracking the nominal drag profile with primarily bank-angle modulation on-board. The bank-angle is commanded by a single full-envelope nonlinear trajectory control law. Near {{the end of the}} entry flight, the guidance logic is switched to heading control in order to meet strict conditions at the terminal area energy management interface. Two methods, one on ground-track control and the other on heading control, were proposed and examined for this phase of entry guidance where lateral control is emphasized.

40|$|A mix {{between a}} {{monograph}} and an article collection, this PhD thesis considers {{the concept of}} guided motion control for marine vehicles, in particular focusing on underactuated marine surface vehicles. The motion control scheme is defined to involve {{the combination of a}} guidance system which issues meaningful velocity commands with a velocity control system which has been specifically designed to take vehicle maneuverability and agility constraints into account when fulfilling these commands such that a given motion control objective can be achieved in a controlled and feasible manner without driving the vehicle actuators to saturation. Furthermore, motion control scenarios are classified in a novel way according to whether they involve desired motion which has been defined a priori or not. Consequently, in addition to the classical scenarios of point stabilization, trajectory tracking, path following and maneuvering, the so-called target tracking scenario is considered. The resulting scenarios then involve target tracking, path following, path tracking and path maneuvering. In addition, it is proposed to define the control objectives associated with each scenario as work-space tasks instead of configurationspace tasks. Such a choice seems better suited for practical applications, since most vehicles operate in an underactuated configuration exposed to some kind of environmental disturbances. The thesis also proposes a novel mechanization of constant bearing guidance, which is a classical <b>guidance</b> <b>principle</b> well-known in the guided missile literature. This suggestion is motivated by a need to solve the target tracking motion control objective for marine vehicles. The proposed implementation enables explicit specification of the transient rendezvous behavior toward the target by selection of two intuitive tuning parameters. In addition, a singularity-free guidance law applicable to path following scenarios involving regularly parameterized paths which {{do not need to be}} arc-length parameterized is proposed. An extension to this guidance law is also suggested in order to enable off-path traversing of regularly parameterized paths for formation control purposes. A novel velocity control system which inherently takes maneuverability, agility and actuator constraints into account is developed for the purpose of controlling underactuated marine vehicles moving at high speed. The system is derived through a design method which involves a control-oriented modeling approach and requires a minimum of system identification tests to be carried out. The thesis also gives a novel overview of the major developments in marine control systems as seen from a Norwegian perspective. The development can be viewed as three waves of control, where the first wave concerned development of novel ship automation technology in the 1960 s and 1970 s, the second wave involved development of unique dynamic positioning systems in the 1970 s and 1980 s, while the third wave is expected to encompass the development of unmanned vehicle technology for a large number of maritime applications. A summary of the historical development, present status and future possibilities associated with unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is also given. Current Norwegian activities are particularly emphasized. Furthermore, an overview of the main formation control concepts applicable to marine surface vehicles is given. A novel formation control functionality named coordinated target tracking is subsequently suggested within a leader-follower framework. Employing a guided motion control system using the suggested mechanization of constant bearing guidance, this functionality is then implemented for two different types of underactuated USVs such that they are able to move in formation with a leader vessel which can maneuver freely without being constrained to any predefined motion pattern. In particular, excerpts from successful full-scale formation control experiments involving a manned leader vessel and the two USVs executing coordinated target tracking at high speed are presented. This functionality currently seems to be unique on a worldwide basis, providing a convenient plug-and-play formation control capability for manned leader vessels involved in maritime survey operations. </p...|$|E
