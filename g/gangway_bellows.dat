40|$|Abstract <b>Gangway</b> <b>bellows</b> in {{this study}} is the double {{wrinkled}} neoprene rubber component to accept various deviations between the carriage end parts of the articulated type high speed railway vehicle(HSRV). The fatigue failure of the bellows has a harmful effect on the riding comfort for the passengers with the increase of noise and ringing in the ears due to air-tightness failure during pass through a long tunnel. In this study, to assure the safety of <b>gangway</b> <b>bellows</b> of the HSRV, non-linear analysis of the <b>gangway</b> <b>bellows</b> considering triaxial angular displacement(rolling /yawing/pitching) between the carriage end parts are performed. The non-linear properties of the rubber are determined by uniaxial tension and equi-biaxial tension test. Moreover, from th...|$|E

This standardisation {{was intended to}} give rail passengers on international services a standard level of comfort; in addition {{it was intended to}} simplify the maintenance of coaches when abroad. One of the standards introduced was the use of rubber corridor connectors on <b>gangways</b> instead of <b>bellows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wolverton has a {{long history}} {{associated}} with providing carriages for the British Royal Train. The works produced Queen Victoria's 1869 saloon, comprising two six-wheelers joined by the first <b>bellows</b> <b>gangway</b> in Europe; the carriage is now part of the collection of the National Railway Museum, York. Further Royal coaches were built in 1903 for King Edward VII, and in 1961 for Queen Elizabeth II.|$|R
