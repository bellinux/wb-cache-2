Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, and {{it was not until the}} 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Walter {{attended}} {{at least}} five meetings of the Scottish national parliament during his episcopate. He {{was present at the}} Scone parliament of 27 September 1367, which discussed royal revenues and relations with the English crown. He was also present at the Scone parliament of June 1368, and the Perth parliament of 6 March 1369; the latter discussed royal business, relations with the Kingdom of England and the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway,</b> and law and order in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Stewart, Thomas, Earl of Mar, Uilleam III, Earl of Ross, and other Highland lords, were ordered to impose greater control in their regions. Bishop Walter took part in two parliamentary committees, the first a clerical committee devoted to general business, and the second a judicial committee authorised to review earlier legal judgments in the kingdom.|$|E

5000|$|Ivar Halfdansson was a king <b>of</b> Oppland, <b>Norway</b> one <b>of</b> the Petty <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> {{during the}} Migration Period. He is made father of Eystein Glumra and is said by the Orkneyinga Saga to be {{ancestor}} of the Earls of Orkney, {{and also of}} Rollo of Normandy.|$|R
5|$|Jon Haraldsson {{was killed}} in 1231, at Thurso in Caithness. He was contested by Snaekoll Gunnisson, a {{great-grandson}} of Rognvald Kali, who had demanded that Jon should share the Earldom with him, as had been done before. Jon's supporters and Snaekoll's fought a war until {{it was agreed that}} King Haakon Sverreson should settle the matter. All concerned set off to Norway, but a ship carrying Earl Jon, his supporters, and his kin, was lost at sea on the return voyage. As a result, the line of Norse Earls came to a temporary end and from 1231 until 1236 Orkney was without an Earl. In 1236 the Earldom was granted by Haakon IV of Norway, to Magnus, son of Gille Brigte, Mormaer of Angus. Although ruled by Angus, Strathearn and Sinclair lords thereafter, Orkney remained part of the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 {{established}} full Norwegian {{sovereignty over}} the archipelago. The islands are, unlike the Norwegian Antarctic Territory, {{a part of}} the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> and not a dependency. The treaty came into effect in 1925, following the Svalbard Act. All forty signatory countries of the treaty have the right to conduct commercial activities on the archipelago without discrimination, although all activity is subject to Norwegian legislation. The treaty limits Norway's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard. Therefore, Svalbard has a lower income tax than mainland Norway, and there is no value added tax. There is a separate budget for Svalbard to ensure compliance. Svalbard is a demilitarized zone, as the treaty prohibits the establishment of military installations. Norwegian military activity is limited to fishery surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard as the treaty requires Norway to protect the natural environment.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{were first}} taken into {{use as a}} whaling base in the 17th and 18th centuries, after which they were abandoned. Coal mining started at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, and several permanent communities were established. The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 recognizes Norwegian sovereignty, and the 1925 Svalbard Act made Svalbard a full part of the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway.</b> They also established Svalbard as a free economic zone and a demilitarized zone. The Norwegian Store Norske and the Russian Arktikugol remain the only mining companies in place. Research and tourism have become important supplementary industries, with the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS) and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault playing critical roles. No roads connect the settlements; instead snowmobiles, aircraft and boats serve inter-community transport. Svalbard Airport, Longyear serves as the main gateway.|$|E
50|$|In the 7th and 8th centuries {{the area}} {{suffered}} raids and invasions by Vikings. From the 9th century until the Treaty of Perth in 1266 CE {{control of the}} Hebrides alternated between the <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway,</b> Alba {{to the east and}} the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> the Isles ruled by figues such as Ketil Flatnose, Maccus mac Arailt, Godred Crovan and Somerled.|$|R

Following some months of tension and fear of war between the neighbouring nations - and a Norwegian plebiscite held on 13 August which overwhelmingly backed dissolution - negotiations between the two governments led to Sweden's recognition <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> as an independent constitutional monarchy on 26 October 1905. On that date, King Oscar II renounced his claim to the Norwegian throne, effectively dissolving the United <b>Kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> Sweden and <b>Norway,</b> and this event was swiftly followed, on 18 November, by the accession to the Norwegian throne of Prince Carl of Denmark, taking the name of Haakon VII.|$|R

25|$|Bouvetøya is one {{of three}} {{dependencies}} of Norway. Unlike Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land, which are subject to the Antarctic Treaty System, Bouvetøya is not disputed. The dependency status entails that the island {{is not part of the}} <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway,</b> but is still under Norwegian sovereignty. Specifically, this implies that the island can be ceded without violating the first article of the Constitution of Norway. Norwegian administration of the island is handled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, located in Oslo.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} centuries of the Iron Age {{and at the}} {{beginning}} of the Viking Age (7931066) petty kingdoms appeared: bigger regional territories with power centres and chieftains.

The first reported finding was in the 1873 Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition led by Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht, who named the area after Emperor Franz Joseph I. The islands, then under the name Fridtjof Nansen Land, were annexed by the Soviet Union in 1926, who settled small outposts for research and military purposes. The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> rejected the claim and several private expeditions {{were sent to the}} islands.

The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948. The Faroese have control of most {{domestic}} matters. Areas that remain the responsibility of Denmark include military defence, the police department, the justice department, currency and foreign affairs. However, as they {{are not part of the}} same customs area as Denmark, the Faroe Islands have an independent trade policy and can establish trade agreements with other states.

25|$|In {{the last}} year of his father's reign, Guðrøðr was absent at the court of Ingi Haraldsson, King of Norway, forging closer ties with the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway.</b> When Óláfr was assassinated by rival members of the Crovan dynasty in 1153, Guðrøðr {{returned}} to the Isles, overthrew his usurping cousins, and seized the throne for himself. Guðrøðr evidently pursued a more aggressive policy than his father, and the following year appears to have lent military assistance to Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain in the latter's bid for the high-kingship of Ireland. Not long afterwards, Guðrøðr faced a dynastic challenge from his brother-in-law, Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll, whose son, as a grandson of Óláfr, possessed a claim to the throne. Late in 1156, Guðrøðr and Somaile fought an inconclusive sea-battle and partitioned the kingdom of the Isles between them. Two years later Somairle stuck again and forced Guðrøðr from the Isles altogether.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} Norwegian trade, {{the civil}} service and the united <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> and Sweden's treaty negotiations with France between 1845 and 1865. These efforts resulted in treaty in 1865 between France and Sweden-Norway. The story of the various negotiation rounds 1847 - 48, 1852 - 54, 1863 - 65 and the treaty has their own history and deserves attention in their own rights. However, the treaty of 1865 also introduced entirely new principles into Swedish and Norwegian trade policy. The treaty implied that the united kingdoms joined the multilateral trade network first introduced with the Cobden treaty, and hence made the countries {{an integral part of}} the emerging web of global trade network. Previous research has tended to focus on only the last - and hence the successful of the three above mentioned negotiation rounds. Moreover, these studies have predominantly approached the topic through the framework of today's nation states, and thereby tended to ignore the fact that the foreign services was the only bureaucratic body shared by the united <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> and Sweden. The thesis offers a new approach compared to previous research both through the choice of time-span as well as the ambition to study these processes from a dual-perspective as both Norwegian and Swedish interests are taken into account - in addition to those of France of course. The thesis pays particular attention to the political economy in the united <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway</b> and Sweden, with a particular emphasis on the former. Through employing a rich source material from both Norwegian and Swedish archives, the issues of trade and treaties are studied through the lenses of business individuals, civil servants and governmental bodies. The thesis argues that Sweden, not surprisingly, was the predominant party <b>of</b> the united <b>kingdoms</b> throughout the period. However, the political economy within Norway was changing throughout these decades, giving commercial interests a substantial increase in their political capital and hence a stronger influence on decision-making processes. Still, the thesis underlines that the breakthrough of the 1865 -treaty cannot be ascribed to increasing power to commercial interests alone, but also has to be understood through changing contexts domestically and internationally - as well as a professionalization of the foreign services...|$|R

The internal struggles and civil strife of the Age of the Sturlungs led to the signing of the Old Covenant in 1262, which ended the Commonwealth and brought Iceland under the Norwegian crown. Possession of Iceland passed from the Norwegian Empire to the Kalmar Union in 1415, when the <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Norway,</b> Denmark and Sweden were united. After the break-up of the union in 1523, it remained a Norwegian dependency, as a part of Denmark–Norway.|$|R
