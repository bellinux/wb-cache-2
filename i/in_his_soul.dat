500|$|Britten's fellow-composers had divided {{views about}} him. To Tippett he was [...] "simply the most musical person I have ever met", with an [...] "incredible" [...] {{technical}} mastery; some contemporaries, however, were less effusive. In Tippett's view Walton {{and others were}} convinced that Britten and Pears were leaders of a homosexual conspiracy in music, a belief Tippett dismisses as ridiculous, inspired by jealousy at Britten's postwar successes. Leonard Bernstein considered Britten [...] "a man {{at odds with the}} world", and said of his music: [...] "f you hear it, not just listen to it superficially, you become aware of something very dark". The tenor Robert Tear, who was closely associated with Britten {{in the latter part of}} the composer's career, made a similar point: [...] "There was a great, huge abyss <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>soul...</b> He got into the valley of the shadow of death and couldn't get out".|$|E

[...] Another biographer, Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as believing that he has [...] "the spirit of Caledonia <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>soul</b> and his music reflects it." [...] According to Yorke, Morrison claimed to have discovered [...] "a certain quality of soul" [...] when he first visited Scotland (his Belfast ancestors were of Ulster Scots descent) and Morrison has said he believes there is some connection between soul music and Caledonia. Yorke said Morrison [...] "discovered several years after he first began composing music that some of his songs lent themselves to a unique major modal scale (without sevenths) which of course is the same scale as that used by bagpipe players and old Irish and Scottish folk music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pisemsky's debut play The Hypochondriac (1852) was {{followed}} by the Sketches of Peasant life, a three-part short stories cycle. In Pisemsky's second play, The Divide (Раздел, 1853), a typical natural school piece, parallels have been found with Turgenev's comedy Breakfast at the Chief's. Speaking about Pisemsky's early works, Skabichevsky wrote: [...] "Dig deeper into the pessimism which has gone into full swing in The Muff and Marriage by Passion, put it next to the mindset of an ordinary provincial man for examination and you'll be struck by the identical nature of the two. At the bottom of this outlook lies the conviction that man deep <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>soul</b> is a scoundrel, moved only by practical interests and egotistical, mostly dirty impulses, and for this reason one has to be on one's guard with one's neighbour and always keep 'a stone by one's bosom'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Limbo of the Patriarchs" [...] or [...] "Limbo of the Fathers" [...] (Latin limbus patrum) {{is seen as}} the {{temporary}} state of those who, despite the sins they may have committed, died in the friendship of God but could not enter Heaven until redemption by Jesus Christ made it possible. The term [...] "Limbo of the Fathers" [...] was a medieval name for the part of the underworld (Hades) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ's soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them (see Harrowing of Hell). The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Christ's descent into hell as meaning primarily that [...] "the crucified one sojourned {{in the realm of the}} dead prior to his resurrection. This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ's descent into hell: that Jesus, like all men, experienced death and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>soul</b> joined the others in the realm of the dead." [...] It adds: [...] "But he descended there as Saviour, proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there." [...] It does not use the word [...] "Limbo".|$|E
