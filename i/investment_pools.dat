Standard was growing horizontally and vertically. It added its own pipelines, tank cars, and home delivery network. It kept oil prices low to stave off competitors, made its products affordable to the average household, and, to increase market penetration, sometimes sold below cost if necessary. It developed over 300 oil-based products from tar to paint to Vaseline petroleum jelly to chewing gum. By the end of the 1870s, Standard was refining over 90% of the oil in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|The {{company or}} other entity issuing the {{security}} {{is called the}} issuer. A country's regulatory structure determines what qualifies as a security.

5000|$|The 130-30 funds {{also known}} as 1X0/X0 funds give {{ordinary}} investors a taste of an investing strategy that has been popular among hedge funds, lightly regulated <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Like other [...] "long-short" [...] mutual funds, the 130-30 funds have traditional [...] "long" [...] holdings of stocks but also sell other stocks [...] "short" [...] in a bet that prices will fall.

50|$|In addition, in Europe, {{mezzanine}} funds play {{a significant}} role in the loan market. Mezzanine funds are also <b>investment</b> <b>pools,</b> which traditionally focused on the mezzanine market only. However, when second lien entered the market, it eroded the mezzanine market; consequently, mezzanine funds expanded their investment universe and began to commit to second lien as well as payment-in-kind (PIK) portions of transaction. As with credit funds, these pools are not subject to ratings oversight or diversification requirements, and allow managers significant freedom in picking and choosing investments. Mezzanine funds are, however, riskier than credit funds in that they carry both debt and equity characteristics.|$|E

5000|$|Terminology {{varies with}} country but {{investment}} funds are {{often referred to}} as <b>investment</b> <b>pools,</b> collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds. The regulatory term is undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities, or short collective investment undertaking (cf. Law). An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund, or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund. [...] The term also includes specialized vehicles such as collective and common trust funds, which are unique bank-managed funds structured primarily to commingle assets from qualifying pension plans or trusts.|$|E

50|$|Another form of {{insurance}} that was popular {{from time to}} time was life insurance. However, private insurance companies could usually not compete with government life annuities when the government was active in this market. We therefore see this activity only in the period between 1670 and 1690, when Holland suspended the issuance of lijfrenten, and again after 1710, when the province again withdrew from this market. After 1780 the French government started to dominate this market with its life annuities. The private life-insurance contracts often took the form of group <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> that paid pensions to nominees. A peculiar feature was often a tontine format that offered windfall profits to surviving nominees. In the 18th century these pools were marketed and controlled by brokers, which gave them a professional character.|$|E
5000|$|The county's {{finances}} {{were not}} suspect until February 1994. The Federal Reserve Bank began to raise US interest rates, causing many securities in Orange County's <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> {{to fall in}} value. As a result, dealers were requesting extra margin payments from Orange County. These extra margin payments were {{funded in part by}} another bond issue made by Orange County; the size of that bond issue was $600 million. However, this fix proved to be only temporary. In December 1994, Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) realized {{what was going on and}} blocked the [...] "rolling over" [...] of $1.25 billion in repos ("rollover" [...] essentially means issuing another repo when the previous one ends, but at the new prevailing interest rate). At that point some claim that Orange County was left with no recourse other than to file for bankruptcy. [...] Others would argue that Orange County's decision to enter bankruptcy protection was voluntary.|$|E
5000|$|The ICB Report {{rejected}} [...] "narrow banking" [...] in {{part because}} it would lead to more credit (and all credit during times of stress) being provided by a [...] "less regulated sector."

They proposed to equalize the cost by establishing [...] "uniform regulation" [...] of banks and the lenders and investors in the parallel banking system. As with Kotlikoff’s [...] "limited purpose banking" [...] proposal, only <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> funded 100% from equity interests would remain unregulated as banks. Although D’Arista and Schlesinger acknowledged the regulation of banks and of the parallel banking system would end up only being [...] "comparable," [...] their goal was to eliminate so far as possible the competitive advantages of the [...] "parallel" [...] or [...] "shadow" [...] banking market.|$|E

5000|$|Like regular banks, shadow banks provide {{credit and}} {{generally}} increase the liquidity {{of the financial}} sector. Yet unlike their more regulated competitors, they lack access to central bank funding or safety nets such as deposit insurance and debt guarantees. [...] In contrast to traditional banks, shadow banks do not take deposits. Instead, they rely on short-term funding provided either by asset-backed commercial paper or by the repo market, in which borrowers in substance offer collateral as security against a cash loan, through the mechanism of selling the security to a lender and agreeing to repurchase it at an agreed {{time in the future}} for an agreed price. Money market funds do not rely on short-term funding; rather, they are <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> that provide short-term funding by investing in short-term debt instruments issued by banks, corporations, state and local governments, and other borrowers. The shadow banking sector operates across the American, European, and Chinese financial sectors, and in perceived tax havens worldwide. Shadow banks can be involved in the provision of long-term loans like mortgages, facilitating credit across the financial system by matching investors and borrowers individually or by becoming part of a chain involving numerous entities, some of which may be mainstream banks. Due in part to their specialized structure, shadow banks can sometimes provide credit more cost-efficiently than traditional banks. A headline study by the International Monetary Fund defines the two key functions of the shadow banking system as securitization - to create safe assets, and collateral intermediation - to help reduce counterparty risks and facilitate secured transactions. In the US, prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the shadow banking system had overtaken the regular banking system in supplying loans to various types of borrower; including businesses, home and car buyers, students and credit users. As they are often less risk averse than regular banks, entities from the shadow banking system will sometimes provide loans to borrowers who might otherwise be refused credit. Money market funds are considered more risk averse than regular banks and thus lack this risk characteristic.|$|E

By the end of the 1870s, Standard was refining over 90% of the oil in the U.S. In 1877, Standard clashed with Thomas A. Scott the president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, its chief hauler. Flagler and Rockefeller had envisioned the use of pipelines as an alternative transport system for oil and began a campaign to build and acquire them. The railroad, seeing Standard’s incursion into the transportation and pipeline fields, struck back and formed a subsidiary to buy and build oil refineries and pipelines. Standard countered and held back its shipments and, with the help of other railroads, started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest as well. Flagler and Rockefeller eventually prevailed and the railroad sold all its oil interests to Standard. But in the aftermath of that battle, in 1879 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicted Flagler and Rockefeller on charges of monopolizing the oil trade, starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of Standard Oil’s business practices.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, central bankers and {{financial}} institution supervisors have sharpened {{their focus on}} the increasingly important role that private pools of investment funds play in global financial markets. The growth in these pools has contributed significantly to market efficiency and financial stability by expanding liquidity in many financial markets, improving price discovery, and, ultimately, lowering the costs of capital. Private <b>investment</b> <b>pools</b> and the alternative investment strategies they pursue have contributed to a signifi cant expansion of the global markets and have helped accelerate the evolution in traded credit products such as credit derivatives, collateralized debt obligations, and the securitization of an increasing array of traditionally illiquid assets.

Abstract: We examine whether health care equity investments hedge health care liabilities. In contrast with conventional wisdom, we find them uncorrelated and, thus, poor hedges. <b>Investment</b> <b>pools</b> are frequently designed to pay health care expenses. Companies and governments pay post-retirement health care benefits, often out of their pension investment pool or an affiliated trust. Non-profits, including over one hundred hospital conversion foundations worth billions of dollars, regularly finance health programs. (Hospital conversion foundations are formed when a non-profit hospital sells to a for-profit entity.) Finally, individual investors hold Archer Medical Savings Accounts and Health Savings Accounts, both designed to finance personal health care expenditures...|$|E
