5|$|In 1953 the State Department's {{physical}} security was split between {{foreign and domestic}} branches. Uanna reorganized these into one group called the Division of Physical Security, consisting of four branches, and took over as its new chief. He then published the Protection of Dignitaries Manual and developed the handbook used at the training school for Marine Security Guards assigned to U. S. embassies, legations and consulates overseas. As Chief of the Division, Uanna was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of all State's personnel and facilities in the United States and abroad.

5|$|According to {{a poetic}} verse {{composed}} by the contemporary Icelandic skald Óttarr svarti, Knútr's subjects included Danes, Englishmen, Irishmen, and Islesmen. These Islanders could refer {{to either the}} folk of the Isles or Orkney, whilst the Irish seems {{to refer to the}} Dubliners. The fact that Sitriuc had been able to undertake a pilgrimage and return home to an intact kingdom in 1028 may demonstrate the extent of influence that Knútr held over the Irish Sea region. This authority, and Sitriuc's apparent close connections with Knútr, could account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> Sitriuc enjoyed during Knútr's reign.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, the walls were measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> and policing of the town.|$|E

5|$|There {{were also}} {{penalties}} enacted against the French officers whose neglectful behaviour {{had contributed to}} the mutiny at Yen Bay.

Neither Robin nor General Aubert, who were ultimately accountable for the failures of their subordinates, were punished. The former remained in Indochina as Governor General until retiring in 1936.

5|$|Two {{helicopters}} {{carrying a}} 60-man security detail—51 Marines and 9 US Navy SEALs—reached the embassy compound {{on the morning}} of January 5 and left with 61 evacuees. Throughout the day US and foreign nationals seeking evacuation arrived at the embassy compound, including the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff from the Soviet Union's embassy. Meanwhile, the embassy compound was prepared for the main evacuation, which occurred {{in the early morning hours}} of January 6. The first of four waves of helicopters—three for civilians and the fourth <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> detail and ambassador—left the ships at midnight (UTC+4). The final wave reached the ships at 03:43. A total of 281 evacuees were taken from the embassy, including eight ambassadors (and two other heads of missions) and 61 Americans.|$|E

5|$|Discontent {{crystallised}} into {{a wave of}} uprisings and rioting {{known as}} the Small Revolution (Kleine Revolutie) of 1787. The revolution was suppressed by levying the civil militias but it alarmed the Governors-General and opposition grew. The Small Revolution proved that the Austrian army was insufficient on its own to keep order without some popular support. The allegiance of the civil militias, who were already beginning to call themselves Patriots (Patriotten), was uncertain. Fearing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the regime, the Governors-General temporarily suspended the reforms without the Emperor's permission on 20 May 1787. They invited all aggrieved parties to express their opposition and grievances in petitions but this merely inflamed the regime's critics. The Emperor himself was furious and recalled his minister, Ludovico, Count di Belgiojoso. Alarmed by the level of unrest, Joseph eventually agreed to repeal his reforms to the judicial system and governance but left his clerical reforms in place. He hoped that, by removing the grievances of the states and middle classes, the opposition would become divided and would be easily suppressed. He also appointed a new Minister Plenipotentiary to oversee the province. The concession did not stop the opposition growing, inspired and funded by the Catholic clergy, which became especially notable at the University of Leuven.|$|E
5|$|During the Duke's {{march to}} the Danube Emperor LeopoldI offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E
5|$|Following the mutiny of the French Guards a {{few hours}} before the {{storming}} of the Bastille, the only troops immediately available <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the palace at Versailles were the aristocratic Garde du Corps (Body Guard) and the Cent-Suisses (Hundred Swiss). Both were primarily ceremonial units and lacked the numbers and training to provide effective protection for the royal family and the government. Accordingly, the Flanders Regiment (a regular infantry regiment of the Royal Army) was ordered to Versailles in late September 1789 by the king's minister of war, the Comte de Saint-Priest, as a precautionary measure. On 1 October, the officers at Versailles held a welcoming banquet for the officers of the new troops, a customary practice when a unit changed its garrison. The royal family briefly attended the affair, walking amongst the tables set up in the opera house of the palace. Outside, in the cour de marbre (central courtyard), the soldiers' toasts and oaths of fealty to the king grew more demonstrative as the night wore on.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{ownership}} of <b>securities</b> {{is governed by}} Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). This Article 8, a text of about thirty pages, underwent important recasting in 1994.

5|$|For {{the most}} part, barring {{intermittent}} passes and valleys (the major one being the corridor through Zhangjiakou and the Juyong Pass), the North China Plain remained shielded from the Mongolian steppe by the Yin Mountains. However, if this defence were breached, China's flat terrain offered no protection {{to the cities}} on the plain, including the imperial capitals of Beijing, Kaifeng, and Luoyang. Heading west along the Yin Mountains, the range ends where the Yellow River circles northwards upstream in the area known as the Ordos Looptechnically part of the steppe, but capable of irrigated agriculture. Although the Yellow River formed a theoretical natural boundary with the north, such a border so far into the steppe was difficult to maintain. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, but also <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of China proper. The region's strategic importance combined with its untenability led many dynasties to place their first walls here.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, No. 4 Commando was {{relieved}} by No. 47 (Royal Marine) Commando {{and moved to}} Middelburg and stayed at Bergen-Op-Zoom by April. While responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the immediate area, they conducted small raids from the sea against Zuid Holland. Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. On the No.4 Commando front the two French troops crossed the channel to Schouwen and Lieutenant Colonel Dawson accepted the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the region. Within days of the surrender No.4 Commando moved to Recklinghausen in Germany {{as part of the}} occupation forces. In Recklinghausen part of their duties were to provide the guard force for a civilian internment camp. The camp housed several thousand German civilians who were not prisoners of war. Inmates included those with no identification and those known to have served in concentration camps. The two French troops returned to French control and were demobilised. Other men were posted to No.s 3 and 6 Commandos in Britain, who were preparing for a move to the Far East to continue the fight in the Burma campaign. By June 1945 the strength of No. 4 Commando had been reduced to 188 all ranks. During a visit in October 1945, Lieutenant General Robert Sturges informed them that the War Office had decided to disband all army commandos. Those not due to be demobilised would be returned to their parent regiment or corps. No.4 Commando was formally disbanded in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' {{predecessor}} Caracalla {{was murdered}} on April 8, 217, {{during a period}} of war with the Parthians, near Carrhae while traveling en-route to visit a temple. His murderer was Justin Martialus, a soldier who was incensed after being declined the rank of centurion. Martialus was himself cut down by Caracalla's German Guards immediately afterwards, a convenient fact for Macrinus, at the time a Praetorian prefect, who was involved in the assassination. One reason for Macrinus to have intrigued against Caracalla was out of fear <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of his own life. A story documented by Roman writer Herodian and supported by some later historians details the events leading to Caracalla's death. The story goes that Macrinus, {{in the course of his}} employment, was often tasked with reading dispatches sent to Caracalla for him. One such dispatch detailed a prophecy, perhaps fabricated, from the oracle at Delphi suggesting that Macrinus was destined to kill Caracalla and succeed him as the next emperor.|$|E
