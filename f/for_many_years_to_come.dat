5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the Senate, that if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E
5|$|Like his grandfather, Edward III {{took steps}} to restore royal power, but during the 1340s the Black Death arrived in England. The losses from the epidemic, and the {{recurring}} plagues that followed it, significantly affected events in England <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Meanwhile, Edward, under pressure from France in Aquitaine, made a challenge for the French throne. Over the next century, English forces fought many campaigns in a long-running conflict that {{became known as the}} Hundred Years' War. Despite the challenges involved in raising the revenues to pay for the war, Edward's military successes brought an influx of plundered wealth to many parts of England and enabled substantial building work by the king. Many members of the English elite, including Edward's son the Black Prince, were heavily involved in campaigning in France and administering the new continental territories.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{source of}} wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade. The {{disruption}} of this trade caused by Myles Standish's raid at Wessagussett created great hardship for the colonists <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> and was directly cited by William Bradford as a contributing factor to the colonists' economic difficulties in their early years. The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay {{were known to be}} excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.|$|E

This was the last documented case of police harassment at gay discos <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parker contributed {{greatly to}} the modern jazz solo, one in which {{triplets}} and pick-up notes were used in unorthodox ways to lead into chord tones, affording the soloist with more freedom to use passing tones, which soloists previously avoided.

25|$|In 1989, two {{long-term}} members departed. One was bassist Rick Kemp, {{who needed}} to recover from a serious shoulder injury, exacerbated by playing bass on stage. His eventual replacement (after two tours, each with a different bassist) was Tim Harries, who was brought {{in less than two}} weeks before the band was scheduled to start a tour. A friend of Pegrum's, Harries was a self-taught rock bassist, as well as a classically trained pianist and double bassist. With Harries on board, Steeleye released Tempted and Tried (1989), an album that formed the basis for their live set <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E

Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> His comments may be {{regarded as one of the}} most significant events, as far as gay rights are concerned, of the decade.|$|E

25|$|October 3, 1924 was {{the first}} time Roosevelt {{traveled}} to Warm Springs, Georgia and it soon became his home away from home. <b>For</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> Warm Springs would be where Franklin would retreat in comfort and do hydrotherapy for his legs. On April 29, 1926 he bought the center with the intention of making it into a rehabilitation center for polio patients. One of Roosevelt's major goals was to get the American Orthopedic Association to endorse the resort, but he was rejected because there was no real progress in physical health. It is now the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation, a comprehensive rehabilitation facility operated by the State of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Karadžić {{continued}} collecting song {{well into}} the 1830s. He arrived in Montenegro {{in the fall of}} 1834. Infirm, he descended to the Bay of Kotor to winter there, and returned in the spring of 1835. It was there that Karadžić met Vuk Vrčević, an aspiring littérateur, born in Risan. From then on Vrčević became Karadžić's faithful and loyal collaborator who collected folk songs and tales and sent them to his address in Vienna <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Another equally diligent collaborator of Vuk Karadžić was another namesake from Boka Kotorska the Priest Vuk Popović. Both Vrčević and Popović were steadily and uselfishly involved in the gathering of the ethnographic, folklore and lexical material for Karadžić. Later, other collaborators joined Karadžić, including Milan Đ. Milićević.|$|E
25|$|Better {{dental health}} overall coupled with {{increased}} demand for more modern alternatives such as resin composite fillings (which match the tooth color), as well as public concern about the mercury content of dental amalgam, {{have resulted in a}} steady decline in dental amalgam use in developed countries, though overall amalgam use continues to rise worldwide. Given its superior strength, durability, and long life relative to the more expensive composite fillings, it will likely be used <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Over a lifetime, dietary sources of mercury are far higher than would ever be received from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth. For example, due to pollution of the world's oceans with heavy metals, products such as cod liver oil may contain significant levels of mercury.|$|E

25|$|In 1990 {{fortunes}} changed once more, in an {{affiliation with}} the New York Islanders. A gallant squad coached by ex-NHL defensive whiz Jim Roberts sneaked into the playoffs in the final week {{in part due to}} veteran minor-league goaltender Rick Knickle's (signed when injuries both in Springfield and Long Island sidelined the Indians' top three goaltenders) eight game undefeated streak, and on May 18, 1990, the team knocked off the heavily favored Rochester Americans in six games in the finals for the franchise's sixth Calder Cup. Future NHL goaltender Jeff Hackett won the playoff MVP, inspirational leader Rod Dallman provided tons of grit, while names such as Marc Bergevin, Tom Fitzgerald, team captain Rob DiMaio, Jeff Finley and Bill Berg were heard from by NHL fans <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Consort {{was first}} {{shown at the}} 1956 Commercial Motor Show. It was a {{development}} of the Venturer, but {{in place of the}} previous oval the four-part grill was now enclosed by a near-trapezoidal outline (though actually hexagonal), wider at the top than the bottom, with the headlamps outside. Trim was revised to be much squarer in outline, featuring ribbed brightwork, and the curved rear quarter lights, first standardised on the Venturer III, were now incorporated into the main window line. However, a year later the Consort II was announced, re-introducing the oval grill outline of the Venturer – but now surrounding a plainer grill with chrome flash across the middle - while the trim lines so recently squared up were softened once again. The evident popularity of the oval- shaped grill then ensured its survival as a Plaxton hallmark <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2007–08 season saw {{a return}} of Junior B Colts alumnus Drake Berehowsky to the team. This time as {{assistant}} coach. He left the team {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season. The Colts season was an average one. They would finish with a 28–34–3–3 record; good for seventh in the Eastern Conference. Second year forward Alex Hutchings led the Colts in offence throughout the year, finishing with a team high 54 points. Several other forwards including Tomas Marcinko, Cory McGillis, Stefan Della Rovere, and rookie Daniel Michalsky would add to the Colts offence. Throughout the year, several trades were made, sending goaltender Andrew Perugini, and high-scoring forward Vladimir Nikiforov away, while bringing in many new faces including Colt Kennedy, Ryan Berard, Andrew Clouthier, and future captain Dalton Prout. Goaltender Peter Di Salvo, defenceman Stephen Gaskin, Marcus Pepe as well as forward Kyle Clifford all made their debut for the Colts this year, becoming the core of a Colts team <b>for</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> In the playoffs the Colts would again meet Brampton Battalion, this time sweeping them in a four-game playoff series. In the conference semi-finals the Colts would lose a quick series to the Belville Bulls 4 games to 1.|$|E
