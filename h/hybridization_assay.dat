The constructed label contains the T 7 RNA polymerase promoter, the apoaequorin coding sequence and a downstream (dA/dT) (30). In the captured target configuration, biotinylated target DNA (233 bp) was captured on streptavidin-coated microtiter wells and hybridized to a poly(dT) -tailed detection probe. In the sandwich-type assay, the target DNA was hybridized simultaneously with an immobilized capture probe (through biotin/streptavidin) and a poly(dT) -tailed detection probe. In both configurations, the hybrids were reacted with poly(dA) -tailed apoaequorin DNA. The DNA label was subjected to in vitro transcription/translation to produce apoaequorin, which was converted to active aequorin in the reaction mixture. Generated aequorin was determined by its characteristic Ca(2 +) -triggered bioluminescence. Each DNA label was estimated to produce 156 aequorin molecules. As low as 0. 25 and 0. 5 amol of target DNA were detected with the sandwich-type and captured target <b>hybridization</b> <b>assays,</b> respectively, with a linear range spanning four orders of magnitude.

This assay, which combines a sensitive sandwich DNA hybridization reaction and a colorimetric protocol {{similar to those}} used in conventional enzyme immunoassays, was shown to be suitable for detecting H. pylori-infected gastric biopsy specimens and for monitoring the eradication of the pathogen after treatment. The specificity and sensitivity of the colorimetric <b>hybridization</b> <b>assay</b> were tested by assaying 27 H. pylori strains (4 reference and 23 clinical isolates), 9 strains of other Helicobacter spp. or Campylobacter spp., and 11 clinical isolates of other urease-positive bacteria. The likelihood of H. pylori detection in gastric biopsy specimens by the colorimetric <b>hybridization</b> <b>assay</b> was evaluated with 23 H. pylori-positive and 41 H. pylori-negative biopsy specimens on the basis of positive and negative results, respectively, of culture, rapid urease test, histological examination, and PCR. Biopsy specimens from 33 treated patients, endoscopied 4 to 8 weeks after the end of treatment, were also tested. All H. pylori strains showed positive results in the colorimetric <b>hybridization</b> <b>assay,</b> presenting optical densities at 450 nm (OD 450 S) of > or = 3. 0. None of the other Helicobacter spp., Campylobacter spp., or the clinical isolates of other urease-positive bacteria showed OD 450 S equal to or greater than the cutoff (mean OD 450 cutoff, 0. 208). The colorimetric <b>hybridization</b> <b>assay</b> detected all 23 H. pylori-positive biopsy specimens (mean OD 450, 2. 910 +/- 0. 295), while none of the H. pylori-negative biopsy specimens was shown to be positive in the assay (mean OD 450, 0. 108 +/- 0. 025). H. pylori was considered to be not eradicated from three of the posttreatment biopsy specimens by culture, rapid urease test, histological examination, and PCR.

To compare their relative efficiencies, these two sets of probes were radiolabeled with 32 P and were applied to 74 strains of E. coli with known enterotoxin profiles and to 156 previously unexamined E. coli isolates. The enterotoxigenic bacteria Vibrio cholerae O 1, Vibrio cholerae non-O 1 (NAG), Yersinia enterocolitica, and E. coli harboring the plasmid vectors of the polynucleotide gene probes were examined for further evaluation of probe specificity. The two classes of probes showed a perfect concordance in their specific detection and differentiation of enterotoxigenic E. coli. In the analysis of six strains, the signal strength on autoradiography after hybridization with oligonucleotides was weaker than that obtained after hybridization with polynucleotide probes.

40|$|Quantitative {{detection}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in serum or plasma is of significance for monitoring of therapy and {{establishment of the}} prognosis of the disease, {{as well as for}} infectivity assessment and quality control of the diagnosis. Unfortunately, various commercially available test kits for HBV DNA yielded conflicting quantitative results, with differences of up to a factor of 120. The Eurohep Pathobiology Group has established two reference samples of plasma from HBV carriers and determined as accurately as possible the number of HBV DNA molecules in these samples. Plasma donations from two single highly viremic carriers of HBV genotype A (HBV surface antigen subtype adw 2) and genotype D (ayw 2 / 3), respectively, were collected, and coded dilutions of these samples were analyzed by members of the Eurohep Pathobiology Group. Quantitative results from the seven laboratories reporting consistent results were initially divergent. Limiting dilution and nested PCR assays suffered from incomplete DNA extraction. <b>Hybridization</b> <b>assays</b> used inaccurately quantitated cloned DNA as a reference. Two <b>hybridization</b> <b>assays</b> could not be calibrated directly with cloned HBV DNA, because virion-derived DNA reacted much less efficiently. After identification and elimination of these problems, limiting-dilution assays from three laboratories and <b>hybridization</b> <b>assays</b> from two producers generated consistent and concordant results: 2. 7 × 109 HBV DNA molecules/ml (range, 2. 1 × 109 to 3. 4 × 109 HBV DNA molecules/ml) in the plasma from the carrier of genotype A and 2. 6 × 109 HBV DNA molecules/ml (range, 2. 1 × 109 to 3. 0 × 109 HBV DNA molecules/ml in the plasma from the carrier of genotype D.
