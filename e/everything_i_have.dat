I have done nothing in my life! <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done was a waste! <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done was worthless!" [...] When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, Clark said that more {{resources}} needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty. He also said that the United States needed a [...] "reawakening of a conscience." [...] The entire subcommittee sent a letter to President Lyndon B. Johnson about their discoveries, writing about [...] "conditions of malnutrition and widespread hunger...that {{can only be described as}} shocking." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian quoted Khan's {{reaction}} to watching al Qaeda's attack on September 11, 2001. I {{could not believe}} my own eyes. It was like <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said, <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been told by al-Qaeda. I was in no doubt. Same plan. Perhaps someone from the training camp was on board one of those planes. Perhaps, if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not run away, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> been there.|$|R

500|$|Delivering {{lectures and}} giving interviews, Goldman enthusiastically {{supported}} the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists. She wrote regularly for Spain and the World, a biweekly newspaper {{focusing on the}} civil war. In May 1937, however, Communist-led forces attacked anarchist strongholds and broke up agrarian collectives. Newspapers in England and elsewhere accepted the timeline of events offered by the Second Spanish Republic at face value. British journalist George Orwell, present for the crackdown, wrote: [...] "he accounts of the Barcelona riots in May...beat <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever seen for lying." ...|$|E
500|$|Until 30 October, he {{was still}} capable of {{speaking}} unhindered. His doctors performed several surgeries to no avail, and the cancer spread to his throat. One night, he suffered an agonizing attack of meningitis. In a fever-induced delirium, Rio Branco said: [...] "Do not disturb Slavery's march [...]" [...] His last warning went unheeded, for rather than simply allowing slavery to slowly die out, the last remnants of slavery would be aggressively extinguished in 1888 by Princess Isabel and his former minister João Alfredo (by then President of the Council). At 7:05am on 1 November 1880, Rio Branco died. His last words were: [...] "I will confirm before God <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> affirmed to men." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{reception}} amazed me. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{been greatly}} agitated as I heard her approach, turning {{over in my}} mind what I should first say to her, but now <b>I</b> forgot <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> prepared. [...] "No what?" [...] I exclaimed.|$|R
50|$|Events {{in my life}} {{caused me}} to start {{questioning}} my goals and the correctness of <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned.

500|$|Birkett {{became a}} popular defence counsel, {{something}} that on occasion caused him trouble; {{he was once}} forced to refuse a defendant's request to act as his representative because Birkett was expected in a different court. He impressed the Bench in Birmingham so much that, in 1919, he was advised by a local Circuit Judge to move to London to advance his career. Although he was initially hesitant, saying that [...] "competition in London is on quite a different scale, and if I failed there, I would have lost <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> built up here", a case he took in 1920 changed the situation. He acted as a junior for the prosecution in the so-called Green Bicycle Case against Edward Marshall-Hall. Although he lost, he sufficiently impressed Marshall-Hall for the latter to offer him a place in his chambers in London. He had no connections with the solicitors in London, and the clerk at his new chambers got around this lack of contacts by using him as counsel in cases involving Marshall-Hall, who as a King's Counsel could appear in court only when accompanied by a junior barrister such as Birkett.|$|E
500|$|Chopra found Mary Kom a {{very special}} and {{personal}} film due to the inspiring theme. She revealed that she channelled the grief of father's death into the film: [...] "I started this film at the hardest point in my life, four days after my father passed away. All my grief, <b>everything,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> shoved into this movie. A part of my soul has gone into it." [...] In an interview with Daily News and Analysis, Chopra revealed that since she could not look like her, she {{did not try to}} imitate Kom as her main focus was to represent Kom's spirit and personality. In July 2013, Chopra visited Kom's home town of Manipur to learn more about her life. As part of her research, Chopra stayed with Kom and her family for three to four days, and went to her boxing academy and church to learn more about her. Kom stated, [...] "When she came to Manipur, she knew about boxing so I gave her tips as a mother and a wife, how I went about managing my home and profession, how I live with my family– basically she got to know aspects of my family life." ...|$|E
500|$|Profitable though La fille du tambour-major was, {{composing}} it left Offenbach {{less time}} to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera. Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, Les contes fantastiques d'Hoffmann, by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré. [...] Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair. Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera Les contes d'Hoffmann ("The Tales of Hoffmann"). He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, [...] "I would give <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to be at the première". However, Offenbach did not live to finish the piece. He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration. [...] Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making significant changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the Opéra-Comique's director, Carvalho. [...] The opera was first seen at the Opéra-Comique on 10 February 1881; Guiraud added recitatives for the Vienna premiere, in December 1881, and other versions were made later.|$|E
60|$|That morning I {{went for}} a ride with the girls, and both had heard {{something}} {{and wanted to know}} <b>everything.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> become a news-carrier, and Miss Sampson never thought of questioning me in regard to my fund of information.|$|R

I was giving Kevin <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> got, I thought he was gonna beat us, he had a better car today, I guess he was a little short on fuel.” ...|$|R
500|$|The {{second part}} to the show's behind the scenes look was {{released}} on August 30, 2011. In {{the second part of}} the behind the scenes special, Beyoncé is shown calling the shots and rehearsing with her band, leading up to the sold-out shows and clips of fans waiting in line show appreciation and dedication for Beyoncé. The third {{part to the}} behind the scenes look was revealed on September 10, 2011. The behind the scenes third part showed the orchestra and back up dancers preparing for the performance as the instrumental to [...] "I Was Here" [...] plays in the background. Before Beyoncé takes to the stage, a clip of her praying with everyone involved in the concert is shown. On her way to the stage, Beyoncé describes in depth what she hopes to achieve during these 4 Intimate Nights stating, [...] "I just want to give them <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> I'm so excited about performing the album, and it's just such a beautiful vibe inside people are just ready to dance and enjoy the music. —It's all good." [...] The third part to the behind the scenes look ends with Beyoncé taking to the stage addressing the crowd with [...] "Hello Roseland!" [...] The fourth, and final, behind the scenes look into the intimate show was released exclusively through Citibank's Facebook page on September 14, 2011. The final part of the behind the scenes look was the commercial for the concerts' DVD release.|$|E
2500|$|In one post, Clarett {{summed up}} his {{attitude}} towards prison by saying [...] "Understand my struggle {{so you can}} respect my hustle. I am never coming back here, believe that. Never, I am cool on this. It is first-class living from the day I get out. I WILL NEVER SETTLE FOR LESS, EVER AGAIN. That goes for communication, personal relationships, housing, education, friendships, and travel arrangements. <b>Everything.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the fire in my eyes" ...|$|E
2500|$|Marino Mannoia was disillusioned by {{the little}} reward and support he {{received}} from the Italian government {{in relation to the}} sacrifice he made and family members that had been killed. [...] "I am disappointed, embittered, after <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done for the fight against the Mafia since 1989," [...] he said. He attempted a suicide by taking a cocktail of pharmaceuticals in July 2011, but was saved by his wife who got him to the hospital in time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tush!' he said. 'I do {{not believe}} in justice; there is no justice left. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> given <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> for him. <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> made any sacrifice.

5000|$|... "I was {{inspired}} by poems of Stefan George, the German poet, to compose music {{to some of his}} poems and, surprisingly, without any expectation on my part, these songs showed a style quite different from <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written before."

6000|$|... "Oh, sir," [...] said Mrs. Brixham, [...] "I know {{it to my}} cost. I {{borrowed}} from him a little money five years ago; and though <b>I</b> <b>have</b> paid him many times over, I am entirely in his power. I am ruined by him, sir. <b>Everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> is his. He's a dreadful man." ...|$|R
2500|$|McAlpine's {{carefree}} attitude sometimes put him {{in conflict}} with his disciplinarian manager. In his autobiography, McLean describes his frustration with McAlpine's unwillingness to undertake specialist goalkeeping training, saying, [...] "Hamish McAlpine was the one player {{who was able to}} destroy single-handedly <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> ever thought or believed about the game of football". The pair's most serious disagreement occurred in 1979, resulting in McAlpine being sent home from a tournament in Japan. McAlpine was suspended by the club and temporarily replaced by former England goalkeeper Peter Bonetti.|$|E
2500|$|Jeffrey Pearcy {{also claims}} the {{statements}} regarding his involvement were fabricated by King to assist her son, {{who has been}} in prison for 14 years and has 24 years left on his sentence. [...] "I have been up front and honest about <b>everything.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> willingly given them everything. Take it, I mean, it's there", he said. [...] "My heart goes out to the Bobo family. It could have very well been one of my kids. For someone to give them false hope, and that's exactly what's been done to them", he said. [...] "But for the justice system to just haul someone in and destroy their whole life, I mean, there's no sense in that at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russell {{soon came}} to believe that Wittgenstein was a genius, {{especially}} after he had examined Wittgenstein's written work. He wrote in November 1911 that he had at first thought Wittgenstein might be a crank, but soon decided he was a genius: [...] "Some of his early views made the decision difficult. He maintained, for example, at one time that all existential propositions are meaningless. This was in a lecture room, and I invited him to consider the proposition: 'There is no hippopotamus in this room at present.' When he refused to believe this, I looked under all the desks without finding one; but he remained unconvinced." [...] Three months after Wittgenstein's arrival Russell told Morrell: [...] "I love him & feel he will solve the problems I am too old to solve ... He is the young man one hopes for." [...] Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that Russell’s encouragement had proven his salvation, and had ended nine years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually thought of suicide. In encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life. However, while this encouragement played a positive role, Wittgenstein’s later life was riddled with depression nonetheless. The role-reversal between him and Wittgenstein was such that he wrote in 1916, after Wittgenstein had criticized Russell's own work: [...] "His criticism, tho' I don't think you realized it at the time, was an event of first-rate importance in my life, and affected <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done since. I saw that he was right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work in philosophy." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This {{was my job}} and I was blessed. Then my {{life and}} <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> dreamed of and {{accomplished}} flashed before my eyes as I laid {{there on the ground}} trying to understand why I was in such pain and why my legs just wouldnt move." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dresses ARE nice. I love pretty things. I {{remember}} the first pretty dress I ever had--the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our school concert. Before that <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> was so ugly. It {{seemed to me that}} I stepped into a new world that night." ...|$|R
50|$|If I owned a {{newspaper}} and if I didn't {{like the way}} somebody else was doing things—some politician, say—I'd fight them with <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>had.</b> Only <b>I</b> wouldn't show him in a convict suit with stripes—so his children could see the picture in the paper.

2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by <b>everything</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
