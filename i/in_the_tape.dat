During his Volta Laboratory period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a magnetic field on a record {{as a means of}} reproducing sound.

25|$|Briggs' {{love for}} {{baseball}} triggered {{another piece of}} research. During World War II the government had mandated that rubber in baseballs be replaced by cork. Complaints about the new balls lead Briggs to test them, and in 1945 he demonstrated that the new baseballs were inferior. This was done by addressing {{the issue of whether}} or not a pitched baseball could curve out of the plane of the pitch. With the help of two pitchers from the Washington Senators baseball club and his 1917 wind tunnel he studied the effect of spin and speed on the trajectory and established the relationship between the amount of spin and the curvature of the ball (see curveball). To measure the spin, he attached a lightweight tape to the ball and counted the number of twists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> This was a popular topic in newspapers and is probably the most widely known of his research.|$|E

On December 6, 1988, Superior Court Commissioner Eleanor M. Palk issued a ruling dismissing the libel cause of action, but did not dismiss the slander charges. On December 16, 1988, Palk ruled that Cox, his defense attorneys, and expert witnesses could view a 60-hour est organization videotape. Cox's attorneys had requested to view the video {{in order to determine}} if material contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> could support expert witness testimony from cult experts.

According to testimony given by Cox in his nomination hearing to become Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the case was dismissed with prejudice in 1992.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{currently}} {{not unusual for}} the rim of a bodhran to be covered with electrical tape, either by the drum-maker or the owner. This both reduces [...] "edge-loading" [...] (where the vibrations in the skin hit the rim and bounce back {{toward the center of}} the drum), and dampens unwanted overtones, allowing for greater control of the drum's sound. Electrical tape is preferred because the adhesive is rubber-based and will stretch with the skin even after bonding to it, lessening the likelihood of bubbles and other changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> occurring when the skin tension is changed by tuning or atmospheric conditions. Owners of lower quality drums, with thick and rough skins, may also choose to sand the skin very lightly to reduce the rasp when the tipper strikes the face of the drum. Many effects of these and other modifications to the drum-skin, especially high quality skins, can also be achieved through regular use of the drum over time.|$|E

Participants were blindfolded and required to complete a target end/mid range position with the hand. They performed six trials under two experimental conditions; no tape and therapeutic tape. EMG activity was measured by surface electrodes, and proprioception {{was measured by the}} FASTRAK electromagnetic motion tracking system. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA showed that UT and AD activities decreased 2. 65 % (p= 0. 001), and SA muscular activities increased 1. 9 % (p= 0. 015) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> condition. <b>The</b> proprioceptive feedback magnitude was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>taping</b> condition than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> no <b>taping</b> condition (11. 9 ◦, p< 0. 005).

2500|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in magnetic tape was multitrack recording, {{in which the}} tape is divided into multiple tracks parallel with each other. Analog magnetic tape recording introduces noise, usually called [...] "hiss", caused by the finite size of the magnetic particles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tape.</b> There is a direct tradeoff between noise and economics. Signal-to-noise ratio is increased at higher speeds and with wider tracks, and decreased at lower speeds and with narrower tracks. By the late 1960s, disk reproducing equipment became so good that audiophiles soon became aware {{that some of the}} noise audible on recordings was not surface noise or deficiencies in their equipment, but reproduced tape hiss. Before 1963, when Philips introduced the Compact audio cassette, almost all tape recording had used the reel-to-reel (also called [...] "open reel") format. Previous attempts package the tape in a convenient cassette that required no threading met with limited success. The most successful tape was 8-track cartridge used primarily in automobiles for playback only.|$|E
