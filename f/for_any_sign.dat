5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Watt {{arranged}} for a major test of the CH system at Bawdsey with many aircraft involved. Dowding had been promoted to Chief of Fighter Command, and was on hand to watch. Things did not go well; for unknown reasons the radar did not pick up the approaching aircraft until they were far too close to arrange interception. Dowding was watching the screens intently <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of the bombers, failing to find one when he heard them pass overhead.

500|$|Ballard {{realized}} that {{looking for the}} wreck itself using sonar was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic, drawing {{on the experience of}} the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion; he would look for the debris field instead, using Argos cameras rather than sonar. Whereas sonar could not distinguish man-made debris on the sea bed from natural objects, cameras could. The debris field would also be a far bigger target, stretching a mile (1.6km) or longer, whereas Titanic itself was only [...] wide. The search required round-the-clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed, with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of debris. After a week of fruitless searching, at 12.48am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorrs screens. One of them was identified as a boiler, identical to those shown in pictures from 1911. The following day, {{the main part of the}} wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before. The discovery made headlines around the world.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the flight}} spotted no Chinese, at 14:40 Koenig radioed that Brown {{appeared}} to be trailing fuel. The damage had likely come by small arms fire from Chinese infantry, who were known {{to hide in the}} snow and to ambush passing aircraft by firing in unison. At least one bullet had ruptured a fuel line. Brown, losing fuel pressure and increasingly unable to control the aircraft, dropped his external fuel tanks and rockets and attempted to land the craft in a snow-covered clearing {{on the side of a}} mountain. Brown crashed into a bowl-shaped valley at approximately [...] The aircraft broke up violently upon impact and was destroyed. In the crash, Brown's leg was pinned beneath the fuselage of the aircraft, and he stripped off his helmet and gloves in an attempt to free himself, before waving to the other pilots, who were circling close overhead. The other pilots had thought he had died in the crash. Brown had crash-landed near Somong-ni, [...] behind Chinese lines in [...] weather, and the other pilots began a Mayday radio to any heavy transport aircraft in the area as they canvassed the mountain <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of Chinese ground forces who might threaten Brown. They received a signal that a rescue helicopter would come as soon as possible, but Brown's aircraft was smoking and a fire had started near its internal fuel tanks.|$|E

2500|$|Annabella did {{not have}} a close {{relationship}} with the young Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as [...] "it": [...] "I talk to it for your satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own." [...] In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of moral deviation.

2500|$|Her eight {{letters to}} Sigismund Augustus, all written between November 1547 and March 1548 from Dubingiai, {{are the only}} {{surviving}} love letters of the period. However, they are formulaic and use flowery language. Above all, her letters show her humility and subservience to her husband. Barbara habitually refers to herself as his most humble and smallest servant. She inquires about his health, thanks him <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of his good grace and favor, asks him not to forget her. Letters written to others, particularly those by her secretary, are similarly standard though she manages to include more honest and warm greetings and wishes. Initially, Sigismund Augustus lectured her on {{the proper use of}} the royal [...] "we" [...] after she sent letters with singular [...] "I". She rarely writes about herself or politics. She often inquired about recipient's health and wished them good health, trusting god and his good grace. Her correspondence with her brother was controlled by Sigismund Augustus; therefore she wrote several letters to him in secret from her husband.|$|E
2500|$|Once waterborne, debris becomes mobile. Flotsam can {{be blown}} by the wind, or follow {{the flow of}} ocean {{currents}}, often ending {{up in the middle}} of oceanic gyres where currents are weakest. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is one such example of this, comprising a vast region of the North Pacific Ocean rich with anthropogenic wastes. Estimated to be double the size of Texas, the area contains more than 3 million tons of plastic. In fact, patches may be large enough to be picked up by satellites. For example, when the Malaysian Flight MH370, disappeared in 2014, satellites were scanning the oceans surface <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of it, and instead of finding debris from the plane they came across floating garbage. [...] The gyre contains approximately six pounds of plastic for every pound of plankton. The oceans may contain as much as one hundred million tons of plastic. [...] Its estimated that each garbage patch in the ocean have up to one million tons of trash swirling around in them, sometimes extending down to around one hundred feet below the surface. Some items that have been extracted from these garbage patches are: a drum of hazardous chemicals, plastic hangers, tires, cable cords, a ton of tangled netting etc.|$|E

2500|$|Rostron {{ordered the}} ship's heating and hot water cut off {{in order to}} make as much steam as {{possible}} available for the engines, and had extra lookouts on watch to spot ice. Cottam, meanwhile, messaged the Titanic that Carpathia was [...] "coming as quickly as possible and expect to be there within four hours." [...] Cottam refrained from sending more signals after this, trying to keep the air clear for Titanic's distress signals. Carpathia reached the edge of the ice field by 2:45a.m., and for the next two hours dodged icebergs as small growlers of ice ground along the hull plates.. The Carpathia arrived at the distress position at 4:00a.m., approximately {{an hour and a half}} after the Titanic went down, claiming more than 1,500 lives. For the next four and a half hours, the ship took on the 705 survivors of the disaster from Titanics 20 lifeboats. Survivors were given blankets and coffee, and then escorted by stewards to the dining rooms. [...] Others went on deck to survey the ocean <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of their loved ones.

2500|$|The East German regime imposed an {{official}} ideology that {{was reflected in}} all its media and all the schools. Anyone who indicated the least deviation invited {{a visit from the}} Stasi (secret police). The official line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and in Dimitrov's theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of financial capitalism. The official party line stated that the United States had caused the breakup of the coalition against Hitler. It was now the bulwark of reaction worldwide, with a heavy reliance on warmongering {{for the benefit of the}} [...] "terrorist international of murderers on Wall Street". East Germans were told they had a heroic role to play as a front-line against the evil Americans. However Schnoor argues that few East Germans believed it. They had seen enough of the Russians since 1945—a half-million Soviet troops were still stationed in East Germany as late as 1989. Furthermore, they were exposed to information from relatives in the West, as well as the American Radio Free Europe broadcasts, and West German media. The official Communist media ridiculed the modernism and cosmopolitanism of American culture, and denigrated the features of the American way of life, especially jazz music and rock 'n roll. The East German regime relied heavily on its tight control of youth organizations to rally them, with scant success, against American popular culture. The older generations were more concerned with the poor quality of food, housing, and clothing, which stood in dramatic contrast to the prosperity of West Germany. Professionals in East Germany were watched <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of deviation from the party line; their privileges were at risk. The solution was to either comply or flee to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the crackdown and the Berlin wall of 1961.|$|E
2500|$|... “Political work” done by politruks and kommissars took {{much of the}} soldier's {{spare time}} as at least one hour every day was given to {{political}} indoctrination into Communism for soldiers who not engaged in combat. The term Nazi was never {{used to describe the}} enemy as the term was an acronym for National-Sozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (National Socialist German Workers' Party) as the politruks and kommissars found explaining why the enemy called themselves National Socialists to be too confusing for the frontoviks. The preferred terms for the enemy were fascists, Gitlerits [...] (Hitlerites-Russian has no H), Germanskii and nyemetzi (a derogatory Russian term for Germans). The commissars had the duty of monitoring the officers <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>sign</b> of disloyalty and a network of informers known as seksots within the ranks. In October 1942, the system of dual command, which dated back to the Russian Civil War, where the officers shared authority with the commissars, was abolished and henceforward only officers had the power of command. Many commissars after the Stalin's Decree 307 of 9 October 1942 were shocked to find how much they were hated by the officers and men. The commissars now become the politruks or deputy commanders for political affairs. The politruks no longer had the power of command, but still evaluated both officers and men for their political loyalty, carried out political indoctrination and had the power to order summary executions of anyone suspected of cowardice or treason. Such executions were known as devyat gram (nine grams- a reference to the weight of a bullet), pustit v rakhod (to expend someone) or vyshka (a shortened form of vysshaya mera nakazanija- extreme penalty). Despite these fearsome powers, many of the frontoviks were often openly contemptuous of the politruks if subjected to excessively long boring lectures on the finer points of Marxism–Leninism and officers tended to win conflicts with the poltitruks as military merit started to count more in the Great Patriotic War than did political zeal. Relations between the officers and men were usually good with junior officers in particular being seen as soratnik (comrade in arms) as they lived under the same conditions and faced the same dangers as the frontovik. Officers usually had only a high school education as very few had gone to university, and coming from the same social milieu as their men ensured that they could relate to them. The frontovik usually addressed their company commanders as Batya (father).|$|E
