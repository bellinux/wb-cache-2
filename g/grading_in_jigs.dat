40|$|Coal use is {{regarded}} as one of main sources of anthropogenic propagation of mercury in the environment. The coal cleaning is listed among methods of the mercury emission reduction. The article concerns the statistical assessment of mercury separation between coal cleaning products. Two industrial processes employed in the Polish coal preparation plants are analysed: coal cleaning in heavy media vessels and coal cleaning <b>in</b> <b>jigs.</b> It was found that the arithmetic mean mercury content in coarse and medium coal size fractions for clean coal from heavy media vessels, amounts 68. 9 μg/kg, and most of the results lay below the mean value, while for rejects it amounts 95. 5 μg/kg. It means that it is for around 25 μg/kg greater than in the clean coal. The arithmetic mean mercury content in raw coal smalls amounts around 118 mg/kg. The cleaning of smalls <b>in</b> <b>jigs</b> results <b>in</b> clean coal and steam coal blends characterized by mean mercury content 96. 8 μg/kg and rejects with mean mercury content 184. 5 μg/kg...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{meet the}} needs of the jigging process control, attempt to combine the {{studying}} on jigging mechanism with the operating and detecting parameters so as to use them in practical producing control. On the basis of studying the motion characteristic of water <b>in</b> <b>jig,</b> the motion of particles with different size and density was researched. A laboratorial model jig and a high-speed dynamic analysis meter were used and 60 group conditions were designed in experiment. The motion rule and curves were gained through analyzing the huge amount of data and pictures with the high-speed dynamic analysis meter. The conclusion is that the characteristic of the position curve of the particles is similar with the typical damped vibration. Then the motion differential equation of the particles was educed imitating the damped vibration and the solution equations were gained. In the equations the motion parameters of the particles <b>in</b> <b>jig,</b> such as velocity, acceleration, force etc. are in a direct proportion to the air pressure, and have a definite non-linear relationship with the jigging cycle, thickness, mobility of the jig bed, mass and size of the particles and so on. The equations might be used directly in control process of jig...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic energy {{dissipation}} within a jigging cycle has been mechanically analyzed using data {{developed in a}} highly instrumented and controlled pilot scale Baum jig. The analysis {{is based on the}} use of the energy and momentum equations for the fluid. It was found that energy balances on the water <b>in</b> the <b>jig</b> failed to close because of elastic deformation of the jig body, rather than inaccuracies in the measurement techniques or failure to account for heat transfer. This deformation problem appears to be common <b>in</b> either pilot <b>jigs</b> or commercial jigs. An empirical means of correcting the energy balance was devised and applied to the data with some success. Using this compensation method, the energy balance was improved. The likely energy balance indicates that (i) less than 7 % of the energy of the incoming compressed air is expended <b>in</b> the <b>jig</b> system, (ii) less than 5 % of the energy from the compressed air is actually dissipated <b>in</b> the <b>jig</b> bed, (iii) the kinetic energy input from the hutch water supply is effectively negligible, in comparison to the energy input from the compressed air, and (iv) about 2. 5 - 3. 7 % of the energy from compressed air is dissipated around the bed plate...|$|R
