500|$|The Castle of Zafra in Guadalajara, Spain {{stood in}} for the Tower of Joy in the {{flashback}} scene involving a young Ned Stark and Ser Arthur Dayne, as witnessed by Bran Stark and the Three-eyed Raven. During filming of the scene, it was reported widely among media sources after {{a fan of the}} series had snuck their way onto a nearby mountain and filmed {{a small portion of the}} fighting scenes that occurred. Robert Aramayo (young Eddard Stark) spoke about the filming of the scene in an interview following the airing of the episode and stated, [...] "We all went through a bunch of training, which continued through our three- or four-day shoot in Spain. It was intense. It was not easy. I did not find it easy to shoot that fight sequence. It's not an easy routine at all. And Luke Roberts, who plays Arther Dayne, he's incredible, man." [...] He continued, [...] "If your move's getting blocked, you obviously can't know that, just like when you're playing a scene through dialogue. You can't know the response your scene partner gives you is going to be the response you'll get. You hope it is. Likewise, in a fight, if you're going to chop somebody's arm off or stab them in the gut — the intention is to chop that arm off or stab someone in the gut, and you have to play that intention fully. I didn't expect it, but <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> skill in terms of acting to play." ...|$|E

[...] "Fate has an interesting way of working these things out... Yes, we had a falling out, but we're working together again and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> worries off my mind knowing Eric is the man for us", Schuldiner told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.|$|E

2500|$|The Coalition forces began {{constructing}} extensive siege works around Maubeuge. On {{the first}} day, the French garrison sortied against the Cense de Château but were repulsed after stiff fighting. Maubeuge was supplied for a normal garrison but {{far too many}} soldiers were trapped there. On 10 October, Ferrand had to put the troops on half-rations, while hundreds of sick and dying soldiers crowded the hospitals. On the 13 October, the French enjoyed initial success in a sortie against the Bois du Tilleul, but troops sent out to help mistakenly fired on their own friends and the French were compelled to retreat. The Coalition established batteries of 20 24-pound cannons against the town. [...] After the Coalition army opened its bombardment {{on the night of}} 14 October, the morale of the garrison sank. When some soldiers complained to Chancel that they were hungry and tired he replied, [...] "Listen young men, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> work and privation in order to gain the honor to fight and die for your country." [...] Representative Jean-Baptiste Drouet tried to cut his way out of Maubeuge with some dragoons but was captured. Denounced for abandoning the place, Drouet claimed his escape would have raised the spirits of the garrison.|$|E
