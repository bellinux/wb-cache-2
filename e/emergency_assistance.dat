5|$|In late November, Typhoon Durian brought {{even greater}} devastation to the Philippines and {{prompted}} greater need for international assistance. On December11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1billion PHP (US$25.6million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000people and left more than US$1.6billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for <b>emergency</b> <b>assistance</b> to the nation, {{in the form}} of US$46million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided â‚¬2million (US$1.9million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian. The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.|$|E

In addition, the Nashville Predators announced that for their game on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, half the ticket sales revenue would be donated to the American Red Cross to help with their efforts, and that fans could make additional donations to Red Cross volunteers at the arena's main entrances.

On the morning of October 16, BELCO switched its focus from Fay to Gonzalo, leaving around 1,500 households without power; the remaining affected customers were asked to refrain from calling to report outages. Ahead of the storm, the Royal Navy frigate HMS Argyll sailed from the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with <b>emergency</b> <b>assistance.</b> Public beaches were closed as hurricane swells began to build, and {{the decision was made to}} shut down the Causeway early on October 17, based on forecasts of long-duration severe winds. Additionally, L.F.Wade International Airport closed prior to the storm's onslaught, accounting for 62canceled commercial flights. Three cruise ships were diverted from the island.|$|E

5|$|While Marco {{was still}} {{spinning}} {{in the western}} Caribbean, the Government of Honduras allotted 70million HNL ($5.6million 1996USD) in <b>emergency</b> <b>assistance.</b> Following the storm, several countries contributed cash toward the recovery of Honduras, including: Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States; cash donations collectively totaled slightly more than $438,000. In addition, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs contributed an emergency grant, worth $10,000. Japan donated 40tents, 10water purifiers, 480soaps, and 3emergency health kits in lieu of money. Norway donated almost $71,000 worth of food, medicines, and clothing. Spain also contributed medicine and transportation, costing $156,250. The United States donated plastic sheeting, water containers, and family food bags. The primary contributor of non-government aid was the Red Cross.

5|$|After Hurricane Fay caused {{extensive}} {{power outages}} {{on the island}} just days before, residents of Bermuda were forced to complete preparations for Gonzalo in haste. Banks, businesses, schools, and government offices closed {{in advance of the}} storm, while the Royal Navy ship HMS Argyll left its post in the Caribbean to provide Bermuda with <b>emergency</b> <b>assistance.</b> The cyclone gradually weakened before crossing directly over central Bermuda at Category 2 strength around 00:30 UTC on October 18. Gonzalo battered the island with wind gusts as high as , downing hundreds of trees and creating widespread roof damage. At the height of the storm, about 31,000 out of 36,000 total electricity customers were without power; service was not fully restored until early November. Many roads were impassable immediately following the hurricane, and in many cases the damage done by Gonzalo was indistinguishable from that of Fay. Bermuda Regiment soldiers and sailors from the Argyll took part in initial cleanup and repairs on the territory, and preliminary assessments revealed that the storm did not compare to the devastation of Hurricane Fabian in 2003. Catastrophe modelling firms estimated that Bermuda suffered up to $400million in losses, and despite the heavy disruptions, no deaths or serious injuries were reported there.|$|E

Numerous weekend events were called off throughout the Canadian Maritimes, including the Stan Rogers Folk Festival. Multiple boat-owners and fisherman took extra precautions by battening down hatches and tying extra lines to wharves to keep ships and boats from coming loose in the storm. Environment Canada officials issued high wind warnings in addition to earlier tropical storm warnings for the Maritimes and considered imposing rainfall warnings for western portions of Prince Edward Island as well. Province-managed parks in Nova Scotia, including beaches and camping grounds, were shut down prior to Arthur's arrival, and several airlines waived transfer fees. Officials in Moncton stated that city personnel {{would be prepared to}} respond to potential issues caused by Arthur, such as flooding or fallen trees, while the Canadian Red Cross readied volunteers in case of the need for <b>emergency</b> <b>assistance.</b> The Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station took precautionary measures against the storm, with Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission employees deployed to the site.|$|E
5|$|The FSM {{government}} {{estimated that}} residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3â€“6 {{months following the}} typhoon. Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April1. <b>Emergency</b> <b>assistance</b> across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was {{the large number of}} trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April6, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean. Relief supplies stockpiled by the Micronesian Red Cross were distributed {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April8. On April14, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen noodles, and water.|$|E

The European Commission channeled â‚¬2million (US$2.1million) through the European Community Humanitarian Office for use by various relief organizations.

Other countries sent aid through their respective International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies branch. Following an initial disaster declaration by United States Ambassador to India Dick Celeste, the United States Agency for International Development contributed US$7,482,000 through Food for Peace and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance to complement recovery efforts. The United Nations Children's Fund allocated more than US$100,000to help supply basic health and shelter needs, while the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs made a similar allocation through an emergency grant and with reserves from an earlier grant from Norway.|$|E
