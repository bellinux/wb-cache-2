5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, it <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> the court should not merely rely on international law to determine {{the meaning of the}} liberty, unless there is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E
25|$|A {{life cycle}} {{analysis}} {{is only as}} valid as its data; therefore, it <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> data used for {{the completion of a}} life cycle analysis are accurate and current. When comparing different life cycle analyses with one another, it <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> equivalent data are available for both products or processes in question. If one product has a much higher availability of data, it cannot be justly compared to another product which has less detailed data.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} {{low-cost}} net shape forging for demanding applications that {{are subject to}} {{a high degree of}} scrutiny, i.e. non-destructive testing by way of a dye-penetrant inspection technique, it <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> basic forging process disciplines be implemented. If the basic disciplines are not met, subsequent material removal operations will likely be necessary to remove material defects found at non-destructive testing inspection. Hence low-cost parts will not be achievable.|$|E

25|$|In 1949, {{after the}} Malayan Union had been {{replaced}} by the semi-autonomous Federation of Malaya, UMNO shifted its focus to politics and governance. The Malay people thus search for their birth-rights since the government of Malaya did not proclaim it openly, resulting in a confusing situation.

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> {{children}} {{are allowed to}} socially interact with other people who can vocalize and respond to questions. For language acquisition to develop successfully, children must be {{in an environment that}} allows them to communicate socially in that language. Children who have learnt sound, meaning and grammatical system of language that can produce clear sentence may still not have the ability to use language effectively in various social circumstance. Social interaction is the footing stone of language.|$|E
25|$|The Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa {{also offers}} a co-op option for some of their {{programs}} including: accounting, commerce, e-business, finance, management, marketing, and few other interconnected programs. With the exception of accounting which starts during the summer before a student’s fourth year, all programs start the summer before a student’s third year of study. Finally as a last category, several co-op graduate programs are offered as well: computer science, economics, globalization and international development, history, information studies, and public and international affairs. The entry requirements for graduate students are {{a little different from}} those for undergraduate co-operative education programs. In the graduate level, one of the requirements of the co-op program is that it <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>that</b> students begin their study in the fall semester because of the co-op program’s placement cycle.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 September, Bishop Jo Seoka of the South African Council of Churches, who was {{mediating}} {{a resolution}} to the conflict, announced that the striking miners had accepted a 22% pay raise, a one-off payment of R2,000, and would return to work 20 September. However, the National Union of Mineworkers, the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union and the Solidarity union did not make any statements {{in response to this}} offer. While miners' representative Zolisa Bodlani said of the deal that [...] "it's a huge achievement. No union has achieved a 22% increase before," [...] Lonmin's Sue Vey said it would offer no comment as the agreement had not yet been signed. However, Chris Molebatsi, who {{was a part of the}} organising committee for the strike, said: [...] "The campaign will go on. This campaign is aimed at helping workers. People died here at Marikana.
