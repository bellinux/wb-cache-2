40|$|The {{standard}} {{paradigm for}} <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> assumes that a description {{in terms of}} single-fluid MHD, adiabatic work, and radiation losses should provide an adequate model for the observed radiation and morphology. However this approach omits several physical elements that are now standard in other branches of laboratory, space, and astrophysical plasma physics, and we examine whether current observations of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> motivate extensions to the standard paradigm. Supernova remnants are analogous to <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> in producing synchrotron radiation from radio to X-ray wavelengths, and electron energies as high as 10 (14) eV axe required in some cases. Diffusive shock acceleration can generate these electrons from a mildly relativistic population, but the 'injection' problem of prior acceleration of background electrons to mildly relativistic energies has remained. Here we describe the 'bootstrap' solution of the electron injection problem, by which a shock-reflected proton population drives collective plasma instabilities, which in turn excite waves in the plasma which accelerate thermal electrons to mildly relativistic energies. The physical processes incorporated in this solution lie outside the standard paradigm for <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources,</b> and we discuss their potential relevance...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of a dipole anisotropy {{in the sky}} distribution of sources in large-scale radio surveys {{can be used to}} constrain the magnitude and direction of our local motion with respect to an isotropically distributed <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> population. Such a population is predicted to be present at cosmological redshifts in an isotropically expanding universe. The <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> population is observed to have a median redshift of z ~ 1, a much later epoch than the cosmic microwave background (z ~ 1100). I consider the detectability of a velocity dipole anisotropy in radio surveys having a finite number of source counts. The statistical significance of a velocity dipole detection from radio source counts is also discussed in detail. I find that existing large-scale radio survey catalogs do not have a sufficient number of sources to detect the expected velocity dipole with statistical significance, even if survey masking and flux calibration complications can be completely eliminated (i. e., if both the surveys and observing instruments are perfect). However, a dipole anisotropy should be easily detectable in future radio surveys planned with next-generation radio facilities, such as the Low Frequency Array and the Square Kilometer Array; tight constraints on the dipole magnitude and direction should be possible if flux calibration problems can be sufficiently minimized or corrected and contamination from local sources eliminated.

40|$|We {{separate}} the <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> population above ~ 50 uJy into active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming sources. The primary method of our {{approach is to}} fit the infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs), constructed using Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS and Herschel/SPIRE photometry, of 380 radio sources in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South. From the fitted SEDs, we determine the relative AGN and star-forming contributions to their infrared emission. With the inclusion of other AGN diagnostics such as X-ray luminosity, Spitzer/IRAC colours, radio spectral index and the ratio of star-forming total infrared flux to k-corrected 1. 4 GHz flux density, qIR, we determine whether the radio emission in these sources is powered by star formation or by an AGN. The majority of these radio sources (60 per cent) show the signature of an AGN at some wavelength. Of the sources with AGN signatures, 58 per cent are hybrid systems for which the radio emission is being powered by star formation. This implies that radio sources which have likely been selected on their star formation have a high AGN fraction. Below a 1. 4 GHz flux density of 1 mJy, along with finding a strong contribution to the source counts from pure star-forming sources, we find that hybrid sources constitute 20 - 65 per cent of the sources. This result suggests that hybrid sources have a significant contribution, along with sources that do not host a detectable AGN, to the observed flattening of the source counts at ~ 1 mJy for the <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>source</b> population.

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{simulate}} the polarization properties of <b>extragalactic</b> <b>radio</b> <b>sources</b> at microwave frequencies. Polarization measurements of nearly 2 x 10 ^ 6 sources at 1. 4 GHz are provided by the NVSS survey.

We find that the polarization degree is anti-correlated with the flux density for the former population, while no correlation is detected for the latter. The available high-frequency data are exploited to determine the frequency dependence of the distribution of polarization degrees. Using such information and the evolutionary model by Toffolatti et al.
