50|$|Carnivals. They are {{celebrated in}} {{different}} {{towns and villages}} with typical local dances that can go on for <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> and nights.|$|R
50|$|The tournament was marred {{with poor}} weather, as an <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> {{schedule}} was {{wiped out by}} rain, resulting in an abbreviated schedule.|$|R
50|$|Alluding to the trope, the CBBC {{television}} series Hounded features a literal reset button that, {{at the end}} of each episode, rewinds the <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> events back to the beginning.|$|R
5|$|Also in Arad is the Kedem Democratic School, {{which is}} an {{alternative}} school for students up through the high school level. It allows students {{to create their own}} schedules, and choose how they would like to spend their <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> at school.|$|E
5|$|This task {{system of}} slavery was common among sea island {{plantations}} in the Southeastern United States. In contrast, cotton and tobacco plantations in Virginia {{and other parts}} of the South practiced the gang system, where an overseer who was also a slave drove slaves to work the <b>entire</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th Légère, renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the <b>entire</b> <b>day,</b> and this had stalled the French advance.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} when Crossing Delancey opened, Bozyk joked that the 37 years spent {{with her husband}} had been like 74 because they'd spent their <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> and nights together.|$|R
50|$|Once the two leads were cast, the {{characters}} continued to evolve, with Dockendorf, Johnson and Cook spending <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> together for three weeks, walking together {{through the city}} and running through {{the characters}}’ conversations, trajectories, and inner lives.|$|R
50|$|Motors TV used to {{show all}} the races live, {{including}} some support races, {{both in the}} UK and across Europe. In 2007 Setanta Sports showed all the races live, including the support races; this ceased when the <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> coverage moved to ITV4.|$|R
5|$|Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) and Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{travel to}} New York City for the {{deposition}} of Jan's {{lawsuit against the}} company. While Michael originally intends to be a witness against the company, he ends up defending the company. Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) talks smack to Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) after Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) beats Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{in a game of}} ping pong, prompting Jim to spend the <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> practicing in the conference room.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{severe weather}} was ongoing {{at the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of severe weather for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{attempted}} to restore their defenses to their initial dispositions with an armored attack on October 17. It initially succeeded, but was pushed back by Israeli counterattacks in an armored battle lasting the <b>entire</b> <b>day.</b> Seriously depleted by the continuous fighting, the Egyptians relinquished {{control of the}} routes to the canal, opening {{them up to the}} Israelis. The battle is remembered {{as one of the most}} costly and brutal battles of the war.|$|E
50|$|Yaza is a Zen Buddhist {{term for}} a sitting time during sesshin that is {{above and beyond the}} normal daily routine. It is {{generally}} encouraged because it is more difficult to sit at this time when your body is exhausted from the <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> routine.|$|R
5000|$|Season seven winner Jeff Mauro's show [...] "Sandwich King" [...] premiered on Sunday, August 21, 2011. In spring 2013, Jeff hosted $24 in 24, a show {{in which}} he went to several cities and ate an <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> worth of meals on 24 dollars.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{material}} from the same day's performance was released in a second album Waltz for Debby (also 1961), as was other material in another LP Bill Evans — More From the Vanguard. The <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> recordings were released in 2005 as The Complete Village Vanguard Recordings, 1961.|$|R
5|$|The <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> of a Jain monk {{is spent}} in {{ensuring}} that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in hiṃsā (injury).|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} overhead wires. The trams are dimensioned to operate an <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
5|$|Admission is {{competitive}} and decisions {{are based on}} evaluations of applicants' intellectual ability, social and emotional maturity, and readiness for the accelerated program of study. Applicants for kindergarten through eighth group must submit IQ test results {{at or above the}} 91stpercentile (over 120 on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)), with consistent subtest scores, to qualify for consideration. Evaluations are based on report cards, parent questionnaires, teacher recommendations, and in-person assessments by the faculty. Early childhood through kindergarten applicants are screened in one-hour play sessions. Applicants for groups one and two are invited for a half-day school visit, and older applicants for an <b>entire</b> <b>day,</b> where they are assessed by teachers in the actual classroom setting.|$|E
50|$|The Fleischmann Atmospherium Planetarium {{was built}} in 1963 on the University of Nevada, Reno campus. It was the first planetarium in the United States to feature a {{360-degree}} projector capable of providing horizon-to-horizon images and through time-lapse photography showing an <b>entire</b> <b>day’s</b> weather in a few minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Part-time {{teachers}} need to have certain <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> off. They will either specify to the school which weekdays they are or simply how many days per cycle they need off. Such teachers can greatly add {{to the difficulty of}} timetabling when they are assigned to large blocks.|$|R
50|$|Des journées entières dans les arbres (in English, <b>Entire</b> <b>Days</b> in the Trees) is a 1976 French film {{directed}} by Marguerite Duras, {{based on her}} novel. Prior to directing a film version of the novel, Duras had already modified it into a stageplay that had enjoyed a theatrical run.|$|R
5|$|For that <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> the Comanches plundered {{and burned}} buildings, draping {{themselves}} grandly in top hats and stolen linens. They tied feather beds {{and bolts of}} cloth to their horses, and dragged them. They herded large numbers of cattle into pens and slaughtered them. One outraged citizen, Judge John Hays, grabbed a gun and waded ashore through the shallow water, and roared at the bemused warriors, but the Indians chose to spare him, believing him mad. He later found that he had waded ashore to face nearly a thousand Indians with an unloaded pistol.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at {{the office}}, {{half of the}} office opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a {{spontaneous}} visit and asks them {{to come up with}} Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas.|$|E
5|$|On April 18, 1989, a {{group of}} 39 women went into the Pittston Coal {{headquarters}} and held a 36‑hour sit-down strike. The women stated {{that they would not}} leave until a contract was signed. When questioned by police and media reporters to give up their names, the women responded by saying that they were daughters of Mother Jones. The Daughters gained the attention of the media and completely halted production at Pittston for an <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> and a half. The women involved were not members of the UMWA but wanted to support their cause, and due to this they were linked to the UMWA and considered by some {{to be a part of}} the union.|$|E
5000|$|On a rainy day, {{the race}} went off at 6:52 PM, EST. [...] In {{spite of the}} weather, {{attendance}} was a record-breaking 135,256, beating the previous year's record of 131,680. The pari-mutuel take of $94,127,434 for the <b>entire</b> <b>day's</b> races also broke the previous record of $91,028,000 in 2005.|$|R
60|$|The {{work was}} no longer arduous, for often <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> would pass without a single {{casualty}} demanding their attention. The cold weather resulted in much sickness among the soldiers, however, and Gys found {{during this period of}} military inactivity that his medicine chest was more in demand than his case of surgical instruments.|$|R
50|$|The {{scene with}} Ash in the tramway is a live action {{recreation}} {{of a similar}} scene appearing in the 1999 anime feature film Jin-Roh, which Oshii wrote but did not direct. This scene is based on Oshii's own teenage experience, when he used to spend <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> spinning in loop in the Yamanote Line.|$|R
5|$|After {{the rest}} day, play resumed in poor visibility, with {{frequent}} interruptions due to rain and bad light. England's batsmen progressed steadily as Australia struggled in Lindwall's absence, which forced his fellow bowlers {{to bear a}} greater workload. Hutton made 74 and Compton batted through the <b>entire</b> <b>day</b> to be unbeaten on 154, with England one run ahead {{at the close of}} play, on 345/6. Compton's innings in the difficult conditions was highly praised and his team still had a chance of hanging on for a draw if the lower order could bat for {{a large part of the}} final day. The next day, Australia prised out the remaining wickets and England were dismissed for 441, with Compton out for 184 after falling on his stumps. Miller and Johnston had both taken four wickets. Australia then made the 98 runs required for victory with the loss of two wickets; opener Sid Barnes made his second half-century for the match in the pursuit.|$|E
5|$|At 11:10, V./LG 1 Bf 110s {{took off}} in advance of a raid by KG 54, {{possibly}} to tempt RAF fighters into battle before the main assault, so the RAF {{would be out of}} position. The bombers' mission was cancelled. The order did not reach V./LG 1 who continued to their target area. The 23 Bf 110s continued to the target of Portland. They ran into No. 601 Squadron RAF Hurricanes and lost six Bf 110s destroyed and three damaged. Only one Hurricane was shot down and another damaged. A second source states only four Bf 110s were destroyed, whilst a third gives the loss of five destroyed and five damaged. The Zerstörergeschwader optimistically claimed 30 RAF fighters destroyed (in reality RAF fighter losses in aerial combat amounted to 13 throughout the <b>entire</b> <b>day),</b> for a loss of 13 Bf 110s. The morning's effort had been a fiasco. The attacks showed a serious German technical failure in air-to-air communication.|$|E
5|$|Harold's defeat was {{probably}} due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. The fact that Harold had dismissed his forces in southern England on 8 September {{also contributed to the}} defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although {{it is not clear that}} the English forces were insufficient to deal with William's forces. Against these arguments for an exhausted English army, the length of the battle, which lasted an <b>entire</b> <b>day,</b> shows that the English forces were not tired by their long march. Tied in with the speed of Harold's advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria once their enemy Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out that one reason for Harold's rush to battle was to contain William's depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.|$|E
50|$|Whilst some students, like Blue, {{attended}} {{for a short}} period, {{often for}} one singing lesson per week over several months, others spent <b>entire</b> <b>days</b> at the Centre, having singing lessons and observing others. These included Jenny Johnson, whose voice typified for Wolfsohn what he believed was possible for every human voice trained in his approach to extended vocal technique.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{also used}} at certain colleges to define a {{required}} note to take absence from school either for <b>entire</b> <b>days,</b> or parts of a day for appointments, interviews, open days and other [...] Students at Oxford University, Cambridge University, and other British universities have also been required to obtain such permission to leave college overnight.|$|R
5000|$|Although Fredegund did {{not live}} to see it, her son's {{execution}} of Brunhilda bore the mark of Fredegund's hatred: Clothar II had the old queen, now in her sixties, stretched in agony upon the rack for three <b>entire</b> <b>days,</b> then watched her meet her death chained between four horses that were goaded to the four points of the compass, tearing her body asunder.|$|R
