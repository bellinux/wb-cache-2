50|$|Although {{his early}} studies {{garnered}} {{a degree of}} acclaim, it was in late 1927 that Kellaway found his experimental forte. At the suggestion of Neil Hamilton Fairley - then resident at the Hall Institute whilst recuperating from tropical sprue - a significant research programme was instigated into Australian snake venoms. This practical and scientific problem had not been substantively addressed {{since the turn of}} the century researches by Frank Tidswell and Charles Martin. Kellaway also used the opportunity to negotiate with the Minister for Health one of the first ad-hoc grants for medical research in Australia, preceded only by a limited number of cancer investigations. This grant lasted from 1928-31 and was a milestone in Commonwealth support for independent research in medical science. Working with Fairley, Holden and Fannie Eleanor Williams from the Institute, plus Frederick Morgan from the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited) and Tom 'Pambo' Eades from the Melbourne Zoo, Kellway's research encompassed venoms from a plethora of Australian snake species (elapidae). This work initially focused on characteristing biting apparatus, venom yields, pharmacological activity, lethality and immunology. Clinical work included investigations into the appropriate first-aid treatment of snakebite and the development of antivenenes (antivenoms) against tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), copperhead (Austrelaps superbus) and death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) venoms, although only the first was found suitable for manufacture by CSL. In addition to expanding field work on <b>identification</b> <b>and</b> <b>characterisation</b> of a wide range of Australian elapids and their venoms, Kellaway's work through the 1930s broadened to include platypus, mussel, Sydney funnel-web spider (Atrax robustus) and redback spider (Latrodectus hasselti) venoms. This huge corpus of work, totalling over 70 publications by the end of the programme, resulted in an invitation for Kellaway to review his oeuvre via the prestigious Charles E Dohme Memorial Lectureships at Johns Hopkins University Medical School (now Johns Hopkins School of Medicine) in 1936 - an impressive international accolade.|$|E

We {{report on the}} <b>identification</b> <b>and</b> functional <b>characterisation</b> of such one novel activity, a germ plasm associated mRNA encoding for the Xenopus version of a kinesin termed KIF 13 B. Modulations of xKIF 13 B function result in germ cell mismigration and in reduced numbers of such cells. PGCs explanted from Xenopus embryos form bleb-like protrusions enriched in PIP 3. Knockdown of xKIF 13 B results in inhibition of blebbing and PIP 3 accumulation. Interference with PIP 3 synthesis leads to PGC mismigration in vivo and in vitro. We propose that xKIF 13 B function is linked to polarized accumulation of PIP 3 and directional migration of the PGCs in Xenopus embryos...|$|R

Bacterial lipoproteins are a functionally diverse class of membrane-anchored proteins. The signal peptides of these proteins direct their export and post-translational lipid modification.
