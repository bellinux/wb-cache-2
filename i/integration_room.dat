40|$|Within {{this thesis}} a new {{philosophy}} in monitoring spacecrafts is presented: {{the unification of}} the various kinds of monitoring techniques used during the different lifecylce phases of a spacecraft. The challenging requirements being set for this monitoring framework are: - "separation of concerns" as a design principle (dividing the steps of logging from registered sources, sending to connected sinks and displaying of information), - usage during all mission phases, - usage by all actors (EGSE engineers, groundstation operators, etc.), - configurable at runtime, especially regarding the level of detail of logging information, and - very low resource consumption. First a prototype of the monitoring framework was developed as a support library for the real-time operating system RODOS. This prototype was tested on dedicated hardware platforms relevant for space, and also on a satellite demonstrator used for educational purposes. As a second step, the results and {{lessons learned from the}} development and usage of this prototype were transfered to a real space mission: the first satellite of the DLR compact satellite series - a space based platform for DLR's own research activities. Within this project, the software of the avionic subsystem was supplemented by a powerful logging component, which enhances the traditional housekeeping capabilities and offers extensive filtering and debugging techniques for monitoring and FDIR needs. This logging component is the major part of the flight version of the monitoring framework. It is completed by counterparts running on the development computers and as well as the EGSE hardware in the <b>integration</b> <b>room,</b> making it most valuable already in the earliest stages of traditional spacecraft development. Future plans in terms of adding support from the groundstation as well will lead to a seamless integration of the monitoring framework not only into to the spacecraft itself, but into the whole space system...|$|E

40|$|A Fire and Life Safety Analysis was {{performed}} {{as one of}} the requirements for the Master of Science Degree in Fire Protection Engineering from California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo. The Fire and Life Safety Analysis consists of a prescriptive analysis as well as a performance based analysis. These analyses were performed on the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center which is part of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The prescriptive analysis consisted of the four following parts: Egress Analysis and Design, Fire Detection and Alarm Systems, Water-based Fire Suppression, and Structural Fire Protection. The purpose of the prescriptive analysis was to determine if the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center adhered to the codes and standards applicable to the building. The prescriptive analysis {{was performed}} using primarily the 2013 edition of the California Building Code (CBC) along with the 2013 editions of NFPA codes. The egress analysis and design met most of the code requirements. One area that the Bonderson Engineering Projects Center did not meet was door swing direction. Room 104 (See Appendix A for building layout) was originally an office classification, but since construction has been utilized as an assembly space. The decreased occupant load factor resulted in a new occupant load which is greater than 50 persons. Per CBC 1008. 1. 2 exit doors must swing in the direction of egress travel where serving a room or area containing an occupant load of 50 or more persons, which the building does not adhere to. The fire detection and alarm systems analysis was performed primarily utilizing NFPA 72. The building had multiple shortcomings in regards to spacing gaps of the detection devices. These shortcomings were found on the first and second floor, including the lobby, robotics room, project <b>integration</b> <b>room</b> and computer cluster room. The water-based fire suppression system analysis was performed primarily utilizing NFPA 13 and NFPA 25. The water supply and sprinkler system are acceptable. The structural fire protection analysis was performed primarily utilizing the CBC. The main shortcoming discovered was in relation to the atrium. The building must have a 1 hour fire barrier separating atrium spaces from adjacent spaces or it must provide an acceptable smoke control system. The building provides neither of these provisions. The performance based analysis was performed in order to ascertain the ability for the occupant of a building to evacuate safely {{in the event of a}} fire. Two separate fire scenarios were evaluated using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and Pathfinder. Tenability criteria was determined and used in conjunction with FDS in order to determine the available safe egress time (ASET). This was compared against the required safe egress time (RSET) which was determined using Pathfinder. The RSET time was greater than the ASET time, meaning occupants would not be able to safely evacuate the building in the event of an emergency...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades {{multichannel}} audio reproduction systems and the trend for flatter design of media devices have lead to an increased demand in flat panel speaker technologies. With a depth of a few centimeters these devices shall allow a space saving and unremarkable <b>integration</b> into <b>rooms</b> while providing the acoustic quality of a conventional conus loudspeaker. Current flat panel speakers can be designed with a depth less than 10 cm. However if they are mounted directly in front of a wall or maintained within a flat case an unacceptable quality loss occurs. In this thesis the reasons for the deterioration of sound quality have been investigated. Therefore existing flat panel speaker technologies have been analysed and possible solutions have been proposed. If flat panel speakers without enclosure are maintained directly in front of a wall, reflections and interferences between sound parts from the front and the back of the membrane lead to an increased acoustic short circuit and to a comb filter effect. On the one hand this effect can be prevented applying a loudspeaker enclosure. On the other hand the air volume inside the enclosure acts as an additional spring and influences the vibration behavior of the membrane. The smaller the case is the greater is the spring's counterforce. This leads to an decreased sound pressure level in the low frequency range. Because of this a new flat panel speaker technology based on array like arranged miniature transducers built in a case is proposed. By using many single transducers enough driving power can be realized counteracting against the air volume's stiffness. Additionally the distribution of the driving force and the subdivision of the sound radiating area in partial areas allows a piston-shaped vibration behavior and a optimized radiation characteristic. The developed flat panel speakers dimensions are 75 cm * 55 cm * 2, 4 cm. The frequency range is 100 Hz to 20 kHz (- 6 dB limiting frequency). Mounted on a wall the speakers' mean sound pressure level is 88 dB/ 1 W/ 1 m. Combined with a subwoofer the new developed flat panel speaker can replace a conventional loudspeaker. To achieve the required sound pressure level within cinemas or concert halls multiple flat panel speakers have to be combined. The stereo setup of the final flat panel speaker developed within this thesis was presented at the "Internationale Funkausstellung" 2009 in Berlin...|$|R

50|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding <b>integration.</b> The operating <b>room</b> can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging.

If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.|$|R
40|$|Galileo Galilei' (GG) is a {{proposal}} for a small, low-orbit satellite devoted to testing the equivalence principle (EP) of Galileo, Newton and Einstein. The GG report on the phase A study recently carried out with funding from ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) concluded that GG can test the equivalence principle to 1 part in 10 (17) at room temperature. The main novelty is to modulate the expected differential signal of an EP violation at the spin rate of the spacecraft (2 Hz), Compared with other experiments, the modulation frequency is increased by more than a factor of 10 (4), thus reducing 1 /f (low-frequency) electronic and mechanical noise. The challenge for an EP test in space is to improve over the sensitivity of ground-based experiments (about 1 part in 10 (12)) by many orders of magnitude, so as to deeply probe a so Far totally unexplored field; doing that with more than one pair of bodies is an unnecessary complication. For this reason GG is now proposed with a single pair of test masses. At present the best and most reliable laboratory-controlled tests of the equivalence principle have been achieved by the 'Eot-Wash' group with small test cylinders arranged on a torsion balance placed on a turntable which provides the modulation of the signal (a 1 - 2 h rotation period). The torsion balance is not a suitable instrument in space. We have designed and built the GGG ('GG on the Ground') prototype. It is made of coaxial test cylinders weakly coupled (via mechanical suspensions) and quickly rotating (6 Hz achieved so far); in addition, it is well suited to be flown in space-where the driving signal is about three orders of magnitude stronger and the absence of weight is very helpful-inside the coaxial, co-rotating GG cylindrical spacecraft. The GGG apparatus is now operational. Preliminary measurement data indicate that weakly coupled, fast-spinning macroscopic rotors can be a suitable instrument to detect small differential effects. Rotation (up to 6 Hz so far) is stabilized by a small passive oil damper. A finer active damper, using small capacitance sensors and actuators as {{in the design of the}} space experiment, is in preparation. The current sensitivity of the GGG system is of 10 (- 9) m s(- 2) /root Hz at about 300 s, which can be improved because horizontal seismic noise is rejected very well; perturbing effects of terrain tilts (due to microseismicity and tides) will be reduced by adding a passive cardanic suspension. As for the capacitance read-out, the current sensitivity (5 pm displacements in 1 s <b>integration</b> time at <b>room</b> temperature) is adequate to make GGG competitive with the torsion balance. Because of the stronger signal and weaker coupling of the test rotors in space, this sensitivity is also adequate for GG to reach its target accuracy (10 (- 17)).

40|$|Ubiquitous {{computing}} environments offer a {{wide range}} of devices in many different shapes and sizes, creating new possibilities for interaction. In the context of meetings and teamwork situations, it is desirable to take advantage of their different properties for synchronous collaboration. Besides providing an adapted user interface, this requires the software to be designed for synchronous access to shared information using heterogeneous devices with different interaction characteristics. The handling of these requirements poses challenges for software developers. As this field is still emerging and no mature models, tools, and standards are at hand, developers have to create their own solutions from scratch. The goal of this thesis is to provide guidance and support for developers of synchronous groupware applications for ubiquitous computing environments. They have to be enabled to develop applications more efficiently and with the flexibility and extensibility that is required for ubiquitous computing. The development effort can be reduced effectively if support for developers is provided at several levels. Developers need assistance when creating models of the applications to be developed, when choosing an appropriate architecture, when creating the design, and finally when implementing. This implies that an architecture-driven, model-based development approach should be followed. While the implementation of a single synchronous UbiComp application still requires research, the development of appropriate development support is even more challenging. Common properties of ubiquitous computing applications have to be identified. Future developments and extensions have to be predicted. Requirements of different research areas have to be fulfilled. Addressing these aspects, the goal of this dissertation is accomplished by providing extensions to {{the state of the art}} at four levels: A conceptual model of synchronous UbiComp applications defines a high-level structure for applications that ensures reusability and extensibility of developed software components. It identifies separation of concerns, degree of coupling and sharing, and level of abstraction as the three main design dimensions of these applications. The conceptual model provides two key contributions to the state of the art. First, it proposes the strict separation of user interface and interaction concerns orthogonal to the level of abstraction that is not found in current HCI models. This is a crucial extension of HCI models that is required in the context of ubiquitous computing. Second, it introduces a new view on the concept of sharing. By applying the CSCW concept of sharing in the context of ubiquitous computing, sharing user interface, interaction, and environment state becomes relevant. Thereby, the concept of sharing as known from CSCW can be extended to function as a guiding principle for UbiComp application design. This novel design approach helps ensuring the extensibility and flexibility that is required in ubiquitous computing. A flexible software architecture identifies essential abstractions that support the development of synchronous applications in “roomware” environments. Roomware refers to the <b>integration</b> of <b>room</b> elements with information technology, such as interactive tables, walls, or chairs. Roomware environments represent one form of ubiquitous computing environment. They are used in this thesis as an application context for the conceptual model. The software architecture refines the conceptual model to meet the needs of roomware environments. An object-oriented application framework that has been designed and implemented provides a reusable design and reusable software components. Furthermore, extensibility is supported by explicit mechanisms that are provided to allow adaptability for variable aspects of applications. Thus, the application framework helps developers with the design and implementation. To show how model, architecture, and framework can be applied, the design of sample roomware applications is explained. To demonstrate the extensibility, several new forms of interaction that are required for roomware environments are implemented. The developed applications and interaction forms are used in i-LAND, the roomware environment at Fraunhofer IPSI. Besides being a contribution on their own, the developed applications and new forms of interaction provide evidence that the conceptual model effectively supports developers in meeting the requirements of roomware environments. They show that the model helps reduce the implementation effort when accompanied by appropriate software development tools such as the application framework. The conceptual model, software architecture, and application framework presented in this thesis relieve software developers from the burden of handling all details of multiple interaction forms, and of many critical issues when dealing with synchronous collaboration. By these means, the developer can concentrate on the task at hand designing software at an appropriately high abstraction level, and thus create applications with a higher quality that are flexibly extensible...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of organic electronics - {{a technology that}} relies on carbon-based semiconductors to deliver devices with unique properties - {{represents one of the}} most dramatic developments of the past two decades. A rapidly emerging new direction in the field involves the interface with biology. The "soft" nature of organics offers better mechanical compatibility with tissue than traditional electronic materials, while their natural compatibility with mechanically flexible substrates suits the non-planar form factors often required for implants. More importantly, their ability to conduct ions in addition to electrons and holes opens up a new communication channel with biology. The coupling of electronics with living tissue holds the key to a variety of important life-enhancing technologies. One example is bioelectronic implants that record neural signals and/or electrically stimulate neurons. These devices offer unique opportunities to understand and treat conditions such as hearing and vision loss, epilepsy, brain degenerative diseases, and spinal cord injury. The engineering aspect of the work includes the development of a photolithographic process to integrate the conducting polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene: poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) with parylene C supports to make an active device. The technology is used to fabricate electrocorticography (ECoG) probes, high-speed transistors and wearable biosensors. The experimental work explores the fundamentals of communication at the interface between conducting polymers and the brain. It is shown that conducting polymers outperform conventional metallic electrodes for brain signals recording. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent a step beyond conducting polymer electrodes. They consist of a conducting polymer channel in contact with an electrolyte. When a gate electrode excites an ionic current in the electrolyte, ions enter the polymer film and change its conductivity. Since a small amount of ions can effectively "block" the transistor channel, these devices offer significant amplification in ion-to-electron transduction. Using the developed technology a high-speed and high-density OECTs array is presented. The dense architecture of the array improves the resolution of the recording from neural networks and the transistors temporal response are 100 μs, significantly faster than the action potential. The experimental transistor responses are fit and modeled in order to optimize the gain of the transistor. Using the model, an OECT with two orders of magnitude higher normalized transconductance per channel width is fabricated as compared to Silicon-based field effect transistors. Furthermore, the OECTs are integrated to a highly conformable ECoG probe. This is the first time that a transistor is used to record brain activities in vivo. It shows a far superior signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) compare to electrodes. The high SNR of the OECT recordings enables the observation of activities from the surface of the brain that only a perpetrating probe can record. Finally, the application of OECTs for biosensing is explored. The bulk of the currently available biosensors often require complex liquid handling, and thus suffer from problems associated with leakage and contamination. The use of an organic electrochemical transistor for detection of lactate by <b>integration</b> of a <b>room</b> temperature ionic liquid in a gel-format, as a solid-state electrolyte is demonstrated.

Operacijska medicinska sestra dela v specifičnem okolju in najzahtevnejših situacijah na področju zdravstva. Razpolaga s številnimi znanji in izkušnjami, pa žal še vedno ni vzpostavljen izobraževalni program v okviru dodiplomskega bazičnega izobraževanja s področja zdravstvene nege. Iz tega izhaja, da operacijski medicinski sestri dodiplomski študijski program ne pokriva potreb po znanju, ki so nujna na področju operacijske zdravstvene nege. Glavni namen raziskave je ugotoviti, kako poteka uvajanje operacijske medicinske sestre v prakso v širšem slovenskem prostoru s stališča tistih, ki se uvajajo, s kakšnimi problemi se soočajo, kakšne rešitve potrebujejo in katera znanja so v procesu uvajanja deficitarna. Raziskavo smo izvedli s pomočjo anketnega vprašalnika, ki smo ga poslali v 10 zdravstvenih ustanov, ki imajo organizirano operativno dejavnost. Zajeli smo le tiste OPMS, ki so še v fazi uvajanja. Analizo smo izvedli s pomočjo statističnega paketa SPSS for Windows 17. 0. V empiričnem delu smo z analizo rezultatov ankete ugotovili, da 96 % vprašanim teoretično znanje pridobljeno v času dodiplomskega študija ne zadošča. Največ (45 %) se jih v času izobraževanja poslužuje internih navodil in standardov. V največji možni meri, v 98 % pa še vedno pridobivajo znanja od izkušenih sodelavcev, 56 % se jih uvaja po programu uvajanja in le 22 % jih ima dodeljenega stalnega mentorja. Rezultati raziskave so pokazali potrebo po premišljenem in skrbno načrtovanem kadrovanju na področju OP ZN. S predlaganimi izboljšavami, ki se nanašajo na izobraževanje in ustrezno izbiro kandidatov za OP ZN, lahko pomembno pripomoremo k učinkovitejši integraciji OPMS v delovno okolje. ABSTRACT The {{master degree}} thesis is a {{research}} project completed {{with the help of}} a questionnaire, which researches the ways and methods used in the education process of operating room nurses in Slovenia. The operating room nurses work in a very specific and demanding environment in the health care arena. They require diverse knowledge and experience but unfortunately there is still no educational program within basic undergraduate health care studies to provide operating room nurses the required knowledge needed in the field of operating room health care. The main purpose of the research is to find out how the initial training of operating room nurses, from surveys compiled from operating room nurses, takes place in the greater area of Slovenia. We wanted to learn about the problems the operating room nurses are confronted with, what solutions they need, and what knowledge is deficient in the initial training process. The research was performed with the help of questionnaires which were sent to 10 Health Care Institutions having organized surgical activity. We included only those operating room nurses in the initial training stage. The analysis was performed by SPSS 17. 0 for Windows operating system. On the basis of the survey analysis results we determined that 96 % of operating room nurses believe that the knowledge gained during the basic degree study is insufficient. During the education period 45 % of them use the intern instructions and standards. The great majority of nurses (98 %) gain knowledge from experienced co-workers. 56 % of the operating room nurses follows the initial training program and only 22 % of the operating room nurses have an assigned mentor. The results have shown that there is a need for sound and carefully planned recruitment of operating room health care. The proposed improvements which are relating to education and proper selection of candidates for the field of operating room health care, can significantly contribute to the effective <b>integration</b> of operating <b>room</b> nurses into a working environment...|$|R
