40|$|The Due Hydroelectric Project is a {{proposed}} 50 MW run-of-river hydroelectric project {{being developed by}} Hidroalto SA. The project will be located on the Rio Due in Ecuador. The civil works of the intake facility will be comprised of a 133. 45 m wide diversion weir, with two overflow spillways and six gated sluice channels; a four bay intake structure with sediment excluder; and, a fish bypass facility. Northwest Hydraulic Consultants (NHC) evaluated the initial design of the Due intake and spillway facilities using a 1 : 35 Froude-scaled physical model for river discharges ranging from the intake design discharge of 57. 2 m 3 /s to the 1000 -year flood of 2, 339 m 3 /s. The testing in the physical model revealed some deficiencies {{in the performance of}} the initial design of the spillway stilling basins and some opportunities to reduce construction costs. Modifications to the initial design were proposed and evaluated in the model during the design optimization testing phase. The final recommended modifications included: adding a new stilling basin wall separating one of the overflow spillways from adjacent sluice channels; reducing the length of the stilling basin; decreasing the height and thickness of the stilling basin walls; and modifying pier noses to reduce flow disturbances. Furthermore, a sluice gate operation guideline was developed in order to maintain sufficient energy dissipation within the stilling basins for the range of river <b>discharges</b> <b>covered</b> in the study. The physical model was also utilized to evaluate the reservoir sediment flushing procedure and the performance of the intake sediment excluder. Fine sand was used in the model to simulate the reservoir deposits such that qualitative observations of the sediment flushing could be made. Accordingly, a sluice gate operating guideline was developed to maximize the sediment flushing from the reservoir. Finally, the physical model used light-weight sediments to evaluate the efficacy of the intake sediment excluder in trapping sediment to qualitatively observe the sediment load into the intake and the particle trapping process. Modifications to the intake sediment excluder were recommended to improve sediment trapping efficiency and reduce construction costs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Partial {{discharges}} (PD) {{are recognized}} as {{the main cause of}} the inner insulation deterioration process in power transformers. Therefore, the optimum inner insulation design is one of the challenges a transformer designer is faced with. Transformer strength, especially during transient conditions, is a criterion for transformer insulation designers. This challenge has made designers initiate and employ other types of winding, for example, rather than ordinary layer and disc windings employ the multiple-α windings. Multiple-α windings have a more complicated structure and are comprised of various parts with different physical structures and electrical characteristics. Typical partial <b>discharge</b> signals <b>cover</b> a wide frequency range from DC up to hundreds of MHz and different frequency components propagate through the winding depending upon the winding structure in different modes. Partial discharge propagation in single-α winding is more predictable compared to multiple-α winding. A 66 kV / 25 MVA interleaved winding, which has 19 fully interleaved discs, plays the role of a single-α winding. When this main winding is connected to the tap winding with a different structure and magnitude response, a multiple-α winding is constructed. Two terminal current signals are detected by the application of two home-made high frequency current transformers (HF-CT). The signals were amplified and fed into a 50...|$|R
40|$|Adequate {{estimation}} of the spatial distribution of snowfall is critical in hydrologic modeling. However, this is a well-known problem in estimating basin-scale snowfall, especially in mountainous basins with data scarcity. This study focuses on correction and {{estimation of}} this spatial distribution, which considers topographic effects within the basin. A method is proposed that optimizes an altitude-based snowfall correction factor (C fsnow). This is done through multi-objective calibration of a spatially distributed, multilayer energy and water balance-based snowmelt model (WEB-DHM-S) with observed discharge and remotely sensed snow cover data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The Shuffled Complex Evolution – University of Arizona automatic search algorithm is used to obtain the optimal value of C fsnow for minimum cumulative error in <b>discharge</b> and snow <b>cover</b> simulations. <b>Discharge</b> error is quantified by Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and relative volume deviation, and snow cover error was estimated by pixel-by-pixel analysis. The study region is the heavily snow-fed Yagisawa Basin of the Upper Tone River in northeast Japan. First, the system was applied to one snow season (2002 – 2003), obtaining an optimized C fsnow of 0. 0007 m − 1. For validation purposes, the optimized C fsnow was implemented to correct snowfall in 2004, 2002 and 2001. Overall, the system was effective, implying improvements in correlation of simulated vs. observed <b>discharge</b> and snow <b>cover.</b> The 4 yr mean of basin-average snowfall for the corrected spatial snowfall distribution was 1160 mm (780 mm before correction). Execution of sensitivity runs against other model input and parameters indicated that C fsnow could be affected by uncertainty in shortwave radiation and setting of the threshold air temperature parameter. Our approach is suitable to correct snowfall and estimate its distribution in poorly-gauged basins, where elevation dependence of snowfall amount is strong...|$|R

In case of medium voltage overhead lines with covered conductors, the internal partial discharges indicate the degradation of insulation system, rupture or downfall of the line. The reliability and selectivity of methods to detect internal partial <b>discharges</b> in the <b>covered</b> conductors are mainly given by the level of background noise.
