40|$|We ask various <b>experts,</b> <b>who</b> produce sales {{forecasts}} that can differ from earlier received model-based forecasts, {{what they do}} and why they do so. A questionnaire with a range of questions was completed by no less than forty-two such <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> are located in twenty different countries. We correlate {{the answers to these questions}} with actual behavior of the experts. Our main findings are that experts have a tendency to double count and to react strongly to recent volatility in sales data.

In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece were found on or inside the silencer.|$|E

Both experts and nonexperts predicted the results of soccer matches after conscious thought, after unconscious thought, or immediately. In Experiment 1, <b>experts</b> <b>who</b> thought unconsciously outperformed participants in all other conditions. Whereas unconscious thinkers showed a correlation between expertise and accuracy of prediction, no such relation was observed for conscious thinkers or for immediate decision makers.
