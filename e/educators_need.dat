50|$|A major {{impetus for}} the current {{understanding}} of pedagogy was the educational philosophy of the Swiss social thinker Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778). Concerned with the decay of society, he developed his theories based on his belief that human beings were inherently good as they were closest to nature when born, but society and its institutions corrupted them and denaturalized them. Consequently, bringing up children in harmony with nature and its laws so as to preserve the good was central for Rousseau’s pedagogic theory. Rousseau innovatively “argued that the momentum for learning {{was provided by the}} growth of the person (nature) - and that what the <b>educator</b> <b>needed</b> to do was to facilitate opportunities for learning,” as Doyle and Smith note.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe main {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to describe the students’ self-perceived and actual performance in making oral presentations. The study employed a mixed method research design and involved an intact class of 40 Business Faculty undergraduates taking an ESL (English as a Second Language) course in a local university in Malaysia. Data was collected using a self-constructed and expert-validated needs analysis questionnaire, oral presentation tests and semi-structured interviews. The results indicated that there were discrepancies between the actual performance scores and students’ self- evaluation marks for all the four skills. Thus, when designing a course outline, <b>educators</b> <b>needs</b> to focus more on those areas in order to improve the students’ oral presentation skills...|$|R

This dialogue has the goal of assessing reasons behind competing interpretations through critical examination of evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view.

Educators can encourage critical reflection and experience with discourse through the implementation of methods including metaphor analysis, concept mapping, consciousness raising, life histories, repertory grids, and participation in social action.|$|E
