5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June.

Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on <b>hand,</b> <b>on</b> the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{had been}} unbeaten {{throughout}} the tour. Between the Fourth and Fifth Test, they played five tour matches.

Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, {{the pace of the}} pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E

5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed the details of a dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E
