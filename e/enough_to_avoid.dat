The author described the best variety of the breed to be those with long ears whose coat was white under the belly and around the neck but brown on the back.|$|E
5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, {{and allowing the}} gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean to dissipate over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a result could not slow down fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing anything until the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E
25|$|Unlike French, he was {{politically}} astute <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> becoming {{entangled in the}} Curragh Incident of 1914. Unlike a number of British generals of the era, Smith-Dorrien was not a political intriguer.|$|E
25|$|In his 1990 {{edition of}} Animal Liberation, Peter Singer {{said that he}} no longer ate oysters and mussels, because {{although}} the creatures might not suffer, they might, it's not really known, and it's easy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> eating them in any case (and this aspect of seeking better alternatives is a prominent part of utilitarianism).|$|E

50|$|By {{adding a}} set of {{eccentrics}} and guide slots to the axle of the supercharger, the Powerplus actively controls the position of these vanes, such that they maintain a constant small clearance from {{the walls of the}} housing. This is <b>enough</b> spacing <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> friction, but close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep pumping efficient.|$|R
25|$|In {{all kinds}} of {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> boundary condition artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing periodic boundary conditions in which {{one side of the}} simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase.|$|E
25|$|The club {{went on to}} win six {{of their}} last {{fourteen}} games after Lance's arrival, <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the wooden spoon awarded to the team finishing lowest on the competition ladder.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the preference for syn adducts typically observed in enolate-based aldol additions, these organocatalyzed aldol additions are anti-selective. In many cases, the organocatalytic conditions are mild <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> polymerization. However, selectivity requires the slow syringe-pump controlled addition of the desired electrophilic partner because both reacting partners typically have enolizable protons. If one aldehyde has no enolizable protons or alpha- or beta-branching, additional control can be achieved.|$|E
50|$|This seaweed {{is mostly}} {{found in the}} {{littoral}} zone or in rock pools, where it receives plenty of light and <b>enough</b> seawater <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> desiccation. Homosira often lives in large patches, minimising moisture loss when the tide is low.|$|R
50|$|Using AASHTO standards, an {{engineer}} works {{to design a}} road that is safe and comfortable. If a horizontal curve has a high speed and a small radius, an increased superelevation (bank) is {{needed in order to}} assure safety. If there is an object obstructing the view around a corner or curve, the engineer must work to ensure that drivers can see far <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> an accident or accelerate to join traffic.|$|R
50|$|After the {{financial}} crisis of 1873, orders for new equipment dropped off, but Brooks was able <b>to</b> recover <b>enough</b> business <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> bankruptcy.

25|$|At dawn, a fog {{obscured}} the frigates from each other, and Bouvet could not engage. The next morning, Aréthuse found herself {{alone on the}} sea, and Bouvet followed the course that he assumed Amelia had taken; around eleven, she appeared on the horizon and Aréthuse put on all sails to give chase. The frigates raced all day and at 19:30, Irby decided that he was far <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> interference from Rubis, and Amelia turned to confront her opponent.|$|E
25|$|Captive males breed at {{five years}} of age, but wild males attain {{dominance}} much later when they are larger. In one five-year field study, only one rhino estimated to be younger than 15 years mated successfully. Captive females breed as young as four years of age, but in the wild, they usually start breeding only when six years old, which likely indicates {{they need to be}} large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being killed by aggressive males. Their gestation period is around 15.7 months, and birth interval ranges from 34–51 months.|$|E
25|$|After his release, {{he escaped}} Cuba {{with the help}} of {{journalist}} Robert Desnos who lent him his passport and papers. Carpentier decided on a voluntary exile to France and arrived in Paris in 1928; he remained there until 1939, when he returned to Havana. When he left Cuba, he was fortunate <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the political conflicts which had occurred during the 1930s. During this time certain positions were unacceptable to the authorities and Cuban intellectuals were forced to define their political position and for these and other political reasons he decided to leave.|$|E
50|$|Several eruptions of Mauna Loa (the {{most recent}} in 1984) have {{threatened}} {{the city of}} Hilo, but stopped short. Tsunamis devastated the areas along the coast, with the largest in 1946 and 1960, but the new site of the church was far <b>enough</b> inland <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> destruction.|$|R

25|$|Other {{archaeologist}}s have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. Dan Bahat, the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, {{as there is}} no known temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.|$|E
25|$|The Plano Real ("Real Plan"), instituted in {{the spring}} 1994, sought to break inflationary {{expectations}} by pegging the real to the US dollar. Inflation was brought down to single digit annual figures, but not fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> substantial real exchange rate appreciation during the transition phase of the Plano Real. This appreciation meant that Brazilian goods were now more expensive relative to goods from other countries, which contributed to large current account deficits. However, no shortage of foreign currency ensued because of the financial community's renewed interest in Brazilian markets as inflation rates stabilized and memories of the debt crisis of the 1980s faded.|$|E
25|$|Another {{factor that}} impacts total CPU time needed by a {{simulation}} {{is the size}} of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> discretization errors (i.e., smaller than the fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1femtosecond (10−15 s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE constraint algorithm, which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.|$|E
50|$|A second {{promotion}} to Serie A followed in 1981 and finished a respectable 10th before being relegated {{once more in}} 1983, staying in Serie B for four years.

50|$|A twenty acre (8.1 ha) {{field to}} the north of the hall was chosen as the {{appropriate}} site to build the required operational set rooms (huts). The huts were spaced far <b>enough</b> apart <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> collateral damage should a bombing raid occur.

25|$|The MythBusters episode {{also pointed}} out another complication: it would be {{necessary}} to insert the item into one's mouth (for example, eat an onion, rinse with mouthwash, conceal a battery), take the breath test, and then possibly remove the item — all of which would have to be accomplished discreetly <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> alerting the police officers administering the test (who would obviously become very suspicious if they noticed that a person was inserting items into their mouth prior to taking a breath test). It would likely be very difficult, especially for someone in an intoxicated state, to be able to accomplish such a feat.|$|E
25|$|Tredwell was {{selected}} for the return series in Sri Lanka. He played in the first game, taking figures of 2/52 in his ten overs. In the second match he was wicket less, finishing with figures of 0–47. Tredwell did not play {{in the next two}} games although he returned for the fifth match of the series, taking figures of 1–33 to help England get back into the series. In the sixth match between the two sides, Tredwell took figures of 1–37 and made 19 with the bat. Tredwell did not take any wickets in England's final match of the series, although he did again add runs {{at the end of the}} innings, this time making 17 to help England past 200, but it wasn't <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> another defeat.|$|E
25|$|The French {{constitution}} {{gives the}} government two options to defeat such a filibuster. The {{first one was}} originally {{the use of the}} article 49 paragraph 3 procedure, according to which the law was adopted except if a majority is reached on a non-confidence motion (a reform of July 2008 resulted in this power being restricted to budgetary measures only, plus one time each ordinary session – i.e. from October to June – on any bill. Before this reform, article 49, 3 was frequently used, especially when the government was short a majority in the Assemblée nationale to support the text but still <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a non-confidence vote). The second one is the article 44 paragraph 3 through which the government can force a global vote on all amendments it did not approve or submit itself.|$|E
50|$|Five minutes later, Sabur {{repeated}} the message, this time notifying Sukarno {{of the problem}} as well. Sukarno quickly suspended the meeting {{and left the room}} with Amirmachmud intact.
