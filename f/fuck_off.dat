The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my family. I don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

500|$|At {{his weekly}} Sunday Night at the Tunnel Palladium shows, {{sometimes}} even experienced and accomplished comedians failed {{to complete a}} whole set against the unforgiving crowd and razor-sharp heckling. When the club became established, it attracted groups of men apparently from the suburb of [...] 'Eltham' who Malcolm referred to as 'Herberts'. They [...] were usually drunk and in the Tunnel club as it offered after hours drinks on a Sunday night, a rarity back then. They usually ended the evening by fighting, fortunately usually between themselves, leaving everybody else as spectators. It was at the Tunnel Club that comedian Jim Tavare once began his act with the unwise opener, [...] "Hello, I'm a schizophrenic" [...] – to be met with the lightning rejoinder from a heckler in that night's audience, [...] "Well, you can both <b>fuck</b> <b>off</b> then!". Julian Clary together with Fanny the Wonder dog were surprising hits at such evenings.|$|E
500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} <b>fuck</b> <b>off.</b> I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E

5000|$|While this {{perceived}} inauthenticity {{is viewed}} with scorn and contempt {{by members of}} the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it should be applied is subjective.

500|$|A second album, We Are the Way Forward, was {{recorded}} over an eight-day period and released by Out On a Limb in 2005. It received three from five {{stars in a}} review by RTÉ's Harry Guerin who said: [...] "you'll get what you paid for from their stomp and swing". Phil Udell's Hot Press review gave the album 4.5 out of five stars, saying it [...] "gives you that much sought after visceral thrill" [...] and that the duo [...] "wrote it, recorded it, <b>fucked</b> <b>off.</b> A classic".|$|R
500|$|... "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] was M2M's {{biggest hit}} and is their most {{recognisable}} song. While their next single, [...] "Mirror Mirror", {{was a top}} 40 single in Australia and Canada, and reached number 62 on the Billboard Hot 100, [...] "Don't Say You Love Me" [...] would remain M2M's only top-40 hit in the US, and their only hit at all in many other countries. The song {{has been called a}} one-hit wonder. While speaking favourably of the duo, in 2014 Abby Devora from MTV ranked M2M and the song at number 2 on her list [...] "9 Girl Group One-Hit Wonders You Need To Remember Right Now". Jessica Booth from Gurl.com included the duo and song in her 2012 list [...] "Flashback: 15 Old-School Girl Singers We Miss", calling the song [...] "ridiculously catchy". Kaitlin Cubria from Teen.com listed the duo and song in her 2014 list of [...] "12 forgotten girl groups from the '90s/'00s that are worth your time." [...] In 2014 Nathan Jolly from MAX said it was [...] "one of those few pop songs that is happiness incarnate despite being a 'back the <b>fuck</b> <b>off,</b> dude' anthem".|$|E
500|$|The second video, {{created to}} {{accompany}} the 1992 single release that was recorded at Sound City Studios, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the band's videos for [...] "Come as You Are" [...] and [...] "Lithium". Cobain's original concept for the video {{told the story of}} a young girl born into a Ku Klux Klan family who one day realizes how evil they are. His concept was too ambitious, so Cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The humorous tone of the video was a result of Cobain being [...] "so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously [...] [...] [...] I wanted to <b>fuck</b> <b>off</b> and show them that we have a humorous side to us". Kerslake filmed the video on old Kinescope cameras, and the band improvised its performance. The video begins with an unnamed variety show host (played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of The People's Court) introducing Nirvana to an in-studio crowd of screaming teenagers; their non-stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as [...] "thoroughly all right and decent fellas", perform dressed in Beach Boys-style outfits; Cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision, while Novoselic cut his hair short and liked it so much he kept it that way afterwards. As the video progresses, the band destroys the set and its instruments.|$|E
2500|$|This {{release was}} a kind of [...] "return to the roots" [...] - grindcore. After {{recording}} The World Keeps Turning EP, the band toured Europe with Dismember and Obituary on the [...] "Campaign for Musical Destruction" [...] tour. They then toured the US with Sepultura, Sacred Reich and Sick Of It All. The proceeds of Napalm Death's 1993 EP Nazi Punks <b>Fuck</b> <b>Off</b> were donated to anti-fascist organisations. The Nazi Punks <b>Fuck</b> <b>Off</b> EP was inspired by Napalm Death touring South Africa during 1993. Thus they were the first international grind core act to tour South Africa.|$|E

Corbyn did not intervene. Owen Bennett wrote in The Huffington Post that Phillips recounted: I roundly told her to fuck off.' When asked what Ms Abbott did after that suggestion, Ms Phillips replied: 'She <b>fucked</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
500|$|After {{a concert}} in Athens, Strummer went to Spain to clear his mind. While he was abroad, the first single from Cut the Crap, the mournful [...] "This Is England", was {{released}} to mostly negative reviews. [...] "CBS had paid an advance for it {{so they had to}} put it out", Strummer later explained. [...] "I just went, 'Well fuck this', and <b>fucked</b> <b>off</b> to the mountains of Spain to sit sobbing under a palm tree, while Bernie had to deliver a record." [...] However, critic Dave Marsh later championed [...] "This Is England" [...] {{as one of the top}} 1001 rock singles of all time.

2500|$|The band made a demo tape but, {{instead of}} mailing {{the tape to}} record companies, they would go in and {{personally}} deliver it.

2500|$|Just after 3pm on Sunday, 4 December 2005, {{police were}} called to North Cronulla Beach {{following}} a report of an assault on two off-duty surf lifesavers by four {{members of a group}} of eight Middle Eastern men. A verbal exchange had taken place after three lifesavers approached a group of four young Lebanese men on Cronulla Beach with both groups accusing the other of staring at them. One of the Lebanese men reportedly responded to the accusations, [...] "I'm allowed to; now <b>fuck</b> <b>off</b> and leave our beach", to which a lifesaver responded, [...] "I come down here out of my own spare time to save you dumb cunts from drowning; now piss off, you scum".|$|E
5000|$|The {{results were}} still deemed unsatisfactory, {{and there was}} little chance of another attempt at {{recording}} the album. The recordings already made had to be used. In desperation, Creation's Marcus Russell contacted engineer-turned-producer Owen Morris, who had previously mixed the album's songs. [...] "I just thought, 'They've messed up here,'" [...] Morris recalled after hearing the Sawmills recordings. [...] "I guessed at that stage Noel was completely <b>fucked</b> <b>off.</b> Marcus was like, 'You {{can do what you}} like - literally, whatever you want." [...] Among the producer's first tasks was to strip away the layers of guitar overdubs Gallagher had added, although he noted that Gallagher's overdubs allowed him to construct the musical dynamics of songs such as [...] "Columbia" [...] and [...] "Rock 'n Roll Star".|$|R

One definition of the genre is [...] "a form of exceptionally harsh punk rock." [...] Like the Oi! subgenre of the UK, hardcore punk can be considered an internal music reaction.

2500|$|On Chaos A.D., Sepultura honored one {{of their}} biggest idols, Jello Biafra. Max had called Biafra asking him to {{contribute}} to the album with a song about the growing neo-Nazi movement. [...] "I asked for something like 'Nazi Punks <b>Fuck</b> <b>Off</b> - Part 2'", remembers Max, referring to the anti-Nazi song [...] "Nazi Punks Fuck Off" [...] by the Dead Kennedys. But Biafra wasn't interested in recycling old ideas and he suggested a song called [...] "Biotech Is Godzilla", that he had written during his visit to Eco '92, a world conference about ecology organized in Rio de Janeiro. [...] "Jello spent ten minutes explaining me his crazy theories", said Max to Anamaria G. of Bizz magazine, [...] "he said that George Bush had sent a group of scientists to Brazil to test germs and bacteria on human beings and use them as guinea pigs.

2500|$|At Woodstock in 1969, Hoffman {{reportedly}} interrupted The Who's {{performance to}} attempt to speak against the jailing of John Sinclair of the White Panther Party.

[...] Pete Townshend was adjusting his amplifier between songs and turned to look at Hoffman over his left shoulder. Townshend shouted [...] "Fuck off! <b>Fuck</b> <b>off</b> my fucking stage!" [...] and reportedly ran at Hoffman with his guitar and hit Hoffman in the back, although Townshend later denied attacking Hoffman. Townshend later said that while he actually agreed with Hoffman on Sinclair's imprisonment, he would have knocked him offstage regardless of the content of his message, given that Hoffman had violated the [...] "sanctity of the stage," [...] i.e., the right of the band to perform uninterrupted by distractions not relevant to the show. The incident took place during a camera change, and was not captured on film. The audio of this incident, however, can be heard on The Who's box set, Thirty Years of Maximum R (Disc 2, Track 20, [...] "Abbie Hoffman Incident").|$|E
