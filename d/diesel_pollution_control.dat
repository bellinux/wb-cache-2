This paper examines several efficiency properties of cost-effective <b>pollution</b> <b>control</b> strategies in a stochastic setting when economic damages from pollution are unknown.

(B) There is heterogeneity in the marginal pollutant concentration reduction cost among various districts {{as a result of the}} cities' varying contribution of unit emission reduction to the pollutant concentration reduction, and their diverse unit cost of emission reduction brought about by their different industry composition.

25|$|<b>Pollution</b> <b>control</b> is a {{term used}} in {{environmental}} management. It means the control of emissions and effluents into air, water or soil. Without <b>pollution</b> <b>control,</b> the waste products from overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation and other human activities, whether they accumulate or disperse, will degrade the environment. In the hierarchy of <b>controls,</b> <b>pollution</b> prevention and waste minimization are more desirable than <b>pollution</b> <b>control.</b> In the field of land development, low impact development is a similar technique {{for the prevention of}} urban runoff.|$|R
