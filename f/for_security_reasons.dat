5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on Uranium was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the Uranium Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the Uranium Committee was again placed directly under Bush. <b>For</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> GCHQ {{moved its}} own {{computers}} and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost {{more than three times}} their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E

The administrator, however, openly defied the criminal organization's threat through Facebook. His wife and children reportedly fled to the United States after the threats <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> but the citizen journalist stated on the Facebook page that {{he had decided to}} stay in Mexico and continue updating at Valor por Tamaulipas. In December 2014, however, the administrator announced his retirement from social media.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the living}} {{conditions}} of the Robinsons varied according {{to whether or not}} they had had time to prepare. There were roughly three days between the signing of the capitulation and the deadline for civilians to leave the city, during which those who made the decision to stay could stockpile food and water, and camouflage their hiding places. As time passed, supplies ran out, and many Robinsons had to change their locations <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b> The situation soon became equally desperate for all who remained.|$|E

5|$|The {{relief of}} the {{garrison}} and replacement with fresh troops were finally agreed. The first stage saw the 1st Polish Carpathian Brigade replace the 18th Australian Infantry Brigade. Next came the 6th Infantry Division's 16th Infantry Brigade, during late September, with {{elements of the}} 32nd Army Tank Brigade, {{in lieu of the}} 24th Australian Infantry Brigade. On 10October, <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons</b> and in an attempt to confuse Axis intelligence as to when the division was fully redeployed, the 6th Infantry Division was renamed the 70th Infantry Division. Major-General Ronald Scobie was given command.|$|E

5|$|By 1945, Roane-Anderson was {{divesting}} {{itself of}} many of its tasks. American Industrial Transit took over the transport system, and Southern Bell the telephone system. Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson. The dental service was transferred to civilians in February 1946, and private medical practices were permitted at Oak Ridge from 1 March 1946 on.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Rosenborg had {{qualified}} for the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, UEFA had <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons</b> introduced restrictions which reduced Lerkendal's capacity to 12,200 spectators. In addition, a total ban on standing places would be introduced from 1997. In 1995, a debate arose between Rosenborg and Trondheim Municipality regarding {{the construction of a}} new grandstand, to be located on the north side of the stadium. Rosenborg's Nils Skutle stated that if it was not built ahead of the 1997–98 season, Rosenborg would only be allowed to sell 2,800 tickets to their home Champions League matches, and that they instead would be forced to play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. The new grandstand cost 32 million, and opened in 1996 season. The upgrades also included a new floodlight and public announcement system.|$|E

5|$|<b>For</b> <b>{{security}}</b> <b>reasons,</b> Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Rotblat {{in charge}} in Liverpool, Chadwick began {{a tour of}} the Manhattan Project {{facilities}} in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man apart from Groves and his second in command to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. <b>For</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons,</b> he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place <b>for</b> <b>security</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E
