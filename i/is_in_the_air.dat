25|$|Some {{cephalopods}} {{are able}} to fly through the air for distances of up to 50m. While cephalopods are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these impressive ranges by jet-propulsion; water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The animals spread their fins and tentacles to form wings and actively control lift force with body posture. One species, Todarodes pacificus, has been observed spreading tentacles in a flat fan shape with a mucus film between the individual tentacles while another, Sepioteuthis sepioidea, has been observed putting the tentacles in a circular arrangement.|$|E
25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, as one would expect. The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E
25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps inside the room, an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E

Lyrically, the track is about falling in love during the Christmas season. Set in the key of D♭ major, the song has a [...] "slow" [...] feel and a tempo of 50beats per minute; Carey's voice spans just short of two octaves from F♯3 to E5.

Lyrically, Carey makes a plea to Santa Claus asking him to bring back her [...] "baby" [...] in time for Christmas, singing [...] "Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas." [...] Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle noted that it has a 1960s girl-group swing feel to it.

Cary Ganz of Rolling Stone described it as a [...] "straightforward and sweet" [...] performance. [...] "Christmas Time <b>Is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> Again" [...] is softly sung ballad backed by a string section and embellished with bells and chimes.

[...] Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine gave the album {{two and a half stars}} our of five, writing [...] "Everything about Carey’s sequel to 1994’s buoyant, if, in retrospect, safe, Merry Christmas is as desperate and habitual as it is reassuringly predictable."
