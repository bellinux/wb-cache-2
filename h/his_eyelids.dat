5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a black dwarf. He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E
25|$|The biographical {{tradition}} {{is littered with}} apocryphal tales about Bodhidharma's life and circumstances. In one version of the story, {{he is said to}} have fallen asleep seven years into his nine years of wall-gazing. Becoming angry with himself, he cut off <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> to prevent it from happening again. According to the legend, as <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> hit the floor the first tea plants sprang up, and thereafter tea would provide a stimulant to help keep students of Chan awake during zazen.|$|E
25|$|Although {{blindness}} {{was indeed}} a common result of smallpox, ophthalmologist Richard H. C. Zegers suggests that Mozart's symptoms did not represent actual blindness, but rather resulted from the pustular rash of the disease affecting <b>his</b> <b>eyelids.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The {{flutter of}} <b>his</b> <b>eyelid</b> {{fortified}} Soames in {{a resolution to}} write direct to the new Bolderby, suggesting that the only dignified {{way of dealing with}} an Old Crome was to avoid dealers. He therefore said, [...] "Well, good-day!" [...] and went, leaving Dumetrius the wiser.|$|R
25|$|In Anthony Burgess' book A Clockwork Orange, Alex, the anti-hero of the book, {{undergoes}} a fictional medical torture program called 'The Ludovico Technique', {{in which he}} is given a nausea-inducing drug, strapped to a chair with <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> forced open and forced to watch hours of films of extreme violence and rape to condition him to associate feelings of nausea with rape and violence.|$|E
500|$|... "The Diving Bell and the Butterball" [...] was a satire of the 2007 French film The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, {{in which}} a paralyzed man learns to {{communicate}} through moving <b>his</b> <b>eyelids.</b> Instead of moving <b>his</b> <b>eyelids,</b> Homer communicated through flatulence. The segment took off in different direction when Homer was bitten by another spider {{and turned into a}} paralyzed Spider-Man with reversed colors, swinging around Springfield and fighting crime. The last part references the Spider-Man musical, [...] that was plagued by stage malfunctions and sometimes left its performers to dangle in mid-air. The many accidents caused five people to become injured while working on the musical.|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised over the mistreatment of {{primates}} undergoing testing. In 1985 the case of Britches, a macaque monkey at the University of California, Riverside, gained public attention. He had <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> sewn shut and a sonar sensor on his head {{as part of an}} experiment to test sensory substitution devices for blind people. The laboratory was raided by Animal Liberation Front in 1985, removing Britches and 466 other animals. The National Institutes of Health conducted an eight-month investigation and concluded, however, that no corrective action was necessary. During the 2000s other cases have made headlines, including experiments at the University of Cambridge and Columbia University in 2002. In 2004 and 2005, undercover footage of staff of Covance's, a contract research organization that provides animal testing services, Virginia lab was shot by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Following release of the footage, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Covance $8,720 for 16 citations, three of which involved lab monkeys; the other citations involved administrative issues and equipment.|$|E

50|$|On September 3, 2008, Giambi {{walked into}} a {{bathroom}} door {{in his hotel room}} while in Florida before playing against the Tampa Bay Rays. The accident caused him to split <b>his</b> <b>eyelid</b> open but he played through the injury later that night and went one for four with one RBI, helping the Yankees win game 2 of the series.|$|R
2500|$|In {{recent years}} the hip hop world has seen a {{resurgence}} of old fads {{as well as the}} emergence of new ones. The last few years of {{the first decade of the}} new millennia gave rise to the popularity of tattoos covering artists from head to toe. Soulja Boy, Wiz Khalifa, Lil' Wayne and Tyga are all examples of artists that have set the trend of being completely [...] "tatted up. [...] " [...] Although having tattoos is nothing new to the music industry, never have tattoos been so pervasive in the hip hop industry. Tattoos covering the face and the head have also become increasingly popular. For example, Birdman now sports a star tattoo on the crown of his head, Gucci Mane proudly boasts an ice cream tattoo on his right cheek, and Lil Wayne has tattoos on <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> and forehead.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Davis, the vocalist of Korn, {{spoke about}} the {{criticism}} of nu metal from heavy metal fans, saying [...] Lamb of God's vocalist Randy Blythe criticized the nu metal genre and spoke about its loss of popularity in 2004, saying, [...] "Nu-metal sucks, so that's why that's dying off. And I think..... people are ready for angrier music. I think people are ready for something that's real, not, you know, 'I did it all for the nookie.'" [...] Dave Mustaine of the heavy metal band Megadeth said he would [...] "rather have <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> pulled out" [...] than listen to nu metal. Gary Holt, {{a member of the}} thrash metal bands Exodus and Slayer, said that he [...] "was so glad about" [...] the decline of [...] Despite the large amount of criticism that the genre received, Jack Porter of The Michigan Daily defended , writing [...] Additionally, Jody Macgregor of FasterLouder called nu metal [...] "music's most hated genre" [...] and wrote that nu metal is [...] "not as bad as people think".|$|E
2500|$|Scull {{handles the}} cage {{so well that}} Ahumado has him taken down, and has his henchman Goyeto cut off <b>his</b> <b>eyelids.</b> [...] Ahumado sends word to Austin that he will return Scull for a ransom of one {{thousand}} cattle. [...] Governor Pease sends the Rangers out once again, to collect the cattle and exchange the herd for Scull. [...] The Rangers go to Lonesome Dove in search of cattleman Captain King. [...] Realizing {{they will not be}} able to even gather the cattle, let alone persuade King to sell them, Call and McCrae set out to try to rescue Scull on their own terms, leaving the rest of their troop behind. [...] Meanwhile, Ahumado has been bitten by a brown recluse spider, and goes South to die. [...] Call and McCrae find Scull going insane in a pit, [...] but the rescue is soon enough to allow Scull to mostly recover. Scull returns to Austin and later becomes a general with the Union army. [...] Because of the eyepieces he has devised, he becomes known as [...] "Blinders" [...] Scull.|$|E

60|$|But she sat transfixed. There they lay--the soft-featured Nee-Koo; the gnarled old face of Gnob; Makamuk, {{grinning}} {{at her with}} his lifted upper lip; and lastly, Nossabok, <b>his</b> <b>eyelid,</b> up to its old trick, drooped on his girlish cheek in a suggestive wink. There they lay, the firelight flashing upon and playing over them, and from each of them a widening circle dyed the snow to scarlet.|$|R
2500|$|The {{central figure}} here is Romanian Army officer Titel Ursu. A Germanophile, he finds {{war on the}} Entente side to be a humiliation, and, once on the front line, sabotages the war effort {{to the point where}} he is arrested and tried for treason. In contrast, his father, Captain Costache Ursu, is by everyone's {{standards}} a war hero, and firmly believes in the patriotic virtues of the pro-Entente leaders. They confront each other on prison grounds: while Titel is awaiting execution, his indignant father urges him to commit suicide and save their honor—the [...] "keystone" [...] moment, according to Cubleșan. Costache hatred for his son, although counterbalanced by pity and regret, bewildered critics of that day and age. A fragment reads: [...] " [...] hated Titel, hated him with ever-burning embers between <b>his</b> <b>eyelids,</b> with a slab of stone on his chest, that shortened his breath. [...] His son's existence on the face of the earth seemed to him a horrible mistake." [...] Later commentators found more sympathy for Aderca's attempt: Zalis argued that Aderca had intended to [...] "collect, from the cortege of massacres, the effort of conscience of exasperation and perplexity". Elevated to hero status in interwar Greater Romania, and decorated with the Order of Michael the Brave, Costache is attracted into far-right politics, only to find that he has been manipulated by more cynical political partners. His hatred for Titel then morphs into a burning regret, and pushes Costache to suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{first appeared}} in the Defenders of the Realm cartoon and Mythologies as a tall, bald figure wearing an teal-colored bodysuit under a black tabard adorned with ornamental spikes on the shoulders, accented by a yin-yang symbol on the sternum. Designed by Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, this style was carried over into Mortal Kombat 4, but for Deadly Alliance, the first release following Tobias' 2000 departure from Midway, Quan Chi's design was minimized with him going shirtless and revealing a well-built physique with only a black bandolier across his chest, in addition to simple black trousers and knee-high boots, with Shinnok's amulet usually attached to his belt; this has remained his primary template in all his MK appearances thereafter, while his first design returned as an alternate costume in several games. In conceptual sketches by Deadly Alliance character designer Allen Ditzig, Quan Chi was seen brandishing a [...] "mysterious living weapon"—a staff topped with a grotesque head capable of spewing green mist and flies from its mouth. Though the staff was cut from the game, its concept was used in the creation of Drahmin, one of whose offensive moves involved shooting flies at his opponent. The one element of Quan Chi's design that has remained unchanged is his albino skin tone, with simple parallel black stripes extending upward from <b>his</b> <b>eyelids</b> and extending over {{the top of his head}} in his first appearances, then enhanced in Deadly Alliance and onward with an extensive collection of red tattoo-like markings on his head, back and arms, in addition to an elliptical red gem planted in the center of his forehead.|$|E

50|$|Belcher faced Michael Bisping on April 27, 2013 at UFC 159. Bisping {{controlled}} {{the majority of}} the fight due to his conditioning and cardio pushing a constant pace. The bout was stopped at 4:29 of round 3 as Bisping inadvertently poked Belcher in the eye, rendering Belcher unable to continue. Bisping won the bout via technical unanimous decision. Belcher got eight stitches in <b>his</b> <b>eyelid</b> after the fight.|$|R
60|$|For {{several hours}} the doctor sat reading by Ned's bedside.
