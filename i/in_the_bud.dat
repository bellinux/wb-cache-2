25|$|Here, {{one should}} also {{understand}} that an evil suggestion is {{the starting point of}} evil act. When it affects a careless or heedless person, it creates in him a desire for evil. Then, further whisperings change the evil desire into an evil intention and evil purpose. When the evil suggestion grows in intensity, the intention becomes a resolution, which then culminates in the evil act. Therefore, the meaning of seeking God's refuge from the evil of the whisperer is that God should nip the evil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bud.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{typically}} red, orange, or yellow or {{any combination of}} those colours, and are aggregated in inflorescences that are spikes or panicles (thyrses). Although gardeners enjoy these odd flowers, nature really intended them to attract pollinators collecting nectar and pollen, such as bees, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and bats. The pollination mechanism is conspicuously specialized. Pollen is shed on the style while still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bud,</b> and in the species and early hybrids some is also found on the stigma {{because of the high}} position of the anther, which means that they are self-pollinating. Later cultivars have a lower anther, and rely on pollinators alighting on the labellum and touching first the terminal stigma, and then the pollen.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, {{director}} and writer Alejandro Jodorowsky set {{about creating a}} cinematic adaptation, taking over the option that producer Arthur P.

25|$|Flower buds {{are formed}} in March and April and these open from October {{to the end}} of December varying {{according}} to location and altitude. The inflorescence sits {{at the end of the}} branches in an umbel-like panicle that consists of five to ten flowers. Each flower is hermaphrodite, starsymmetric, 2½—3½cm in diameter and produces copious amounts of nectar, but apparently does not emit a scent. The five sepals are broadly oval, covered in downy hairs and 5–6mm long. The five petals are overlapping <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bud,</b> white, felty, spoon-shaped with a narrow base (or claw). The claw is 1½-2cm long and is inserted on a 5-lobed disc. The five stamens extend well beyond the corolla and alternate with the five lobes of the disc at the centre of the flower. The filaments are very long and white. The anthers are connected to the filaments midlength and open in lengthwise slits towards the middle of the flower. Pollen grains have five slits. The nectar is produced by the ledges of the disc, just above the petal inplant. The five styles that rise from the disc are sometimes free from each other at their based and are twisting and fused higher up.|$|E

500|$|Oppenheimer {{was awarded}} a United States National Research Council {{fellowship}} to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in September 1927. Bridgman also wanted him at Harvard, so a compromise was reached whereby he split his fellowship for the 1927–28 academic year between Harvard in 1927 and Caltech in 1928. At Caltech he struck up a close friendship with Linus Pauling, and they planned to mount a joint attack {{on the nature of}} the chemical bond, a field in which Pauling was a pioneer, with Oppenheimer supplying the mathematics and Pauling interpreting the results. Both the collaboration and their friendship were nipped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> when Pauling began to suspect Oppenheimer of becoming too close to his wife, Ava Helen Pauling.
