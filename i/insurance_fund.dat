5|$|He {{was elected}} the 33rd {{governor}} of Oregon in 1986, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and {{a doubling of}} the state's prison population. He worked across party lines to reduce regulation and to repair the state's infrastructure. During his term, Oregon emerged from nearly eight years of recession. His reforms to the State Accident <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (SAIF), a state-chartered worker's compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Goldschmidt {{brokered}} {{agreements between}} business, labor and insurance interests {{that changed the}} state's workers' compensation regulations. Workers' compensation has been a contentious issue in Oregon for some time, as the state-run State Accident <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (SAIF) insures approximately 35% of the workforce. The legislature passed a law as a result. The changes were considered to benefit the insurance industry and business interests, {{at the expense of}} claimants, who were required to establish more extensively that their employers were responsible for injuries. The issue was contentious for some time, involving lawsuits and various efforts to modify the law. In 2000, Governor John Kitzhaber attempted to reform the system again. This led to a new law in the 2001 Legislature, which was complicated by an Oregon Supreme Court ruling that occurred during deliberations.|$|E

25|$|In February 2006, President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related {{conforming}} amendments act.

Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (BIF) and the Savings Association <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the <b>insurance</b> <b>fund.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} cost savings {{potential}} {{with regard to}} administration and management costs by merging Public Employment Accident <b>Insurance</b> <b>Funds</b> (Öffentliche Unfallkassen) in Germany. Our data base consists of the annual reports of the public statutory accident <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> from 1999 to 2005. Results of a multivariate regression analysis help to identify cost drivers and the potential existence of economies of scale. The numbers of employee accidents and pupil accidents as well as expenditures to prevent accidents serve as explanatory variables for administration and management costs. The main results are as follows. First, public accident <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> are very heterogeneous with regard to administration and management costs. Second, these cost differences are unrelated {{to the size of}} <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> (the number of insured employees and pupils). There is no evidence for cost savings of larger <b>insurance</b> <b>funds,</b> i. e., economies of scale. Third, accidents of pupils entail substantially lower management and administration costs than accidents of employees. Furthermore, there is evidence that higher expenditures to prevent accidents such as accident prevention programs also involve higher administration and management costs.

The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted {{to qualify for the}} BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.|$|E
