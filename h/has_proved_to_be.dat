5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins. The committee {{was of the}} view that the Boltzmann constant provided a better basis for temperature measurement than did the triple point of water, as it overcame these difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a major cause}} behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming {{needed to keep the}} tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, KFC International {{launched}} the Krusher (Krushem in some markets) line of frozen beverages. The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards teenagers. In April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a success for the company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013. In September 2012, the Chicken Little sandwich returned in the US.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, the Barmouth Viaduct Access Group (B-VAG), was {{established}} to investigate an alternative route from the town centre to the bridge, as the current walkway is steep, narrow, and unsuitable for buggies or wheelchairs. In June, the toll was removed after the collectors left and were not replaced. The council have not yet decided {{how to pay for}} the bridge's maintenance costs, which were £39,405 for the year. This <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> problematic as the revenue collected from tolls has not been sufficient to cover the council's share of costs, and there is not a sufficient budget to employ any full-time staff to collect payments.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul is {{primarily}} {{known for its}} Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. Nothing of {{the architecture of the}} classical Greek period has survived, but Roman architecture <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more durable. The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, and a section of the Valens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at {{the western edge of the}} Fatih district. The Column of Constantine, erected in 330 CE to mark the new Roman capital, stands not far from the Hippodrome.|$|E

5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|Henry II {{appears as}} a {{character}} in several modern plays and films. He is a central character in James Goldman's 1966 play The Lion in Winter, set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king although, as Goldman acknowledges, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional. The Lion in Winter <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an enduring representation of Henry, being turned into an Academy-Award-winning film and remade in 2003 for television. Henry also appears in the play Becket by Jean Anouilh, filmed in 1964; once again, however, {{the character of the}} King is deliberately fictitious, driven by the need for drama between Henry and Becket in the play. The Becket controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and Becket form the basis both {{for a discussion of the}} more superficial events of Becket's death, and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, Orkney and Shetland {{remained}} a Norwegian possession, but Scottish influence was growing. Jon Haraldsson, who {{was murdered in}} Thurso in 1231, {{was the last of}} an unbroken line of Norse jarls, and thereafter the earls were Scots noblemen of the houses of Angus and St Clair. On the death of Haakon VI in 1380, Norway formed a political union with Denmark, after which the interest of the royal house in the islands declined. In 1469, Shetland was pledged by Christian I, in his capacity as King of Norway, as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter Margaret, betrothed to James III of Scotland. As the money was never paid, the connection with the Crown of Scotland became permanent. In 1470, William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness ceded his title to James III, and the following year the Northern Isles were directly annexed to the Crown of Scotland, an action confirmed by the Parliament of Scotland in 1472. Nonetheless, Shetland's connection with Norway <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enduring.|$|E

5|$|Neighbours <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{more popular}} in the United Kingdom than in Australia. It was {{screened}} on BBC One from 1986 until 2008. The series started airing on 27 October 1986, as part of BBC1's revamped daytime schedules. Neighbours went out twice a day, with a morning broadcast and then a showing at lunchtime. Michael Grade, the channel's then controller, was advised by his daughter to move the series to 5:35pm, as {{she and her friends}} kept missing it due to them being at school, which took place from January 1988. The show then started attracting larger audiences, peaking in 1990 at over 21 million. Towards the late 2000s, Neighbours was normally attracting an average of 3million viewers for its lunchtime showing and 2.6million viewers for its early-evening repeat. It was frequently the highest-rating daytime programme in the UK, outside of news bulletins.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span {{a period of}} over 9000years. The artifacts were disposed {{in a manner that}} permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum <b>has</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied {{near the end of the}} Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000BC.|$|E
