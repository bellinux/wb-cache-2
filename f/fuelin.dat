5000|$|Set the Booty Up Right [...] is a five-song EP {{released}} by the alternative/funk/rock band Fishbone in 1990. It was recorded shortly after the band hired former Miles Davis music director John Bigham on guitar and keyboard (though Bigham is not pictured in the band photo on the back cover of the CD). The EP served as a stopgap release for fans, due to production delays for the full album The Reality of My Surroundings, which was released in 1991. The EP features two alternate versions of the song [...] "Bonin in the Boneyard" [...] (the original version of which is found on the 1988 album Truth and Soul) as well as three new studio tracks. It has long been out of print, but the track [...] "Love and Bullshit" [...] was included on the 1996 retrospective Fishbone 101: Nuttasaurusmeg Fossil <b>Fuelin</b> the Fonkay.|$|E
50|$|As {{result of}} the {{energetic}} optimisation of buildings in the town, expenditure on energy was reduced by almost 50%. Then a wood burning plant that provided heating for 27 houses was built. Then, a facility was constructed which turned rapeseed into car <b>fuel.In</b> 1998, Koch and Vadasz saw a presentation by a Viennese scientist, Hermann Hofbauer, about a technology he had developed to make an alternative fuel from wood.They asked Hofbauer and Vienna's Technical University to build a pilot project in Güssing applying the technology, where wood chips are gasified under high temperature conditions. Gas fuels a Jenbacher engine that produces electricity and the “by-product” heat is used to produce warm water for the district heating system. Plant efficiency about 82-85%. Research and development went further on, so Güssing hosts today a number of innovative technologies, solutions, and patents. There is a team of highly trained technicians and “imported” scientists working in Güssing today.|$|E

In August 2014, Defence Minister David Johnston announced the intention to purchase two additional KC-30As with one in VIP configuration for transport of the Prime Minister. In July 2015, Defence Minister Kevin Andrews announced the order of two additional KC-30s, to be delivered in 2018. The new tankers {{will be based on}} A330-200 airliners that were previously operated by Qantas on lease from CIT Aerospace, and will be the first KC-30As to be converted from airframes that have already seen civilian service. A formal decision to add a [...] "modest" [...] VIP fitout to one of the KC-30s was made in 2016.

5000|$|During the Crimean War, the {{regiment}} formed {{part of the}} Light Brigade. The regiment set sail from Plymouth in early March 1854. Five ships were needed to transport them to the Black Sea. The Echunga, Mary Anne and the Shooting Star left first, followed by the Medora and the Wilson Kennedy on 1 May. The regiment suffered heavy losses at the Siege of Silistra in late March 1854. The next battle was near the River Alma in September 1854 and the 8th Hussars were awarded the battle honour for a convincing defeat of the enemy. On 28 September, following a report that Russian troops were {{out in front of}} Balaklava town, the troop of the 8th, which made up Lord Raglan's escort under Captain Chetwode, was thrown out in skirmishing order. The Horse Artillery then came up and opened fire, causing the Russians to abandon all their wagons and flee from the scene. Some seventy wagons and carts were captured, some only containing small arms ammunition which was destroyed. The rest of the wagons contained black bread. The troops were allowed to pillage the wagons that did not contain anything of value to the Commissariat. As a result, within a few minutes, the ground was strewn with various pieces of clothing - Hussar uniforms, fur cloaks and wigs. The carriages were said to belong to the suite of Prince Menshikov. After this engagement until 25 October, {{the regiment}} furnished patrols and outpost duties, being billeted close to vineyards and barns containing water, corn, hay and <b>fuel.In</b> October, Balaklava and the Charge of the Light Brigade took place. It was started when 25,000 Russians tried to capture Balaklava, the British Army's only port, defended by the 93rd Highlanders, some Turks, and the Cavalry Division. Lieutenant Colonel Sherwell led the King's Royal Irish Hussars, forbidding two soldiers to carry their swords in the charge because they had [...] "Disgraced the regiment by smoking {{in the presence of the}} enemy". The charge through the crossfire into the mouths of the Russian guns is vividly described by Lieutenant the Hon S Calthorpe, an 8th Hussar ADC.|$|E
50|$|Tusker {{was founded}} to supply {{contract}} hire and leasing cars through an online platform with lead investor Smedvig Capital, a London-based venture capital firm. In 2005, Smedvig almost doubled their investment in Tusker, increasing their shares from 49-93%. When the recession hit in 2008, the business changed focus and now concentrates on providing a salary sacrifice car scheme, {{the first of}} which was launched in 2008 with multinational law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.By offering salary sacrifice schemes, corporate customers can provide their employees with a car benefit scheme. Employees offset part of their salary each month before it gets taxed in exchange for a new car complete with road tax, car insurance, breakdown cover, MOT and car servicing, employees continue to pay for <b>fuel.In</b> 2012, Tusker secured funding from Barclays to finance the expansion of their fleet. In the same year, the company established links with the Teenage Cancer Trust who they continue to support regularly through various fundraising events, such as Tough Mudder and donations of Easter eggs to young patients. In October 2013, Tusker introduced a Carbon Offsetting Project with the aim of having a fleet composed solely of carbon neutral cars by 2017. In partnership with Carbon Footprint Ltd, all of Tusker's customers' drivers choose a Verified Carbon Standard carbon offsetting project to compensate for their CO2 emissions through funding an equivalent carbon dioxide saving elsewhere. Drivers have a choice of three projects, a Landfill Gas Project in Indonesia, a Wind Power Project in India and a Hydroelectric Project in Chile. These initiatives not only counteract carbon emissions, but also help to support the local communities and all meet the Quality Assurance Standard for Carbon Offsetting. During 2014, Tusker offset 30,000 tons of tailpipe carbon emissions.2014 saw Tusker renew their government framework agreement with North Yorkshire County Council, originally secured in 2010, allowing them to provide salary sacrifice car schemes to the local authorities. Also in 2014, Tusker's CEO David Hosking began a campaign for the amendment of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document. Teachers in state maintained schools in the UK are not eligible for company cars through the salary sacrifice scheme, despite being allowed involvement in similar schemes for childcare benefits and cycle equipment. The company continued their campaign into 2015, but is yet to see a revision of the document permitting teachers access to the scheme, even though they have accrued support from 22 MPs and more than 1,200 teachers who have signed an online petition. In 2015, following the exit of Smedvig Capital, the company formed a new partnership with ECI Partners who continue to back the firm.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{measurements}} of the global power and particle balance in the high-performance phase of negative central magnetic shear (NCS) discharges and compare with reference VH–mode discharges. The principal differences observed are that NCS has a much lower {{fraction of the total}} input power flowing into the boundary, less core radiation, and larger rate of stored energy increase as a fraction of total power. Scrape-off layer (SOL) temperature and divertor heat flux profiles, and radiation profiles at the midplane, are similar to VH–mode. Due to the good core particle confinement and efficient fueling by neutral beam injection (NBI), with little gas puffing, the gas load on the walls and the recycling are very low during the NCS discharges. This results in a rate of density rise relative to beam <b>fuelin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Objectives:Turbulent Drag Reduction (DR) {{efficacy}} of diesel <b>fuelin</b> a Rotating Disk Apparatus (RDA) using anionic surfactant of Sodium Lauryl Ether Sulfate (SLES) was investigated with smooth andSV-groove disks(riblets height of 900 and 3100 µm). Methods: The DR efficacy indicates how the torque is being reduced {{with a tiny}} amount of additives under a turbulent flow at a Reynolds number (Re) range of 302227 to 453341. The effects of different variables such as rotary disk type (smooth or structured), surfactant concentration, and Reynolds number were also studied. Findings: SLES shows a good ability to reduce the frictional drag forces with smooth and SV-groove of height 3100 µm. In contract, there is no drag reduction can be observed by using this surfactant with SV-groove of height 900 µm.

40|$|In Section I the {{empirical}} Shimomura-Odajima "linear offset " scaling {{for the global}} energy confinement TG is analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Eliminating the temperature dependence of the ohmic power, positive scaling of T G with plasma current and a parameter id ' = 1. 6 ARnm emerges, where A is the aspect ratio, R the major radius in meters, and n 2 the plasma density in units of 10 /m-. In the moderately large auxiliary power limit, rG = 'r, + rkIl 8 /P [...] Here rd = 'dr and-r is the ohmic confinement time. An explicit reformulation is given for rG {{as a function of}} auxiliary (not total) power P., i. e., T/m = (1 + idP) /[P + (1 + idP) -] 2, P = P. JP and Po is the ohmic power before P _ is applied. This scaling favors high magnetic field tokamaks with large ARn. In Section II, we use the method of Callen, Cordey et al.

40|$|Biodiesel is alkyl esters {{that are}} {{produced}} through alcoholysis or (transesterification) process of triglycerides with methanol or ethanol {{in the presence}} of bases. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of the molar ratio and reaction time on the yield and quality of biodiesel from used cooking oil through transesterification process assisted ultrasonic wave at a frequency of 42 kHz. This research was conducted using waste cooking oil obtained from the cracker factory in Sukarame, Bandar Lampung. The chemicals used are methanol and NaOH as catalyst (both are of technical grade). The experiment was arranged by two factors, namely the molar ratio and reaction time. Factor molar ratio of methanol the used cooking oil is composed of three levels, namely 3 : 1, 4, 5 : 1, and 6 : 1. Reaction time factor consists of three levels, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 30 minutes. All treatments are carried out with three replications. The results showed that the presence of ultrasonic wave can eliminate the process of heating and stirring at conventional biodiesel transesterification process. Production of biodiesel produced in this reaction ranged from 55, 67 to 70, 67 % with the characteristics density of 0, 86 to 0, 94 kg/liter, acid number 0, 09 to 0, 15 %, and viscosity of 4, 16 to 8, 07 cSt. Statistically, molar ratio and reaction time significantly affect the yield and acid number of biodiesel but did not significantly affected the viscosity and density of biodiesel.
