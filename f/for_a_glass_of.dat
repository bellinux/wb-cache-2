One day, the latter insisted Eliyahu stop whatever he was doing and come visit him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> arak. Not wishing to upset the holy man, Eliyahu accepted the invitation, only to find out later that a disgruntled ex-litigant had gone to the beth din seeking to do him harm.|$|E

25|$|As an example, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> {{ice water}} in air at room temperature, the {{difference}} in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and {{not part of the}} room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.|$|E
25|$|A {{few weeks}} after Roberts' capture, the Royal James had to be {{abandoned}} because of worm damage. The Royal Rover headed for the island of Príncipe. Davis hoisted the flags of a British man-of-war and was allowed to enter the harbour. After a few days, Davis invited the governor to lunch on board his ship, intending to hold him hostage for a ransom. Davis had to send boats to collect the governor, and {{he was invited to}} call at the fort <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> wine first. The Portuguese had discovered that their visitors were pirates. They ambushed Davis' party {{on its way to the}} fort, shooting Davis dead.|$|E
500|$|Harry {{convinced}} Epstein to sell 12 {{copies of}} the first Mersey Beat newspaper at his North End Music Stores (NEMS), which sold out in one day, resulting in Epstein having to order more copies. After ordering and selling 144 {{copies of the}} second issue, Epstein invited Harry to his office <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> sherry, proposing {{the idea that he}} (Epstein), should write a record review column. It was published in the third issue on 3 August 1961, entitled [...] "Stop the World—And Listen To Everything in It: Brian Epstein of NEMS".|$|E

500|$|On another occasion, {{when she}} visited Bermuda, she {{was invited to}} a {{reception}} and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding {{that she was in}} a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: [...] "Well {{take a good look at}} me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges." [...] The Princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed. I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{associative}} use of recurring motifs, {{combined with}} unorthodox editing techniques, foreshadows key {{events in the}} film. [...] In Daphne du Maurier's novella it is Laura that wears a red coat, but in the film the colour is used to establish an association between Christine and the elusive figure that John keeps catching glimpses of. [...] Du Maurier's story actually opens in Venice following Christine's death from meningitis, but the decision was taken to change {{the cause of death}} to drowning and to include a prologue to exploit the water motif. The threat of death from falling is also ever present throughout the film: besides Christine falling into the lake, Laura is taken to hospital after her fall in the restaurant, their son Johnny is injured in a fall at boarding school, the bishop overseeing the church restoration informs John that his father was killed in a fall, and John himself is nearly killed in a fall during the renovations. Glass is frequently used as an omen that something bad is about to occur: just before Christine drowns, John knocks a glass of water over, and Johnny breaks a pane of glass; as Laura faints in the restaurant she knocks glassware off the table, and when John almost falls to his death in the church, a plank of wood shatters a pane of glass; finally, shortly before confronting the mysterious red clad figure, John asks the sisters <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water, a piece of symbolism that prefigured Christine's death.|$|E

2500|$|This quote {{is found}} in many {{translations}} of Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters. Vershinin, a cultured and philosophical character, makes reference to this famous quote when he says [...] "Half my kingdom <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> tea!".|$|E
2500|$|On {{meeting his}} future wife for the first time, George called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> brandy. He was evidently disappointed. Similarly, Caroline told Malmesbury, [...] " [...] very fat and he's nothing like as {{handsome}} as his portrait." [...] At dinner that evening, the Prince was appalled by Caroline's garrulous nature and her jibes {{at the expense of}} Lady Jersey. She was upset and disappointed by George's obvious partiality for Lady Jersey over her.|$|E
2500|$|At eleven o'clock, therefore, I would {{despatch}} Miss Botterill to a neighbouring {{branch of}} the Aerated Bread Company <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> hot milk and a substantial slice of a cake appropriately known as lunch cake. I would then, at twelve-thirty, repair in person to the same branch of this valuable company, where I would generally order {{from one of the}} quieter waitresses a double portion of sausages and mashed potatoes, accompanied by a cup of coffee, and followed by an apple dumpling or a segment of baked jam roll.|$|E
5000|$|The Quaker Girl is an Edwardian {{musical comedy}} in three acts {{with a book}} by James T. Tanner, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank, and music by Lionel Monckton. In its story, The Quaker Girl {{contrasts}} dour Quaker morality with Parisienne high fashion. The protagonist, Prudence, is thrown {{out of her house}} by her quaker parents <b>for</b> drinking <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> champagne. Later, in Paris, her grey dress and bonnet become the height of fashion.|$|R
60|$|The Reverend Mr. Jowls, my mother's director, was {{the only}} person to whom the door of her {{habitation}} was opened during my sojourn; and he would take no denial.

2500|$|Jim says {{a tender}} goodbye to Jenny, who, dressed in white, {{declares}} herself his widow. He surrenders her to Billy, his last remaining companion from Alaska. When {{he tries to}} delay the execution by reminding the people of Mahagonny that God exists, they play out for him, under Moses' direction, the story of [...] "God in Mahagonny", in which the Almighty condemns the town and is overthrown by its citizens, who declare {{that they can not}} be sent to Hell because they are already in Hell. Jim, chastened, asks only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water, but is refused even this as Moses gives the signal for the trap to be sprung.|$|E
2500|$|The {{work day}} for {{three-quarters of the}} {{enterprises}} in Paris was twelve hours, with two hours allowed for lunch. [...] Most workers lived far from their place of employment and public transport was expensive. A train on the inner circle line cost 75 centimes round-trip, so most workers walked {{to work with a}} half-kilogram loaf of bread for their lunch. [...] Construction workers on the grand projects of Haussmann in the city center had to leave home at 4 AM to arrive at work by 6 AM, when the day began. Taverns and wine merchants near the work sites were open at a very early hour; it was common for workers to stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> white wine before work to counter the effects of what they had drunk the night before.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{the hotel}} boasted lawn tennis courts facing Dundas Street. Also featured were {{hot and cold}} sea and fresh water baths. The hotel proved to be extremely popular and in 1876 magistrates granted an extension of opening hours from 10.00 pm to 11.00 pm to encourage trade. Alcoholic drinks, however, were still not allowed for consumption on the open terraces. In 1882, John Richardson was fined 5/- <b>for</b> drinking <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> beer outside the hotel. The manager of the hotel, Mr Verini, was also fined 5/- for supplying him.|$|R
60|$|The lawyer acquiesced {{and felt}} somehow {{that he had}} become {{the tail end of}} a procession, the Marquis's {{entrance}} and progress through the grillroom towards the smoking-room bar was marked by much deference on the part of porters, cloak-room attendants and waiters, a deference acknowledged in the barest possible fashion, yet in a manner which his satellite decided to make a study of. They reached a retired corner of the smoking room, where the Marquis subsided into the only vacant easy chair, ordered <b>for</b> himself <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> dry sherry, and left his companion to select his own refreshment and pay for both.|$|R

I convinced him to see a doctor, he accepted. Then Édouard added ‘I will die, it’s so sad to die so young and so far away from dear parents.’ He asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water.

The ambulance transported him to the Emergency Hospital where he died a few minutes later.” Édouard Beaupré died on July 3, 1904 from a pulmonary hemorrhage at age 23. Airne Benard, who acted as Édouard’s agent, had the body embalmed. Even {{at the time of his}} death, doctors determined that Beaupré was still growing.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{passport}} check, the hijackers {{had discovered that}} an Algerian police officer was a passenger on the flight. To get the Algerian government to cave in, the hijackers came to the police officer {{and asked him to}} follow them. Kakachi recalled that the police officer, two rows behind her, was hesitant to follow the hijackers as {{he did not know what}} was going to happen. Several passengers recalled him pleading [...] "Don't kill me, I have a wife and child!" [...] The hijackers shot the police officer in the head on the top of the boarding stairs. The pilots and most of the passengers initially did not know that the Algerian police officer had been killed. Delhemme recalled that his first contact with the passenger cabin during the hijacking was when a flight attendant, allowed into the cockpit, asked the pilots if they needed anything. According to Delhemme, he asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>of</b> water from the attendant as the pilots' throats were parched and the pilots had difficulty swallowing. The attendant then whispered to the captain that the hijackers had already killed a passenger.|$|E
2500|$|The priests {{celebrate}} Tamino's successes so far, {{and pray}} that he will succeed and become worthy of their order (Chorus: [...] ""). Pamina is brought in and Sarastro instructs Pamina and Tamino to bid each other farewell before the greater trials ahead, alarming them by describing it as their [...] "final farewell." [...] (Trio: Sarastro, Pamina, Tamino – [...] "" [...] Note: In order to preserve the continuity of Pamina's suicidal feelings, this trio is sometimes performed earlier in act 2, preceding or immediately following Sarastro's aria [...] "".)
