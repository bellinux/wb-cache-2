5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of <b>genetic</b> <b>epidemiology,</b> Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
25|$|Different {{fields in}} {{epidemiology}} have {{different levels of}} validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of <b>genetic</b> <b>epidemiology,</b> candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in <b>genetic</b> <b>epidemiology</b> as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.|$|E

25|$|As late as {{the mid-1970s}} there was little {{evidence}} of a genetic role in autism; evidence from <b>genetic</b> <b>epidemiology</b> studies now {{suggests that it is}} one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions. The first studies of twins estimated heritability to be more than 90%; in other words, that genetics explains more than 90% of autism cases. When only one identical twin is autistic, the other often has learning or social disabilities. For adult siblings, the risk of having one or more features of the broader autism phenotype might be as high as 30%, much higher than the risk in controls. About 10–15% of autism cases have an identifiable Mendelian (single-gene) condition, chromosome abnormality, or other genetic syndrome, and ASD is associated with several genetic disorders.|$|E
2500|$|The DSM-IV and ICD-10 {{diagnostic}} criteria {{have been criticized}} for being too broad and inadequate for assessing adults, overly narrow (particularly in relation to Hans Asperger's original description of individuals with AS), and vague; results of a large study in 2007 comparing the four sets of criteria point to a [...] "huge need to reconsider the {{diagnostic criteria}} of AS". [...] The study found complete overlap across all sets of diagnostic criteria in the impairment of social interaction with the exception of four cases not diagnosed by the Szatmari et al. criteria because of its emphasis on social solitariness. [...] Lack of overlap was strongest in the language delay and odd speech requirements of the Gillberg and the Szatmari requirements relative to DSM-IV and ICD-10, and in the differing requirements regarding general delays. A small 2008 study of children referred with a tentative diagnosis of AS found poor agreement among the four sets of criteria, with one overlap being only 39%. In 2007 Szatmari et al. suggested a new classification system of ASD based on familial traits found by <b>genetic</b> <b>epidemiology.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Implicitly, {{parasite}} molecular studies assume temporal genetic stability. In {{this study}} we tested, {{for the first time}} to our knowledge, the extent of changes in genetic diversity and structure of Sarcoptes mite populations from Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) in Asturias (Spain), using one multiplex of 9 microsatellite markers and Sarcoptes samples from sympatric Pyrenean chamois, red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Results The analysis of an 11 -years interval period found little change in the genetic diversity (allelic diversity, and observed and expected heterozygosity). The temporal stability in the genetic diversity was confirmed by population structure analysis, which was not significantly variable over time. Population structure analysis revealed temporal stability in the genetic diversity of Sarcoptes mite under the host-taxon law (herbivore derived- and carnivore derived- Sarcoptes mite) among the sympatric wild animals from Asturias. Conclusions The confirmation of parasite temporal genetic stability is of vital interest to allow generalizations to be made, which have further implications regarding the <b>genetic</b> structure, <b>epidemiology</b> and monitoring protocols of the ubiquitous Sarcoptes mite. This could eventually be applied to other parasite species. </p...|$|R
