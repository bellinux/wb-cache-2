500|$|Valene's storyline in {{her first}} two episodes on Dallas focuses on the {{rebuilding}} of her relationship with estranged ex-husband Gary Ewing. When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter, Lucy Ewing, she is brought back into {{the drama of the}} Ewing family. Upon arrival, she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love. Once Dallas became a hit, series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin-off series titled Knots Landing, which would feature Valene and Gary prominently. The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline. She recalled, [...] "I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." ...|$|E
500|$|The Doors had {{achieved}} commercial and critical success by 1969, but {{for much of}} that year, they were blacklisted from radio playlists and their concert bookings dwindled, after singer Jim Morrison {{had been charged with}} profanity and indecent exposure stemming from a concert in Miami, Florida, on March 1. Promoters feared another episode like this. Morrison, who craved recognition as a serious poet and had also begun dabbling in film, had mentioned leaving the group at the end of 1968, only to be convinced by keyboardist Ray Manzarek to stay on another six months. On September 20, 1970, Morrison was convicted for the Miami incident. In a 1971 interview with Ben Fong-Torres, Morrison said of Miami, [...] "I think subconsciously <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across in that concert, I was trying to reduce it to absurdity. And it worked too well." ...|$|E
500|$|At the US National Championships he equaled his 100m best of 9.84s {{while running}} into the wind. This was a meeting record and the second fastest 100m time with a {{headwind}} after Maurice Greene's 9.82s run. He followed this with a new 200m personal best in the finals, again facing an impeding wind. His time of 19.62s was the second fastest ever; only Johnson's 19.32s run at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was faster. Gay was happy with the achievement but noted that the competition was still strong: [...] "I wasn't thinking about any time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from Spearmon as fast as I could." [...] After noting that he was feeling worn out, Gay had a brief recuperation period {{in preparation for the}} 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan. He returned to the track in Europe and, while weather conditions were poor, he won the 200m in Lausanne with 19.78s and had wins at 100m events in Sheffield and London. He relished the opportunity to face Powell at the World Championships: both sprinters were undefeated that year and Gay said that he felt ready for the challenge.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I {{was supposed to be}} in New York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

Ice-T {{explained}} {{later that}} he felt that LL Cool J was [...] "at that time on his 'I'm the great rapper in the world' thing. Me being from L.A., I was trying to rep our entire city alone, so had to step to him". Ice-T also replied {{that he had no}} personal problem with him but just [...] "thought I could beat him rapping anyways". Ice-T stated that he recorded [...] "Girls L.G.B.N.A.F." [...] as a humorous response to LL Cool J's song [...] "I Need Love". Ice-T stated that: [...] "Girls came to me and asked, 'Ice, why don't you write a ballad'? Now can you imagine saying, 'I need loooove?' That's a wimp. So I wrote ('Girls') as a joke." [...] LL Cool J later retaliated [...] dissing Ice-T in his song [...] "To da Break of Dawn" [...] from his album Mama Said Knock You Out (1990). Afrika Islam said their feud ended when a group meeting involving Flavor Flav, DJ Red Alert, Mike Tyson and Afrika Bambaataa persuaded them to stop fighting. Islam explained Tyson's role: [...] " [...] down with hip-hop and the Zulus and I've always considered rappers like boxers anyway". Ice-T commented on the feud in NME magazine in 2012, stating: [...] "You need a nemesis in hip hop. It's part of what fuels good rap. L was coming out of New York saying he was the best rapper in the world. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> my feet out of LA. You can't have someone saying they're the best if you're trying to. We had a little hip hop thing but it was never serious." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{began writing}} the scripts, working to a {{delivery}} deadline of February 1973. Much {{of the setting}} for the story was influenced by contemporary political events such as strikes, power cuts, the Oil Crisis and developments in the Space Race, especially the planned Apollo-Soyuz missions and Skylab. Writing in the listings magazine TV Times to promote the serial, Kneale said, [...] "Quatermass {{is a story of}} the future – but perhaps only a few years from now. There are some clues already in the most obvious places: the streets. Pavements littered with rubbish. Walls painted with angry graffiti. Belfast black with smoke and rage. Worst of all, the mindless violence". Concerns about the state of society, especially the [...] "dropout" [...] culture of the youth movement, had been a theme of Kneale's writing for some time. This was seen in such works as The Big, Big Giggle, an unmade play about a teenage suicide cult; The Year of the Sex Olympics, about the consequences of a world with no censorship or inhibitions; and Bam! Pow! Zap! (1969), about teenage delinquents, all of which fed into the world depicted in the new Quatermass serial. Kneale said, [...] "I looked at the alarming aspects of contemporary trends. Since then, we'd seen 'flower power' and hippies, so all I did was bring them into the story. It was written in 1972 and it was about the sixties really". Another theme that had crept into Kneale's writing at this time—as seen in Wine of India, about compulsory euthanasia for the elderly, and later the Beasts episode [...] "During Barty's Party", about an elderly couple terrorised by rats—was the consequences of growing old. Kneale later recalled, [...] "The theme <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to was the old redressing the balance with the young, saving the young, which I thought a nice, paradoxical, ironic idea after the youth-oriented 60s".|$|E

The album had originally been a projected liaison between Hayward and Pinder, but after Pinder dropped out, John Lodge stepped in. (Tony Clarke produced it.) The members then released solo albums. Pinder said he hoped to get the band back together that year. [...] "Having moved to California in 1974, I returned to Britain for a visit in summer 1975. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the band to do an album, but the response was so weak I returned to California with my two new Mk5 mellotrons and began work on my solo album The Promise." [...] Edge produced two albums with guitarist Adrian Gurvitz, Kick Off Your Muddy Boots (1975) and Paradise Ballroom (1976); Hayward composed the acoustically textured Songwriter (1977), which was followed up in later years by Night Flight (1980), Moving Mountains (1985), (which Hayward dedicated to Peter Knight) Classic Blue (1989), The View From The Hill (1996) and Live in San Juan Capistrano (1998); Lodge released Natural Avenue (1977); Pinder produced The Promise (1976); and Thomas collaborated on two projects with songwriter Nicky James, producing From Mighty Oaks (1975) and Hopes, Wishes and Dreams (1976).|$|E

It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying.
