The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length <b>data</b> <b>fields.</b> After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|E

25|$|Sentinel node may simplify certain list operations, by {{ensuring}} that the next or previous nodes exist for every element, and that even empty lists {{have at least one}} node. One may also use a sentinel node {{at the end of the}} list, with an appropriate data field, to eliminate some end-of-list tests. For example, when scanning the list looking for a node with a given value x, setting the sentinel's data field to x makes it unnecessary to test for end-of-list inside the loop. Another example is the merging two sorted lists: if their sentinels have <b>data</b> <b>fields</b> set to +∞, the choice of the next output node does not need special handling for empty lists.|$|E

This method transforms the linear inseparable problem into finding the nearest {{points in the}} general <b>data</b> <b>field</b> (GDF). GDF is inspired by the physical field. Different dimensions represent the different properties. Not all attributes play a decisive role in the classification process. Therefore, how to find decisive data points and attributes is a critical is-sue. This research builds a general <b>data</b> <b>field</b> structure in high dimension data sets. The role of data point is expanded from local to global by GDF. We calculate the weights of data points and features by the potential value in <b>data</b> <b>field</b> space. We put it into practice.

Then, a new volumetric data structure and its storage structure are designed to sort cells according to their feature value, which makes the algorithm can select projected cells to decrease the number of the cells to be processed further. Finally the realization and experiment results show that the algorithm can improve image quality of edge transition region and improve rendering speed effectively...|$|R
