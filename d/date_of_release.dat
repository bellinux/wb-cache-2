5|$|Australian Submarine Corporation {{was made}} {{responsible}} for the delivery of the Rockwell combat system, but had little ability to enforce this. Rockwell was contracted to deliver the combat system by 9 September 1993, but was unlikely to do so. ASC's management board voted to issue a default notice to Rockwell as the American company had defaulted on the contract, but was ordered by the Department of Defence to retract the default notice and accept gradual delivery of partially completed versions of the combat system—referred to as 'releases' and 'drops'—until the complete system had been delivered. Sea trials of Collins were unable to commence until Release 1.5 of the combat system software was delivered; because of ongoing delays {{in the provision of}} the software, the early phases of the trials were completed using stand-alone equipment By March 1994, the combat system had become the major area of concern for the submarine project: assembly of the system was almost nine months behind schedule, and at least 20% of the software had not been compiled. The combat system continued to be a problem during the next few years, with progressive drops offering little improvements in performance over the previous version, and the completion <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>Release</b> 2—the designation for the full contractual realisation of the combat system software—was continually postponed.|$|E

25|$|The EBU {{released}} {{the rules for}} the 2003 contest in November 2002, which detailed that twenty-six countries would participate, making it {{the largest number of}} participants {{to take part in the}} contest up to this point. The rules also modified the eligibility criteria for entries, changing the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> cut-off point for songs from 1 January 2003 to 1 October 2002. There was also a change in the tie-break rule, which would now resolve such a case in favour of the nation that received points from a higher number of countries rather than taking into account the amount of top scores (12 points) received. The draw for running order was held on 29 November 2002 in Riga, hosted by Marie N and Renārs Kaupers, with the results being revealed during a delayed broadcast of the proceedings later that day.|$|E

500|$|In March 1883, the Century Company {{circulated}} a postcard, with copies likely {{going to}} newspapers and potential subscribers. [...] Under the heading [...] "Literary Note from The Century Co.", and giving {{some information about}} the plot, it announced that an anonymous novel, [...] "unusual in scene and subject, and powerful in treatment" [...] would soon be serialized {{in the pages of}} the Century. The serial was originally supposed to begin in April or May, but was postponed because Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel Through One Administration ran long. On July 20, the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> of the August number, the company placed newspaper advertisements for The Bread-Winners, and stated that [...] "the story... abounds in local description and social studies, which heighten the interest and continually pique curiosity as to its authorship".

In the week of July 6, 2013, the song entered the top 10 of Billboard Hot 100 at number eight. On October 9, 2013, it was certified three times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). As of November 2013, the song had sold two million copies in the US indicating inclusion of on-demand audio and/or video song streams in addition to downloads to its certification. It also peaked at number five on Billboards Pop Songs chart. The song also rose to number five on the Canadian Hot 100 on July 6, 2013 and reached the top position on Canada AC.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{released}} the new cents {{to the public}} on May 25, 1857. In anticipation of large popular demand, Mint authorities built a temporary wooden structure {{in the courtyard of}} the Philadelphia facility. On the morning of the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>release,</b> hundreds of people queued, one line for those exchanging Spanish silver for cents, the other for those bringing in old copper cents and half cents. From 9 am, clerks paid out cents for the old pieces; outside the Mint precincts, early purchasers sold the new cents at a premium. Snowden wrote to Guthrie, [...] "the demand for them is enormous… we had on hand this morning $30,000 worth, that is three million pieces. Nearly all of this amount will be paid out today." [...] The 1856 specimen became publicly known about the time of issuance, and had the public checking their pocket change; 1856 small cents sold for as much as $2 by 1859. The public interest in the new cents set off a coin collecting boom: in addition to seeking the rare 1856 cent, some tried to collect sets of large cents back to 1793, and found they would have to pay a premium for the rarer dates.|$|E

2500|$|Braemer {{surrendered}} to the British Second Army in {{the port city of}} Lübeck in Germany on 2May 1945 and detained as a prisoner of war. Eight months later, on 9January 1946 he was transferred to the prisoner-of-war camp in South Wales, the so-called Special Camp11 (Island Farm), where high-value Nazi captives awaiting extradition to Nuremberg were imprisoned. Braemer was interned at Island Farm for 21 months as prisoner No.A451665. On 6October 1947, Braemer was transferred from Island Farm [...] via Camp 43 [...] to the Civil Internment Camp No.6 at Neuengamme near Hamburg, a post-Nazi concentration-camp facility used after the War specifically for detention of suspected German war criminals. There he was apparently set free sometime later that October without extenuating circumstances (like ill health: the precise circumstances and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> are not known), having spent less than 2½years in prisoner-of-war camps but without having been brought to trial for war crimes. This outcome was apparently brought about by the deliberate shielding of Braemer by British authorities wilfully refusing to take cognizance of his past as a war criminal.|$|E

2500|$|Concern {{was raised}} by the fan {{community}} when OpenCritic, a review aggregator site, stated that there {{were going to be}} no review copies of the game prior to the public release and a review embargo that would end on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> The lack of review copies is a general sign within the industry that there are concerns by the developers or publishers that a game may not live up to expectations and thus indicates that they want to minimise any impact reviews may have prior to release. However, both OpenCritic and Sony later affirmed there would be pre-release review copies and that they were waiting on a pre-release patch before sending these out to journalists. Eurogamer noted that they had expected to have review copies by 5 August, but these were pushed until 8 August so as to get the day-one patch in place, a situation they attributed to the certification process required by Sony for any games on their service. Because of the late arrival of the review copies, {{and the size of the}} game, critics presented their reviews [...] "in progress" [...] over several days, omitting a final review score until they had completed enough of the game to their satisfaction.|$|E
