In an operational news speech retrieval system such as our own, news story boundaries are not always part of the speech data, making it difficult to automatically detect shifts in stories being broadcast.

George was riding along the shoreline on his all-terrain vehicle when he stopped behind an outcropping to take shelter from the wind. As he bent over his ATV to warm his hands, his experienced eye picked out what appeared to be tiny tracks. Using a jackknife, he gradually exposed five fossil trackways imprinted in a slab of sandstone measuring 16-by-14 inches (40-by-35 cm). At first, he thought the three-toed tracks had been made by a reptile, but Olsen identified them as dinosaur prints. They belonged to a theropod dinosaur {{about the size of a}} small bird such as a sparrow or robin.|$|E

In fact, a recent survey by Pollard (2004) found that 79 out of 88 central banks made monetary policy by committee. Thus the existence of a pronounced worldwide trend is clear.

A platform is essentially a heterogeneous system consisting of communicating processing units of different types and mostly distributed memory units.

However, the specification, exploration and design of application multiprocessor system platforms from user requirements is still a painstaking process that takes too long and is too costly. Our answer to the above mentioned issues is the Archer approach. It embodies: Application representations (Symbolic Programs - SP), a platform-based library of the architecture components and their configurations (all-in-hardware, all-in-software, hybrid multiprocessor, with dedicated network, hared-bus, highway, burst-bus, or hybrid network), and a mapping methodology (managing the aforementioned representations while transforming application SPs to Archer architecture components), that we have been developing and experimenting with.

This contribution aims to give a comprehensive overview of the occurrence, taxonomic distribution, molecular evolution, and physiological role of plant lectins with the emphasis on relevant novel developments. The overview comprises a description of the 12 different carbohydrate binding domains and annex lectin families that hitherto have been identified in plants. For each lectin family, a fairly detailed summary is given of the biochemical properties, taxonomical distribution, and evolutionary origin. Novel insights in some specific aspects of plant lectins like their biosynthesis and topogenesis, carbohydrate binding specificity, and regulation of expression are discussed. The last major section deals with an updated critical discussion of the physiological role of plant lectins with an emphasis on specific functions within the plant cell. Finally, the concept of "lectinome" is introduced...|$|R
40|$|The global {{experience}} {{of the last two}} years has shaken conventional beliefs in the benefits of unfettered financial markets. In response to the Asian crisis of a <b>decade</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>most</b> Asian economies had switched to an apparently more durable system of financing economic growth. But this did not prevent Asian countries from suffering considerably from the global financial crisis. Moreover, the spread of the crisis across countries seems to have been channelled more by financial linkages than conventional trade linkages. This raises questions about the future of financial integration among Asian economies and between Asia and the rest of the world. This paper first documents some features of the propagation of the global financial crisis. It then goes on to explore a two-country theoretical model in which there is a trade-off between the risk sharing benefits of international financial markets and the contagion effects of international financial interdependence. The key resultfeature of the model is to show that financial market integration in the presence of financial constraints can generate very high macroeconomic comovement among economies, quite independent of international trade linkages. 1 We thank, without implication, participants at the Asian Development Bank conference on Regional and Globa...|$|R
