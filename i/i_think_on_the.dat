500|$|Edge of Darkness was {{promoted}} {{on the cover}} of the listings magazine Radio Times and was broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 at 9:30pm, beginning 4 November 1985. The serial averaged an audience of 4 million viewers over its run. The critical response was generally positive with most commentators concentrating their praise on Peck's performance as Craven and the scale of the programme's political themes. “A good television thriller is very hard to find but Edge of Darkness promises to be one of the best”, wrote Celia Brayfield in The Times, “The central character is played by Bob Peck, who has the gift of looking tragic and intelligent simultaneously. [...] There was humour to lift the gloom and superb characterisation to flesh out the stock situation”. [...] Ruth Baumgarten, in The Listener, praised the serial as “a grandiosely ambitious and compelling piece of fiction”. Speaking on the BBC's review programme Did You See...?, the writer Sarah Dunant said, “this is a very classy piece of television drama, on all levels, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plot level, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> level of emotion and I think stylistically [...] it looks absolutely wonderful, it's shot like a feature film”. Not so impressed was Byron Rogers, television critic of The Sunday Times, who initially hailed the series as one that “stayed in the mind and will stay there long [...] because of its portrayal of human grief” but later felt he was “beginning to find Edge of Darkness slightly irritating” and decried the final episode as “an insult to its considerable following”.|$|E

[...] Originally, the bill called for mintage of 100,000 silver dollars in commemoration of McKinley, {{but at the}} hearing, Butler requested that they be gold instead, stating, [...] "if you will recall the fact, McKinley was elected in 1896 mainly {{on the question of}} the gold standard." [...] The gold dollar had not been struck as a circulating coin since 1889. [...] Asked a question from New York Congressman James W. Husted as to whether a gold dollar would be too small to be a souvenir, Butler responded, [...] "No; I do not think so. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other hand, a silver dollar might be too large. I think we can dispose of gold dollars very much easier. Mr. Husted, and you know gold dollars are rather scarce just now." [...] Ashbrook agreed, and stated: ...|$|E
