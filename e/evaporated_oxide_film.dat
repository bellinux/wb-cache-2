Atomic force microscope (AFM) results showed the formation of nanostructures for films irradiated with a fluence of 1 Ã 1013 ions cm- 2. The particle size estimated by section analysis of the irradiated film was in the range 25 - 30 nm. Glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GAXRD) revealed the amorphous nature of the films.

Based on the analysis of the AC parameters variation in the micro-arc oxidation process, the following conclusions can be drawn: The growth of <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> can be divided into three stages, and <b>Oxide</b> <b>film</b> breakdown discharge occurs twice in the micro-arc oxidation process. The first stage is the formation and disruptive discharge of amorphous <b>oxide</b> <b>film,</b> producing the ceramic oxide granules, which belong to solid dielectric breakdown.

They could be primary or secondary types of <b>oxide</b> <b>films.</b> The former type is {{inherited from the}} ingot and has existed in {{aluminum alloy}} casting {{for a long period}} of time. During the filling of the mold cavity, the free unstable surface of the molten metal causes a secondary <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> to exist on the aluminum alloy castings. The <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> are usually rich in oxygen and are difficult to observe by optical micrographs. This paper presents a simple but powerful method to observe the shape and size of <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> on the aluminum matrix. During ultrasonic-vibration treatment, cavitation bubbles nucleated, grew and collapsed, generating micro-jets on the surface of sample. The water micro-jets then had an impact on the <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> initiating micro-cracks.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{interaction}} of water vapor with amorphous aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> on Al(111) is studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to elucidate the passivation {{mechanism of the}} oxidized Al(111) surfaces. Exposure of the aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> to water vapor results in self-limiting Al 2 O 3 /Al(OH) 3 bilayer film growth via counter-diffusion of both ions, Al outward and OH inward, where a thinner starting aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> is more reactive toward H 2 O dissociation-induced oxide growth because of the thickness-dependent ionic transport in the aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> The aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> exhibits reactivity toward H 2 O dissociation in both low-vapor pressure [p(H 2 O) = 1 × 10 − 6 Torr] and intermediate-vapor pressure [p(H 2 O) = 5 Torr] regimes. Compared to the <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> growth by exposure to a p(H 2 O) of 1 × 10 − 6 Torr, the exposure to a p(H 2 O) of 5 Torr results {{in the formation of}} a more open structure of the inner Al(OH) 3 layer and a more compact outer Al 2 O 3 layer, demonstrating the vapor-pressure-dependent atomic structure in the passivating layer. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the physiological medium and living tissues with the implant surfaces in biological environments is regulated by biopotentials that induce changes in the chemical composition, structure and thickness of the <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> In this work, <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> grown on CoCr alloys at 0. 5 V vs Ag/AgCl and 0. 7 V vs Ag/AgCl have been characterized through overall and localized electrochemical techniques in a phosphate buffer solution and 0. 3 % hyaluronic acid. Nanopores of 10 – 50 nm diameter are homogeneously distributed along the surface in the <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> formed at 0. 7 V vs Ag/AgCl. The distribution of the Constant Phase Element studied by local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed a three-dimensional (3 D) model on the <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> grown at 0. 5 V vs Ag/AgCl and 0. 7 V vs Ag/AgCl. This behaviour is especially noticeable in <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> grown at 0. 7 V vs Ag/AgCl, probably due to surface inhomogeneities, and resistive properties generated by the potentiostatic growth of the <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> This work {{was supported by the}} Spanish National government [MINECO-MAT 2011 - 29152 -C 02 - 01].

40|$|Hydrated {{yttrium oxide}} and {{titanium}} <b>oxide</b> thin <b>films</b> were prepared by reactive sputtering in H 2 O atmosphere at substrate temperatures from − 30 to + 130 °C. The electrical conductivities of the yttrium <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> {{increased with decreasing}} substrate temperature. The increase in electrical conductivity corresponds well {{to the increase in}} IR absorption intensity due to OH bonds, and it is considered that proton conduction is dominant in the yttrium <b>oxide</b> <b>films.</b> In contrast, the conductivity of the titanium <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> increased with increasing substrate temperature, suggesting that electron conduction is dominant in the films...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{experimental}} {{scheme for}} real time measurement of aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> during anodization {{was developed for}} the first time. The scheme was established based {{on a combination of}} a fiber optic sensor of FabryâPÃ©rot interferometry and direct current (DC) electrochemical methods. The scheme was assembled in a way to simultaneously anodize the aluminum samples and to measure the thickness of the aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> The anodization process of aluminum sample was carried out in 4 % sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) solution by the DC methods at room temperature. The estimated thickness of the aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> by the novel scheme was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electrochemistry measurements. This study shows that real time measurement of the thickness of aluminum <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> is feasible as it closely matched the thickness determined by SEM and other electrochemistry techniques.

40|$|Ultrathin <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> is {{currently}} {{one of the}} paramount candidates for a heterogeneous catalyst because it provides an additional dimension, i. e., film thickness, to control chemical reactivity. Here, we demonstrate that the chemical reactivity of ultrathin MgO film grown on Ag(100) substrate for the dissociation of individual water molecules can be systematically controlled by interface dopants over the film thickness. Density functional theory calculations revealed that adhesion at the oxide-metal interface can be addressed by the ligand field effect and is linearly correlated with the chemical reactivity of the <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> In addition, our {{results indicate that the}} concentration of dopant at the interface can be controlled by tuning the drawing effect of <b>oxide</b> <b>film.</b> Our study provides not only profound insight into chemical reactivity control of ultrathin <b>oxide</b> <b>film</b> supported by a metal substrate but also an impetus for investigating ultrathin <b>oxide</b> <b>films</b> for a wider range of applications. close 5...|$|R
