5000|$|A divisional patent {{application}} (sometimes {{referred to as a}} <b>divisional</b> <b>application</b> or simply a divisional) is a type of {{patent application}} which contains matter from a previously filed application (the so-called parent application).

50|$|<b>Divisional</b> <b>applications</b> filed voluntarily may be {{susceptible}} to {{attacks on the}} grounds of double patenting.
