40|$|Component-based {{software}} engineering {{is becoming a}} prominent solution {{to the development of}} complex embedded systems. Since it allows a system to be built by reusable and independently developed components, component-based development substantially facilitates the development of a complex embedded system and allows its complexity to be better managed. Meanwhile, partitioning system behavior into multiple operational modes is also an effective approach to reducing system complexity. Combining the component-based approach with the multi-mode approach, we get a component-based multi-mode system, for which a key issue is its <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> handling. The <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> of such a system corresponds to the joint <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> of many hierarchically organized components. Such a <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> is not trivial as it amounts to coordinate the <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> of different components that are independently developed. Since most existing approaches to <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> handling assume that <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> is a global event of the entire system, they cannot be easily applied to component-based multi-mode systems where both the <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> of the system and each individual component must be considered, and where components cannot be assumed to have global knowledge of the system. In this thesis, we present a mechanism [...] -the <b>Mode</b> <b>Switch</b> Logic (MSL) [...] -which provides an effective solution to <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> in component-based multi-mode systems. MSL enables a multi-mode system to be developed in a component-based manner, including (1) a mode-aware component model proposed to suit the multi-mode context; (2) a mode mapping mechanism for the seamless composition of multi-mode components and their <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> guidance; (3) a <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> runtime mechanism which coordinates the <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> of all related components so that the <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> can be correctly and efficiently performed at the system level; and (4) a timing analysis for <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> realized by MSL.

30|$|Since random <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> {{have been}} used and <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> is not {{triggered}} by network changes, these results say nothing about the actual performance gain {{that can be achieved}} when the <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> capabilities are applied intelligently according to the network context. With random <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> or badly assigned modes it can even occur that suboptimal routes in terms of hop count are being used (e.g., when routing via a long U-shaped proactive zone takes place, while a shorter non-proactive route could exist). Also very important to remark is that with intelligent <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> behavior, nodes will only switch when needed and will possibly switch in group, since groups of nodes will often experience a similar network context. This is important, because when the <b>mode</b> <b>switch</b> frequency becomes too high, the packet delivery ratio drops.

30|$|Adapting the routing {{behavior}} {{to the network}} context has to happen with minimal impact on the ongoing network traffic. This is a challenging aspect, since changing from one mode to another has its implications, {{not only for the}} node that changes its mode, but also for all the other nodes for which this mode change involves updates in their routing table. This means that {{in order to keep the}} routing tables consistent and to maintain mode compatibility, appropriate actions need to be taken. As all <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> can occur, the protocol should be able to deal with them. This section describes the desired protocol behavior upon <b>mode</b> <b>switches.</b> This behavior has been verified through simulations in GloMoSim and guarantees that during <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> connectivity between applications is maintained. As all <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> involve transitions from or to a proactive mode, between proactive modes or changes within a proactive mode, we have chosen to manage these <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> through the propagation of special proactive update entries.|$|R

30|$|In this article, we have {{presented}} the implementation {{in a network}} simulator of an adaptive multi-mode routing protocol offering three different compatible modes of operations. The modes are compatible, meaning {{that they have been}} designed {{in such a way that}} every node can individually select its own optimal mode and can adapt its mode of operation at any moment while maintaining a consistent state of all routing tables and without impacting ongoing connections. This has been proven by simulations; first, possible individual <b>mode</b> <b>switches,</b> then followed by an evaluation of the protocol in a network with random <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> and in a mobile network with pre-assigned modes. From these simulations, it has been observed that adaptivity at the routing level is only beneficial when adapting to medium and large time-scale network changes. Short time-scale changes must be handled by other mechanisms, but care should be taken that different mechanisms at different time scales and different layers do not become counterproductive. It can be concluded that this article has showcased the feasibility of designing an adaptive protocol, which has the potential to outperform traditional protocols when its adaptive capabilities are exploited intelligently, according to the network context, and that they are triggered for handling medium to large time-scale network context changes. This potential has been illustrated by a simple scenario, in which the protocol adapts itself according to the monitored network load. Although the feasibility of an adaptive routing protocol has been demonstrated, where individual nodes can change their routing behavior, it should be mentioned that during the design and implementation of the protocol we have learned that implementing compatible modes is not straightforward. When introducing new modes, many new <b>mode</b> <b>switches</b> become possible and these should all be handled in a way that does not impact ongoing traffic. This creates complex interactions and, in this study, this behavior has only evaluated through simulations. Ideally, a theoretic evaluation of the protocol correctness and the performance of individual modes according to the network context should be done in order to know when to switch. However, this is definitely not straightforward, even for existing ad hoc protocols. Also, this article has <b>focused</b> on the <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> capabilities and its potential and has only provided guidelines for advanced monitoring and alternative applications of the protocol have been provided. From this study, it becomes clear that, although adaptive routing has potential and interesting applications, there are still many open issues representing huge research topics on their own. Several of these topics also appear in other domains that have recently gained increased attention from the research community, e.g., in cognitive networking or sensor networking, and remain therefore very relevant and interesting to further explore.|$|R

We first introduced three communication transmission modes {{in these two}} scenarios, which are the traditional cellular communication mode, direct D 2 D communication mode, and two-way DF-relayed D 2 D communication mode. By deriving the expression for the ergodic achievable sum-rate of these transmission modes, we got the threshold of different transmission modes to attain maximum sum-rate of the system. Based on this, we got the transmission <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> strategy theoretically. Simulation results showed that by applying the transmission <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> strategy, the ergodic achievable sum-rate of the system achieves a remarkable enhancement under different interference level and distance of D 2 D users.

First, when SIMO mode is configured, parameters like PCI and CQI for the second stream are not available because the second antenna is switched off to save energy. Thus, how to estimate the available EE for D-TxAA is a challenge. Second, the transmit antenna number information should be informed through the system information, so the <b>mode</b> <b>switching</b> will impact all users in the cell and bring huge signaling overhead.
