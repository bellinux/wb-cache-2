40|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump is a flow singularity characterised {{by a significant}} amount of air entrainment in the shear zone. The air is entrapped at the jump toe that is a discontinuity between the impinging flow and the roller. The impingement point is a source of air bubbles, as well as a source of vorticity. Herein the convective transport of air bubbles in the jump roller is re-visited. Some analytical extension is presented and the theoretical results are compared with some laboratory experiments conducted in a large-size facility operating at large <b>Froude</b> <b>numbers.</b> The turbulent air bubble mixing coefficient was found to increase linearly with increasing distance and be independent of the <b>Froude</b> and Reynolds <b>numbers.</b> Overall the study highlighted some seminal features of the air-water shear layer in {{hydraulic jump}}s with large <b>Froude</b> <b>numbers</b> (5. 1 < Fr(1) < 11. 2).
