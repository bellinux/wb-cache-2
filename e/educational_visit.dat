40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{evaluated}} {{the association of}} different types of educational visits for dia-betic patients of the eight Philadelphia Health Care Centers (PHCCs) (public safety-net primary care clinics), with hospital admission rates and charges reported to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council. RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS — The study population included 18, 404 pa-tients who had a PHCC visit with a diabetes diagnosis recorded between 1 March 1993 and 31 December 2001 and had at least 1 month follow-up time. RESULTS — A total of 31, 657 hospitalizations were recorded for 7, 839 (42. 6 %) patients in the cohort. After adjustment for demographic variables, baseline comorbid conditions, hospi-talizations before the diabetes diagnosis, and number of other primary care visits, having had any type of <b>educational</b> <b>visit</b> was associated with 9. 18 (95 % CI 5. 02 – 13. 33) fewer hospitalizations per 100 person-years and $ 11, 571 ($ 6, 377 to $ 16, 765) less in hospital charges per person. Each nutritionist visit was associated with 4. 70 (2. 23 – 7. 16) fewer hospitalizations per 100 person-years and a $ 6, 503 ($ 3, 421 to $ 9, 586) reduction in total hospital charges.

40|$|A {{randomised}} controlled trial {{studied the}} effect of an <b>educational</b> <b>visit</b> on benzodiazepine prescribing. An approximately representative sample of 286 general practitioners was allocated to an intervention or a control group. Rates of benzodiazepine prescriptions were derived from two comprehensive self-report surveys seven months apart. Two months after the first survey the intervention group received an <b>educational</b> <b>visit</b> and supporting material from a doctor or pharmacist, ostensibly unconnected with the surveys. The overall benzodiazepine prescribing rate fell by 23. 7 per cent from the first to the second surveys, from 4. 93 to 3. 76 prescriptions per 100 encounters (P < 0. 001). Anxiety and insomnia diagnosis rates also declined from 4. 68 to 3. 76 per 100 encounters (19. 7 per cent). After adjusting for confounders, there was a differential downward trend in prescriptions per diagnosis of insomnia but not to a statistical level. The same was true of initial prescriptions per insomnia diagnosis. In a subsidiary analysis selecting only ne tv insomnia diagnoses, the intervention had a strong effect in reducing initial prescriptions (odds ratio 0. 18, 95 per cent confidence interval 0. 04 to 0. 73). No effect was seen on prescribing for anxiety diagnoses. Educational practice visiting for benzodiazepine prescribing in anxiety, as we conducted it, is not justified in an unselected population of general practitioners. Specific education on prescribing for insomnia is probably useful. Our interpretation of the reduction in benzodiazepine prescribing is that probably there was an effect from self-monitoring alone which overwhelmed a main-analysis intervention effect. Retrospective diagnosis may also have obscured a real intervention effect...|$|E

The term 'academic detailing' was borrowed from the pharmaceutical industry to describe a process of educational outreach Teaching exchange 431 (Soumerai and Avorn, 1990). Other terms in the literature, such as 'practice visiting' or 'peer discussion in a one-to-one situation' appear to describe similar activities, depending on the focus, intensity and formality of the educational programme. Such visits are often combined with other practice-based educational activities. Their effectiveness as an educational intervention has been established in the Cochrane reviews (Thomson et al., 1998). A question raised in the reviews was that none of the trials examined whether outreach visits can be made more effective by modifying how they are done...|$|E

40|$|Children's {{palliative care}} has evolved {{in recent years}} and is now {{recognised}} as a distinct area of health and social care practice. Whilst children's hospices are viewed as central to quality care for these children and families, lack of knowledge regarding the exact nature of care they provide exists. Education can go part way to changing attitudes and knowledge about the key contribution of hospices, thus improving future care. Alternative and innovative strategies to stimulate meaningful learning are pivotal to children's nurse education and this paper examines one such innovation adopted with 2 nd year children's nursing students. Aiming to help students explore the ethos of children's hospice an <b>educational</b> <b>visit</b> was arranged, followed by an on line discussion. Although some practical challenges were encountered, the visit heightened student awareness moving them from the readily held perception that children's hospices were exclusively for dying children and was viewed by students as more effective than a traditional classroom session...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{determine}} whether diabetes {{education can be}} provided as effectively through telemedicine technology as through in-person encounters with diabetes nurse and nutrition educators. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — A total of 56 adults with diabetes were randomized to receive diabetes education in person (control group) or via telemedicine (tele-medicine group) and were followed prospectively. The education consisted of three consultative visits with diabetes nurse and nutrition educators. The in-person and telemedicine groups were compared using measures of glycemic control (HbA 1 c) and questionnaires to assess patient satisfaction and psychosocial functioning as related to diabetes. Outcome measures were ob-tained at baseline, immediately {{after the completion of}} diabetes education, and 3 months after the third <b>educational</b> <b>visit.</b> RESULTS — Patient satisfaction was high in the telemedicine group. Problem Areas in Dia-betes scale scores improved significantly with diabetes education (adjusted P 0. 05, before vs. immediately after education and 3 months after education), and the attainment of behavior-change goals did not differ between groups.

40|$|Background Despite the {{availability}} of evidence-based guidelines on venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention clinical audit and research reveals that hospitalised medical patients frequently receive suboptimal prophylaxis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the acceptability, utility and clinical impact of an educational outreach visit (EOV) on the provision of VTE prophylaxis to hospitalised medical patients in a 270 bed acute care private hospital in metropolitan Australia. Methods The study used an uncontrolled before-and-after design with accompanying process evaluation. The acceptability of the intervention to participants was measured with a post intervention survey; descriptive data on resource use was collected as a measure of utility; and clinical impact (prophylaxis rate) was assessed by pre and post intervention clinical audits. Doctors who admit 3 ̆e 40 medical patients each year were targeted to receive the intervention which consisted of a one-to-one <b>educational</b> <b>visit</b> on VTE prevention from a trained peer facilitator.

40|$|Background: Experiential art {{making in}} a {{clinical}} clerkship offers {{opportunities for students to}} gain self-awareness and enhance empathic understanding of patients. The student-created art can be further used as teaching material for other students. Context: The graduating medical school class of 2012 from Ajou University School of Medicine in South Korea was interested in learning about medical humanities initiatives at the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong (HKU) and partook in an <b>educational</b> <b>visit</b> in May 2012. Innovation: As part of the core Family Medicine curriculum, third year HKU medical students created poetry and art based on their experiences witnessing patient pain and suffering. Twenty of the artworks and accompanying reflective writing were chosen for an exhibition. The visiting students viewed the exhibit and created their own art based on their emotional response to one piece selected from the exhibit. Implications: The combination of viewing art made by their peers and creating art in response resulted in empathic understanding of patient pain and suffering and an appreciation of holistic care and the value of the doctor-patient relationship. Medical student-generated artwork has the potential to educate both students and professionals on humanistic aspects of medical care...|$|E
