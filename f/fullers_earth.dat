40|$|International audienceLifetime {{extension}} of power transformers {{is a subject}} of high importance for electric power systems utilities. The decision of replacing, refurbishing or repairing a service aged power transformer requires considering several factors, especially the cost and time to execute the work. The lifetime of the power transformer being related to {{the condition of the}} insulation system; one way of improving the situation is to reclaim insulating oil by <b>Fuller??s</b> <b>Earth</b> treatment. This procedure is economically attractive because of increasing prices for both mineral and synthetic transformer coolants, effective cost and environmentally sounds. Reclamation rejuvenates the transformer oil by eliminating contaminants. In this paper, a series of experiments has been performed with service aged oils reclaimed in laboratory conditions. Fast, inexpensive and reliable laboratory testing procedures developed by ASTM (D 6802 and D 6181) were also used to monitor decay products as traces impurities. The results obtained in laboratory conditions, indicate {{that a large number of}} reclamation passes (around 15 passes) are required to regenerate inservice aged oil to a grade close to new oil.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that the source materials of the English Aptian <b>fuller's</b> <b>earths</b> were soils of the Anglo-Belgian Land and that montmorillonite is the characteristic clay mineral of marine deposits formed when old land surfaces of low relief are transgressed. When the origin of English <b>fuller's</b> <b>earths</b> was discussed in the 1930 's, Grim (1933, 1935) and Newton (1934) engaged in a polemic. Grim maintained that the Jurassic <b>fuller's</b> <b>earth</b> of Bath contained glass shards [...] relict s ructures which proved the igneous origin of the clay [...] as in bentonite, but this sample {{was found to be}} of doubtful provenance.

Spent tea leaves, an abundantly available material that is currently disposed of as a solid waste, are potentially suitable for such applications. Approach: To provide some information on the adsorption properties of tea waste, we evaluated the removal efficiency of lead ions by spent leaves of green and black tea. Batch adsorption experiments were made at 25 and 40 °C at initial lead-ion concentrations between 0. 01 and 2 g L - 1. Equilibrium data were analyzed by the Langmuir equation to evaluate the maximum adsorption capacity and the equilibrium constant. The adsorption characteristics of the two materials were also compared with those of coffee grounds, activated carbon and <b>Fullers</b> <b>earth.</b> Results: Experimental data showed that removal efficiencies up to 98 - 99 % can be achieved when using spent tea leaves as lead adsorbent. The results were only marginally affected by the type of tea waste. At low lead loading, the adsorption equilibrium was well described by the Langmuir equation, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 83 - 130 mg g - 1 and an equilibrium constant ranging from 0. 112 - 0. 245 L mg - 1. A comparison with other adsorbents provided the following order for lead removal efficiency: Black tea, coffee grounds > green tea > <b>Fullers</b> <b>earth</b> > activated carbon.

40|$|Much {{oil spill}} {{research}} has focused on fertilizing hydrocarbon oxidising bacteria, but a primary limitation is the rapid dilution of additives in open waters.

Together with adsorbed N and P fertilizers, filming additives, and organoclay, clay flakes can be engineered to float on seawater, attach to the oil, and slowly release contained nutrients.

Whereas a major portion (up to 98 %) of the alkane content was removed during the 1 month period of experimentation by fertilized clay flake interaction; the reduced concentration of polyaromatic hydrocarbons was not significantly different from the non-clay bearing samples.

Particular emphasis has been placed on the identification of hydrogeochemical processes.

40|$|A dust is {{classified}} as explosible based on the laboratory tests specified by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 1226. This standard requires that a dust be uniformly dispersed into an enclosed 20 -Liter (L) chamber forming a dust cloud; a 10, 000 Joule (10 kJ) flame is subsequently forced through the dust cloud and the resulting pressure rise is measured. If the pressure rise exceeds one bar (14. 5 psig), {{it is assumed that}} a deflagration occurred, and the dust {{is classified}} as class ?A? explosible dust. We have reported several flaws in the current ASTM testing protocols. The only indicator used by the ASTM method for assuming a deflagration had occurred in the test chamber is pressure rise. CAAQES has developed an alternative protocol that more accurately characterizes the explosibility of dusts. The CAAQES protocol for determining MEC is to test a wide range of concentrations of a dust in a 28. 3 -L (1 ft^(3)) Plexiglas chamber with a diaphragm and a stationary ignition source. If a self-propagating flame results as indicated by the diaphragm bursting, the Pressure vs. Time curve, and the flame leaving the chamber, a deflagration occurred during the test and the dust is explosible. Several dusts were tested along with cotton gin dust (CGD) for explosibility. The CGD does not have a MEC and hence it is non-explosible, contrary to the results reported by the Safety Consulting Engineers Inc. (SEC Inc.). The SCE Inc. tested CGD for explosibility based on the ASTM E 1226 standard and reported CGD as class ?A? explosible dust. The difference in test results triggered a research on characterizing a dust for explosibility by the CAAQES. The MECs of dusts were reported and compared with the MECs determined by Palmer in 1973 and the U. S. Bureau of Mines in 1964. Further studies were also conducted to determine the dust properties affecting the explosibility of a dust. The CGD consisted of 87 % inerts with a low energy content of 1400 J g^(- 1). The properties of CGD rendered it non-explosible. Dusts were mixed with <b>Fuller?s</b> <b>earth</b> and tested in the CAAQES chamber in order to study the effect of inert mass fraction of a dust on MECs. It was hypothesized that, at a specific concentration, the distance between the combustible particles must be at a certain distance to enable a flame to propagate from one particle to another. The distance between the combustible particles should be 450 to 700 m to propagate the flame from one particle to another in the CAAQES chamber. Approximately, 50 % of inerts (<b>Fuller?s</b> <b>earth)</b> prevented a deflagration for all dusts. The energy content of agricultural dusts should be above 7000 J g^(- 1) to result in a deflagration. It was also concluded that the dust properties influences the explosibility of a dust...|$|E
