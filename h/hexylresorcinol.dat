The {{results show that}} <b>hexylresorcinol</b> and dodecylresorcinol can inhibit both monophenolase and diphenolase activity of the enzyme. The lag period of the enzyme was obviously lengthened, and the steady-state activity of the enzyme decreased sharply. Two muM of <b>hexylresorcinol</b> and dodecylresorcinol can lengthen the lag period from 98 s to 260 and 275 s, respectively. Both <b>hexylresorcinol</b> and dodecylresorcinol can lead to reversible inhibition of the enzyme.

30|$|Alkyl resorcinols, natural non-isoprenoid {{phenolic}} lipids {{found in}} plants (Tyman 1979), have {{attracted much attention}} due {{to a variety of}} biologic functions, such as being nonspecific antioxidants, antimutagens, and regulatory molecules (Kim et al. 2011 b). <b>Hexylresorcinol</b> is an organic compound with well-known anaesthetic, antiseptic, and anthelmintic properties (Wilson and Gisvold 1954).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated by Leonard (1924) and his colleagues that <b>hexylresorcinol,</b> when taken by mouth in therapeutic doses, is excreted by the kidneys and appears in the urine in sufficient concentration to kill bacteria in large numbers. A discussion of <b>hexylresorcinol</b> as a urinary antiseptic has been published elsewhere (Leonard, 1925). It has been shown by Leonard (1923) that: the administra-tion to persons taking <b>hexylresorcinol,</b> of sodium carbonate, robs the urine of its bactericidal power. It was shown that neither the alkalinity of the urine nor the presence of soda had any direct effect on {{the activity of the}} <b>hexylresorcinol.</b> It was found, however, that the administration of <b>hexylresorcinol</b> in therapeutic doses resulted in the secretion of urine of very low surface tension, while the administration of soda gave rise to urine of very high surface tension. It was therefore suggested that surface tension might play some r 6 le in governing the activity of <b>hexylresorcinol</b> in urine.

40|$|In {{some ways}} the effects of <b>hexylresorcinol</b> on Nitella {{resemble}} those of guaiacol but in others they differ. Both substances depress the P.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{chemicals}} employed as food preservatives is somewhat limited. The Food and Drugs Act permits {{a few of}} these to be used in food products. Owing to the fact, how-ever, that there is no uniformity of opinion as to the absolute harmlessness of these food preservatives, any new preservative which can be shown to be harmless would have a distinct ad-vantage. It was thought that <b>hexylresorcinol</b> might be used as an efficient food preservative, since this substance has a very high phenol coefficient. Johnson and Lane (1921) in studying alkyl resorcinols found the phenol coefficient to increase as the series ascended. Leonard and Feirer (1927) reported that the phenol coefficient of hexyl-resorcinol was around 70. Leonard (1924) determined that, co-incident with the sharp rise in bactericidal power with an in-crease in the length of the side chain, there was a corresponding drop in toxicity.

40|$|In {{previous}} reports {{one of us}} (M) and his as-sociates (1, 2) {{have shown}} that <b>hexylresorcinol</b> aids in the absorption of insulin from the gastro-intestinal tract of dogs.

40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} etiological {{factors and}} special issues of diagnostics of inflammatory {{diseases of the}} pharynx associated with pain in children. According to etiological factors tonsillopharyngitis {{can be divided into}} two main forms: bacterial and viral. The prevalence of viral tonsillopharyngitis is respectively high and, in contrast to bacterial form, this one does not demand systemic antibacterial treatment. The article contains information on the main medicines used for topical treatment of viral inflammation of the pharynx: saline solutions and antiseptic agents. The most appropriate topical antiseptic drug for children with tonsillopharyngitis is combined ones with amylmetacresol and dichlorobenzyl alcohol, not lidocain-containing or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ones. The high analgesic effect of such combination is shown in various studies. Moreover, it was found, that <b>hexylresorcinol</b> and amylmetacresol inhibit sodium channels 10 - 20 times more intensely than lidocain. Significant analgesic effect of amylmetacresol/dichlorobenzyl alcohol is observed in 5 minutes after administration and its duration is 2 hours. Decrease of virulence of influenza A, respiratory syncytial and coronaviruses under exposure to amylmetacresol and dichlorobenzyl alcohol was also proved. Availability of several medicinal forms and its high pharmacological safety make this drug the most optimal for treatment of pain syndrome in tonsillopharyngitis in children. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} fundamental self-organized aspects in Ï-conjugated polymers. Self-organization is {{the central}} issue in nanotechnology of soft condensed matter. The thesis focuses on the design and control of supramolecular hairy-rodlike molecules which are characterized by a thermotropic and preferentially aligned nanoscale structure. The major emphasis is on polypyridine, polyaniline, and polyfluorene. Because of their rodlike chain the formation of supramolecules is nontrivial. The understanding of the structure-property relations of this class of materials is vital {{in the development of}} organic high-performance opto-electronic devices. Throughout this work, synchrotron radiation and X-ray diffraction techniques have been extensively used and combined with the photophysical methods. In the first part, the ways to form hierarchic, highly ordered, and aligned lamellar smectic supramolecules of poly(2, 5 -pyridinediyl) complexed with dodecylbenzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic or camphorsulfonic acid and pentyl- or <b>hexylresorcinol,</b> octyl gallate, or octyl phenol have been developed and perfected. They have been characterized in the solution, in bulk and â in particular â in aligned films. Several new phases have been discovered and detailed structural description is given. When side groups are introduced microphase separated phases reveal a regular axial repeat but have different degrees of lateral packing regularity between molecules, varying from crystalline to liquid. Depending on composition they exhibit an order-order and then an order-disorder transition to isotropic phase. Liquid crystallinity allows facile overall alignment and results in the opto-electronic anisotropy as revealed by dichroism and polarized photoluminescence. In particular, it is shown that the hierarchic supramolecular structure of poly(2, 5 -pyridinediyl), camphorsulfonic acid and octyl phenol comprises of a higher level head-to-head structure of polymer and lower lamellae, stacked, and monomer related structure levels in normal, equatorial, and meridional directions, respectively. By choosing the exact components and tuning the composition a coherence length as high as 800 Â Ã along the smectic axis has been achieved. By contrast to covalent side chains, the supramolecular side chains can be cleaved from the aligned materials, which render aligned pristine polymer and high photoluminescence quantum yield of pure polymer. The structure and phase equilibria have been designed between theory and experiment. The compilation of the results has been presented as a phase diagram in the melt state in the high polymer fraction limit. The study shows that the recent theoretical model highlights the most important mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena and gives trends in which direction the developed system has to be adjusted to achieve the desired effects. In the second part, the thickness dependent triaxial texturing in poly(9, 9 -bis(2 -ethylhexyl) -fluorene- 2, 7 -diyl) thin film on the rubbed polyimide has been identified, when thermotropic alignment has been applied. The polymer is 5 / 2 helix as proposed by Lieser and coworkers. It has three chain unit cell and the hexagonal-like cells of helical polymers are flattened {{in the direction of the}} surface normal and reveal two kinds of coexistent crystallites, a multiple orientation, where the greater proportion of the crystallites have a crystal axis a perpendicular to the substrate surface and where a smaller proportion is aligned with the crystal axis a parallel to the surface. This has been found to depend on the temperature and the film thickness. The overview shows a selection of unpublished results, reviews the trends in the supramolecular science discusses and reviews widely the characterization methods. In addition, a selection of further clarifications of the publications is reported.

For such lozenges, containing the antiseptics and local anesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2, 4 -dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or <b>hexylresorcinol</b> (HR), recently an additional virucidal effect was published. Therefore, we tested a set of StrepsilsÂ® lozenges, containing either HR (Max [# 2]) or AMC/DCBA (Original [# 3], Extra Strong [# 4], Warm [# 5], Orange and Vitamin C [# 6], Sugar free Lemon [# 7], Children/Strawberry [# 8] and Soothing Honey and Lemon [# 9]) for their antiviral efficiency against representatives of respiratory viruses known to cause sore throat: human rhinovirus (HRV) 1 a, HRV 8, influenza virus A H 1 N 1 n, Coxsackievirus A 10, and human coronavirus (hCoV) OC 43. The lozenges were tested {{head to head with}} ColdamarisÂ® lozenges (# 1), which contain the patented antiviral iota-carrageenan. None of the tested AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges shows any antiviral effectiveness against HRV 8 at the tested concentrations, whereas all are moderately active against HRV 1 a. Only lozenge # 5 shows any activity against hCoV OC 43 and Coxsackievirus A 10 at the tested concentrations. Similarly, only lozenge # 3 is moderately active against influenza A H 1 N 1 n virus. The data indicates that neither the isolated effect of the active ingredients nor the pH but rather {{one or more of the}} excipients of the specific formulations are responsible for the antiviral effect of some of the AMC/DCBA or HR containing lozenges. In contrast, carrageenan-containing lozenges are highly active against all viruses tested. In another experiment, we showed that binding and inactivation of virus particles by iota-carrageenan are fast and highly effective. During the residence time of the lozenge in the mouth, the viral titer is reduced by 85 % and 91 % for influenza A virus and hCoV OC 43, respectively.

The shelf life of fresh shrimp stored on ice is limited by two factors: melanosis (blackspot) and microbial spoilage. In this study L-lactic acid was tested, alone and in combination with sodium bisulfite and 4 -hexylresorcinol, to determine their effectiveness as both melanosis and microbial spoilage inhibitors. Brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) were obtained from the Gulf of Mexico on board a commercial fishing vessel. Immediately after harvest, the shrimp were separated {{from the rest of the}} catch. The shrimp were then headed, washed, and sorted into six groups that were treated by dipping for I min in the following solutions: (1) Control (sea water), (2) 1. 0 % L-lactic acid, (3) 1. 25 % sodium bisulfite, (4) 0. 0025 % 4 -hexylresorcinol, (5) 1. 25 % sodium bisulfite with 1. 0 % L-lactic acid, or (6) 0. 0025 % 4 - <b>hexylresorcinol</b> with 1. 0 % L-lactic acid. Each of the six groups of shrimp was split into 2 subgroups. One subgroup of shrimp was treated immediately after sorting and the other subgroup was treated after a 2 -hr delay on deck at ambient temperature to simulate normal practices during peak harvesting times. Each subgroup of shrimp was placed in a nylon mesh bag, completely submerged in the appropriate dip solution for 1 min with moderate up and down agitation, and drained. Each treatment group was stored on ice for 16 days in separate ice chests, and examined over the storage period for aerobic plate count (APC), pH, and degree of melanosis. Overall, this study demonstrated that treatment with L-lactic acid, alone or in combination with 4 -hexylresorcinol, had no detectable effect on the microbiological shelf life of brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus). In addition, 4 -hexylresorcinol performed exceptionally well as a melanosis inhibitor, whether alone or in combination with L-lactic acid. However, extensive bacterial growth was demonstrated in the 4 -hexylresorcinol dip solution during normal storage on deck, creating the potential for a heavy bacterial inoculation of shrimp during a typical dipping process. Addition of L-lactic acid to the 4 -hexylresorcinol dip solution prevented bacterial growth in the dip solution and did not interfere with melanosis inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1950. The {{adult male}} pinworm {{measures}} from 2 to 5 millimeters in length, and has its terminal and curved ventrad. The female pinworm {{is more than}} twice as large as the male, 8 - 13 millimeters in length, and has its tail portion decidedly attenuate. Pinworm ova is characteristically flattened on one side, and measures 55 by 30 micrometers. 	Examination of the feces show {{only a small percentage of}} the actual number of cases infected with pinworms. D'Antoni and Sawitz (1940) reported diagnosing less than 1 per cent of the true incidence using direct fecal films, and less than 25 per cent using fecal concentration techniques. 	The use of swabs is the present accepted means for diagnosing pinworm infections. Many swabs have been devised, but only two are in general use (1) the NIH swab, and (2) the Graham swab. These two swabs require a total of 7 consecutive swabs before an individual is considered to be negative. 	Serological testing seems to be of little value in diagnosing the presence of Enterobius. The reactions encountered upon injection of various sorts of extracts of pinworm individuals are not specific and therefore of little diagnostic value. 	The incidence of Enterobius in North America can be regarded as high, probably infecting half the people of North America. 	Central America and Mexico seems to be the most heavily infected area of continent. According to Sandground (1933) and Mazzotti and his associated (1940) and (1943), the majority of central americans and mexicans are probably harboring pinworms. 	In the Canadian-Alaska areas, the incidence of pinworms is high, according to Kuitunen-Ekbaum (1940) and (1943) and Ashburn (1941). 	The numerous papers presented on the incidence of pinworms in various parts of the United States supports the view that possibly 40 percent or more of the people in the United States are infected with pinworms. 	The injury that results from infections with Enterobius is slight. Gravid female migrations may set up local irritations in the anal area known as prurtis ani. This latter phenomenon is often used as a basis for diagnosing pinworms. MacArthur (1930) reported that the first and most important case of nocturnal prurtis is the presence of Enterobius. Numerous other complaints are associated with pinworm infections; anorexia, irritability, headaches, gastro-intestinal symptoms and so forth. 	Anal washes and ointments were once highly favored in treating pinworm infections, but they are, for the most part, no longer used. Wright, Brady, and Bozicevich (1939) reported anal ointments to be of doubtful value in treating cases of enterobiasis since they failed either to destroy females or render the ova non-viable. 	Santonin was shown by Wright, Brady, and Bozicevich (1939) to be far from effective in treating pinworms infections. 	Tetrachloroethylene is probably the best single dose drug for the treatment of Enterobius, but in large does it is not well tolerated by the patients especially children. 	Phenothiazine therapy is the standard treatment for enterobiasis in Europe and appears to be quite effective in ridding individuals of pinworms. With the use of phenothiazine nearly 90 percent cures are effected. 	<b>Hexylresorcinol</b> is probably the best all around drug available in pinworm therapy. The drug is better tolerated in large doses than most anthelmintics. It has, however, two major disadvantages, (1) it is expensive, and (2) if treatment is to be effective it must proceed for a considerable length of time. 	Hygienic measures alone will not clear up infections with pinworms. Best results are obtained when medication is coupled with hygienic controls. 	Thirty-six institutionalized boys, between the ages of 13 and 17, were examined with the use of a modified anal swab. The swab consists of a small test tube having a ring of Scotch tape affixed to its terminal end. The applicator tube when not in use was inserted into a larger, housing test tube. 	The boys were examined in the morning, 6 : 30 - 6 : 45 AM. For the sake of convenience the boys were divided into three groups, group I- 13 boys, group II- 13 boys, and group III- 10 boys. Of the 36 boys examined on the basis of four swabs, 18 or 50. 0 percent were found to be infected with pinworms. The negative fourth swabs were not regarded as evidence for diagnosis of pinworm infections using three consecutive swabs...|$|E
