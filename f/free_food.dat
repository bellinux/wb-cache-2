The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E

For those with Celiac disease, or gluten intolerance, gluten-free foods {{are hard to come}} by, especially on college campuses. Eating gluten free products has positive health effects on numerous diseases. It has been shown that eating gluten <b>free</b> <b>foods</b> can help alleviate symptoms of numerous diseases such as ADHD, autism, and type 2 diabetes (UDI’s Gluten Free website 2012). Throughout the past few years, more gluten free companies have been advocating to promote their products on college campuses for people with intolerances.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of <b>free</b> <b>food</b> stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained <b>free</b> <b>food</b> and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century they had their own gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E

The family was of modest means, and he matriculated at Gonville and Caius College, University of Cambridge, on 8 December 1576 as a sizar. Sizars were students of limited means who were charged lower fees and obtained <b>free</b> <b>food</b> and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study, often in exchange for performing work at their colleges.|$|E
40|$|The present article review about gluten {{its health}} effects and {{development}} of gluten <b>free</b> <b>foods.</b> Celiac disease is the main disease caused due to gluten indigestibility. Wheat is the main constituent {{in the production of}} bakery products and gluten is the main protein in the wheat. It has been well recognized that the only effective treatment for celiac disease is a persistent life-long avoidance of food products containing wheat and similar cereal grains. At present, there is still substantial demand for gluten-free products that meet consumer needs in terms of sensory quality, conveniences and price values. Wheat (Gluten) is the main component for quality of the bakery products. Gluten <b>free</b> <b>foods</b> are produced by the gluten free sources. The gluten free sources selected should have same characteristics as gluten and should have same effect as gluten on quality of the bread...|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Quorn was founded, an {{anonymous}} organization calling themselves The Spooks was started. Each Christmas, the members provided <b>free</b> <b>food</b> and clothing {{to the needy}} in Quorn and then in Kingsley. Their membership was small and only the members themselves knew who {{was a part of}} the organization. All members wear masks and they are still in operation in Kingsley. The Women's Kingsley Community Action Club was founded in June 1980 as a splinter group of the Men's KCAC. It was started with the plan to help summer programs for Kingsley's youth. The city once published the newspaper The Kingsley-News Times that began publication in 1887. The local newspaper was founded by J. H. Strief, who later became president of the Iowa State Federation of Labor. The Kingsley-News Times was later combined with two other newspapers to form The Record, spreading its coverage to include multiple nearby cities.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their dirty clothes and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the <b>free</b> <b>food.</b> Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{established}} a diplomatic {{presence in the}} Tarim Basin of Central Asia during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC). Han envoys brought gifts of sheep, gold, and silk to the urban oasis city-states. The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency; however, silk was favored {{as a means to}} pay for food and lodging. Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and {{established a}} Protectorate there, Han envoys in these states were given <b>free</b> <b>food</b> and lodging. These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs, precious stones, and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court. The Arsacid court sent exotic animals including lions and ostriches to the Han court, and a king ruling in what is now Burma sent elephants and rhinoceroses. Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits.|$|E
