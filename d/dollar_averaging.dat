Management Sci. 5 (4, July).) is essentially correct. The analysis, however, merits extension beyond the rather abbreviated treatment given in the article cited. <b>Dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> {{is a type of}} procurement policy whereby a given amount of money is spent at each purchasing opportunity. The amount actually bought at each period is then a function of the price prevailing at that time. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} this paper fall into two areas. First, it is shown that the {{conventional}} wisdom of <b>dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> is related to hedging against, large regrets rather than unfavorable outcomes. Suppose that a given sum of dollars is to be irreversibly converted into stock within a given number of periods. Suppose that the share price of dollars follows an arithmetic random walk. It is shown that <b>dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> is a nonsequential minimax strategy, if the largest possible price increase in each period {{is equal to the}} largest possible decrease. On the other hand, it is shown that <b>dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> cannot be a nonsequential expected utility maximizing strategy for any strictly concave utility function and any arithmetic random walk. Second, sequential minimax strategies are examined. Here the analysis may be viewed {{as an extension of the}} literature on the optimal time to sell an asset or the optimal stopping problem. The minimax sequential strategy is shown to be of the following form. At any time there exists a critical value which depends only on n, the difference between the maximum price since conversions began and the current price. Funds held in excess of this value are converted into stock, otherwise no funds are converted. The critical values are shown to be decreasing functions of n. When the share price of dollars rises (i. e., stock prices fall) few funds are converted while decreases produce large conversions. These results seem to correspond to the second thoughts of those, embarking on nonsequential policies of the <b>dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> type. Buying and selling minimax policies are shown to be symmetric. Sequential minimaxing will tend to have a reinforcing effect on price movements. ...|$|E

The sinking fund problem is to determine an optimal strategy {{in the form of}} a stopping rule to decide between purchasing bonds now, or waiting for at least one more day. The problem is formulated and solved for two objective functions: (1) minimize expected unit cost, and (2) minimize maximum regret. Price move-ments are assumed to follow a conditional random walk. Using computer simulation, the performance and stopping characteristics of the two models are compared against a <b>dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> purchase strategy commonly used in prac-tice.

Circumstances are discussed for which such popular policies as short term trend following and intermediate term <b>dollar</b> <b>averaging</b> are optimal in the long run.

50|$|Value averaging, {{also known}} as <b>dollar</b> value <b>averaging</b> (DVA), is a {{technique}} of adding to an investment portfolio {{with the objective of}} providing a greater return than similar methods such as <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> and random investment. It was developed by former Harvard University professor Michael E. Edleson. Value averaging is a formula-based investment technique where a mathematical formula is used to guide the investment of money into a portfolio over time. With the method, investors contribute to their portfolios {{in such a way that}} the portfolio balance increases by a set amount, regardless of market fluctuations. As a result, in periods of market declines, the investor contributes more, while in periods of market climbs, the investor contributes less. In contrast to <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> which mandates that a fixed amount of money be invested at each period, the value averaging investor may actually be required to withdraw from the portfolio in some periods.|$|R

40|$|<b>Dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> is {{a highly}} {{controversial}} investment strategy, which has lately gained popularity in midst of the debate. While it is increasingly recommended by scores of investment advisors, as an effective strategy; many academics argue that this strategy merely reduces risk, {{at the cost of}} the opportunity to earn higher returns. In addition, the increased popularity of the strategy amongst individual investors, have lead to claims, that it a product of irrational behaviour of investors. This dissertation will explore whether <b>Dollar</b> Cost <b>Averaging</b> is irrationality or an effective investment strategy for investors of all types with different risk tolerance levels. By means of risk adjusted return performance measures such as Sharpe, Sortino and Treynor's ratio, the research shows that <b>Dollar</b> Cost <b>Averaging,</b> not only significantly reduce the magnitude and chances of incurring losses, but also produces superior returns when compared to Lump Sum Investment strategy.

40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{focus of}} this article are lump sum and regular {{investments}} (<b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method) on selected world stock markets in the period from 1990 to 2010 for different investment horizons. Scientific aim: The aim of this Paper is to compare and evaluate lump sum and regular investments (<b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method) on important world stock markets according to the return-risk profile in the period from 1990 to 2010 for different investment horizons. The following world stock markets were chosen: US stock market (S&P 500 Total Return index), European stock market (S&P Europe 350 Total Return index) and Japan stock market (S&P TOPIX 150 Total Return index). Methodology: The Methodology used in this Paper is based on the quantification of return and risk indicators for different investment horizons. The following investment horizons were chosen: 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 10 years. The Paper works with quarterly data of selected indices in the period from 1990 to 2010. Indices are used in total return form, i. e. dividends and their reinvesting on the same market are included. Standard deviation is used as the risk indicator and internal rate of return is used as the return indicator. The return-risk profile is quantified as the share of the return indicator and the risk indicator. Findings: Regular investment through the <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method brought substantially better (higher) values of the return-risk profile than lump sum investments made during the same period on the same market, mostly over short-term investment horizons (one-year and three-year horizons). Over longer investment horizons, regular investment with the <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method was still bringing better results than the return-risk profile, but given the trend of a growing US and European market, more return could be achieved with lump sum investments than regular investments made over the same period. As the Japanese stock market was stagnating, the gap between the results of the return-risk profile for regular and lump sum investments was closing with growing length of the investment horizon. Conclusions: Regular investments with the <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method are desirable particularly for short-term investment horizons (1 -year and 3 -year horizons) where volatility can be reduced thanks to the right investment timing, but the losses following a slump on the stock market are not so vast as in one-time investments (thanks to cost averaging). On the other hand, the recommendation to invest over the one- or threeyear investment horizon can partially contradict the recommendations for stock markets. Here, the shortest recommended investment horizon is five years. Regular investment with the <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method however significantly reduces the stock market risk also over these investment horizons when compared with one-time investments. As this Paper has however shown, even when the results of the return-risk profile were not so much better for longer investment horizons in regular investments with the <b>dollar</b> cost <b>averaging</b> method than for short-term investment horizons, investments with this method can be still clearly recommended also for these investment horizons – both for growing stock markets, and for long-term stagnating markets...|$|R
