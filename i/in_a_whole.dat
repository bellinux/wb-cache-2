5|$|During Memphis's 1873 {{yellow fever}} {{epidemic}}, he—along with other Memphis rabbis and leading Jews—remained {{in the city}} rather than fleeing. During the seven weeks the epidemic lasted, 51 people were buried in B'nai Israel's cemetery, almost twice the number typically buried there <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> year. When another yellow fever epidemic broke out in 1878, Samfield stayed again, ministering to the dead and dying of all faiths. During that epidemic 78 people were buried in the congregation's cemetery. The city's frequent yellow fever epidemics decimated its Jewish community, which dropped from 2,100 to 300. They also hurt B'nai Israel's finances; members did not pay their dues, {{and for a time}} the congregation could not afford to pay Samfield. By 1880, however, membership had increased to 124 families, and finances had improved. By this time, the synagogue was more typically called Children of Israel. Beth El Emeth was affected more severely than Children of Israel by the epidemics; its rabbi (Peres) died of yellow fever in 1879. In 1882, Beth El Emeth disbanded, and transferred its property to Children of Israel, though most Beth El Emeth members joined the Orthodox Baron Hirsch Synagogue. The property included land on Second Street, and Beth El Emeth's cemetery.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken place there for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} {{building}} {{to be done}} in Manueline style is the Monastery of Jesus of Setubal, by the architect Diogo de Boitaca, one of the originators and masters of the style. The nave of the monastery's church, supported by spiral columns, reveals the attempt to unify and make equal of the church, a style which reaches its climax in the church of Jerónimos Monastery, completed in 1520 by architect João de Castilho. Francisco de Arruda's Belém Tower and chapter window of the Convent of the Order of Christ, in Tomar, {{are some of the most}} famous examples of the Manueline style, and Portuguese Renaissance architecture <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Knifeline attack (KLA) {{is another}} kind of {{corrosion}} affecting welds, impacting steels stabilized by niobium. Niobium and niobium carbide dissolves in steel at very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes, niobium carbide does not precipitate, and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, {{making it difficult to}} spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have to be heated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> to about , when the chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment is not important.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{his first}} murder conviction, Tobin served ten {{years in prison for}} a double rape {{committed}} in 1993, following which he was released in 2004. In 2007, he was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years for the rape and murder of Angelika Kluk in Glasgow in 2006. Skeletal remains of a further two young women who went missing in 1991 were subsequently found at his former home in Margate, Kent. Tobin was convicted of the murder of Vicky Hamilton in December 2008, resulting in his minimum sentence being increased to 30 years, and of the murder of Dinah McNicol in December 2009, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> life order.

25|$|By November, 1990, the 52/55hp (carbureted/EPI) non-turbo F6A SOHC 4-valve engine became {{available}}, available <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> {{range of}} versions: M as three- or five-door (later only five), with manual or automatic transmissions and FWD or 4WD, a sportier S {{only as a}} three-door, and the luxurious L only as a five-door with the more powerful EPI engine - which also appeared in 4WDs equipped with automatics. In September 1991 the range was revised, receiving side impact protection and a high mounted brakelight. Since these were considered structural changes the car received {{a new set of}} model codes, becoming the CN22S/CP22S/CN32S/CP32S. The SR-Four now came with all-around disc brakes while the S-Turbo was discontinued. An FWD automatic MC version joined the range at the lower end, equipped with a column-mounted shifter. Other special versions abounded, with the luxurious F-Limited EPI 3-door joining in December 1991 and the somewhat cheaper, carbureted M Selection in April 1992. In July of that year, the 3-door, automatic only S Selection managed to find a slot in a pricelist now comprising a faintly ridiculous 27 variants. This didn't hinder Suzuki from adding more versions, the well-equipped LoFt (sic), in June 1994 and the A in April of that year.|$|E

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} {{data about}} the population, households and settlements of the smallest Croatian county, the Međimurje County, situated in the furthest north-west of Croatia. This {{is one of the}} most densely populated parts of Croatia, but for over 130 years its population has been growing more slowly than <b>in</b> Croatia as <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> The reason is steady emigration (in the last 20 or so years over 0. 2 per cent a year). Medimurje’s demographic characteristics are somewhat more favourable than <b>in</b> Croatia as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> but forecasted demographic development is not especially optimistic. The education structure of the Međimurje population is interesting because there are fewer completely uneducated people, but also fewer highly educated ones than <b>in</b> Croatia as <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> This last difference is decreasing. On an average households are somewhat larger than <b>in</b> Croatia as <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> but they are decreasing at an above-average rate. The population distribution is more even than <b>in</b> Croatia as <b>a</b> whole: there is no pronounced urban centre not are there any minute settlements...|$|R
