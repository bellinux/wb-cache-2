40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} process by which consumers decide which automobile to purchase and how to finance their decision. Although prior research of automobile leasing assumed a sequential process in which household's first decided which vehicle to buy and then decided how to pay for it, empirical estimates from this paper indicate the process should be modeled as simultaneous. A nested multinomial logit vehicle type choice model which considers payment options is used to gain insight into why consumers lease cars. Specifically, evidence supports the hypothesis that consumers lease to avoid binding credit constraints which permit them to drive a higher quality car than they otherwise would have chosen and avoid the disposal costs associated with purchasing a new vehicle every three years. Furthermore, accurate survey information enabled the inclusion of previously unexplored vehicle and socioeconomic attributes in the vehicle type choice estimation. For example, it is shown that the residual value of a vehicle, defined as the percentage of MSRP a vehicle is expected to retain after three years of use, does {{have a significant impact on}} the selection of which vehicle to purchase. An endogenous lease pricing model which allows automobile manufacturers to price discriminate depending upon a households choice of financing is then used to develop short term forecasts of the automobile industry. The endogenous pricing model allows for empirical enumeration of two opposing incentives faced by automobile manufacturers. Results indicate that in many cases manufacturers have incentives to charge lease prices higher than the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price would suggest. Automobile demand estimates and endogenous lease pricing results are then used to explain the dramatic increase in consumer leasing over the past fifteen years and predict <b>future</b> <b>leasing</b> trends. As real household income and automobile prices stabilize, consumer leasing is predicted to peak at approximately 30 % of all vehicle purchases...|$|R

40|$|North Mississippi has {{significant}} hardwood timber resources. Hardwood timber {{in the region}} has traditionally been {{an important source of}} raw material for furniture and other wood-based industries. In recent years, however, demand has greatly increased for hardwood timber for use in the pulp and paper industry, resulting in increased harvest levels of pole-sized and small sawtimber-sized hardwoods in the region. Increased harvests of hardwood timber have given rise to concerns about the longerterm availability of hardwoods that are large enough in size to be efficiently converted into lumber and other solid wood products. Futures options, <b>futures</b> contracts, <b>leases,</b> and limited partnerships were initially considered for potential application to increase the longer-term production of hardwood sawtimber on nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) lands in North Mississippi.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Amid rising oil and gas prices and reports of record oil industry profits, a number of governments have taken steps to reevaluate and, in some cases, increase the share {{of oil and gas}} revenues they receive for the rights to develop oil and gas on their lands and waters. For example, the State of Alaska has recently passed new oil and gas legislation that will increase the state's share of revenue received from oil and gas companies operating state leases. In January 2007, the Department of the Interior announced an increase in the royalty rate for <b>future</b> <b>leases</b> granted in the deepwater region of the Gulf of Mexico. Companies engaged in exploration and development of oil and gas resources do so under terms of concessions, leases, or contracts granted by governments or other resource owners. The terms and conditions of such arrangements are established by law or negotiated on a case-by-case basis. One important aspect of the arrangements is the applicable payments from the companies to the resource owners [...] in the United States, these include bonuses, rentals, royalties, corporate income taxes, and special fees or taxes. The precise mix and total amount of these payments, referred to as the "fiscal system" varies widely across different resource owners. The total revenue, {{as a percentage of the}} value of the oil and natural gas produced, received by government resource owners, such as U. S. federal or state governments is commonly referred to as the "government take. " For example, a government take of 50 percent means that the government receives 50 percent of the cash flow produced from an oil or gas field. In fiscal year 2006, oil and gas companies received over $ 77 billion from the sale of oil and gas produced from federal lands and waters, and the Department of the Interior's Minerals Management Service (MMS) reported that these companies paid the federal government about $ 10 billion in oil and gas royalties. Clearly, such large and financially significant resources must be carefully developed and managed so that our nation's rising energy needs are met while at the same time the American people are ensured of receiving a fair rate of return on publicly owned resources, especially in light of the nation's daunting current and long-range fiscal challenges. As requested, this report documents the information provided to Congressional staffs in March 2007 on the U. S. government's take and implications associated with increasing royalty rates. Specifically, this report discusses (1) the United States' government take relative to that of other government resource owners and (2) the potential revenue implications of raising royalty rates on federal oil and gas leases going forward. ...|$|R
40|$|The Grid {{can be seen}} as a {{collection}} of services each of which performs some functionality. Users of the Grid seek to use combinations of these services to perform the overall task they need to achieve. In general this {{can be seen as}} a set of services with a workflow document describing how these services should be combined. The user may also have certain constraints on the workflow operations, such as execution time or cost to the user, specified in the form of a Quality of Service (QoS) document. The users submit their workflow to a brokering service along with the QoS document. The brokering service's task is to map any given workflow to a subset of the Grid services taking the QoS and state of the Grid into account [...] service availability and performance. We propose an approach for generating constraint equations describing the workflow, the QoS requirements and the state of the Grid. This set of equations may be solved using Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is the traditional method. We further develop a novel 2 -stage stochastic MILP which is capable of dealing with the volatile nature of the Grid and adapting the selection of the services during the lifetime of the workflow. We present experimental results comparing our approaches, showing that the 2 -stage stochastic programming approach performs consistently better than other traditional approaches. Next we addresses workload allocation techniques for Grid workflows in a multi-cluster Grid. We model individual clusters as MIMIk queues and obtain a numerical solution for missed deadlines (failures) of tasks of Grid workflows. We also present an efficient algorithm for obtaining workload allocations of clusters. Next we model individual cluster resources as G/G/l queues and solve an optimisation problem that minimises QoS requirement violation, provides QoS guarantee and outperforms reservation based scheduling algorithms. Both approaches are evaluated through an experimental simulation and the results confirm that the proposed workload allocation strategies combined with traditional scheduling algorithms performs considerably better in terms of satisfying QoS requirements of Grid workflows than scheduling algorithms that don't employ such workload allocation techniques. Next we develop a novel method for Grid brokers that aims at maximising profit whilst satisfying end-user needs with a sufficient guarantee in a volatile utility Grid. We develop a develop a 2 -stage stochastic MILP which is capable of dealing with the volatile nature of the Grid and obtaining cost bounds that ensure that end-user cost is minimised or satisfied and broker's profit is maximised with sufficient guarantee. These bounds help brokers know beforehand whether the budget limits of end-users can be satisfied and, if not, then obtain appropriate <b>future</b> <b>leases</b> from service providers.
