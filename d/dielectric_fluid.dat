40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a nonlinear perturbation technique to third order, {{to study the}} stability between two cylindrical inviscid fluids, subjected to an axial electric field. The study {{takes into account the}} relaxation of electrical charges at the interface between the two fluids. At first order, a linear dispersion relation is obtained. Analytical and numerical results for the overstability and incipient instability conditions are given. For perfect <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids,</b> the electric field has a stabilizing influence, while for leaky <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids,</b> the electric field can have either a stabilizing or a destabilizing influence depending on the conductivity and permittivity ratios of the two fluids. At higher order, a nonlinear dispersion relation (nonlinear Ginzburg–Landau equation) is derived, describing the evolution of wave packets of the problem. For leaky <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids</b> near the marginal state, a nonlinear diffusion equation (nonlinear incipient instability) is obtained. For perfect <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids,</b> two cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations are obtained.

25|$|Capacitors may catastrophically fail when {{subjected}} to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluid,</b> resulting in case bulging, rupture, {{or even an}} explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially {{in the center of}} the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{the development of}} a hybrid reconfiguration technique used to achieve both frequency and polarization diversity in a 2. 4 ? 2. 5 GHz microstrip antenna. This hybrid solution for the first time combines current state-of-the-art fluidic and solid-state reconfiguration mechanisms in a collaborative effort. Two orthogonally-crossed and co-located narrow microstrip patches with gap discontinuities separating a central probe-fed section from the radiating slots provides the base antenna structure. The fluidic mechanisms use high strength <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids</b> or liquid metal loaded across the gap discontinuities and the solid-state mechanisms uses readily available RF PIN and varactor diodes integrated across the gaps to enable reconfiguration. Accurate and robust circuit modeling concepts are presented to provide insight on antenna performance and loss mechanisms from each reconfiguration technique. A polarization-only reconfigurable version of this antenna utilizing <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids,</b> RF PIN didoes, and liquid metal in separate design iterations were examined to introduce design and circuit modeling concepts and provide a first comparison between the reconfiguration techniques. While all iterations achieved good linear polarization switching, <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids</b> and the RF PIN didoes are found to have large negative impacts on radiation performance due to ohmic losses (radiation efficiencies between 8 ? 35 %). In the liquid metal iteration, ohmic losses are significantly reduced to boost radiation efficiencies near that of a tradition patch antenna (near 80 %). The hybrid reconfiguration solution utilizes liquid metal and solid-state varactors for polarization and frequency diversity, respectively. Non-hybrid design iterations using only <b>dielectric</b> <b>fluids</b> and solid-state RF PIN diodes with varactors provide a comparison between all reconfiguration techniques and demonstrate the advantages of the hybrid solution. It was found that broadly variable <b>dielectric</b> strength <b>fluids</b> used as a sole reconfiguration mechanism can achieve a wide frequency tuning range of 700 MHz, maintain linear polarization switching, and have radiation efficiencies near 60 %. However, the fluids must have loss tangents less than 0. 02 and are currently not readily available. The RF PIN and varactor diode combination provides a realizable solution, however, suffers from excessive DC control power requirements, a limited tuning range of 100 MHz, and low radiation efficiency around 16 %. The hybrid solution combines the best aspects of all subsequent design iterations to achieve a realizable frequency and polarization reconfigurable antenna with a tuning range of 263 MHz and 41. 7 % radiation efficiency average across reconfiguration states...|$|R
