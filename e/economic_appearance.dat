40|$|To {{encounter}} {{the novels of}} Maria Edgeworth is to encounter an author who is not always politically correct. She did not write as a feminist to better the world for women. She did not write {{in the name of}} equality between nations or classes. She did not write to promote racial tolerance. In fact, based on her treatment of these issues within her novels, Edgeworth could arguably be accused of anti-feminism, imperialism, and racism. Instead, what this late eighteenth-century, early nineteenth-century writer centered her novels around was a rigid set of moral guidelines. Maria Edgeworth used the novel genre as a way to promote her own codes of conduct that she perhaps thought necessary for a world caught in the midst of various upheavals. This thesis will investigate the possible events that may have inspired Edgeworth to take on the responsibility of moralizer. And of course, we will discuss the topics of education, class, gender, society, economy, fashion, and religion—all subjects which Edgeworth used to generate her codes of conduct. In a time of European unrest and change, Edgeworth, we will find, wrote to uphold the threatened status quo. In the shadows of women 2 ̆ 7 s reform, the <b>economic</b> <b>appearance</b> of a middle class, and revolutions leading to the end of monarchies, Edgeworth took it upon herself to speak in opposition to these and other socially disruptive changes. This all seems happily uncomplicated until we consider Edgeworth 2 ̆ 7 s use of textual rhetoric, the accents and dialogue of her characters, and her use of comedy which serve to undermine her moral motives. This thesis then must explore the ways in which Edgeworth inadvertently creates tension between the harmony she intends to accomplish through creating codes of conduct, and the discordant linguistic devices within her texts (rhetoric, accents, dialogue, idiom, sarcasm, irony, etc.) she employs to do so...|$|E

Byrd said in 2010 that, based on their research, they believe that Toomer passed for white at periods in his life even though he never claimed that he was white or black, he simply was an American {{as far as he}} was concerned. They note that in the 1920 and 1930 censuses he was classified as European-American.

40|$|Since inception, the {{development}} industry has evolved within adverse geopolitical conditions, most acutely, the Cold War. Various accounts, particularly post-development literature, {{assert that the}} discourse of war was displaced onto the social domain and to a new geographical terrain via ‘the war on poverty’ (Escobar, 1995). While there is increasing interest in the security discourse within the humanitarian/emergency fad, particularly since the 911 attacks, most accounts suggest that this shift skews development practice. However, when analysed within the East – West development axis, I argue that the glove of benevolence is rolling back to reveal an ‘iron fist’. Exacerbated by the <b>economic</b> crisis, <b>appearance</b> of the BRICS and dominance of Chinese ‘soft power’, it serves to undress other forms of Western ‘insecurity’. In Europe, Merkel employs the spectre of war to achieve support for the rescue fund announcing perhaps the arrival of force as ‘politics of last resort’. In the cooperation arena, the Western agenda is becoming blatant, revealed in the launch of Africa Command (AFRICOM) by the US, followed by the UK, including traditionally benign states like Canada and Denmark. While this shift {{is seen as a}} threat for development outcomes in the South, few accounts have contemplated the opportunities contained in the slippery slope presented by {{the development}}-security nexus. If development is exposed as Western insecurity rather than Southern assistance; what opportunity does this present for Southern States? Can the so called radicalised states like Zimbabwe and Venezuela perhaps point a justified re-direction of development focus in the bid for self determined improvement?

40|$|Globalization {{processes}} and market deregulation policies are rapidly changing the competitive environments of many <b>economic</b> sectors. The <b>appearance</b> of new competitors and technologies {{leads to an}} increase in competition and, with it, a growing preoccupation among service-providing companies with creating stronger customer bonds. In this context, anticipating the customer’s intention to abandon the provider, a phenomenon known as churn, becomes a competitive advantage. Such anticipation can be the result of the correct application of information-based knowledge extraction in the form of business analytics. In particular, the use of intelligent data analysis, or data mining, for the analysis of market surveyed information can be of great assistance to churn management. In this paper, we provide a detailed survey of recent applications of business analytics to churn, with a focus on computational intelligence methods. This is preceded by an in-depth discussion of churn within the context of customer continuity management. The survey is structured according to the stages identified as basic for the building of the predictive models of churn, as well as according to the different types of predictive methods employed and the business areas of their application.

The <b>appearance</b> of fast light stage-coaches on certain roads at this time however, provided the inspiration for John Palmer to advance his plan for a system of mail-coaches. Despite opposition, Palmer had in a period of less than two years established a network of mail-coach services which provided an economical and safe means of mail transit coupled with a premier form of public passenger conveyance. The speed and expansion of routes and facilities resulted initially in a rapid increase in the volume of letters, but this declined as postage rates increased to assist war financiers, and from 1812 stagnation set in.

40|$|The ongoing {{processes}} {{of globalization and}} deregulation are changing the competitive framework {{in the majority of}} <b>economic</b> sectors. The <b>appearance</b> of new competitors and technologies entails a sharp increase in competition and a growing preoccupation among service providing companies with creating stronger bonds with customers. Many of these companies are shifting resources away from the goal of capturing new customers and are instead focusing on retaining existing ones. In this context, anticipating the customer¿s intention to abandon, a phenomenon also known as churn, and facilitating the launch of retention-focused actions represent clear elements of competitive advantage. Data mining, as applied to market surveyed information, can provide assistance to churn management processes. In this thesis, we mine real market data for churn analysis, placing a strong emphasis on the applicability and interpretability of the results. Statistical Machine Learning models for simultaneous data clustering and visualization lay the foundations for the analyses, which yield an interpretable segmentation of the surveyed markets. To achieve interpretability, much attention is paid to the intuitive visualization of the experimental results. Given that the modelling techniques under consideration are nonlinear in nature, this represents a non-trivial challenge. Newly developed techniques for data visualization in nonlinear latent models are presented. They are inspired in geographical representation methods and suited to both static and dynamic data representation. Postprint (published version...|$|R

The environmental (dis-) performance of Chinese vehicles contributes largely to this problem. The fuel-cell system represents a technology that could eliminate much of the local air-pollution problem. However, the chances of fuel-cell cars during the next decades are still highly questioned. In this research, the diffusion of fuel-cell cars in China has been explored till 2045. The energy model MARKAL (MARKet ALlocation) has been combined with qualitative exploring methods, using a multi-disciplinary scenario approach. We identified the key factors and driving forces that influence the diffusion of fuel-cell cars in China, ranked them on importance and uncertainty, to finally generate four scenarios. The scenarios are based {{on the role of the}} Chinese government with regard to emission control, technology development, and fossil fuel prices. Scenario analyses confirm the widely claimed need for further technological development, but also find it insufficient. Moreover, it is found that the widespread diffusion of fuel-cell cars in China will first and only take place after 2025. Main conditions are firstly: the removal of technological and <b>economic</b> obstacles, the <b>appearance</b> of an initial niche market and the self-enforcement of diffusion (with consensus among the important actors), driven by the technological development. Secondly: either high price of fossil fuels (energy resource scarcity) is required or (very) strict environmental regulations by the Chinese government -i. e. a breakthrough of the present policy trend...|$|R

On November 1, Mozzoni requested his resignation. According to Ezequiel Perteagudo, this was part of an agreement between President Juan Carlos Onganía, Archbishop Antonio José Plaza of La Plata and Archbishop Mozzoni, whereby the government took no action with regard to the 1965 crash of the Banco Popular de la Plata in return for the removal of Podestá; and Luro said in a book published in 2011 that Podestá's removal by the Church was paid for by a government subsidy for the Catholic University of Argentina, and that Plaza gained by the government covering up the bank affair. Podestá agreed to resign on condition that he could speak to Pope Paul VI in January. Sources cited by the New York Times blamed his removal on his [...] "outspoken attacks on the Government's <b>economic</b> policies", his <b>appearance</b> at labor union rallies, and the influence of conservative Catholics who opposed his enthusiastic support of the Second Vatican Council's reforms. Onganía, who had taken power in a coup d'etat that its leaders called the Argentine Revolution, had told Podestá in July 1967 that he was [...] "the main enemy of the Argentine Revolution". Podestá denied charges that he maintained contact with the followers of Juan Perón, who had ruled Argentina from 1946 to 1955. Perteagudo says that, after being asked to resign, Podestá went to Rome and was assured by Pope Paul VI that nothing would happen, but that, three days after his return to Argentina, he received notification from Rome that his resignation was accepted. News of his resignation was published on L'Osservatore Romano on 2 December 1967. After his resignation became public in December, he attacked Mozzoni for leaking the news. Church officials suggested Podestá had resigned due to health problems and denied any pressure from the government.|$|R

From an economic standpoint, innovation is the engine of <b>economic</b> growth. The <b>appearance</b> of innovation is not uniform in the market, and neither are its affects. The {{development of}} new products and technology is significant in any industry. As a result, understanding the path of progress within an industry is necessary to maximize the benefit from innovation. The focus {{of this research is}} to further understand the relationship between producers, consumers, and the environment, in the context of innovation. Three scenarios are evaluated. First, innovation evaluated in the context technology intensive industries with product differentiation. Using an optimal control approach with product differentiation and firm outlook we examine conditions that maximize social welfare. When firm(s) have the same discount rate regardless of market structure, a monopoly will develop more innovative products. However, it is shown that competition may increase innovation if firms alter their outlook in a duopoly market structure. Next, influence of consumers on producer adoption of clean technology is evaluated. A spatial model is developed to analyze welfare implications of environmental policies in a competitive market with production and consumption heterogeneity. Consumers with heterogeneous preferences choose between non-green and certified green products, while firms with heterogeneous production costs decide whether to engage in green production. In order for green products to be recognized by consumers, firms must join a green club. The number of green firms, environmental standard, and overall welfare under the market solution are all found to be socially sub-optimal. Finally, producer innovation in markets characterized by public policy due to emission concerns is evaluated. Using a dynamic approach, we derive a firm’s optimal R&D investment strategy to develop clean technology. Explicitly allowing for the cumulative nature of R&D shows that emissions per unit of output are lowest when the firms cooperate in R&D, and show that a profit-maximizing merged entity will never choose the most efficient investment strategy in clean technology, which has implications for emission tax policy and environmental innovation to improve overall welfare...|$|R
