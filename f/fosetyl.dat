5000|$|The {{best way}} to manage P. cactorum is by {{implementing}} an integrated management plan. The combination of soil fumigation and proper cultural controls {{will be the best}} option for plant health. Recommended chemical controls products include <b>fosetyl</b> Al, metalaxyl, and etridiazol. Prevention and sanitation are crucial because this pathogen is usually transmitted through cuts or injuries on the plant. The spores are easily transported through irrigation water and will splash to nearby plants. Elevating your plants above the ground can help to prevent infection. The pathogen thrives in moist soils therefore it is important to avoid very saturated soils as much as possible and one should work to prepare their soil for adequate drainage during the wet periods. Soil drainage and low soil pH may help to reduce the disease. [...] Fertilizer regimen methods have been used to control against P. cactorum. These fertilizers include organic materials that release ammonia, nitrous acid and amendments to reduce the pH to less than 4. [...] The use of raised beds and a carefully managed drip irrigation system will be important cultural practices that can be implemented. There are some form of Biological controls that {{have been found to be}} somewhat successful with Enterobacter aerogenes and Trichoderma.|$|E

The application was done before August, which is before the main disease epidemic that usually occurs in September and October.The recommended standard for fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya for a season is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3-4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation with one or two fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard fungicide application.It was suggested that the understanding regarding the source of inoculum, the amount of infective inoculum production and how the disease is disseminated is important in order to identify the appropriate and economical method in fungicide application as well as for an effective control of the disease. For example, the application of fungicide on the trunk will help farmers to control the spread of the disease up in the canopy, as it is difficult to reach the canopy during fungicide application. This will eventually save more time, labor and cost for disease management.|$|E

Here, we demonstrate that in Arabidopsis, the innate plant defense mechanism contributes to the effectiveness of fungicides. In NahG and nim 1 (for noninducible immunity) Arabidopsis plants, which normally exhibit increased susceptibility to pathogens, the fungicides metalaxyl, <b>fosetyl,</b> and Cu(OH) 2 are much less active and fail to control Peronospora parasitica. In contrast, the effectiveness of these fungicides is not altered in Arabidopsis mutants defective in the ethylene or jasmonic acid signal transduction pathways. Application of the systemic acquired resistance activator benzothiadiazole (BTH) in combination with these fungicides results in a synergistic effect on pathogen resistance in wild-type plants and an additive effect in NahG and BTH-unresponsive nim 1 plants. Interestingly, BTH treatment normally induces long-lasting pathogen protection; however, in NahG plants, the protection is transient. These observations suggest that BTH treatment can compensate only partially for an impaired signal transduction pathway and support the idea that pathogen defense mechanisms are under positive feedback control. These observations are strikingly reminiscent of the reduced efficacy of antifungal agents in immunocompromised animals...|$|E

In 2002, vines that had received trunk injections after trunk renewal were in better vegetative condition than vines without such injections, with full yield and lower mortality. Cyproconazole was particularly effective when trunk injected, but was not effective when injected into the ground. A possible explanation for this is given. Moreover the effect that the severity of the wood necrosis observed at the time of trunk renewal had on treatment effectiveness was evaluated.

40|$|Rapidly {{increasing}} {{world population}} {{in recent years}} brings about an increasing demand for nutri-tion, {{which is one of}} the most important problems for mankind. Various methods have been discussed in order to solve this problem. One of these meth-ods is using chemicals against harmful organisms in plants. The use of pesticides in agricultural areas increases the plant yield; however, some chemical substances may result in pollution in nature and health problems. The effects of pesticides used in high concen-trations in the world have been dealt with and investigated by various researchers from differ-ent aspects. For this reason, a number of studies were carried out to determine harmful effects of pesticides (Soriano 1984, El-Khodary et al. 1987). Detrimental effects of fungicide sprays on fruit set and yield in crops such as cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) were reported (Özgen and Palta 2001). Furthermore, it was stated that pesticides had often prevented cell division (Yoshida et al. 1983). A lot of work was done to study the effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth (He et al. 1995). Harmful effects of fungicides on pollen germination (Watters and Sturgeon 1990) and pollen tube growth (Marcucci et al. 1983) were demonstrated for commercially important plants. Although many studies have been conducted on the effects of fungicides on pollen germination and pollen tube growth, very few studies have been carried out handling the impact of fungicides on the pollen morphology and viability. This study was thus conducted to determine whether fungicide fosetyl-Al affects morphol-ogy and viability of Lycopersicon esculentum Mill pollen. Fosetyl-Al i s rapidly absorbed, predomi-nantly through the leaves but also through the roots, with translocation both acropetally and basipetally. Fosetyl-Al (aluminium salt of ethyl hydrogen phosphonate) is C 6 H 18 AlO 9 P 3, or (H(CH 3 CH 2) P(O) O) 3 Al, respectively. The metabo-lism of <b>fosetyl</b> in plants proceeds the hydrolytic cleavage of the ethyl ester bond.

40|$|The leafhopper, Acia lineatifrons (Naude) was {{identified}} as a pest on grapevines near Tulbagh in 1978 and has since been reported on grapevines all over the South Western Cape. A. lineatifrons causes browning of the leaves which often results in the shedding of the discoloured leaves. Heavy defoliation before harvest can result in sunburn damage to the grapes, whilst premature leaf loss after harvest adversely affects the ripening of the canes and the accumulation of reserves. This project was aimed at obtaining basic information on the biology and population dynamics of A. lineatifrons as well as to identify priorities for future research. This information is needed to develop a reliable crop-linked predictive model, methods for monitoring pest populations as well as to develop efficient short- and long-term control measures and pest management strategies. The life cycle of A. lineatifrons was studied in the laboratory. At 26 °C the mean incubation period of the eggs was nine to eleven days, the mean developmental period for the five nymphal instars was 15 days and the minimum pre-oviposition period five to ten days. This adds up to a mean generation time of 29 to 36 days at 26 °C. At 20 °C the mean nymphal development period was 25 days, confirming the strong influence of temperature on the development rate. Fecundity was determined in the laboratory as the number of nymphs produced per female. The mean of 8, 5 nymphs per female recorded at 26 °C is very low compared to that of other leafhopper species (see Appendix 2). The low fecundity measured was most likely due to sub-optimal environmental conditions in the laboratory, a reduction in the suitability of the host plant under these conditions and handling of the females. The seasonal occurrence of A. lineatifrons on grapevines was studied over three seasons. It was found that the leafhoppers overwinter in the adult stage on indigenous Rubus spp, and that they enter the vineyard from the end of October until the beginning of November. Peak populations occurred between the middle of February and the end of March after which the population declined steadily {{towards the end of the}} season as the vine leaves were shed. The sex ratio of the overwintering population on R. chrysocarpus was heavily female biased, possibly due to differential mortality of the sexes. During the growing season the sex ratio was slightly male biased and reached equality on several occasions, both on the Rubus and on the grapevines. The movement of A. lineatifrons between the Rubus and the grapevines was investigated, but no evidence of a directional migration from the Rubus to the grapevines was found. Furthermore, no evidence was found to indicate that morphologically distinct short- and long-distance fliers, as found in Cicadulina species by Rose (1972 b), exist in the A. lineatifrons population. Host preference tests also showed that adult leafhoppers apparently have no significant preference for grapevines to Rubus or vice versa. It seems, therefore, that the leafhoppers' move onto the grapevines at the beginning of the growing season is not prompted by a host preference. Chaboussou (1971) suggested that certain organic fungicides may cause leafhopper outbreaks because they affect the suitability of the vines as host plants and alter leafhopper fecundity. The effect of Mikal-M (active ingredient <b>Fosetyl</b> AL/Mancozeb), a systemic dithiocarbanate fungicide, on A. lineatifrons was investigated. Laboratory experiments showed no significant effect on fecundity and leaf analysis of potted vines treated with Mikal-M indicated no significant difference in total leaf nitrogen compared to untreated control plants. However, the field experiment on the effect of Mikal-M on the population build-up of the leafhopper showed that significantly more leafhoppers occurred on the vines treated with Mikal-M than on those treated with a conventional inorganic fungicide, copper oxychloride. In view of the far-reaching implications this can have on the viticultural industry, further research on the effects of organic fungicides on leafhopper populations is recommended to confirm the generality of these results so that recommendations regarding the use of these fungicides may be made. The question as to why A. lineatifrons became a pest only recently was raised. Three possibilities were considered, namely (1) that A. lineatifrons is a species of tropical origin which moved down the continent and became established in the Western Cape only recently, (2) that is has been in the Western Cape at least as long as the grapevines, but required prolonged exposure to establish itself on the new host and (3) that is has been on the vines for some time, but was noticed only recently when outbreaks occurred. These outbreaks could have been caused by the introduction of organic fungicides or the depletion of natural enemies by insecticides used to control other insects in the vineyards. Due to the lack of evidence this question could not be answered conclusively. Other research priorities that were established are the development of methods for damage assessment and monitoring of leafhopper populations, determining if A. lineatifrons can transmit grapevine virusses, the development of an economic threshold level and the identification of natural enemies of A. lineatifrons to enable the development of efficient pest management strategies (Summary, p. 63 - 65...|$|E
