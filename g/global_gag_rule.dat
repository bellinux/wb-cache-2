2500|$|Sex {{education}} in Africa {{has focused on}} stemming the growing AIDS epidemic. Most governments {{in the region have}} established AIDS education programs in partnership with the World Health Organization and international NGOs. These programs were undercut significantly by the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule,</b> an initiative put in place by President Ronald Reagan, suspended by President Bill Clinton, and re-instated by President George W. Bush. The <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> [...] "...required nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of their receipt of Federal funds that such organizations would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations...." [...] The <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> was again suspended {{as one of the first}} official acts by United States President Barack Obama. The incidences of new HIV transmissions in Uganda decreased dramatically when Clinton supported a comprehensive sex education approach (including information about contraception and abortion).

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> of 1836, its motivations and effects. Enacted in 1836 {{to counter the}} growing vitriol of the slavery debates, it was later repealed in 1844, following sustained controversy. To begin, the essay analyzes the historical context which informed the rule’s enactment, going over the Second Great Awakening {{and its role in}} intensifying the abolitionist movement. It proceeds to examine both the proximate historical explanations for the <b>gag</b> <b>rule,</b> such as recent slave revolts, as well as the more abstract, theoretical arguments concerning how enforced silence can function within democratic legislation. Finally, the essay elucidates the effects of the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> and the factors contributing to its failure and ultimate repeal. It ends on a note regarding the proximate impacts of the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> in antebellum America, and the precedent it set for other “gag rules” in American society...|$|R

Templeman said:We probably all saw the photo of 10 men and a lone woman as the President signed the decree. The irony that this is a decision by men on what rights a woman has is striking. The consequences of this legislation every time a Republican President reinstates it, as George W Bush did, is that women's health clinics close, contraceptive suppliers wither and abortion rates skyrocket. In other words, women and their families suffer. Is that really what these men want? I hope not.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s, many of {{the groups}} {{that made up the}} women's {{movement}} began to evolve in order to adapt to a changing political climate. These groups focused on specific policy issues, such as abortion, and were not composed exclusively of civil society actors. During this same time period, anti-abortion activism was also beginning to gain momentum. The Vatican replaced hundreds of progressive clergy and summarily repressed discussions of reproductive issues. Groups continuing to fight for reproductive rights across the region have faced a strong resistance from the Catholic church as well as the religious right in the United States. Although a majority of countries within the region are officially secular, the church continues to have an extensive influence within the region due to Latin America being the largest Catholic region in the world. The religious right in the United States holds substantial clout over the political right in its own country, which has resulted in the United States banning federal funding for international NGOs. [...] Considerably damaging to groups in Latin America was Ronald Reagan's 1984 <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> which prohibited international organizations receiving US federal funds from performing or promoting abortion as a method of family planning.|$|E

50|$|Adams {{felt that}} he had to {{challenge}} both the country’s acceptance of slavery, but also the House’s adoption of a rule that would limit debate of national issues and issues that were at the forefront of public debate. Adams used his formal legal training to mount an involved attack against the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> and against the movement to limit the congressional discussion of the contentious issue of slavery. At the time, there were a series of <b>gag</b> <b>rules</b> instituted at the urging of several southern members according to the parliamentary requirements of the House. Adams found creative and unique ways to continue challenging these same rules on different grounds and with different tactics.In William Lee Miller’s book, Arguing about Slavery, the author chronicles much of John Quincy Adams’ fight against this censorship of speech on the House floor. Adams engaged his colleagues first by requesting that petitions brought before the institution of the gag order be reviewed. Figuring that the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> could not pertain to items {{brought to the attention of}} the chair prior to its existence, Adams suggested the presentation of those petitions. This request was disallowed, now effectively making the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> a retroactive rule of the House. Adams then, with his colleague from Massachusetts, began to present a series of petitions from other nearby states and states up and down the eastern seaboard, as he was no longer allowed to present petitions from those in his own state. Both he and his colleague also presented petitions from women praying for abolition. Women, as non-voters, were not directly banned from petitioning per the <b>gag</b> <b>rule.</b> All of these parliamentary tricks were in vain, however, as the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> resulted in each being summarily dismissed.|$|R
50|$|He {{refused to}} honor the House’s <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> banning {{discussion}} or debate of the slavery issue. Using unconventional tactics, Adams evaded and ignored the <b>gag</b> <b>rule</b> until his persistence irritated his colleagues {{to the point that}} he was threatened with censure. Although the House never voted to censure Adams, the discussion ignited by his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition, the right to legislative debate, and the morality of slavery.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> in 1984 meant that foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) could not promote or perform abortions {{in order to maintain}} their aid from the United States. Although this policy focuses specifically on abortion, little research exists on the relationship between the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> and contraceptive behavior. Based on women’s contraceptive choice data, this study uses a series of linear and fixed-effects regressions to determine changes in contraceptive behavior from 1990 - 2008 in Peru and Bolivia. Results indicate that during the George W. Bush administration, women had a lower probability of not using contraceptives and a higher probability of using traditional or folkloric methods than they did during the Clinton administration. Furthermore, women’s risk of using tubal ligation was greater during the Clinton years compared to either Bush administration. The results suggest that the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> has real implications for women’s contraceptive use, and that the {{implementation of}} this policy in the future the will likely alter women’s contraceptive choices and behaviors.

40|$|Through the {{implementation}} of the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> the US has gone from being a leader in providing for social development and become a force working against the same cause 1 (Crossette 60). The Gag Rule is limiting women’s resources to health and information concerning reproductive health. It restricts NGOs ’ ability to help people in developing countries by limiting those citizens ’ access to family planning. Furthermore, the Gag Rule applies ideas in developing countries that are not in line with the values of the citizens in the developing countries or the United States. In order to make the US government take responsibility for their actions and repeal the Gag Rule the people who are affected by the Gag Rule need to gain voices in the US.

Part of the explanation is that future health needs are difficult to predict, but it also shows how strong the influence of one donor, i. e. the United States, is in this setup. The landscape of population assistance is a highly volatile one, brought about not only by political issues like the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule,</b> but also issues of collective action design as assistance under the heading of the Millennium Development Goals crowds out family planning.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of holding states or individual decision-makers (criminally) responsible for human rights violations that arise as consequences of aid and trade conditionalities. It identifies the vacuums and possibilities of current international human rights law and points {{out some of the}} strategies that have been used to overcome the prevailing impunity in this area. The paper shows that there currently is a glaring gap between the stated intentions of international cooperation and the mechanisms in place to implement these intentions, and that this gap is biggest when it comes to cases concerning the rights of traditionally marginalized groups, for example women and the poor. Looking at the <b>Global</b> <b>Gag</b> <b>Rule</b> in this light, the paper shows how the reinstatement of this policy in the particular context of Peru has had—or is likely to have in the near future—an exacerbating effect on an already serious public health situation.
