50|$|Shaft-jacking can be minimised by {{devices such}} as {{parallelogram}} swingarms. A practical way to minimise squat on a chain-drive bike is to locate the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> {{as close as possible}} to the axis of the swingarm pivot; the ideal solution is to make the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and the swingarm pivot concentric, as was done on the Hesketh V1000.|$|E

5000|$|The {{so-called}} Triumph Quadrant (aka [...] "Quadrent") was a [...] "bitsa" [...] {{designed and}} built in secret by Doug Hele in 1973. [...] It was a 1,000 cc four-cylinder motorcycle made up from Trident parts (although the camshaft was sourced from outside the factory). Essentially, the fourth cylinder came from grafting on an extra middle crankcase unit; but since the primary chaincase and <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> could not be relocated, the fourth cylinder protruded on the right hand side of the bike. The top speed was reputedly 125 mph.|$|E
50|$|Among modern tractors, {{the high}} <b>drive</b> (elevated <b>sprocket)</b> design {{is unique to}} Caterpillar products. The concept {{originated}} in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated <b>sprocket</b> eliminates the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> system, inclined to frequent failure. This elevated <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> undercarriage was built in modular form; breakdown of the tracks and removal of the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> was much easier. The transmission can {{be removed from the}} rear because of the modular design. As the engine and drivetrain are mounted high in a traditional bulldozer, the half shafts from the differential exit above the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> requiring a small gear {{on the end of the}} half shaft and another, larger one attached to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> The high-drive system eliminates the traditional <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> in favor of the planetary <b>final</b> <b>drive,</b> which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more sprocket, reducing track life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s.|$|R

25|$|Arjun Mark II has a {{total of}} 93 upgrades, {{including}} 13 major improvements. The major upgrades are missile-firing capability against long-range targets, panoramic sight with night vision to engage targets effectively at night, containerisation of the ammunition, enhanced main weapon penetration; additional ammunition types, explosive reactive armour, an advanced air-defence gun to engage helicopters; a mine plough, an advanced land navigation system and a warning system which can fire smoke grenades to confuse laser guidance. Other upgrades are an enhanced Auxiliary power unit providing 8.5 KW (from 4.5 KW) and an improved gun barrel, changes in the commander's panoramic sight with eye safe LRF, night vision capability including for driver, digital control harness, new <b>final</b> <b>drive,</b> track and <b>sprocket.</b> The Arjun Mk.2 has an advanced hydropneumatic suspension system which provides very good comfort to the crew, This tank is also fitted with auxiliary power unit which powers all systems when the main engine is turned off and It can be also fitted with a mine plough.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{consists of}} a multi-plate metal-contact main clutch, a manual gearbox with five forward gears, two planetary two-step steering gears with locking frictions and two <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> groups. The vehicle chassis has six single rubber tired road wheels, a rear <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with detachable sprocket rings (lantern-wheel gear) and one idler wheel per side. The first and fifth left, and sixth right road wheels have hydraulic shock absorbers. The track is 11.904 m long, 382 mm (15") wide and has 93 links.|$|R
5000|$|In 1980, the [...] D9L was introduced. The unit {{featured}} the same {{new type of}} elevated-sprocket undercarriage as {{was used in the}} larger D10. The new undercarriage design reduced strain and shock loads on the <b>final</b> <b>drives</b> and gave the [...] "belly pan" [...] more ground clearance. The elevated-drive-sprocket undercarriage is a modular design. To repair the machines one breaks down the tracks and pulls the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> out. As a result, one can pull the powershift transmission out the rear. The [...] D9N replaced the D8L in 1987.|$|R

5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> idler wheels, track return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or <b>drive</b> wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered wheels between the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] track. The idler picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|R

50|$|The chassis {{needed to}} be {{lengthened}} with addition of an extra road wheel, to give seven each side. The <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> was also moved to the front.|$|R
5000|$|Chassis is same as M110 203 mm {{self-propelled}} howitzer {{with five}} large road wheels on each side, a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> front wheel {{and has no}} track-return rollers.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} system {{was in the}} rear of the vehicle with rear <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The transmission was derived from the ZF of the Panther. The functions of <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> and steering were combined in a single assembly; for each gear two turning radii could be selected. The engine was the Maybach HL295 12-cylinder of 29.5 litres, using fuel injection combined with spark ignition. The project goal was to bring the engine output to 1200 hp, implying a very favourable hp/litre ratio of over forty. This proved to be unrealistically ambitious, given the level of technological development at the time; in reality not even a ratio of thirty was reliably attained. The German mission considered this an embarrassing failure, best forgotten.|$|R
50|$|StuG III Ausf. B: (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940May 1941, 300 {{produced}} by Alkett) Widened tracks (380 mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520 × 79 mm to 520 × 95 mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission {{was changed to}} a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with eight round holes was changed to a new cast <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380 mm tracks or 400 mm wide tracks. 380 mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380 mm tracks.|$|R
50|$|Chain <b>drive</b> uses <b>sprockets</b> and {{a roller}} chain, which {{requires}} both lubrication and adjustment for elongation (stretch) that occurs through wear. The lubricant {{is subject to}} being thrown off the fast-moving chain and results in grime and dirt build up. Chains do deteriorate, and excessive wear {{on the front and}} rear sprockets can be dangerous. In a chain drive the power is transmitted into the real wheel via a cush drive. Conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a chain and sprocket combination constantly changes during revolution ("chordal action"). If a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> rotates at constant RPM, then the chain (and the <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket)</b> must accelerate and decelerate constantly. Most chain-driven motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to eliminate this vibration issue.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of bicycle chains, it is {{possible}} to modify the overall gear ratio of the chain drive by varying the diameter (and therefore, the tooth count) of the sprockets {{on each side of the}} chain. This is the basis of derailleur gears. A multi-speed bicycle, by providing two or three different-sized driving sprockets and up to 11 (as of 2014) different-sized <b>driven</b> <b>sprockets,</b> allows up to 33 different gear ratios. The resulting lower gear ratios make the bike easier to pedal up hills while the higher gear ratios make the bike more powerful to pedal on flats and downhills. In a similar way, manually changing the sprockets on a motorcycle can change the characteristics of acceleration and top speed by modifying the <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> gear ratio.|$|R
50|$|BM Oplot is {{equipped}} with torsion bar type suspension. Either side of the six dual rubber-tyred road wheels are provided with idler at forward, <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the rear, and track support rollers.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} are some non-powered tracked {{transports}} (i.e. trailers that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, Tucker Sno-cat and Mattracks rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks {{in the shape of a}} triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-axle truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic half-track system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.|$|R
5000|$|The M11/39 was {{developed}} as a [...] "breakthrough tank" [...] The design of the M11/39 {{was influenced by the}} British Vickers 6-Ton. This influence is reflected particularly in the track and suspension design. A novelty of the design was the placement of the final reduction gears inside the front-mounted <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> eliminating the need for enlarged <b>final</b> <b>drive</b> housings in the bow armour. Service use of the M11/39 was short due to several deficiencies in its design, particularly the placement of the main 37 mm gun in the hull. The design concept was to use the main gun against other tanks and to defend the tank with the turret armament. The gun was in a fixed position with traverse restricted to 15° to port and starboard. Dual 8 mm machine guns were housed in a small rotating one-man turret, with manual controls.|$|R
5000|$|The Caterpillar D10 is a track-type tractor {{manufactured}} by Caterpillar Inc. (then called the Caterpillar Tractor Company). It {{was the first}} modern tractor to use the elevated <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to improve durability, operator comfort, and ease of maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The tractor's most {{distinctive}} feature was its running gear. Four full height roadwheels acted as roadwheels, rear <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> front idler and track return rollers. This {{was the same}} layout as the Tetrarch light tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs had developed in the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|The WZ-111 {{featured}} a 750 hp supercharged diesel engine and torsion bar suspension system. The idler wheels were in front with <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> in the rear. Many of the suspension components {{were the same}} type used in Soviet heavy tank designs such as the IS-2.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to maintain constant chain tension. This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|R
