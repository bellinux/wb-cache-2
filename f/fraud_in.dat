40|$|Electronic banking frauds are {{becoming}} a global phenomenon in nature, while its consequences {{are becoming}} a great concern for the banks worldwide. This paper tries to investigate the magnitude of online banking <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> Nigerian commercial banks and proffer lasting solutions that will mitigate this contending and boiling issue in the Nigerian banking industry. The paper employs both primary and secondary data in order to investigate the online banking <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> Nigerian banks.

In addition, more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against his players, as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give his players inflated grades they had not earned.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the application of}} forensic auditing <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> control <b>in</b> Nigerian banks. Nigerian banks over the past decades suffered from the menace of frauds which resulted to distresses and liquidations which hamper the roles of banks in the economy. The external auditors failed to detect the <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> the course of carrying out their work. Regulatory evidences have shown that bank frauds increase on daily basis. Analysis {{of the types of}} frauds and forgeries perpetrated show that the most common types are: ATM fraud; fraudulent transfers/withdrawals; internet banking; lodgement of stolen warrants; presentation of forged cheques; suppression of customer deposit. The study analysed the trend <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases from 2001 - 2012, included are the amounts involved <b>in</b> <b>frauds,</b> the most frequent types of fraud, and the losses sustained by banks. The analysis revealed that there are up and down movements <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases. Since banks continually lose huge sums of money {{as a result of the}} inability of the auditors and the supervisory regulators to curtail the trend, there is therefore the need to devise different means of tackling <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> the banks. The study therefore suggests employment of forensic auditing in Nigerian banks by amending the existing statutes, in such a way that forensic auditors are included in the audit team. Through this, auditors will have more tools to effectively deal with challenges in detecting frau...|$|R

5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election <b>fraud.</b> <b>In</b> reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E

The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs.
