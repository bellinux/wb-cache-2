500|$|Gunnel was {{deployed}} {{as part of}} the November 1942 {{invasion of}} French North Africa. Operating conditions for the five submarines sent there were not favorable, due to overcrowded waters, poor weather, and mixed-up signals, and the deployment had no accomplishments. Like many other U.S. submarines, Gunnel was attacked in error by friendly aircraft. The Hooven-Owens-Rentschler (H.O.R.) diesels (known as [...] "whores") which powered Gunnel were troublesome; at one point while returning home, <b>drive</b> <b>gears</b> of all four of the main engines were out of commission, and McCain's crew had to rely on their tiny auxiliary engine for the last [...] Gunnel went into the navy yard for an extensive refit and was replaced on patrol station off North Africa by [...] "Pilly" [...] Lent's [...]|$|E
2500|$|The hedgerow trees {{accepted}} {{today as}} part of the familiar landscape were not planted by farmers for visual effect, they were crops and the wood was used for building and fencing and the millers needed beech or hornbeam wood for mill machinery, in particular for the sacrificial cogs on the main <b>drive</b> <b>gears.</b> It is not generally appreciated how much the Ayrshire landscape has changed its character, for even in 1760–70 the Statistical Account it is stated that [...] "there was no such thing to be seen as trees or hedges in the parish; all was naked and open".|$|E
2500|$|In a Marchant, {{near the}} {{beginning}} of a cycle, the accumulator dials moved downward [...] "into the dip", away from the openings in the cover. They engaged <b>drive</b> <b>gears</b> {{in the body of the}} machine, which rotated them at speeds proportional to the digit being fed to them, with added movement (reduced 10:1) from carries created by dials to their right. At the completion of the cycle, the dials would be misaligned like the pointers in a traditional watt-hour meter. However, as they came up out of the dip, a constant-lead disc cam realigned them by way of a (limited-travel) spur-gear differential. As well, carries for lower orders were added in by another, planetary differential. (The machine shown has 39 differentials in its (20-digit) accumulator!).|$|E
50|$|At this ratio {{it means}} the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> must make 1.62 {{revolutions}} to turn the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> once. It also means that for every one revolution of the driver, the <b>driven</b> <b>gear</b> has made 1/1.62, or 0.62, revolutions. Essentially, the larger gear turns slower.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{example of}} a gear train has two gears. The [...] "input gear" [...] (also known as <b>drive</b> <b>gear)</b> transmits power to the [...] "output gear" [...] (also known as <b>driven</b> <b>gear).</b> The input gear will typically be connected to a power source, such as a motor or engine. In such an example, the output of torque and rotational speed from the output (<b>driven)</b> <b>gear</b> depend on {{the ratio of the}} dimensions of the two gears.|$|R

50|$|Since the {{idler gear}} {{contacts}} directly both the smaller {{and the larger}} gear, it can {{be removed from the}} calculation, also giving a ratio of 42/13≈3.23.

40|$|Abstract. The severe {{global climate}} changes result in {{consecutive}} torrential rains in rainy season, and causes water loss and soil erosion. For an effective water and soil conservation, geotextiles {{are commonly used}} in geotechnical engineering. Geotextiles should able to isolate soil, filter water, and reinforce the soil; therefore, the material for geotextiles should be acid-resistant and alkali-resistant, such as polypropylene (PP) and polyester (PET). This study uses PP fibers as the skin and PET plied yarns as the core to form PP/PET composite tubular knits on a cord knitting machine. The PET plied yarn is fed with a specified tensile strength, and only the tooth number of the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> varies. Mechanical property test results show that a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth increases the tensile strength of the resulting tubular knits; however, with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 35 teeth, the tensile strength decreases. An optimal core coverage occurs with a <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> of 30 teeth...|$|R

40|$|Three {{lead screws}} are {{provided}} for adjusting {{the position of}} a traversing plate. Each of the three lead screws is threaded through a collar that is press fitted through the center of one of three pinion gears. A sun gear meshes with all three pinion gears and transversely moves the three lead screws upon actuation of a <b>drive</b> <b>gear.</b> The <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> meshes with the sun <b>gear</b> and is <b>driven</b> by a handle or servomotor. When the handle or servomotor rotates the <b>drive</b> <b>gear,</b> the sun gear rotates causing the three pinion gears to rotate, thus, causing transverse movement of the three lead screws and, accordingly, transverse movement of the transversing plate. When the <b>drive</b> <b>gear</b> rotates, the traversing plate is driven {{in and out of a}} microwave cavity. Thus, the length or size of the cavity can be tuned while maintaining the traversing plate in an exact parallel relationship with an opposing plate on another end of the cavity...|$|R

5000|$|Novotext is a {{trade name}} for cotton textile-phenolic resin, {{essentially}} cotton-reinforced Bakelite.
