5|$|The 2009 {{version was}} {{released}} for sale September 9, 2008. Symantec set several goals for version 2009 while in development: complete installations under {{minute and a}} footprint of 100 MB. Average installation times range from eight to ten minutes, and the previous 2008 version had a 400 MB footprint. Other goals included reducing load time after the computer starts, from 20â€“30 seconds to 10 seconds, and <b>file</b> <b>scanning</b> times with a technology allowing Norton to skip certain trusted files. The technology works {{on the basis that}} if a piece of software runs on a significant proportion of computers, then it is safe.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} ThinAV, an anti-malware {{system for}} Android that uses pre-existing web-based <b>file</b> <b>scanning</b> ser-vices for malware detection. The goal in developing Thi-nAV {{was to assess}} the feasibility of providing real-time anti-malware scanning over a wide area network where resource limitation is a factor. As a result, our research provides a necessary counterpoint to many of the big-budget, resource-intensive idealized solutions that have been suggested in the area of cloud-based security. The evaluation of ThinAV shows that it functions well over a wide area network, re-sulting in a system which is highly practical for providing anti-malware security on smartphones...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Advanced {{database}} application areas, such {{as computer}} aided design, office automation, digital libraries, data-mining, hypertext and multimedia systems, need to handle complex data structures with set-valued attributes. These information systems contain implicit data {{that will be}} necessary to extract and exploit, by using data mining techniques. To exploit the data from these systems, the choice of appropriate storage structures becomes essential. In this paper, we propose a new compact structure to represent a transactions database, called a signatures tree, to speed up the signature <b>file</b> <b>scanning.</b> The construction of this tree requires only one single access to the transactions database. This tree will be used later to compute maximum support, extract frequent itemsets and generate association rules...|$|E

40|$|Intrroduction: Clinical {{nutrition}} is {{the nutrition}} support therapy provided to patients under medical supervision {{at the hospital}} or home setting. It is a multidisciplinary task performed {{under the control of}} the physician, dietician, pharmacist and nurse. In this study, the changes in the patient admission statistics to the general intensive care unit (GICU), the exitus ratios, decubitus ulcer formation rates, albumin use rates, duration of the hospital stay, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, rate of usege of parenteral and enteral products, and the change in expenses per patient within the first year of activity of the nutrition team in comparison to the previous year was presented. Material and Method: In this study a 6 -bed GICU was used.

40|$|Recently, the {{integration}} of geographical coordinates into a picture has {{become more and more}} popular. Indeed almost all smartphones and many cameras today have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location information in the Exif header when a picture is taken. Although the automatic embedding of geotags in pictures is often ignored by smart phone users as it can lead to endless discussions about privacy implications, these geotags could be really useful for investigators in analysing criminal activity. Currently, there are many free tools as well as commercial tools available in the market that can help computer forensics investigators to cover a wide range of geographic information related to criminal scenes or activities. However, there are not specific forensic tools available to deal with the geolocation of pictures taken by smart phones or cameras. In this paper, we propose and develop an image scanning and mapping tool for investigators. This tool scans all the files in a given directory and then displays particular photos based on optional filters (date, time, device, localisation) on Google Map. The <b>file</b> <b>scanning</b> process is not based on the file extension but its header. This tool can also show efficiently to users if {{there is more than one}} image on the map with the same GPS coordinates, or even if there are images with no GPS coordinates taken by the same device in the same timeline. Moreover, this new tool is portable; investigators can run it on any operating system without any installation. Another useful feature is to be able to work in a read-only environment, so that forensic results will not be modified. We also present and evaluate this tool real world application in this paper...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a multisegmented disk cache processing multiple <b>file</b> <b>scans.</b> Multisegmented caches are designed to support concurrent <b>file</b> <b>scans,</b> which is crucial for providing both intra-query and inter-query parallelism. A multisegmented cache attached to an individual disk usually consists of a constant number of segments. A traditional round-robin segment replacement policy provides satisfactory performance only when the number of scans is limited by the number of segments. We propose a technique that allows estimating dynamically the number of concurrent scans. We introduce several new segment replacement algorithms that adapt a replacement policy and/or a segment size to this estimation. Proposed algorithms turn out to offer better solutions to the disk cache management problem than existing ones. 1 Introduction An important development in disk technology is the use of disk caches. A disk cache is a buffer capable of holding portions of the disk address [...] ...|$|R
