60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. He's {{not going}} to break it to her till they reach <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|E
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. Be quiet, Charles. Now {{listen to}} me, children. Your father is coming <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> [General stupefaction].|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must return}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> Magdalene," [...] the countess said. [...] "He has {{a mission to}} perform, and cannot leave until he does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it not {{a strange}} thing, Halliday," [...] {{he said to his}} comrade, [...] "to see a set of bumpkins sit carousing <b>here</b> <b>this</b> whole <b>evening,</b> without having drank the king's health?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Millet, [...] "that {{reminds me}} that the captain's little girl Rose--Rosebud, as he calls her--is to come <b>here</b> <b>this</b> very <b>evening</b> {{to stay with me}} for a week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Guillot is defiant," [...] Peter replied. [...] "He {{has been}} <b>here</b> only <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> He mocks at me. He swears {{that he will}} bring off this enterprise, {{whatever}} it may be, before midnight to-night, and he has defied me to stop him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] exclaimed Winnifred, {{putting her}} hand to her brow in perplexity, [...] "for me! at this late hour! <b>Here!</b> <b>This</b> <b>evening!</b> In this house?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{shall be}} very sorry to leave you, Ann, but I'm glad I'm {{pulling out of}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Who are all these people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} promise {{to come back}} <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> before it is quite dark;--you and Dr. Bretton, both, in the carriage? It is not fit to ride." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] {{she began}} hesitatingly, [...] "that {{it would be}} more cheerful for you in <b>here,</b> <b>this</b> stormy <b>evening.</b> I thought you might like to put your wet things to dry in the kitchen, and we could sit here together, after supper, alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 51 P. di Spagna, Oct. 30, ’66.—The Clarendons {{are to be}} <b>here</b> [...] <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> to {{stay for}} a {{fortnight}} or three weeks. Dean and Lady [...] A. Stanley are in the house with us. I doubt if there are any [...] other English parties in Rome.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish {{to speak}} to you, sir,' said Bella, 'once for all, and I don't {{know how to do}} it. I have sat <b>here</b> all <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> wishing {{to speak to}} you, and {{determining}} to speak to you, and feeling that I must. I beg for a moment's time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{carry the}} monkey home, an' get your supper, for you'll {{want to come}} down <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> an' you won't have time if you don't go now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I expect you'll find me <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> if {{you care}} to come. You'll find this about {{the best place for}} getting {{dyspepsia}} at the lowest cost in the Quarter." ...|$|E
6000|$|We arrived <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> I {{left the}} cars {{with my head}} full of the cathedral. The first thing I saw, on lifting my eyes, was a brown spire. Said I,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{can get you}} a tug. My brother {{tells me}} the Atlin is coming across from Victoria and should be <b>here</b> early <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> He {{has gone back to}} the office to secure her for you, though she was fixed to go off for a lumber boom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An annuity--a sum {{of money}} paid to you yearly or {{quarterly}} through my solicitors, and which you can consider as a gift from your sister. The conditions are such as I think you will recognize the justice of. I wish to prevent a repetition of any such errand as I presume you have come <b>here</b> upon <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> I cannot have my wife distressed or worried." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} I will trouble {{you to come}} <b>here</b> again <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> There will be a fast train going through with {{ammunition}} for Lee at ten o'clock, and I shall have a bag of dispatches for him, which I will trouble you to deliver. You will find me here {{up to the last}} moment. I will give orders that a horse-box be attached to the train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary, {{there is}} news {{that she will}} be glad to hear--Miss Wyvil is coming <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Will you excuse my asking if Miss Emily has had medical advice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, mother," [...] said Rosie, [...] "let us come up <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> after dark, {{and then}} {{on the top of the}} mountain, instead of smoke coming out, we shall see fire." ...|$|E
60|$|ABSOLUTE Briefly, I have deceived your aunt--I was {{informed}} that my new rival was to visit <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> and contriving to have him kept away, have passed myself on her for Captain Absolute.|$|E
6000|$|... "What you are," [...] Rochester said, leaning {{a little}} {{down from his}} horse, [...] "you know and I know. Let that be enough. Only {{remember}} that {{there comes a time}} when threats cease, and actions commence. And as sure as you and I are met <b>here</b> together <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> Saton, I tell you that if you offend again in this matter, I shall punish you. You understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but {{the fact}} is that Miss Nevil had talked of coming <b>here</b> with me <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> to see you on her own affairs, and it wouldn't have been exactly the thing for her to meet that woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we gotta hike," [...] {{announced}} Billy. [...] "It won't {{never be}} safe for {{none of you}} <b>here</b> after <b>this,</b> not <b>even</b> if you do think Villa's your friend--which he ain't the friend of no American." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why did you}} {{not bring}} Ian Macdonald along with you, Vic?" [...] he asked. [...] "I expect his father <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> from Fort Garry, where he went {{in the morning for}} some pemmican." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I need {{scarcely}} {{say that}} I {{did not ask}} you to meet me <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> to tell you this," [...] he continued. [...] "My object is a different one. I have a confession to make." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Off the Start, Sir; {{two hours}} after--after she left <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> I believe. My orders are {{to report to}} you for the {{manoeuvre}} signal-codes, and join Commander Hignett's flotilla, which is in attendance on Stiletto." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I arrived <b>here</b> from Dumfries <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> after a ride {{of about}} 30 {{miles in the}} most romantic country the mind can conceive. Yesterday Burns the Ayrshire Poet dined with me; and few evenings of my life passed away more to my satisfaction." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} has greatly changed," [...] the Doctor said. [...] "That was really what I came in <b>here</b> for <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> rather than {{to talk about this}} Sepoy business. I am sorry to say, Bathurst, that when he was in at the Major's today your name {{happened}} to be mentioned, and he said at once, 'Is that the Bathurst who they say showed the white feather at Chillianwalla and left the army in consequence?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Holy priest, {{there can}} be no {{deception}} <b>here!</b> <b>This</b> dear child <b>even</b> looks like her wronged grandmother! and my heart tells me she is mine. I know not whether to consider this discovery a good or an evil at this late hour, coming as it does to a dying man!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{we are in}} Grosvenor Square," [...] the Prince answered. [...] "I {{forgot to}} tell you that we have a meeting {{arranged}} for <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> Permit me." [...] But Lucille resumed her seat in the carriage.|$|E
6000|$|He did {{not pursue}} his inquiry into her condition, but said, with an {{irrelevant}} cheerfulness that piqued her, [...] "I was coming <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> at any rate, and I got your {{message on the}} way up from my office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because Mr. Culvain {{was in that}} crowd," [...] {{she told}} him. [...] "Mr. Culvain has been looking for you everywhere. It is only to see you that he came <b>here</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> My uncle is anxious {{to talk with you}} first." ...|$|E
60|$|While we loiter <b>here</b> <b>this</b> autumn <b>evening,</b> {{looking for}} a spot retired enough, where we shall quietly rest to-night, they thus, in that chilly March evening, one hundred and forty-two years before us, with wind and current favoring, have already glided out of sight, not to camp, as we shall, at night, but while two sleep one will manage the canoe, and the swift stream bear them onward to the settlements, it may be, even to old John Lovewell's house on Salmon Brook to-night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} from my father," [...] he said. [...] "Business obliges him to leave Frizinghall for London to-day, and he proposes coming on <b>here,</b> either <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> or to-morrow. I must tell him what has {{happened}} between Rachel and me. His heart is set on our marriage--there will be great difficulty, I fear, in reconciling him to the breaking-off of the engagement. I must stop him, for all our sakes, from coming here till he IS reconciled. Best and dearest of friends, we shall meet again!" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{neighborhood}} is situated {{at one of}} important enter points of the city, and the main access to the E75 highway to Belgrade is located <b>here.</b> <b>This</b> fact is <b>even</b> reflected {{in the name of}} the neighborhood, as it was named per gate that looks towards Belgrade. The main city bus station is located in this area as well.|$|R
