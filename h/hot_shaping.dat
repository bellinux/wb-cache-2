40|$|This {{project was}} aimed at <b>hot</b> <b>shaping</b> of {{titanium}} carbide/graphite and vanadium carbide/graphite composite materials by heating them to above 2000 degrees celsius and pressing into an electrographite die. The sample {{was to be a}} preformed cylinder of powdered graphite mixed with powdered titanium or vanadium, lightly sintered. The preform would be heated in a hot press and the titanium or vanadium would react with some of the graphite to form titanium or vanadium carbide. The remaining (excess) graphite would form a composite with the carbide, and this could then be deformed plastically at temperatures well below the onset of plasticity in pure graphite. There were to be two major thrusts in the research: In the first, an electron beam furnace at Sandia Laboratory was to be used for rapid heating of the sample, which would then be transferred into the press. The second thrust was to be entirely at Alabama A and M University, and here they intended to use a heated, controlled atmosphere press to forge the graphite/carbide preforms at a steady temperature and measure their viscosity as a function of temperature. This report discusses the progress made on this project...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedDevelopment of a procedure {{to model the}} <b>hot</b> <b>shape</b> of a rotor blade and a comparison analysis of the transonic axial splittered rotor (TASR), tandem stator (TS) stage has been investigated. The ability to implement this procedure into the current Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Turbopropulsion Lab (TPL) design procedure that uses commercial off the shelf software has been documented. The TS stage was tested at multiple clocking positions over the full speed range of the rotor. The best performance was observed at a negative 10 percent clocking position relative to the design configuration. Numerical simulations were conducted of both hot and cold rotor shapes and compared. This study advanced the understanding of simulating the <b>hot</b> <b>shape</b> of a rotor to better match the results of experimental data. The <b>hot</b> <b>shape</b> results closely resembled that of the cold shape results; however, the <b>hot</b> <b>shape</b> achieved a greater mass flow range. The procedure developed is easily implemented, utilizing a fluid-structure interaction. Rotational forces as well as gas loading forces were observed as an influence on blade deformation. Utilizing the procedure to model the <b>hot</b> <b>shape</b> of the rotor will be essential in deriving numerical results for a comparative analysis. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the strain {{response}} of Ni-Ti-Cu shape memory alloy (SMA) wire actuators on thermo-mechanical cycling (TMC). The characteristics of the actuators such as austenite (<b>hot</b> <b>shape)</b> remnant deformation and recovery strain undergo changes upon TMC. These changes are significant in the initial few cycles and the properties of SMA tend to reach a steady state on further cycling. It is believed that TMC induces defects in the microstructure and stabilizes the martensite/austenite phase. These in turn result in continuous change in strain response with the progress of TMC. It {{has been shown that}} for a stable strain response, the wire actuators need to be subjected to TMC at a higher stress than the working stress prior to application. Experiments were also conducted in order to minimize the number of TMC required for achieving stable strain response. [All rights reserved Elsevier...|$|R
40|$|To {{support the}} glass façade {{of a recent}} {{building}} extension to the previously existing structure, two 2. 7 m long transparent struts have been designed. These will replace the steel struts that are currently in place. The tubular struts consist of a unique hybrid of an outer acrylic tube and an inner tube of borosilicate glass, transferring both compressive and tensile forces {{without the use of}} steel parts. The acrylic tube is the primary load carrying element, making the element much less sensitive to incidental damage, whereas the glass tube inside prevents buckling. The glass tube was welded together to obtain the required length. The ends of the tube were <b>hot</b> <b>shaped</b> according to a custom design to create opportunities to connect the tube to acrylic head pieces.

40|$|AbstractThe {{numerical}} {{modeling of}} <b>hot</b> <b>shape</b> rolling of steel billet {{is represented by}} using a meshless Radial Basis function Collocation Method (RBFCM). The physical model consists of coupled thermal and mechanical models. Both models are solved through a strong formulation. The material in the present formulation is assumed to behave elastic or ideally plastic. The model decomposes the 3 D geometry of the steel billet into a traveling 2 D cross section which lets us analyze the large shape reductions by a sequence of small steps. Homogeneous compression and a uniform velocity over each of the cross-sections are assumed. A meshless method, based on collocation with radial basis functions, is proposed to solve the thermo-mechanical problem. The nodal distribution is adapted by Transfinite Interpolation (TFI) and Elliptic Node Generation (ENG) at each deformation step to the new form of the billet. The solution is calculated in terms of temperatures and displacements at each node. A simple benchmark solution is compared with FEM based commercial code DEFORM. A good agreement is found between the RBFCM and the commercial code DEFORM...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} and lifetime of a shape memory device is characterised by the changes of its transformation temperatures, its cold <b>shape,</b> its <b>hot</b> <b>shape,</b> its global two way shape memory effect, its recovery stress. This global behaviour {{is influenced by}} a complex combination of internal and external parameters. Internal parameters are : the alloy system, the alloy composition, the type of transformation and the lattice structure including defects. External parameters are : the thermomechanical treatments, the way of training, the applied stress, the imposed shape memory strain, the amplitude of temperature cycling, the absolute temperature of the environment. The possible physical mechanisms which are at {{the origin of the}} limited lifetime of any shape memory element and which are, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, controlled by the above mentioned internal and external parameters, are : the stabilisation of specific martensite variants, the creation of lattice defects during transformation-cycling (transformation plasticity or defects that could trigger unwanted variants), changes in the order of the lattice, changes in defect density and/or defect configuration as a result of ageing.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{the idea of using}} {{partially}} restrained connections in building structures has become more practical and economical. Partially restrained connections resist moment and also allow rotation, therefore distributing the moments and stresses more evenly throughout the element. Combining this idea with steel joists, which are also quite common in construction, makes for shallower story heights and lower steel weights. This initial study analyzes partially restrained connections for both <b>hot</b> rolled <b>shapes</b> and steel joists using non-composite and composite construction. The designs are than compared with respect to complexity, practicality, serviceability and economics.

40|$|We present Chandra {{observations}} of two nearby radio galaxies in group environments, 3 C 285 and 3 C 442 A. The host galaxies of both sources {{are involved in}} mergers with nearby massive galaxies, and the hot gas in the systems is extended along lines joining the interacting galaxies. Both sources show strong evidence for interactions between the radio lobes and the asymmetrical hot gas. We argue that the structure in the hot gas is independent {{of the existence of}} the radio lobes in these systems, and argue that <b>hot</b> gas <b>shaped</b> by an ongoing massive galaxy merger may {{play an important role in}} the dynamics of radio lobes in other objects. For 3 C 442 A, our observations show that gas is being driven out of both members of the host interacting galaxy pair, and the implied constraints on galaxy velocities are consistent with mildly supersonic motions with respect to the group-scale hot gas. The previously known filamentary radio structure in the center of 3 C 442 A may be a result of the interaction between hot gas expelled from these galaxies and pre-existing radio-emitting plasma. In 3 C 285, where there is no ongoing galaxy merger, the powerful radio source is probably having a significant effect on the energetics of the host group. Comment: 43 pages, 8 figures.
