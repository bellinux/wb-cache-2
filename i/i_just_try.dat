500|$|The {{relationship}} between Maria Theresa and Joseph {{was not without}} warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed. Despite his intellect, Maria Theresa's force of personality often made Joseph cower. Sometimes, she openly admired his talents and achievements, but criticised him behind his back. She wrote: [...] "We never see each other except at dinner ... His temper gets worse every day ... Please burn this letter ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> to avoid public scandal." [...] In another letter, also addressed to Joseph's companion, she complained: [...] "He avoids me ... I am {{the only person in}} his way and so I am an obstruction and a burden ...

500|$|The episode {{marks the}} first {{appearance}} of Marceline, {{one of the main}} characters in Adventure Time.

[...] In an interview with Chun, Guerrero discussed the concept and title, stating [...] "It's just this funny idea I had, {{growing up in the}} city – it's so diverse.

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>try</b> to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go.
