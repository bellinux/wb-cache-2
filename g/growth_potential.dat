Additionally, the Danish Design Centre published an Evaluation of the Importance of Design in 2006, with the result that most companies considered design as a promoter for innovation (71%), as a <b>growth</b> <b>potential</b> for the company (79%), and to make products more user friendly (71%). With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also becomes more important.|$|E
5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast <b>growth</b> <b>potential</b> of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering environmental movement {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed.

30|$|A {{common mistake}} in {{macroeconomic}} analysis that may potentially lead to misguided policies is to confuse demand factors {{of economic growth}} with supply factors. As far as the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate is concerned, demand factors can only influence the difference, i.e., growth gap, between the real growth rate and the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate. A strong short-term demand can push the real <b>growth</b> rate beyond <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> capacity, while inadequate demand can cause real growth to fall short of <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> capacity. However, the <b>potential</b> of economic <b>growth</b> ultimately depends on the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate, which is constrained by production factors {{on one hand and}} TFP on the other. Therefore, without an increase to the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate, expanding demand arbitrarily in order to spur economic growth may cause real economic growth to exceed the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate, which may also lead to distortion.|$|R
50|$|Alternative modernity is a {{conceptual}} tool conventionally {{used to represent}} the state of present western society. Modernity represents {{the political and social}} structures of the society, the sum of interpersonal discourse, and ultimately a snapshot of society's direction at a point in time. Unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society. Also, this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world. Problems can be summarized into two elements: inward failure to analyze <b>growth</b> <b>potentials</b> of a given society, and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their <b>growth</b> <b>potentials.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{response}} to possible slowdown of the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate, authorities {{will have a}} number of options. They may spare no effort to achieve a real growth rate higher than the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate or they may change the <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rate via policies. Either option will generate different results of economic results.|$|R
5|$|In 2003, Stardock {{released}} {{a remake of}} Galactic Civilizations, which was praised by reviewers who saw the game {{as a replacement for}} the Master of Orion series. In 2004 the Creative Assembly released the critically acclaimed , which has spawned many sequels. Civilization IV was {{released a}}t the end of 2005 and was considered the PC game of the year according to several reviewers, including GameSpot and GameSpy. It is now considered one of the greatest computer games in history, having been ranked the second-best PC game of all time by IGN. By 2008, the Civilization series had sold over eight million copies, followed the release of Civilization Revolution for game consoles soon after, Civilization V in 2010, and Civilization VI in 2016. Meanwhile, Stardock released , which was considered the sixth-best PC game of 2006 by GameSpy. Additionally, French developer Amplitude Studios released both Endless Space and Endless Legend. These successes have led Stardock's Brad Wardell to assert that 4X games have excellent <b>growth</b> <b>potential,</b> particularly among less hardcore players. This is in addition to the loyal base of 4X gamers who have supported free software releases such as Freeciv, FreeCol, Freeorion, Golden Age of Civilizations, and C-evo.|$|E

30|$|Most of the methodologies {{to obtain}} trend growth rates {{are based in}} the concept of <b>potential</b> <b>growth.</b> In most of the cases, <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> is {{estimated}} in the production function framework, through a traditional Phillips curve linking the evolution of the unemployment rate to inflation. Therefore, these estimates of <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> focus on one particular imbalance: inflation. As long as inflation has not responded to output developments in the last expansionary period, that <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> displayed a statistically significant correlation with other indicators of imbalances, and ex-post revision of these <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> rates are substantial, a reassessment of sustainable growth rates, filtering out the imbalances that the economy incur in the expansionary phases, is granted.|$|R
30|$|Although not shown, these {{correlations}} diminish significantly when ex-post <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> {{estimates are}} considered instead of real-time estimates. This suggests <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> {{tends to be}} revised substantially ex-post when {{the fallout from the}} imbalances is reflected in a correction of the activity. However, for some imbalances the correlations with ex-post <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> continue to be significant, implying that more than additional information on the GDP behavior is necessary in order to filter out imbalances from <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> estimations. That said, this is not only an end point problem associated to the two-sided nature of most of the statistical filters used to estimate <b>potential</b> <b>growth,</b> it is a problem of taking into account all the information required to properly identify the maximum growth compatible with balanced growth.|$|R

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that hypoxic stimulation enhances <b>growth</b> <b>potentials</b> of canine lymphoma cells by activating hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α), {{and that the}} hypoxia-activated prodrug (TH- 302) inhibits <b>growth</b> <b>potentials</b> in the cells. We investigated how hypoxic culture affects the growth rate, chemoresistance, and invasiveness of canine lymphoma cells and doxorubicin (DOX) -resistant lymphoma cells, and influences of TH- 302 on survival rate of the cells under hypoxic conditions. Our results demonstrated that hypoxic culture upregulated the expression of HIF- 1 α and its target genes, including ATP-binding cassette transporter B 1 (ABCB 1), ATP-binding cassette transporter G 2 (ABCG 2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and survivin, and enhanced the growth rate, DOX resistance, and invasiveness of the cells. Additionally, TH- 302 decreased the survival rate of the cells under hypoxic condition. Our studies suggest that hypoxic stimulation may advance the tumorigenicity of canine lymphoma cells, favoring malignant transformation. Therefore, the data presented {{may contribute to the}} development of TH- 302 -based hypoxia-targeting therapies for canine lymphoma...|$|R
40|$|This article aims at {{evaluating}} <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> for France, Germany and {{the euro}} area {{during the period}} from after the 2007 - 2008 credit crisis until 2012.

After presenting the possible effects of the crisis on <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> identified by the literature, we use for our evaluations an unobserved component model. This helps to reconcile the so-called traditional approaches, based on the use of a production function and the statistical approaches based on filtering methods. Our evaluations show for the different areas that the crisis has had a significant impact on <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> starting in 2009; by 2012, <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> should remain weak. The low <b>potential</b> <b>growth</b> is caused in part by a sharp decline in labor input, particularly in France and the euro area.
