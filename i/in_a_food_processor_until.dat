5000|$|Burmese tofu (တိုဖူး; [...] or [...] ) is <b>a</b> <b>food</b> of Shan origin, {{made from}} water and flour ground from yellow split peas and the Burmese version of {{chickpea}} flour, {{also known as}} besan flour, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fashion similar to polenta. The flour is mixed with water, turmeric, and a little salt and heated, stirring constantly, until it reaches a creamy consistency. It is then transferred into a tray and allowed to set. It can also be made using dried chickpea instead of processed flour. In this process, dried chickpeas are soaked overnight. Once the peas have been re-hydrated, they are pureed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> {{with some of the}} liquid used to soak the peas, then allowed to set for a couple of hours. Much of the top layer of clear liquid is then skimmed off and the remaining puree is brought to a boil with turmeric and salt and cooked and set {{in the same manner as}} the version using chickpea flour. It is matte yellow in colour, jelly-like but firm in consistency, and does not crumble when cut or sliced. It may be eaten fresh as a salad or deep fried. It may also be sliced and dried to make crackers for deep frying. Despite the name, Burmese tofu is unrelated to Chinese tofu, which is made from soy milk with added coagulants.|$|R
40|$|For {{efficient}} handling, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi {{should be}} processed into small and uniform inocula; however, processing {{can reduce the}} inoculum density. In this article we describe the preparation and use of sheared-root inocula of Glomus spp. in which inoculum densities were increased during processing. Our objectives were to determine inoculum viability and density after shearing and to ascertain if the sheared inocula could be pelletized or used with a gel carrier. Root samples were harvested from aeroponic cultures, blotted dry, cut into 1 -cm lengths, and sheared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> for up to 80 s. After shearing, the inoculum was washed over sieves, and the propagule density in each fraction was determined. Sheared inocula were also encapsulated in carrageenan or used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gel carrier. Shearing aeroponically produced root inocula reduced particle size. Propagule density increased with decreasing size fraction down to a size of 63 μm, after which propagule density decreased. The weighted-average propagule density of the inoculum was 135, 380 propagules g (dry weight) of sheared root material- 1. Sheared roots were encapsulated successfully in carrageenan, and the gel served as an effective carrier. Aeroponic root inoculum was stored dry at 4 °C for 23 months without significant reduction in propagule density; however, this material was not appropriate for shearing. Moist roots, useful for shearing, began to lose propagule density after 1 month of storage. Shearing {{proved to be an}} excellent method to prepare viable root inocula of small and uniform size, allowing for more efficient and effective use of limited inoculum supplies...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate physicochemical stability of processed cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. cv. Fradel) and maple pea (Pisum sativum var. arvense L. cv. Bruno) spreads at 5 °C temperature during 62 -day storage. Physicochemical stability of pulse spreads was compared after sous vide treatment (80 °C/ 15 min) and high pressure processing (700 MPa/ 10 min/ 20 °C). Pulse spreads were made by homogenizing cooked pulses <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> together with salt, citric acid, oil, and bruschetta seasoning. A total of four different pulse spreads were studied: Cowpea spread without and with seasoning, maple pea spread without and with seasoning. Transparent PA/PE and light proof PET/ALU/PA/PP film pouches were used for packaging of pulse spreads under vacuum. The parameters investigated were pH, water activity and mass losses. Pulse spreads were tested on days 0, 15, 29, 42, 50, 57 and 62. The results showed that sous-vide treatment and high pressure processing had an insignificant influence on pH, water activity and mass losses after processing, irrespective of packaging material did not change (p> 0. 1). pH and water activity of sous-vide treated and high pressure processed pulse spreads in different packaging materials proved to be stable throughout the storage. Mass losses during storage accounted to 0. 1 % losses. Chosen sous-vide treatment and high pressure processing regimes and packaging materials are suitable to maintain consistent physicochemical quality of the new products during 62 -day storage...|$|R
40|$|Photolithography is a {{technique}} used to deposit metals onto substrates in specific patterns.

When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor beating egg whites to frothy soft peaks.

40|$|The total soluble {{solids content}} (TSSC) shows high {{positive}} correlation with sugars content, and therefore is generally accepted {{as an important}} quality trait of fruits.

This evaluation is labor-intensive and {{takes a long time to}} complete. An alternative process was delineated for obtaining the juice: the pulp of the fruit slice would be transversally cut one or more times, and longitudinally pressed by hand to obtain the juice. The objective of this work was to compare processes for obtaining juice to evaluate TSSC in melons. Fifty, 15, and 15 fruits of the Galia, Yellow, and Cantaloupe type melons were evaluated, respectively. Each fruit was considered as a block, and was longitudinally split into six fractions with similar sizes, which corresponded to the plots. The following treatments were evaluated: fraction without cuts, fractions with one, three, five, or seven transversal cuts, and the fraction treated by the conventional process. It was concluded that the procedure by which the melon slices of Galia, Yellow and Cantaloupe types are pressed for obtaining the juice to evaluate TSSC can overestimate this content. This would probably be due to the fact that the most internal section of the mesocarp presents greater TSSC than the portions closer to the epicarp...|$|R
40|$|A typical {{computer}} user {{deals with}} a large variety of documents, such as text files, spreadsheets, and web pages. The applications for constructing and modifying these documents are called editors (e. g. text editors, spreadsheet applications, and HTML editors). Despite the apparent differences between editors, the core editing behavior, whether performed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> word-processor or a spreadsheet, is largely similar: document fragments may be copied and pasted, and new parts of the document may be constructed by selecting from menus or entering text. Proxima is a generic editor suitable for {{a large number of}} document types. Similar to the way <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> can replace several different appliances, a generic editor can replace several different editors. A generic editor offers a number of advantages. For instance, instead of having lots of specialized editors, there is only a single application with a uniform user interface. But the most important advantage is that building an editor for a new document type requires {{only a fraction of the}} effort compared to conventional methods. This is especially useful for building editors for XML documents. In spite of the advantages, generic editors are not in widespread use. Existing editors often only allow a user to edit the internal structure of the document, which is experienced as restrictive. More user friendly are presentation-oriented editors, which allow the presentation of the document on the screen to be directly manipulated. However, these editors are only applicable to a limited class of (mainly textual) document types. In contrast, Proxima offers presentation-oriented editing on complex graphical presentations, which may contain derived values. An important aspect of Proxima is its layered architecture. The problem of offering presentation-oriented editing behavior is thereby split up in several simpler subproblems. The thesis describes the design and the architecture of Proxima, and contains a formal specification of the editor. A prototype of Proxima has been implemented in the functional language Haskell. Although the prototype is still <b>in</b> <b>a</b> preliminary state, it is already straightforward to instantiate editors for complex documents. The resulting editors are powerful, yet easy to use...|$|R

Moreover, a second portion of raw milk cheese was decrusted and cut into cubes. After addition of water and spiking with a solution of SEA, the sample was homogenised using a high-speed grinder (Ultra-Turrax). The cheese slurry was freeze-dried, cryogenically milled and mixed with blank cheese powder to obtain the two SEA-containing materials at SEA target levels of 0. 1 and 0. 25 ng/g cheese, respectively (IRMM- 359 b, IRMM- 359 c). Between unit-homogeneity was quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. The minimum sample intake is 15. 1 g cheese powder (representing 25 g of cheese after reconstitution) per replicate analysis (n= 5), as stipulated in Commission Regulation 1441 / 2007, and therefore no dedicated study on the minimum sample intake was performed. The reference material was characterised <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interlaboratory comparison of laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025 and using the European Screening Method with the VIDAS SET 2 and the Ridascreen SET Total for detection (further on named ESM/VIDAS and ESM/Ridascreen, respectively) [4]. Technically invalid results were removed, but no outlier was eliminated on statistical grounds only. Certified values are reported as probability of detection and expressed as either diagnostic specificity (ratio of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives) for the blank material, or diagnostic sensitivity (ration of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives) for the SEA-containing materials. Uncertainties for homogeneity and stability were estimated, but not used for an uncertainty budget {{due to the nature}} of the certified values (presence/absence certification).
