40|$|Functional {{morphology}} of the penicillate podia of the burrowing echinoid Echinocardium cordatum (Echinodermata). Phyllopodes and preapical podia are the {{two main}} types of penicillate podia of Echinocardium cordatum. They basically consist of an extensible shaft topped by a disc with slender digitate extensions. Phyllopodes are food-collecting podia; their disc surfaces are covered by densely packed club-shaped <b>digitations.</b> Preapical podia build up the burrow's funnel and undertake the maintenance of its wall; their disc surfaces are flat with blunt-tiped <b>digitations</b> located at the disc margin. A thick and well innervated glandular epiderm occurs either {{at the tip of}} the <b>digitations</b> (phyllopodes) or on the whole disc surface and the inner side of <b>digitations</b> (preapical podia). It is suggested that these particular epidermal areas could produce adhesive/de-adhesive secretions that would facilitate sediment handling by penicillate podia...|$|R

50|$|A streak {{commonly}} {{starts at}} a single point (apex) high on the slope. The apex {{is often associated with}} an isolated small ridge, knob, or other area of local steepening. In high-resolution images, a tiny impact crater is sometimes visible at the apex. Slope streaks widen downslope from the apex in a triangular fashion, usually reaching their maximum widths short of the halfway point of their lengths. A single slope streak can split into two separate streaks around an obstacle or form an anastamosing (braided) pattern. (See D and E in Photo Gallery.) Slope streaks commonly develop multiple fingers (<b>digitation)</b> at their downslope ends.Images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on MRO have shown that many slope streaks have relief, contrary to earlier descriptions in which no topographic distinction could be seen between the streaked and adjacent, non-streaked surface.

50|$|The first rib (the topmost one) is {{the most}} curved and usually the {{shortest}} of all the ribs; it is broad and flat, its surfaces looking upward and downward, and its borders inward and outward. The head is small and rounded, and possesses only a single articular facet, for articulation with {{the body of the}} first thoracic vertebra. The neck is narrow and rounded. The tubercle, thick and prominent, is placed on the outer border. It bears a small facet for articulation with the transverse process of T1. There is no angle, but at the tubercle the rib is slightly bent, with the convexity upward, so that the head of the bone is directed downward. The upper surface of the body is marked by two shallow grooves, separated from each other by a slight ridge prolonged internally into a tubercle, the scalene tubercle, for the attachment of the anterior scalene; the anterior groove transmits the subclavian vein, the posterior the subclavian artery and the lowest trunk of the brachial plexus. Behind the posterior groove is a rough area for the attachment of the medial scalene. The under surface is smooth, and without a costal groove. The outer border is convex, thick, and rounded, and at its posterior part gives attachment to the first <b>digitation</b> of the serratus anterior. The inner border is concave, thin, and sharp, and marked about its center by the scalene tubercle. The anterior extremity is larger and thicker than that of any of the other ribs.|$|E
50|$|The second rib is {{the second}} {{uppermost}} rib in humans or second most frontal in animals that walk on four limbs. In humans the second rib {{is defined as a}} true rib since it connects with the sternum through the intervention of the costal cartilage anteriorly (at the front). Posteriorly, the second rib is connected with the vertebral column by the second thoracic vertebra. The second rib is much longer than the first rib, but has a very similar curvature. The non-articular portion of the tubercle is occasionally only feebly marked. The angle is slight, and situated close to the tubercle. The body is not twisted, so that both ends touch any plane surface upon which it may be laid; but there is a bend, with its convexity upward, similar to, though smaller than that found in the first rib. The body is not flattened horizontally like that of the first rib. Its external surface is convex, and looks upward and a little outward; near the middle of it is a rough eminence for the origin of {{the lower part of the}} first and the whole of the second <b>digitation</b> of the serratus anterior; behind and above this is attached the posterior scalene. The internal surface, smooth, and concave, is directed downward and a little inward: on its posterior part there is a short costal groove between the ridge of the internal surface of the rib and the inferior border. It contains the intercostal veins and arteries and intercostal nerve.|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIIntroduction and {{hypothesis}} Obstructed defecation is {{a common}} symptom complex in urogynaecological patients, and perineal, vaginal and/or anal <b>digitation</b> may required for defecation. Translabial ultrasound {{can be used to}} assess anorectal anatomy, similar to defecation proctography. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the association between different forms of <b>digitation</b> (vaginal, perineal and anal) and abnormal posterior compartment anatomy. Methods A total of 271 patients were analysed in a retrospective study utilising archived ultrasound volume datasets. Symptoms of obstructed defecation (straining at stool, incomplete bowel emptying, perineal, vaginal and anal <b>digitation)</b> were ascertained on interview. Postprocessing of stored 3 D/ 4 D translabial ultrasound datasets obtained on maximal Valsalva was used to diagnose descent of the rectal ampulla, rectocoele, enterocoele and rectal intussusception at a later date, blinded to all clinical data. Results <b>Digitation</b> was reported by 39 % of our population. The position of the rectal ampulla on Valsalva was associated with perineal (p= 0. 02) and vaginal (p= 0. 02) <b>digitation.</b> The presence of a true rectocoele was significantly associated with perineal (p= 0. 04) and anal (p= 0. 03) <b>digitation.</b> Rectocoele depth was associated with all three forms of <b>digitation</b> (P= 0. 005 – 0. 02). The bother of symptoms of obstructed defecation was strongly associated with <b>digitation</b> (all P<= 0. 001), with no appreciable difference in bother among the three forms. Conclusion <b>Digitation</b> is common, and all forms of <b>digitation</b> are associated with abnormal posterior compartment anatomy. It may not be necessary to distinguish between different forms of <b>digitation</b> in clinical practice...|$|E

Similar kind of displacement was noted in all the sutures except in intranasal suture which showed a superior displacement in RME model. Similar results were postulated in the study of Ghonemia et al [30] who showed insignificant increase in width of the suture. The reason behind this less displacement in fronto-zygomatic suture is increased <b>digitation</b> and rigidity.|$|E

40|$|The GABAergic {{innervation}} of the goldfish pituitary was {{studied at}} the light and electron microscope levels by means of radioautography after in vitro incubation in tritiated γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and immunocytochemistry using antibodies against GABA. Following incubation of pituitary fragments in a medium containing tritiated GABA, a selective uptake of the tracer was observed within the <b>digitations</b> of the neurohypophysis. Silver grain clusters were also observed in the adenohypophyseal tissue. At the electon microscope level, this uptake was found to correspond to nerve endings containing small clear and dense-core vesicles. These labeled profiles were located mainly in neurohypophyseal <b>digitations</b> in close apposition with the baement membrane separating the neurohypophysis from the adenohypophysis. However, they were also encountered {{in direct contact with}} most adenohypophyseal cell types in the different lobes. These results were confirmed by immunocytochemical data demonstrating the presence of numerous GABA immunoreactive fibers in both anterior and neurointermediate lobes. They were found either in the <b>digitations</b> of the neurohypophysis or in the adenohypophysis in direct contact with the glandular cells with a distribution and an ultrastructural aspect similar to those observed by radioautography. These data demonstrate that the pituitary of teleosts receives a massive GABAergic innervation. Although physiological data providing a functional significance for such an innervation are lacking, the present study suggests that, as already documented in mammals, GABA may be involved in the neuroendocrine regulation of pituitary functions in teleosts...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{determine}} if ultrahigh-field-strength magnetic resonance (MR) imaging {{can be used}} to detect subregional hippocampal alterations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects provided written consent to participate in this prospective institutional review board-approved HIPAA-compliant study. T 1 - and T 2 -weighted 7 -T brain MR images were acquired in 11 healthy subjects and eight patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In all subjects, images were qualitatively examined for evidence of hippocampal atrophy, signal change, and malrotation with the Bernasconi definition, and <b>digitations</b> of the hippocampal heads were counted (agreement was measured with the κ statistic). Data were analyzed quantitatively with manual subregional hippocampal body segmentation. Subregional data in individual subjects with TLE were compared with data in control subjects to detect deviation from the control range for volume measures on each side and with asymmetry indexes. RESULTS: All eight patients with TLE had hippocampal abnormalities on the epileptogenic side. Subregional analysis revealed selective lateral Ammon horn atrophy in six patients and diffuse Ammon horn and dentate gyrus atrophy in one patient. Paucity of hippocampal <b>digitations</b> occurred on the epileptogenic side in all patients with TLE and also on the contralateral side in three patients (interrater κ value, 0. 80). Hippocampal malrotation was observed in three patients with TLE and four control subjects. CONCLUSION: Ultrahigh-field-strength MR imaging permitted detection of selectively greater Ammon horn atrophy in patients with TLE and hippocampal sclerosis. Paucity of <b>digitations</b> is a deformity of the hippocampal head that was detected independent of hippocampal atrophy in patients with mesial TLE...|$|R
