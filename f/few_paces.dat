25|$|One {{method of}} hunting sloth bears {{involved}} {{the use of}} beaters, in which case, a hunter waiting on a post could either shoot the approaching bear through the shoulder or on the white chest mark if it was moving directly to him. Sloth bears are very resistant to body shots, and can charge hunters if wounded, though someone of steady nerves could score a direct hit from within a <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> of a charging bear. Sloth bears were easy to track during the wet season, as their clear footprints could be followed straight to their lairs. The majority of sloth bears killed in forests were due to chance encounters with them during hunts for other game. In hilly or mountainous regions, two methods were used to hunt them there. One was to lie in wait above the bear's lair at dawn {{and wait for the}} bear to return from its nocturnal foraging. Another was to rouse them at daytime by firing flares into the cave to draw them out. Sloth bears were also occasionally speared on horseback. In Sri Lanka, the baculum of a sloth bear was once used as a charm against barrenness.|$|E
500|$|Wolfe {{had ordered}} his {{soldiers}} to charge their muskets with two balls each {{in preparation for}} the engagement. Captain John Knox, serving with the 43rd Foot, wrote in his journal that as the French came within range, the regiments [...] "gave them, with great calmness, as remarkable a close and heavy discharge as I ever saw." [...] After the first volley, the British lines marched forward a <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> towards the shocked French force and fired a second general volley that shattered the attackers and sent them into retreat.|$|E
500|$|The runestone U 358 (...) in the RAK {{style was}} first {{mentioned}} by Richard Dybeck {{who discovered the}} stone in {{the foundation of the}} belfry of Skepptuna Church. The parishioners did not allow him to uncover the inscription completely, and they later hid the stone under a thick layer of soil. It was not until 1942 that it was removed from the belfry and was raised anew a <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> away. The stone is in light greyish granite. It is [...] tall above the ground and [...] wide. The contractor of the runestone was named Folkmarr and it is a name that is otherwise unknown from Viking Age Scandinavia, although it is known to have existed after the close of the Viking Age. It was on the other hand a common name in West Germanic languages and especially among the Franks.|$|E

500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|E

2500|$|Kumar {{is said to}} {{have been}} {{paranoid}} about not being paid. During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment. On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied [...] "Aadha paisa to aadha make-up." [...] (Half make-up for half payment). On the sets of Bhai Bhai, Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him [...] 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked a <b>few</b> <b>paces</b> and said, Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio. On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar's residence shouting [...] "Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar" [...] ("Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand") every morning until Talwar paid up.|$|E

I did find Oliver's public announcement to Star City as the Green Arrow a little bit wonk. Because of the way the camera was aimed at him from the new lair, you could see so easily that it was Oliver Queen. However, with shows like Arrow, you got to suspend your disbelief a little bit, and besides, 'I am the Green Arrow' is something I have been waiting to hear for four years, so how much can I really complain? Arrow, I have missed you." ...|$|R
