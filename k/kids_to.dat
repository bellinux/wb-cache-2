5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make it tough on him. And what they're really doing is telling <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into her hand, and she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E

5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea that a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though it means he will {{have to go back to}} Hell.
