It is a pity almost he is no longer in danger to be burned, as his sermon at the stake would convert thousands. O Niel Booshalloch, Father Clement's pile would be a sweet savouring sacrifice and a beacon to all decent Christians! But what would the burning of a borrel ignorant burgess like me serve? Men offer not up old <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> for incense, nor are beacons fed with undressed hides, I trow. Sooth to speak, I have too little learning and too much fear to get credit by the affair, and, therefore, I should, in our homely phrase, have both the scathe and the scorn." ...|$|E

50|$|Annonay has {{a strong}} {{industrial}} tradition, originally powered by the water flowing through the deep gorges around the town. In the 19th century, it {{was connected to the}} Paris-Lyon Railway and was famed for the best paper in France. It also produced <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> and cotton, woolen, and silk goods. A modern dam was constructed across the Ternay, an affluent of the Deûme northwest of town, which expanded the power available to local factories. By the First World War, the leather industry had become predominant, while the economy expanded to include more raw silk, flour, chemical manures, glue, gelatine, brushes, chocolates, and candles. Although the leather industry has since declined, the Tannerie d'Annonay ("Annonay Tannery") continues the tradition under the Grison brand.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to identify the quatity of bating agent used in tanning rabbit skins to be <b>glove</b> <b>leather,</b> to make use rabbit skins which can not be tanned to fur rabbit skin leather. The materials used in this research were of 40 pieces of lokal salt preservated rabbit skins originated from Yogyakarta having quality III and IV. They were grouped into four and the groups consisted of ten pieces each were tanned to be fashion <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> using 4 % formaline as pretanning agent and followed by chrome tanning agent as the retanning agent. Before carrying out both tanning processes bating was done on them using Pancreol Bate as bating agent. The quantity of bating agent added was varried as 0, 65 %, 1, 2 %, 1, 8 % and 2, 4 %. The process used was of usually carried - out by IRDLAI. The leather produced were tested on their sotfness, with sheepskin <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> was used as the measuring- rod; their tensile strength resistance and flexibility with SII. 0061 – 74 (Quality and test method for goatsheep skin glove and garment leather) as the standard of comparison. The test results were statistically evaluated. A conclusion can be down from this research that by using 0, 6 % Pancreol Bate on bating process, soft glove leathers having good tensile strength and flexibility which fulfill the requirements of SII. 0061 - 74 can be produced...|$|E

All of the group were {{processed}} into <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> with drum rotational speed of 15 RPM and 25 RPM resfectively. Analysis of varians showed that the speed effected the tensile strength, tensile stretch, elongation, and tear strength of the leather obtained.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis was to analyze and {{evaluate}} the head injuries due to a striking in a boxing match by LS-DYNA. A simplified arm model was built up and was equipped with three segments which were linked with two spherical joints. The strain-stress curves of the boxing glove foam and <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> were measured in the Neuronic Lab in School of Technology and Health, KTH. The dimension and weight of the model was also set as adjustable to fulfill various requirements in different cases. Then a method was developed to facilitate the simulation. Finally, 39 video clips from the database were processed and the 13 cases were chosen to test the method and to perform the simulations. Additionally, {{the reliability of the}} model was assessed by comparing the outcome of the simulations with the results of the visual analysis from a previous study. The outcome showed that the model was able to restore the scenario from the videos both quantitatively and qualitatively, but it also suggest a high sensitivity of the model to the data artifacts from the video analysis. Interpretations and suggestions for the future work were also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Appropriate {{protective}} gloves {{are essential for}} industry workers to avoid hands and wrists injuries. Leather is a common material used by professionals for technical gloves. Mechanical resistance, protection against water and high temperature has to be fulfilled by leather that is intended for using in {{protective gloves}}. In this study recipes using various fatliquoring agents with different properties such as lesitin based, lanolin based, polymeric based and water proofing fat liquor were applied to produce technical <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> and effect of each fatliquoring product on protective performance of leathers were analyzed in terms of physical and mechanical properties including tensile (ISO 3376), stitch tear (ISO 23910), tear resistance (ISO 3377 - 2), static (ISO 2417) and dynamicwater absorption (ISO 5403 - 1) and thermal stability such as dry heat (ISO 17227) and heat stability (ISO 11645). For this purpose, chromium tanned split calf leathers were used and retanning of protective leather gloves were performed by using tara and phosphonium combination. Performance testing results obtained from four different retanning processes was compared according {{to the type of}} fatliquoring material used in the production. Post-tanning with different types of fatliquoring products have significant effect on the protective performance properties of leather gloves, in terms of mechanical and thermal properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was {{to determine the effects of}} source and concentration of salt (NaCl) during the pickling process on the leather quality of sheep skin for glove. The kind of salt and concentration developed during pickling process of sheep skin the purified salt, Australian salt, Wedung Demak salt, Madura salt and control salt, was utilized the various concentration was 4 %, 6 % and 8 %, respectively. The test parameter are chemist, physical and visual test. The sheep leather was products like wet blue leather and crust leather, and then they were subsequently tested for their quality such as water content, ash content and Cr 2 O 3 content for wet blue leather and visual test for crust leather such as condition of leather, color, tear strength and resilient. The wet blue leather was water 44, 98 %, dust 6, 90 %, and Cr 2 O 3 3, 7 %, performed with SNI 06 - 3538 - 1994, Standard sheep/goat wet blue leathers. Crust of that leather was bright leather condition about soft, non deflated, flexible, color was average, the tear strength moderately was powerful, the spring was elastic, tensile strength was 156, 62 kg/cm 2 and elongation at break 42 % these quality parameter were comply with regulation standard was SNI 06 - 4035 - 1996, Standard the <b>glove</b> <b>leather</b> from sheep/goat leather...|$|E
