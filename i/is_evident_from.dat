Folk songs of Gaddis can be categorized as marriage songs, festivity songs, love songs.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Kavirajamarga (850) by King Amoghavarsha I is the {{earliest}} available book on rhetoric and poetics in Kannada, though it <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> this book that native styles of Kannada composition had already existed in previous centuries. Kavirajamarga is {{a guide to}} poets (Kavishiksha) that aims to standardize these various styles. The book refers to early Kannada prose and poetry writers such as Durvinita, perhaps the 6th-century monarch of Western Ganga Dynasty.|$|E

5|$|The Chola dynasty in Tamil Nadu was {{particularly}} favourable to {{the beliefs of}} Shaiva sect. It is said that the sectarian aspect got highlighted during their reign. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> the four Sharabha images, the earliest at the Vikramsolishwaram temple near Kumbakonam built by Vikrama Chola (1118–35). The other images are at Darasuram and Kampahareshvarar temple, Thirubuvanam built by a Chola ruler, Kulottunga Chola III where Sharabha's image is housed in a separate shrine.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{nature of}} the Mycenaean Greeks <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> the numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records. The Mycenaeans invested {{in the development of}} military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers. According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number of men who had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E

Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> Asser's account that he {{spent a good deal}} of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E

5|$|Jainism {{became popular}} in the dynasty in the 8th century when the ruler King Shivamara I {{constructed}} numerous Jain basadis. King Butuga II and minister Chavundaraya were staunch Jains which <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> {{the construction of the}} Gommateshwara monolith. Jains worshipped the twenty four tirthankars (Jinas) whose images were consecrated in their temples. The worship of the footprint of spiritual leaders such as those of Bhadrabahu in Shravanabelagola from the 10th century is considered a parallel to Buddhism. Some brahminical influences are seen in the consecration of the Gomateshwara monolith which is the statue of Bahubali, the son of Tirthankar Adinatha (just as Hindus worshipped the sons of Shiva). The worship of subordinate deities such as yaksa and yaksi, earlier considered as mere attendants of the tirthankars was seen from the 7th century to the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was {{installed}} as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7June 738, 39days after {{the execution of}} Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign {{due to the lack}} of monuments raised after Quiriguá's surprise victory. Copán's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá. The fall in Copán's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal. K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil died in January749.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} cathedral are so specifically detailed and the elements of Gothic and contemporary architecture so well delineated, that art and architecture historians have concluded that van Eyck must have had enough architectural knowledge to make nuanced distinctions. More so, given the finesse of the descriptions, many scholars have tried to link the painting with a particular building. Yet, and as with all buildings in van Eyck's work, the structure is imagined and probably an idealised formation of what he viewed as a perfect architectural space. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> a number of features that would be unlikely in a contemporary church, such as the placing of a round arched triforium above a pointed colonnade.|$|E

5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> the plans and {{the exterior of the}} building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society for meetings and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E
5|$|According to monk and biographer Teodosije the Hilandarian, King Radoslav {{was a good}} ruler at first, {{but fell}} under the {{influence}} of his wife, Queen Anna, daughter of the Epirote ruler Theodore Komnenos Doukas (1216–1230). The Serbian nobility most likely disliked Radoslav due to this Greek influence. Radoslav was probably safe from domestic rebellion as long as Theodore remained strong. In 1230, Theodore was defeated and captured by Emperor Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria, after which Radoslav's position seems to have weakened; some of his nobility revolted in the autumn of 1233. Teodosije said that the nobility no longer supported Radoslav, and instead supported Vladislav. Radoslav and his wife fled to Dubrovnik in 1233. He was unable to regain the kingdom, but eventually returned as a monk. There are indications that Radoslav organized rebellions against Vladislav, and that he thought that he would regain the throne. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>from</b> a document dated February 4, 1234, which promised Ragusa trading privileges once Radoslav had returned to Serbia and become king again. Because of this, Vladislav began threatening Ragusa, which then turned to Ban Matej Ninoslav of Bosnia for help. The revolt against Vladislav was unsuccessful, and Radoslav joined the court of Epirote ruler Manuel in Dyrrhachium.|$|E
