As of January 15, 2015 the ACS team has begun to produce post-flashed <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> files for the Wide Field Channel (WFC). This change was made to combat the charge transfer efficiency (CTE) losses caused by radiation damage that the two WFC CCDs have suffered since being put into orbit by artificially increasing the background in the dark images.

One of the major improvements in the new CALACS is the incorporation of the algorithm created by Anderson and Bedin (2010) to correct for the charge transfer efficiency (CTE) losses in WFC 1 and WFC 2. This algorithm is a pixel specific correction that is applied as one of the first steps in CALACS, before the subtraction of the <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> file. In order to properly reduce any raw science images it was necessary to correct all the WFC <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> files used in CALACS for CTE loss, about 1, 600 files...|$|E

The <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> image was first subtracted {{from both the}} white reference and the actual measurement at each wavelength in order to correct for thermal dark current [6]. Next, the resulting data set was divided by the white reference in order to correct for illumination and gain variations across the detector and to obtain the reflectance. The final data processing step was aimed at linking spectral information to {{the thickness of the}} coating layer. For this purpose, three different theoretical models were tested and will be discussed in a later section.|$|E

This is consistent with what we find. We also describe how the calnica reduction software uses the temperature dependent dark components when calibrating NICMOS images...|$|E
40|$|As color digital {{printing}} expands {{into the business}} and consumer markets, the importance of “color accuracy ” has increased. As a result, {{more and more people}} have had to become familiar with concepts such as color difference equations and DE*. While many of the concepts of color measurement are clearly explained in several current books, the myriad practical issues that contribute to color measurement error are seldom discussed. This leaves the practitioner of color measurement with tools for measuring color but little understanding of the key variables that affect the measurement process. This paper examines critical factors affecting accuracy in color measurements and sheds light on issues involved in integrating color measurement into on-line or automated applications. The focus of the paper is to bring out key calibration issues, including frequency calibration, gain adjustment, <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> and light reference. The repeatability and accuracy of color measurements are examined. Key sources of error are investigated, and suggestions are made for reducing sensitivity to them...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a device that {{minimizes}} {{the effects of the}} temperature on light detection in lab-on-chip systems. The device is based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon p-type/intrinsic/n-type junction, fabricated on a glass substrate using thin-film technologies. The device structure is constituted by two series-connected amorphous silicon diodes: a blind one acting as <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> and a photosensitive one. The signal measured at the output node of each element is equal to the difference of the current of the two diodes. This allows to minimize the temperature-dependent dark current contribution. The design of the photolithographic masks has been carefully carried out to pursue a perfect technological symmetry between the two diodes of the differential structure. Experimental data obtained by current-voltage characteristics show the correct operation of the individual diodes as well as the effectiveness of the differential structure to reject the common-mode signal induced by temperature variations. This feature makes the device a suitable candidate for analytical systems based on optical detection that involve thermal treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} few months a number of {{improvements}} to the STIS pipeline calibration have been developed and implemented, which include the following. We have released new low order flat files for use with the G 140 L observations. These flats should reduce uncertainties of the extracted flux with position from 12 % to 2 %. To better reflect the change with time in the overall shape of the NUV MAMA dark current, new <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> files were created for different epochs. To further improve the dark subtraction, these darks are also scaled using an improved algorithm, which takes into account long term changes in the behavior of the NUV MAMA dark current. Additional improvements which have been implemented are described in the posters by Stys et al., Valenti et al., Davies et al. and Lindler et al. Future improvements include background smoothing for low signal spectroscopic data, and updating the Pixel-to-Pixel flat library and the current CCD bad pixel table. 1.

40|$|Lustrous surface {{appearances}} can be elicited {{by simple}} image configurations with no texture or specular highlights, as most prominently illustrated by Helmholtz' demonstration of stereoscopic lustre. Three types of explanatory framework {{have been proposed}} for stereoscopic lustre, which attribute the phenomenon to a binocular luminance conflict, an internalised physical regularity (Helmholtz), or to a disentangling of “essential” and “accidental” attributes in surface representations (Hering). In order to investigate these frameworks, we used haploscopically fused half-images of centre-surround configurations in which the luminances of the test patch were dynamically modulated. Experiment 1 shows that stereoscopic lustre is not specifically tied to situations of a luminance conflict between the eyes. Experiment 2 identifies a novel aspect in the binocular temporal dynamics that provides a physical basis for lustrous appearances, namely the occurrence of a temporal luminance counter-modulation between the eyes. This feature sheds {{some light on the}} internal principles underlying a disentangling of “accidental” and “essential” surface attributes.

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{perceived}} similarity between two grey levels {{is related to}} the way they have been previously associated through eye saccades, actually reflecting their probability of co-occurrence in space and time. In the present study, we modified relative perceptual distances between grey levels by artificially associating certain pairs of grey levels with small eye saccades and other pairs with large eye saccades. In the test stage, we varied the luminance of a test patch (5 levels from 15 to 21 cd m- 2) to determine the luminance perceived as 'right-in-between' that of two reference stimuli, dark and light (10 and 26 cd m- 2). Each trial involved simultaneous presentation of one test grey and the two reference greys. The subject's task was to indicate whether the test patch looked more similar to the light or <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> grey. Adaptation trials involved successive presentation of one of each test greys centred on the screen followed by the dark stimulus with a 10 ° eccentricity or the light stimulus with a 20 ° eccentricity, with equal probability.

40|$|The Maximum Noise Fraction (MNF) {{transformation}} is frequently {{used to reduce}} multi/hyper-spectral data dimensionality. It explores the data finding the most informative features, i. e. the ones explaining the maximum signal to noise ratio. However, the MNF requires {{the knowledge of the}} noise covariance matrix. In actual applications such information is not available a priori; thus, it must be estimated from the image or from <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> measurements. Many MNF based techniques are proposed in the literature to overcome this major disadvantage of the MNF transformation. However, such techniques have some limits or require a priori knowledge that is difficult to obtain. In this paper, a new MNF based feature extraction algorithm is presented: the technique exploits a linear multi regression method and a noise variance homogeneity test to estimate the noise covariance matrix. The procedure can be applied directly to the image in an unsupervised fashion. To the best of our knowledge, the MNF is usually performed to remove the noise content from multi/hyperspectral images, while its impact on image classification is not well explored in the literature. Thus, the proposed algorithm is applied to an AVIRIS data set and its impact on classification performance is evaluated. Results are compared to the ones obtained by the widely used PCA and the Min/Max Autocorrelation Fraction (MAF), which is an MNF based technique...|$|E
30|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was investigated}} by a VNIR hyperspectral camera by Specim (Oulu, Finland). The camera was {{mounted on a}} rotation stage to acquire the images in push broom technique, i.e. by scanning the manuscript horizontally and acquiring full spectral information for one vertical line on the manuscript at a time. The spectral range was 400 – 1000  nm with 212 wavelength channels (rebinned from 1200) with a spectral sampling of 2.8  nm and 1600 spatial pixels. Two objectives were used. With the first one (OL 17, Specim, focal length 17  mm), one image of the entire miniature was acquired with a spatial sampling of approx. 250  μm at a camera-manuscript distance of 62  cm. The scan was acquired with 50  ms integration time, 6  fps (frames per second) and 0.01 /s rotation speed. With the second one (OL 50, Specim, focal length 50  mm), smaller zones were imaged with a spatial sampling of approximately 40  μm. In this “zoom” configuration (distance camera-manuscript of 40  cm), the acquisition parameters were 200  ms integration time, 4 fps and 0.07 /s rotation speed. During the investigation, diffuse illumination is provided by three 20  W halogen lamps, placed at 0.4  m away. The data was normalized with dark and bright field images using the Specim plug-in in ENVI (Harris Corporation, Melbourne, Florida, USA). To check {{the quality of the}} reflectance image cube the reflectance spectra from the white and black diffuse reflectance standards placed in the image scene were examined: they showed in the range between 450 and 900  nm a noise level of 1.7 % reflectance for the white reference and 0.5 % for the <b>dark</b> <b>reference.</b>|$|E

40|$|Economic {{growth and}} the {{increase}} in urbanization has led to an increase of anthropogenic illumination in large parts of the world. Effects of artificial light have been reported in different ecosystems, on many species and species groups. With excellent vision, and – in many species – a dependence on day length information for seasonal timing, birds are potentially strongly affected by disturbances of their natural light environment. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} long-term consequences of these disturbances, and even less about the effects of light on different colours. To study this, we set up a large-scale monitoring project in natural habitat in the Netherlands. At eight study sites we experimentally illuminated 100 m long transects at the forest edge with white, green and red light, and left one transect dark. Every year, we assessed the presence, density and activity of many species at these sites according to rigid protocols. In order to have a <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> for all sites, we started the monitoring routine a year before the artificial illumination was installed. All nest sites and song posts of breeding bird species were located. Birds were frequently netted and banded in order to monitor residence, recruitment and dispersion. We measured timing and reproductive success in birds breeding in nest boxes at and around all transects, as well as daily activity patterns in feeding behaviour. Here we present the effects of light on breeding bird species, including the advance of lay date of great tits (Parus major) breeding at the green and white illuminated transects. We show effects on territories, survival, daily and seasonal timing. Experimental, long term studies are essential for the quantification of the impact of artificial light on birds...|$|E
40|$|In 2010 ESA {{announced}} the Earthwatch Programme Element, Global Monitoring of Essential Climate Variables, (known as ‘ESA Climate Change Initiative’), to support climate modellers with highly stable, long-term satellitebased products, called Essential Climate Variables (ECV). The primary ECV of the “Fire-Disturbance” {{project is the}} Burnt Area (BA). In order to derive the BA with an accuracy fulfilling the GCOS requirements, improvements in data pre-processing are required for the generation of consistent time series. That is, consistency in the time series of a single sensor {{as well as between}} different sensors shall be achieved, and also including an assessment of the related error budgets. For our improved pre-processing chain we developed generic algorithms for image matching resulting in precise geolocation using the global Landsat Mosaic GLS 2000 as accurate reference. Additionally a global DEM is also used (W 42 database including SRTM and other sources). Land-water masking is performed using a learning algorithm. On one side external static reference data as e. g. the water body mask from SRTM radar data and the GSHHS, on the other side two different pre-classification algorithms are included. Regions with consistence in these three different water masks are assumed as water with high probability and therefore used as training data. On basis of this result the not included remaining water pixels of static mask are checked. At least the not included rest of pre-classifications will be tested with a strong classification algorithm. Cloud and snow/ice detection is performed developing generic parameter as e. g. brightness or flatness together with the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). When thermal bands are available as e. g. for (A) ATSR temperature information is used to discriminate clouds and snow/ice. Furthermore confidence levels for all masks are generated on a per pixel level for every scene. Finally atmospheric correction is performed using the newly developed wide swath ATCOR. Each scene is partitioned into cells guaranteeing that no steps in AOT, water vapour, and surface reflectance can be observed at cell borders. For each cell the radiative transfer functions calculated with the MODTRAN 5 code are updated concerning the sun-cell-sensor geometry by interpolating the information in the atmospheric LUT files. Topographic correction is included, requiring a DEM matched to the scene, and the corresponding derived maps of slope and aspect. For the AOT retrieval <b>dark</b> <b>reference</b> pixels are identified. The water vapour map is calculated on a per-pixel basis for MERIS using the atmospheric pre-corrected differential absorption. The (A) ATSR instruments have no water vapour bands in the reflective part of the spectrum. Thus, a fixed water vapour column can be used because the bands are located in atmospheric window regions. The ozone column for sea level is fixed at 330 DU, decreasing with elevation as defined in the mid-latitude summer atmosphere of the MODTRAN code. The overall processor is embedded in DLR’s CATENA chain allowing a distributed cluster-based calculation. The improved pre-processing is applied to all sensors for the 10 global test sites of the CCI project. Within CATENA, subsequently the Burnt Area products will be generated...|$|E
