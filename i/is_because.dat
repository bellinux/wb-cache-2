5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has a visible star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} <b>is</b> <b>because</b> there is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the fraud}} theory, secret trusts are {{sometimes}} classified as constructive trusts; {{the reason they}} do not have to follow the Wills Act 1837 <b>is</b> <b>because</b> they are created by the courts.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play or when aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it. If {{you don't}} come back it will <b>be</b> <b>because</b> you don't want to--no other reason. It won't <b>be</b> <b>because</b> you can't. It will <b>be</b> <b>because</b> you don't want to." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If I'm who I <b>am</b> <b>because</b> I'm who I am,and you're who you <b>are</b> <b>because</b> you're who you are,then I'm who I am and you're who you are.If however...I'm who I <b>am</b> <b>because</b> you're who you are,and you're who you <b>are</b> <b>because</b> I'm who I am,then I'm not who I am and you're not who you are." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> of {{the house}} of Boethus, woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> of their staves; [...] Woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> {{of the house}} of Hanin, woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> of their whisperings; [...] Woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> {{of the house of}} Kathros, woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> of their pens; [...] Woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> of the house of Ishmael the son of Phabi, woe <b>is</b> me <b>because</b> of their fists; [...] For they are High Priests, and their sons are Templetreasurers, [...] and their sons-in-law are trustees, and their {{servants}} beat the people with staves". Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Pesachim, 57a ...|$|R
5|$|Deserts, both hot and cold, {{play a part}} in moderating the Earth's temperature. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{they reflect}} more of the {{incoming}} light and their albedo is higher than that of forests or the sea.|$|E
5|$|Even though Opera Mini {{is based}} on the same {{rendering}} engine as Opera for personal computers, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to make them more suitable for devices with small screens.|$|E
5|$|For the Internet, the {{physical}} medium and {{data link protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the Internet places no constraints on what physical medium or data link protocol is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5000|$|Hours {{before the}} shooting, Bello {{sent an e-mail}} to the New York Daily News, making various accusations in regards to his firing, stating [...] "First, I was told it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> I always kept to myself. Then it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of an altercation with a nurse. Then I was told, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> I {{threatened}} a colleague." [...] Bello blamed a specific doctor for blocking his career progress and costing him $400,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{narration}} {{implies that}} Zebedee's {{reason for not}} joining with Doogal and the others on their quest <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he went to search for Zeebad; in the original, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he had to stay behind to guard the roundabout.|$|R
6000|$|Perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Johnny, {{even at that}} moment, {{hated the}} man; perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> at that moment he loved and {{believed}} in Florry, or perhaps it <b>was</b> only that <b>because</b> at that moment he was nearer the greater Truth than his questioner, but he said, in a husky voice, [...] "You lie!" ...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the colonial languages, there are approximately 250 other languages spoken by nearly 20 million Cameroonians. It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of this that Cameroon {{is considered one of}} the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|In the Laud Troy Book, this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Achilles {{almost killed}} Troilus in the {{previous}} fight but the Trojan was rescued. Achilles {{wants to make sure}} that this does not happen again. This second combat is fought as a straight duel between the two with Achilles, the greater warrior, winning.|$|E
5|$|Ionization of acids is less in an acidic solvent than in water. For example, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a weak acid when dissolved in acetic acid. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> acetic acid {{is a much}} weaker base than water.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>'s</b> <b>because</b> of me. So much {{as that is}} true." [...] Bernard {{wondered}} {{what she was going}} to say--if she were going to be silly enough to allude to the most impudent of fictions; then, as she stood opening and closing her blue fan and smiling at him in the fire-light, he felt that she was silly enough for anything. [...] "It <b>'s</b> <b>because</b> of all the talk--it <b>'s</b> <b>because</b> of Gordon. You need n't be afraid of Gordon." ...|$|R
50|$|BYU was {{returning}} 28 {{players from the}} previous year but Golden Richards would not be one of them. Richards claimed it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the Cougars <b>were</b> still a run-oriented offense while BYU and Edwards said it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Richards had trouble keeping with his academics.|$|R
50|$|He was nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he <b>was</b> always so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he <b>was</b> always up to some mischievous business.|$|R
5|$|Isotopes of hafnium and {{lutetium}} (along with ytterbium) {{are also}} used in isotope geochemistry and geochronological applications. It is often used as a tracer of isotopic evolution of Earthâ€™s mantle through time. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> 176Lu decays to 176Hf with a half-life of approximately 37 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Manasa is an {{especially}} important deity in Bengal for the mercantile castes. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Chando of the Manasamangal {{was the first to}} initiate her worship, and Behula, the heroine of the Manasamangal was a daughter of the Saha clan (a powerful trading community).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jim discovers {{another side}} of Stanley, who {{demonstrates}} uncharacteristic energy and zeal for life. Stanley explains this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> he is on vacation.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} was abandoned in August 1997 and no charges were made, {{as it was}} not in the public interest. This was taken to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> McGuinness <b>was</b> in negotiations for the peace process; however, some allege that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> McGuinness <b>was</b> a British spy.|$|R
50|$|The lion <b>is</b> Matthew, <b>because</b> Matthew {{portrays the}} Lord Jesus as the King; the ox <b>is</b> Mark, <b>because</b> Mark portrays Him as a servant; the man <b>is</b> Luke, <b>because</b> Luke portrays Him as a perfect, genuine man; the eagle <b>is</b> John, <b>because</b> John portrays Him as God.|$|R
50|$|Women show higher {{performance}} levels on tests of verbal fluency. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the female auditory cortex is more dense {{than that of}} the male. This difference and other sensory differences like it could <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the sex hormones that impact the fetal brain during development.|$|R
5|$|Most of the Sinhalese {{letters are}} curlicues; {{straight}} lines are almost completely {{absent from the}} alphabet. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Sinhala used to be written on dried palm leaves, which would split along the veins on writing straight lines. This was undesirable, and therefore, the round shapes were preferred.|$|E
5|$|Most weekend SLE trains {{also run}} local {{westbound}} in the morning, then express in the afternoon, stopping only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street. Eastbound service is reversed. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> Branford, Madison, and Clinton only have platforms on the eastbound track, and thus switching {{is needed to}} platform a westbound train.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{diversity}} and heterogeneity of AML <b>is</b> <b>because</b> leukemic transformation can occur {{at a number of}} different steps along the differentiation pathway. Modern classification schemes for AML recognize that the characteristics and behavior of the leukemic cell (and the leukemia) may depend on the stage at which differentiation was halted.|$|E
50|$|For {{many years}} after Gompers' attack, AFL {{officials}} largely ignored Brookwood. In part this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the college <b>was</b> independent, but in part it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the AFL believed it could dominate (and thus control) workers' education efforts and turn them to its own purposes through the Workers' Education Bureau.|$|R
5000|$|... "If I <b>am</b> I <b>because</b> I <b>am</b> I, and you <b>are</b> you <b>because</b> you <b>are</b> you, then I am I {{and you are}} you. But if I <b>am</b> I <b>because</b> you <b>are</b> you and you <b>are</b> you <b>because</b> I <b>am</b> I, then I am not I {{and you are not}} you!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The 1990 edition <b>was</b> {{abandoned}} <b>because</b> of snow. The 1995 edition <b>was</b> abandoned <b>because</b> of frost. The 2001 running {{took place}} at Newbury. The 2008 edition <b>was</b> abandoned <b>because</b> of heavy rain.|$|R
5|$|Such vast cargoes {{would be}} carried by boat {{as far as}} possible, by sea and/or river, and only the {{shortest}} possible distance overland. That <b>is</b> <b>because</b> transport on water was far more economical than on land (as it remains today, although the differential is smaller).|$|E
5|$|The blast {{furnaces}} {{used in the}} Imperial Smelting Process ("ISP") were developed from the standard lead blast furnace, but are fully sealed. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the zinc produced by these furnaces is recovered as metal from the vapor phase, {{and the presence of}} oxygen in the off-gas would result in the formation of zinc oxide.|$|E
5|$|The {{cast for}} Planet B {{comes from the}} Radio Drama Company, a {{repertory}} radio company. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> they cost nothing to use and the budget for the show is small. The cast of the Radio Drama Company changes around every six months, which means that cast of Planet B changes every series.|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>because</b> he <b>was</b> just then {{cut off from}} all his fellow-creatures and even from the world itself; it may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> he <b>was</b> satiated with marvels and with the almost {{absolute}} control over the powers which the Demon had conferred upon him; or it may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> he <b>was</b> born and reared a hearty, healthy American boy, with a disposition to battle openly with the world and take his chances equally with his fellows, rather than be placed in such an exclusive position {{that no one could}} hope successfully to oppose him.|$|R
50|$|It <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of her {{marriage}} to the consort of ChinchÃ³n.|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} better ways of {{budgeting}} and managing public finances is a continuous process. This may <b>be</b> <b>because,</b> like {{in many other}} areas of economics, there are always some who see a need or an opportunity to improve on existing approaches. It may also <b>be</b> <b>because</b> performance â€“ that is, the results from publi...|$|R
