2500|$|On 16 July, Bethmann Hollweg told Count Roedern, the State Secretary for Alsace-Lorraine, that he couldn't {{care less}} about Serbia or alleged Serbian {{complicity}} in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. All that mattered was that Austria attack Serbia that summer, {{to result in a}} win-win situation for Germany. If Bethmann Hollweg's view was correct, an Austro-Serbian war would either cause a general war (which Bethmann Hollweg believed Germany would win) or cause the Triple Entente to break up. That same day, the Russian Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to St. Petersburg that, [...] "Information reaches me that the Austro-Hungarian government {{at the conclusion of the}} inquiry intends to make certain demands on Belgrade... <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> desirable that at the present moment, before a final decision on the matter, the Vienna Cabinet should be informed how Russia would react to the fact of Austria's presenting demands to Serbia such as would be unacceptable to the dignity of that state".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2005 expert {{evidence}} was {{submitted to the}} High Court in London by the mothers of thirty children who claimed that during their pregnancies they were exposed to contamination from the waste removal operations and who sought to bring a legal action to try to prove {{a link between the}} mismanagement of the toxic waste and the birth defects suffered by their children. The evidence presented included reports detailing the higher rate of birth defects, and alleging that exposure to the toxic waste was the likely cause of the children's deformities. They also presented a report written by Roger Braithwaite, an environmental expert instructed by the families, which concluded that the negligent handling of the waste by Corby Borough Council demonstrated [...] "naivety, arrogance, ignorance, incompetence and a possible serious conflict of interest... At this early stage <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that these... badly polluted lands have never been effectively or comprehensively assessed, properly permitted, regulated, monitored or adequate records maintained... This is environmental negligence on a grand scale." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{should say}} the {{difference}} between the Altrurians and the unfashionable Americans, in view of such a dinner as she gave us, would be that, while <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> us abominable for its extravagance, and revolting in its appeals <b>to</b> appetite, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> most of such Americans altogether admirable and enviable, and would appeal to their ambition to give such a dinner themselves as soon as ever they could.|$|R

6000|$|... "Where did {{you pick}} him up?" [...] Saul asked impatiently. [...] "Why did you waste time on the scoundrel? <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that after all he has done it was your {{business}} to flog, rather than make friends with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not, for {{the sake}} of the blessed Virgin, let there be strife and bloodshed!" [...] said Eveline; [...] "rather unbind my eyes, and let me speak to those whose {{approach}} you dread.

50|$|The date of Henry de Ferrers' {{death is}} uncertain, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be between September 1093 and September 1100. He {{was buried in}} Tutbury Priory.|$|R

"I will submit them to Our Lord {{who sent}} me. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that He and His Church are one, {{and that there}} should be no {{difficulty}} about this matter."

6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon, Caroline," [...] and Marian {{was thrown into}} herself again; but she thought a little longer, and seeing that Caroline was still waiting and musing, she ventured on saying, in a timid voice, [...] "Somehow, I think, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that the more affection there was, the more painful it would all be." ...|$|E
60|$|Then we {{need not}} appeal to history, to the {{declarations}} of {{the framers of the}} government, but we know from judge Douglas himself that slavery began to be an element of discord among the white people of this country as far back as 1699, or one hundred and sixty years ago, or five generations of men,--counting thirty years to a generation. Now, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it might have occurred to Judge Douglas, or anybody who had turned his attention to these facts, that there was something in the nature of that thing, slavery, somewhat durable for mischief and discord.|$|E

60|$|But {{the contest}} {{could not be}} abandoned; devil or reason, or {{whatever}} it was, must be overcome, else {{there was no hope}} for me; and such is the powerful effect of fixing all one's thoughts on one object, assisted no doubt by the reflex effect on the mind of prayer, that in due time I did succeed in making myself believe all I wished to believe, and had my reward, since after many days or weeks of mental misery there would come beautiful intervals of peace and of more than peace, a new and surprising experience, a state of exaltation, when <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that I was lifted or translated into a purely spiritual atmosphere and was in communion and one with the unseen world.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did, sir. But, Mr. Newcome, {{on looking}} round at the {{quantity}} of lumber these men have made, and recollecting the distance they are from Albany, I am {{at a loss to}} imagine how they could hope to get their ill-gotten gains to market without discovery. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that their movements must be known, and that the active and honest agents of {{this part of the country}} would seize their rafts in the water-courses; thus making the very objects of the squatters' roguery the means of their punishment. Is it not extraordinary that theft, in a moral sense at least, can be systematically carried on, and that on so large a scale, with such entire impunity?" ...|$|E

[...] "And it can't even be said that all the members are doin' it of their own accord, for I am not. If Sammy did not go, I would not, but if he does, I do, and there's the end of that; and I suppose it won't be very much longer before there's the end of all of us. I hope you will tell Mrs. Raleigh that I sent my best love to her with my last words; for even if I was to see her again, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like {{beginning}} all over again, and this {{would be the end of}} this part of my life all the same. What I hope and pray for is that none of the party may die of any kind of a disease before the rest all go to their end together; for remains on board an under-water vessel is somethin' which mighty few nerves would be able to stand." ...|$|E

Janet and I have no bairn of our own, and it's good for a house {{to have a child}} in it. I look upon {{it as if it were}} yours, for it is like enough you will never hear of its father again. It will have a hearty welcome. It is a bright little fellow, and in time I doubt not that Janet will take greatly to it. The charge of a child is a serious matter, and we cannot hope that we shall not have trouble with it, but there is trouble in all things. At any rate, Malcolm, we will do our best, and if at the end of a year I find that Janet has not taken to it we will see about some other arrangement. And, Malcolm, I do trust that you will stay with us for another week or two. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> as if I had turned you out of my house were you to leave me so soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You insult {{the memory}} of Moliere, the {{greatest}} ornament of our stage, {{one of the greatest}} ornaments of our nation, when you suggest that there is vileness in doing that which he never hesitated to do, which no great author yet has hesitated to do. You cannot suppose that Moliere ever troubled himself to be original in the matter of ideas. You cannot suppose that the stories he tells in his plays have never been told before. They were culled, as you very well know--though you seem momentarily to have forgotten it, and it is therefore necessary that I should remind you--they were culled, many of them, from the Italian authors, who themselves had culled them Heaven alone knows where. Moliere took those old stories and retold them in his own language. That is precisely what I am suggesting that you should do. Your company is a company of improvisers. You supply the dialogue as you proceed, which is rather more than Moliere ever attempted. You may, if you prefer it--though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to be yielding to an excess of scruple--go straight to Boccaccio or Sacchetti. But even then you cannot be sure that you have reached the sources." ...|$|E

If it were in a thoroughfare, a great many persons might pass in who would be driven in by accident, or driven in by caprice, if they passed it; {{but if it were}} at a little {{distance}} from a thoroughfare, it would be less crowded with those persons who are not likely to derive much advantage from it?--Quite so; but there would always be an advantage in attracting a crowd; it would always extend its educational ability in its being crowded. But <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that all that is necessary for a noble Museum of the best art should be more or less removed, and that a collection, solely for the purpose of education, and for the purpose of interesting people who do not care much about art, should be provided in {{the very heart of the}} population, if possible, that pictures not of great value, but of sufficient value to interest the public, and of merit enough to form the basis of early education, and to give examples of all art, should be collected in the popular Gallery, but that all the precious things should be removed and put into the great Gallery, where they would be safest, irrespectively altogether of accessibility.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has never}} been an American {{tradition}} to speak truly of the people. Always we have thought of them wishfully, according to our own ends. A social evangelist, in a far-away temple, shouts loudly {{of the people and}} class solidarity. Are these Americans class conscious? I can only show them to you and say, judge for yourselves. ... <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that an unschooled man who is aware and puzzled is frequently more intelligent than a man with an educated mind, convinced and closed.

5000|$|But {{the strip}} doesn't assert that. That's the {{assumption}} that adults make because nobody else sees him, sees Hobbes, {{in the way that}} Calvin does. Some reporter was writing a story on imaginary friends and they asked me for a comment, and I didn’t do it because I really have absolutely no knowledge about imaginary friends. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> though, that when you make up a friend for yourself, you would have somebody to agree with you, not to argue with you. So Hobbes is more real than I suspect any kid would dream up.|$|E

"No one {{has used}} the {{argument}} that statutory rape—at least according to the Blackstone sic law dictionary—was solely a crime that a man could commit. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that it became a woman's crime when you had this political egalitarianism {{which has led to}} Washington state's having an equal-rights amendment, although it was rejected by the United States.
