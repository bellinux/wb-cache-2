A consensus on this <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> exists. A dramatic date under Nero (1st century AD) is indicated by the work's social background and in particular by references to named popular entertainers.|$|E
25|$|Evan-Thomas {{was never}} {{consulted}} over the account, but had obtained a copy. He arranged {{to speak to}} First Lord of the Admiralty Leo Amery in July 1923, but the meeting and ensuing correspondence with the Admiralty failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> also included when a flag signal from Lion had been hoisted and then lowered (which was {{the point at which}} the ship receiving the order was supposed to act upon it), the failure of which signal caused Evan-Thomas to continue steaming towards the enemy when he should have turned away with Beatty's other ships. Evan-Thomas arranged another interview in December 1923, but on this occasion Beatty interrupted the meeting before Evan-Thomas could explain his business, and 'pushed' him out of the room. Evan-Thomas returned to Chatham, but by 2.30 pm that day he was taken ill and was diagnosed to have suffered a stroke. In March 1924 he was obliged to retire, and was not sufficiently well to attend a formal interview with the King, as would be expected for a retiring admiral. He was awarded the grand cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) for his services to the Royal Navy.|$|E

2500|$|On July 14, 2009, The Wall Street Journal {{published}} an editorial on Baucus's attitude over Vietnam’s [...] "tra" [...] and [...] "basa" [...] pangasius, {{saying there was}} no reason for America to launch a trade war with Vietnam over fish. [...] "He's dead right about a trade <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> percolating in Washington," [...] said the newspaper. The article, entitled [...] "Max Baucus's Fish Sense - Protectionism often hurts the protectionist," [...] outlined this controversial topic in Washington and underlined the possibility that the U.S. Department of Agriculture could effectively ban imports from Vietnam of pangasius fish, which are similar to U.S.-produced catfish.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial {{investment}} {{may have}} been discouraged by the high initial cost of building a very large novel structure, the large land area required and by the risk of investment, however, {{there appears to be}} a renewed interest in solar updraft towers especially in sunny remote areas. A few prototypes have recently been constructed and projects are being proposed for parts of Africa, USA and Australia. An important fact to consider is that solar updraft towers appear to be the only renewable energy technology that can generate electricity from low temperature heat. [...] Functional or mechanical feasibility is not so much an <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> as capitalisation.|$|E
2500|$|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein {{considers}} {{a key issue}} in the ethics of artificial intelligence: if a machine can be created that has intelligence, could it also feel? If it can feel, does it {{have the same rights}} as a human? The idea also appears in modern science fiction, such as the film , in which humanoid machines have the ability to feel emotions. This <b>issue,</b> <b>now</b> known as [...] "robot rights", is currently being considered by, for example, California's Institute for the Future, although many critics believe that the discussion is premature. Some critics of transhumanism argue that any hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights. The subject is profoundly discussed in the 2010 documentary film Plug & Pray.|$|E

2500|$|When the Wu generals {{wanted to}} respond to the enemy's taunts, Lu Xun said, [...] "This must be a trick. We should observe first." [...] Earlier on, when the Shu army first arrived at Yiling, the Wu generals wanted to attack the enemy, but Lu Xun objected and said, [...] "Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's {{difficult}} for us to attack them. Even if we manage to win, we can't completely defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small <b>issue.</b> <b>Now,</b> we should raise our troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they can't carry out an all-out assault because they're sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs." [...] The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very disgruntled with him.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E

"Yonder it is," [...] said my man, {{pointing}} {{with his}} whip, and I twisted round {{to see over}} his shoulder, not the Rhine-like castle I had expected, but a long low house of stone upon a headland, backed by a distant mountain that vanished in a wild driven storm of rain as I looked.

Now, thought I, we bring things to an <b>issue.</b> <b>Now</b> we come to something personal and definite. The vagueness is at an end.

60|$|It is to a quite {{extraordinary}} extent a thing {{apart from}} our national life. It {{becomes more and}} more so. To go into the House of Commons is to go aside out of the general stream of the community's vitality into a corner where little is learnt and much is concocted, into a specialised Assembly which is at once inattentive to and monstrously influential in our affairs. There was a period when the debates in the House of Commons were an integral, almost a dominant, part of our national thought, when its speeches were read over in tens of thousands of homes, and a large and sympathetic public followed the details of every contested <b>issue.</b> <b>Now</b> a newspaper that dared to fill its columns mainly with parliamentary debates, with a full report of the trivialities the academic points, the little familiar jokes, and entirely insincere pleadings which occupy that gathering would court bankruptcy.|$|E

6000|$|In one {{or other}} {{of two ways}} only is that {{unification}} possible.

Either we must have human unity by a league of existing states or by an Imperial Conquest.

6000|$|Bo {{had been}} {{defeated}} in her cherished and determined ambition to ride Dale's mustang, {{and she was}} furious. The mustang {{did not appear to}} be vicious or mean. But he was spirited, tricky, mischievous, and he had thrown her six times. The scene of Bo's defeat was at the edge of the park, where thick moss and grass afforded soft places for her to fall. It also afforded poor foothold for the gray mustang, obviously placing him at a disadvantage. Dale did not bridle him, because he had not been broken to a bridle; and though it was harder for Bo to try to ride him bareback, there was less risk of her being hurt. Bo had begun in all eagerness and enthusiasm, loving and petting the mustang, which she named [...] "Pony." [...] She had evidently anticipated an adventure, but her smiling, resolute face had denoted confidence. Pony had stood fairly well to be mounted, and then had pitched and tossed until Bo had slid off or been upset or thrown. After each fall Bo bounced up with less of a smile, and more of spirit, until now the Western passion to master a horse had suddenly leaped to life within her. It was no longer fun, no more a daring circus trick to scare Helen and rouse Dale's admiration. The <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> lay between Bo and the mustang.|$|E
60|$|Now, in {{the case}} of young children, the faculties of {{perception}} and consciousness and the power of recognizing the distinguishing characteristics of the different perceptions and sensations of their minds are all immature, and distinctions which even to mature minds are not so clear but that they are often confounded, for them form a bewildering maze. Their minds are occupied with a mingled and blended though beautiful combination of sensations, conceptions, fancies, and remembrances, which they do not attempt to separate from each other, and their vocal organs are animated by a constant impulse to exercise themselves with any utterances which the incessant and playful gambollings of their faculties frame. In other words, the vital force liberated by the digestion of the food seeks an <b>issue</b> <b>now</b> in this way and now in that, through every variety of mental and bodily action. Of course, to arrange and systematize these actions, to establish the true relations between all these various faculties and powers, and to regulate the obligations and duties by which the exercise of them should be limited and controlled, is a work of time, and is to be effected, not by the operation of any instinct or early intuition, but by a course of development--effected mainly by the progress of growth and experience, though it is to be aided and guided by assiduous but gentle training and instruction.|$|E
