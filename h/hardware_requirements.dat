It is possible to install Debian with 60MB of RAM for x86-64; the installer will run in low memory mode and it is recommended to create a swap partition.

5|$|SMP2 {{supports}} {{a trial of}} a special category of bigadv work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive {{and have a great}} scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February7, 2012. Along with these added <b>hardware</b> <b>requirements</b> over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as random-access memory (RAM) and Internet bandwidth. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing clusters and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.|$|E

25|$|IGN rated Supreme Commander {{with the}} rating of 9/10, with {{reviewer}} Charles Onyett giving {{the game the}} Editor's choice award.

IGN UK, however, was less positive, while still awarding a rating of 8.9/10. The issues addressed by its international counterpart were deemed more severe, and the reviewer was not impressed by the interface, finding the amount of control it gives over the game lacking.|$|E

AllGame's Mark Hoogland praised the improved car details, environment textures, and weather effects; GameSpot's Greg Kasavin echoed similar remarks, noting occasional frame rate drops. GameSpy's Sal Accardo commended the draw distance improvements, identifying very few texture issues. IGN's Steve Butts found the port's system requirements to be reasonable, unlike Grand Theft Auto III, and praised the faster load times.

500|$|Several critics {{took issue}} with the game's {{graphics}} and outdated id Tech 2 engine; reviewer Stephen Hunt named the game [...] "a muddy affair" [...] due to the [...] "elderly" [...] engine. Some reviewers, however, felt the game's charm made the engine's age irrelevant. Reviewers also encountered several software bugs and glitches, among them incompatibility with Windows 2000 and a bug forcing the player to repeat a sequence near the end several times. However, they differed in their opinions of the game {{as a result of}} them, ranging from [...] "nearly unplayable" [...] to [...] "a flawed classic."

Game Revolution praised the graphics for their [...] "modeling, colored lighting, incredible special effects, wonderful animation, [...] sheer overall feel". Victor Lucas of Electric Playground stated similar pros, but also admitted that the game's <b>hardware</b> <b>requirements</b> were relatively high. Criticism was leveled at the game's story. GameSpot considered it not compelling, while Jason Cross, writing for Computer Games Magazine, felt that it [...] "really doesn't {{have much to do}} with actual gameplay".

500|$|Microsoft {{continued}} to make strategic decisions directed at consumers. The company released Microsoft Bob, a graphical user interface designed for novice computer users, in March 1995.

Nate Lanxon of Wired UK felt that it produced [...] "some of the most breath taking cutscenes and 3D graphics" [...] seen on the Xbox 360 and that it made [...] "lengthy cutscenes more movie-like than ever". Writing for RPGFan, Stephen Harris called Crystal Tools an [...] "impressive software" [...] that [...] "powered the jaw dropping visuals in Final Fantasy XIII". As time passed on, however, various media outlets criticized Square Enix for building their own engine. GameZone's James Wynne saw Crystal Tools {{as a means of}} [...] "combusting money" [...] during its development, and said it was [...] "fairly out of date" [...] by the time it had matured enough to be used for the company's projects. GamesRadar's Ashley Reed faulted Crystal Tools for leading to extended delays in the company's release schedule and even lowering the quality of some games. She blamed the engine for having caused a [...] "catastrophic meltdown" [...] for Final Fantasy XIV. Harris said that people had come to expect [...] "pretty" [...] graphics from Crystal Tools and that Final Fantasy XIV simultaneously [...] "met and completely shattered" [...] those expectations. He felt that the game was [...] "the most visually astounding MMORPG ever created on the PC platform". However, he called certain graphical features [...] "resource hogs" [...] and was disappointed with the [...] "steep" [...] <b>hardware</b> <b>requirements</b> recommended by Square Enix to run the game. RPGFan's staff writer Derek Heemsbergen said that [...] could be seen as [...] "a desperate attempt to squeeze one last game out of the aging graphical engine". Wynne equally panned Square Enix's alleged decision to drop Crystal Tools in favor of the newly developed Luminous Studio engine.|$|E
