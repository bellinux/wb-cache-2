40|$|Abstract Desulphurization of FCC {{gasoline}} and diesel fuels {{has been investigated}} by chemical oxidation of sulphur containing compounds with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of}} an acid catalyst such as formic acid and acetic acid, followed by extraction of the oxidized compounds using acetonitrile. Oxidative desulphurization (ODS) of diesel fuel was found to be very promising approach for the reduction of up to 92 % of sulphur at low temperature (50 8 C) and atmospheric pressure. The direct extraction of diesel oil without any oxidation has resulted in about 45 % sulphur removal, however such direct extraction also removed other aromatic hydrocarbons and affected the yield. The ODS is not successful with FCC gasoline due to the high olefinic content that tends to react with hydrogen peroxide to form epoxides. GC–MS technique was used to identify the sulphones during the oxidation of thiophenes. This study recommends that the oxidation extraction technique be used as an additional process to the <b>hydrodesulphurization</b> to enable the refiners to meet the future environmental sulphur regulations. The conventional <b>hydrodesulphurization</b> can be used to lower the sulphur content to few hundreds ppm.
