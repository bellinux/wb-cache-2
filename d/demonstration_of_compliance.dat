Both are processed through a {{criminal justice system}} where legal actors assess their claims of victimization and either provide or deny resources and recognition in response to those claims. Ideal victim theory posits that not all victims’ claims are treated equally due to static factors such as personal characteristics or case facts. Professor Corrigan and Professor Shdaimah present the Arena of Intelligibility, an original analytical tool developed from their empirical data, to more effectively explain case outcomes for women affected by sexual crimes. The Arena explains criminal case outcomes {{as the result of}} dynamic processes and relationships between and among criminal justice personnel and would-be victims. Such outcomes are not solely the result of sociodemographic factors, but also reflect personal and institutional beliefs, attitudes, and priorities. After describing the Arena, the authors demonstrate how intelligibility is constructed by analyzing data from their studies in three domains: women’s responses to questioning, <b>demonstrations</b> <b>of</b> <b>compliance,</b> and representations <b>of</b> trauma.

Similarly to the <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> safety <b>compliance</b> applied to aircraft control surfaces, novel functions resulting from the integration of a morphing device (ATED), imposes a detailed examination of the associated risks. Because of the concept novelty, literature references for a safe design of a morphing trailing edge device are hard to be found. The safety-driven design of ATED requires a thorough examination of the potential hazards resulting from operational faults involving either the actuation chain, such as jamming, or the external interfaces, such as loss of power supplies and control lanes. In this work, a study of ATED functions is qualitatively performed at both subsystem and aircraft levels to identify potential design faults, maintenance and crew faults, as well as external environment risks. The severity of the hazard effects is determined and placed in specific classes, indicative of the maximum tolerable probability of occurrence for a specific event, resulting in safety design objectives.

Adopting a comprehensive regulatory approach akin to other civil rights laws, the Parity Act requires “equity” in all plan features, including cost-sharing, durational limits and, most critically, the plan management practices {{that are used to}} deny many families medically necessary behavioral health care. Beginning in 2014, all health plans regulated by the Affordable Care Act must also comply with parity standards, effectively ending the second-class insurance status of persons with these disorders. With the legal framework in place, this Article examines whether the Parity Act will achieve its promise of equitable health care coverage. It concludes that two structural features—the complexity of the Act’s standards and the health plan’s control of all data needed to assess compliance—render enforcement by consumers exceedingly difficult. Enforcement is further jeopardized by the federal regulators’ failure to articulate a standard to implement the most fundamental aspect of the law—the required scope of behavioral health services—and to provide sufficient guidance on the law’s most contentious provision—regulation of plan management practices. To address these enforcement limitations, the Article provides a detailed explanation of the Parity Act’s standards, offers interpretive guidance to resolve key questions and recommends implementation strategies to enhance consumer notification and <b>demonstration</b> <b>of</b> parity <b>compliance.</b> Additional, yet modest, compliance requirements are needed to ensure that the Parity Act achieves its remedial goal...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe rail {{transportation}} industry is highly dynamic and {{driven by the}} need to meet with mandatory safety criteria. Modern railway transportation systems are ever more sophisticated and rely heavily on embedded systems and communication networks. Train builders and their suppliers have to develop and deliver these increasingly sophisticated embedded systems while meeting increasingly stringent quality, safety and certification constraints. Driven by the EN- 50128 standard 'Software For Railway Control And Protection Systems' [3], which proposes needed methods to be used in order to provide software for control systems, train builders have applied processes and adopted tools that help to develop and validate software in compliance with safety constraints. This paper will illustrate how model based system engineering approaches and frameworks provide full business process support to: - Validate the functional requirements of the systems (requirement management); - Design control and safety functions at the train, vehicle and equipment levels (functional design and software architecture); - Design and develop the software applications of electronic controllers;- Integrate, validate and qualify electronic systems in a progressive integration process;- Manage all changes during the lifecycle of the product (change management but also option and variant management); - Demonstrate the compliance with the required safety integrated level, - Train and educate drivers, rail network operators and maintenance technicians.
