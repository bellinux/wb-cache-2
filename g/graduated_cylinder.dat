50|$|The use of wash bottles helps rusers {{control and}} measure the precise amount of liquid used. In addition, {{unwanted}} substances or particles cannot pass through wash bottles. The use of wash bottles is more convenient than using beaker and <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Conical {{measures}} {{are the most}} commonly used item of glassware used in the preparation of extemporaneous medicaments. They are not as precise as <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders</b> for measuring liquids, but make up for this in terms of easy pouring and ability to mix solutions within the measure itself.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} NWS rain gauge, {{developed at}} the start of the 20th century, consists of a funnel emptying into a <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder,</b> 2 cm in radius, which fits inside a larger container which is 20 cm in diameter and 50 cm tall. If the rainwater overflows the graduated inner cylinder, the larger outer container will catch it. When measurements are taken, the height of the water in the small <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> is measured, and the excess overflow in the large container is carefully poured into another <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> and measured to give the total rainfall. Sometimes a cone meter is used to prevent leakage that can result in alteration of the data. In locations using the metric system, the cylinder is usually marked in mm and will measure up to 250 mm of rainfall. Each horizontal line on the cylinder is 0.5 mm. In areas using Imperial units each horizontal line represents 0.01 inch.|$|E
5000|$|I H N {{traditional}} <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> (A in the image) {{is usually}} narrow and tall {{so as to}} increase the accuracy and precision of volume measurement; it has a plastic or glass bottom and a [...] "spout" [...] for easy pouring of the measured liquid.

5000|$|Scoopula is a {{brand name}} of a spatula-like scoop utensil used {{primarily}} in chemistry lab settings to transfer solids: to a weigh paper for weighing, to a cover slip to measure melting point, or a <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder,</b> or to a watch glass from a flask or beaker through scraping. [...] "Scoopula" [...] is a registered trademark owned by Thermo Fisher Scientific. They are very often made of metal.|$|E
50|$|Nalgene is a {{brand of}} plastic {{products}} developed originally for laboratory use, including such items as jars, bottles, test tubes, <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and Petri dishes, that were shatterproof and lighter than glass.

50|$|Two {{classes of}} {{accuracy}} exist for <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Class A has double {{the accuracy of}} class B.Cylinders can have single or double scales. Single scales allow to read the volume {{from top to bottom}} (filling volume) while double scale cylinders allow reading for filling and pouring (reverse scale).|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Nalgene line {{included such}} items as jars, bottles, test tubes, <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and Petri dishes helpful to laboratory workers, chemists, and biologists because they were shatterproof and lighter than glass.

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of ways {{stemflow}} volume is measured in the field. The most common direct measurement currently used is the bonding of bisected PVC or other plastic tubing around the circumference of the tree trunk, connected and funneled into a <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> for manual or a tipping bucket rain gauge for automatic collection. At times the tubing is wrapped multiple times around the trunk is order to ensure more complete collection.|$|E

50|$|Beakers {{are often}} graduated, that is, {{marked on the}} side with lines {{indicating}} the volume contained. For instance, a 250 mL beaker might be marked with lines to indicate 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mL of volume. These marks are not intended for obtaining a precise measurement of volume (a <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> or a volumetric flask {{would be a more}} appropriate instrument for such a task), but rather an estimation. Most beakers are accurate to within ~10%.|$|E
30|$|The Krafft {{temperature}} {{was measured by}} the naked eye with known concentrations of aqueous solution of the synthesized gemini surfactant. This surfactant solution was taken in glass-stoppered <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders</b> and kept in a refrigerator for 24  h, after that the cylinder was taken out and the {{temperature was}} noticed when a clear solution was obtained [19].|$|R
30|$|Biometric {{parameters}} such as plant height (cm; PH) and culm diameter (mm; CD) {{of maize}} plants were determined {{with the aid}} of a digital caliper. In the case of wheat, the number of tillers (NT) was determined. For both crops, root volume was determined by measuring water displacement caused by immersion of the root systems in a <b>graduate</b> <b>cylinder</b> with a known volume of water.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Graduated</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{calibrated}} either “to contain” (indicated {{liquid volume}} inside the cylinder) and marked as [...] "TC" [...] or “to deliver” (indicated liquid volume poured out, accounting for liquid traces {{left in the}} cylinder) and marked “TD”. Formerly the tolerances for “to deliver” and “to contain” cylinders are distinct; however now these are the same. Also, the international symbols “IN” and “EX” {{are more likely to}} be used instead of “TC” and “TD” respectively.|$|R
50|$|A Mohr pipette, {{also known}} as a {{graduated}} pipette, is a type of pipette used to measure the volume of the liquid dispensed, although not as accurately as a volumetric pipette. These use a series of marked lines (as on a <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder)</b> to indicate the different volumes. They {{come in a variety of}} sizes, and are used much like a burette, in that the volume is found by calculating the difference of the liquid level before and after.|$|E
50|$|Mixing {{cylinders}} (B in the picture) have {{ground glass}} joints {{instead of a}} spout, {{so they can be}} closed with a stopper or connect directly with other elements of a manifold. With this kind of cylinder, the metered liquid does not pour directly, but is often removed using a cannula. A <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> is meant to be read with the surface of the liquid at eye level, where the center of the meniscus shows the measurement line. Typical capacities of graduated cylinders are from 10 mL to 1000 mL.|$|E
5000|$|Graduated {{pipettes}} are {{a type of}} macropipette {{consisting of}} a long tube {{with a series of}} graduations, as on a <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinder</b> or burette, to indicate different calibrated volumes. They also require a source of vacuum; {{in the early days of}} chemistry and biology, the mouth was used. The safety regulations included the statement: [...] "Never pipette by mouth KCN, NH3, strong acids, bases and mercury salts". Some pipettes were manufactured with two bubbles between the mouth piece and the solution level line, to protect the chemist from accidental swallowing of the solution.|$|E
50|$|Wet {{chemistry}} commonly uses {{laboratory glassware}} such as beakers and <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders</b> to prevent materials from being contaminated or interfered with by unintended sources. Gasoline, Bunsen burners, and crucibles {{may also be}} used to evaporate and isolate substances in their dry forms. Wet chemistry is not performed with any advanced instruments since most automatically scan substances. Although, simple instruments such as scales are used to measure the weight of a substance before and after a change occurs. Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods.|$|R
30|$|The foam was {{generated}} using pure nitrogen (N 2) for this study. Though CO 2 has a broader field application, it was avoided due to significant water solubility and corrosiveness issues, {{though it has}} been used in some research studies. The literature suggests that stronger foam can be generated with N 2 which is also more compatible with different types of surfactants as compared to CO 2 (Farajzadeh et al. 2009; Farzaneh and Sohrabi 2013). Figure  2 shows the <b>graduated</b> <b>cylinders</b> used in bulk foam stability tests with a steel tube inserted from the top to the base for gas injection {{from the bottom of the}} cylinder.|$|R
