25|$|The Spanish {{king was}} distraught {{by the news}} and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no {{possibility}} a third armada could be attempted. He afterwards fell ill, went into a palsy and shut himself away in his palace. Bonfires and processions all over Spain were lit {{in the hope of}} his health returning. Before he had been taken ill, Philip had decided that he only wanted peace. His health did not improve and he resultingly died the following year.|$|E
25|$|Vang Pao now had {{the month}} of June before the U.S. {{tactical}} air power available to him would drastically diminish. He also had problematic military politics to consider. General William Westmoreland, U.S. Army (USA), had more clout in Washington, D.C. than General Vang Pao, Royal Lao Army (RLA). Westmoreland favored Vang Pao's fighting a holding action while awaiting a ceasefire. Vang Pao knew that his hodge podge irregular army of tribal guerrillas and Thai mercenaries were the last Royalist fighting forces in the Kingdom. And with a decade of experience in trying to hold fixed positions with guerrillas, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little chance L'Armee Clandestine could stand off a combined arms assault by PAVN regulars. Yet with the RLA regulars no longer waging war, L'Armee Clandestine was the Kingdom's last defense.|$|E
25|$|After Michael returns, {{he becomes}} the new Don, with Vito retiring, and shortly thereafter, dying. Michael {{promotes}} Aldo to Caporegime. Learning the FBI are conducting {{an investigation into the}} Corleones, Michael sends Aldo and Monk {{to find out what they}} know. When Aldo arrives at the hotel used by the FBI, Monk tells him Michael has learned a Corleone informant is meeting with the FBI at that moment, and they are to kill him. They storm the hotel, and Monk kills a lone FBI agent, before fleeing. Aldo realizes that Monk himself is the informant. Michael calls, telling Aldo <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an informant but was unsure if it was Monk or Aldo, and the job was a ruse to smoke out the culprit. Aldo pursues Monk, who explains he became disillusioned in the Corleones after Frankie's death, and allied with the Cuneo family. Furious with Monk's betrayal, Aldo kills him.|$|E

25|$|While {{the allies}} were at Brussels making dispositions to {{march to the}} relief of Mons, Saxe slipped down the Scheldt with {{the main body of}} the army towards his real target; one column on the left bank of the river, and two columns on the right to cover the march and engage the allies in battle. The capture of Tournai would {{consolidate}} and extend the gains that had been made in the previous campaign, and provide the French with the key to the approaches of Ghent and Oudenarde, threatening British communications with Ostend and the sea. Yet the siege was also a decoy for a much more original manoeuvre – the prompt engagement of the enemy in a place favourable to the French army, and at a time before the allies could reach their full strength. Although Saxe favoured movement over siege warfare <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing more likely to provoke an early encounter than to threaten one of the allies' larger fortresses, which only the most confident and able commander could ignore.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2011, Davis {{was traded}} with pitcher Tommy Hunter to the Baltimore Orioles for {{reliever}} Koji Uehara. Davis became expendable because the Rangers felt Moreland {{was a better}} option at first base; Rangers' general manager Jon Daniels said {{the day of the}} trade that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a possibility Davis could turn into a high-impact offensive player and [...] "If he does, we'll live with it." [...] Opinions differ as to Davis's inability to hold a consistent starting role with the Rangers; while one popular theory is that it was because of his many strikeouts and low batting average, Orioles' manager Buck Showalter believes it was due to the presence of Moreland and Adrián Beltré in Texas. Davis said, [...] "I'm glad to get the opportunity to come here", citing his desire to play every day.|$|E
500|$|With {{the loss}} of the ship the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival. [...] Shackleton's {{intention}} now was to march the crew westward, to one or other of several possible destinations. His first thought was for Paulet Island, where <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12years earlier while organising relief for Otto Nordenskiöld’s stranded Swedish expedition. Other possibilities were Snow Hill Island, which had been Nordenskiöld’s winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies, [...] or Robertson Island. Shackleton believed that from one of these islands {{they would be able to}} reach and cross Graham Land, and get to the whaling outposts in Wilhelmina Bay. He calculated that on the day Endurance [...] was abandoned they were 346 miles from Paulet Island. Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be , with a further [...] to Wilhelmina Bay. He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton overruled him.|$|E

500|$|This ample {{provision}} {{arose from}} the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended his original gift of seed money to an undertaking {{to cover the costs}} of the entire expedition. The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as [...] "about £100,000". Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt. According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: [...] "His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no prospect of financial return, and what he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton." [...] His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition. Rowett was, according to Huntford, [...] "a stodgy, prosaic looking" [...] businessman, who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in Aberdeen known as the Rowett Research Institute (now part of the University of Aberdeen). He had also endowed dental research work at the Middlesex Hospital.|$|E
2500|$|After he {{had already}} {{explored}} all {{that had previously been}} discovered, Bishop began to grow bored with the cave. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> more out there, but there was a limit to how far the more experienced guides would go. The farthest anyone had been in the cave was to the bottomless pit: a massive hole of darkness. None would dare venture near the pit for fear of being lost forever in its depths. Bishop was brave and his curiosity was greater than his fear. Along with a guest who was equally as curious and daring as Bishop, the two men journeyed to the pit. With the help of an old ladder found nearby, they laid it across the gaping mouth of the pit and slowly ventured across the ladder. What the two men discovered opened up a whole new part of the cave. A short way further from the pit Bishop discovered a river. This was the first body of water that had ever been encountered in the cave. [...] As he explored the river he found eyeless fish: something that no one had ever heard about at this time. This brought scientists to the cave to study the new creature. Some of the most popular areas of the cave were both discovered and named by Bishop after crossing the bottomless pit.|$|E
