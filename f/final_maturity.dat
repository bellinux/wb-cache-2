2500|$|There {{is a time}} {{dimension}} {{to the analysis of}} bond values. [...] A 10-year bond at purchase becomes a 9-year bond a year later, and the year after it becomes an 8-year bond, etc. Each year the bond moves incrementally closer to maturity, resulting in lower volatility and shorter duration and demanding a lower interest rate when the yield curve is rising. Since falling rates create increasing prices, the value of a bond initially will rise as the lower rates of the shorter maturity become its new market rate. Because a bond is always anchored by its <b>final</b> <b>maturity,</b> the price at some point must change direction and fall to par value at redemption.|$|E

That is, their prices will be affected equally by small, first-order, (and parallel) yield curve shifts. They will, however, start to change by different amounts with each further incremental parallel rate shift due to their differing payment dates and amounts.|$|R

50|$|Since the Z-spread {{uses the}} entire yield curve to value the {{individual}} cash flows of a bond, {{it provides a}} more-realistic valuation than an interpolated yield spread based on a single point of the curve, such as the bond's <b>final</b> <b>maturity</b> date or weighted-average life. However, the Z-spread does not incorporate variability in cash flows, so a fuller valuation of an interest-rate-dependent security often requires the more-realistic (and more-complicated) option-adjusted spread.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of plant population differentiation may be integral in predicting aspects of introduced species invasion. In the present study, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that European populations of Senecio inaequidens (Asteraceae), an invasive species with South African origins, differentiated during migration from two independent introduction sites into divergent altitudinal and climatic zones. We carried out 2 years of common garden experiments with eight populations sampled from Belgian and ten populations from French altitudinal transects. The Belgian transect followed a temperature and precipitation gradient. A temperature and summer drought gradient characterized the French transect. We evaluated differentiation and clinal variation in plants germinated from field-collected seed using the following traits: days to germination, days to flowering, height at <b>maturity,</b> <b>final</b> plant height and aboveground biomass. Results showed that S. inaequidens populations differentiated in growth traits during invasion. During the 1 st year of sampling, the results indicated clinal variation for growth traits along both the Belgium and French altitudinal transects. Data from the 2 nd year of study demonstrated that with increasing altitude, a reduction in three growth traits, including plant height at <b>maturity,</b> <b>final</b> plant height and aboveground biomass, was detected along the French transect, but no longer along the Belgian one. Phenological traits did not exhibit a clear clinal variation along altitudinal transects. The possible evolutionary causes for the observed differentiation are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The FX-G10 includes all Euro members, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Norway and Sweden. Original issue zero coupon bonds, 144a securities (both with and without registration rights), and pay-in-kind securities (including toggle notes) are included in the index. Callable perpetual securities are included provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities are included provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Contingent capital securities (“cocos”) are excluded, but capital securities where conversion can be mandated by a regulatory authority, but which have no specified trigger, are included. Other hybrid capital securities, such as those legacy issues that potentially convert into preference shares, those with both cumulative and non-cumulative coupon deferral provisions, and those with alternative coupon satisfaction mechanisms, are also included in the index. Securities issued or marketed primarily to retail investors, equity-linked securities, securities in legal default, hybrid securitized corporates, eurodollar bonds (USD securities not issued in the US domestic market), taxable and tax-exempt US municipal securities and DRD-eligible securities are excluded from the index.|$|E
50|$|Subordinated debt is classed as Lower Tier 2 debt, {{usually has}} a {{maturity}} of {{a minimum of}} 10 years and ranks senior to Tier 1 debt, but subordinate to senior debt. To ensure {{that the amount of}} capital outstanding doesn't fall sharply once a Lower Tier 2 issue matures and, for example, not be replaced, the regulator demands that the amount that is qualifiable as Tier 2 capital amortises (i.e. reduces) on a straight line basis from maturity minus 5 years (e.g. a 1bn issue would only count as worth 800m in capital 4 years before maturity). The remainder qualifies as senior issuance. For this reason many Lower Tier 2 instruments were issued as 10 year non-call 5 year issues (i.e. <b>final</b> <b>maturity</b> after 10 years but callable after 5 years). If not called, issue has a large step - similar to Tier 1 - thereby making the call more likely.|$|E
40|$|Background Good {{decision-making}} requires {{gathering and}} using sufficient information. Several knowledge translation platforms {{have been introduced}} in Burkina Faso to support evidence-informed decision-making. One {{of these is the}} rapid response service for health. This platform aims to provide quick access for policy-makers in Burkina Faso to highquality research evidence about health systems. The {{purpose of this study is}} to describe the process and extent of the institutionalization of the rapid response service. Methods A qualitative case study design was used, drawing on interviews with policy-makers, together with documentary analysis. Previously used institutionalization frameworks were combined to guide the analysis. Results Burkina Faso’s rapid response service has largely reached the consolidation phase of the institutionalization process but not yet the <b>final</b> phase of <b>maturity.</b> The impetus for the project came from designated project leaders, who convinced policy-makers of the importance of the rapid response service, and obtained resources to run a pilot. During the expansion stage, additional policy-makers at national and sub-national levels began to use the service. Unit staff also tried to improve the way it was delivered, based on lessons learned during the pilot stage. The service has, however, stagnated at the consolidation stage, and not moved into the <b>final</b> phase of <b>maturity.</b> Conclusion The institutionalization process for the rapid response service in Burkina Faso has been fluid rather than linear, with some areas developing faster than others. The service has reached the consolidation stage, but now requires additional efforts to reach maturity...|$|R

50|$|Depending on the temperature, {{the larvae}} moult after 4.5 - 7.5 {{days into the}} first nymphal stage. Once leaving the cocoon through an opening, {{they live in a}} {{protective}} web made by the mother, where they feed on the leftover yolk from their eggs and drink from water droplets. After about a week, the nymphs start suspending themselves from their own spider silk and start preying on fruit flies. This usually happens in the sixth or seventh nymphal stage. Cannibalism does not occur in the first few days, but occurs in later stages. The whole nymphal stage is divided into 12 stages at most. Male spiders become sexually mature in the 9th to 11th stages, females in the 10th to 12th stages. Temperature can influence the development and number of stages, with colder temperatures slowing down the process. Under good conditions, spiders can complete their nymphal development in fewer than 12 stages. The duration from prelarval stage to <b>final</b> moult (<b>maturity)</b> typically lasts 257 days for males (stage 10) and 289 days for females (stage 11). Adulthood is the period after final moult till death. Females live longer than males, the record being 247 days for females and 186.5 days for males.|$|R

The cows must have fed on local, natural foodstuffs.The milk is coagulated by using animal products, fermenting products are also used along with calcium chloride. The milk is heated to a temperature of 30 - 35 C for the coagulation, this takes about 45 minutes. The curd is then cut with lyres and the temperature is raised by 2 °C {{and at the same}} time the curd is stirred for a minimum of 10 minutes, until it has become coarsely granular, the grains being the size of a hazel nut. It is then left to rest for about 10 minutes. Next the broken curd is put into sacking bags or plastic containers with fine holes to allow the whey to drain. The cheese is then placed in ventilated rooms at 15 - 20 C for 3 or more days during which they are turned over daily. The cheese is then moulded into its characteristic shape either manually or mechanically. At this time a little salt is added. It is then stored in ventilated rooms for a period of between 5 days to 2 weeks, each piece being turned over daily. Finally the cheeses are given another pressing to give them an aesthetic appearance and the decoration and the mark of the manufacturer is added on the rind. They are left a further 2 more days in the ventilating room. The final maturation takes place in a room between 8 - 10 C and a humidity of 80%. A period of 2 months is necessary between the coagulation of the milk and <b>final</b> <b>maturity.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{constant}} maturity {{credit default swap}} (CMCDS) {{is a type of}} credit derivative product, similar to a standard credit default swap (CDS). Addressing CMCDS typically requires prior understanding of credit default swaps. In a CMCDS the protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller (these payments constitute the premium leg), and in return receives a payoff (protection or default leg) if an underlying financial instrument defaults. Differently from a standard CDS, the premium leg of a CMCDS does not pay a fixed and pre-agreed amount but a floating spread, using a traded CDS as a reference index. More precisely, given a pre-assigned time-to-maturity, at any payment instant of the premium leg the rate that is offered is indexed at a traded CDS spread on the same reference credit existing in that moment for the pre-assigned time-to-maturity (hence the name [...] "{{constant maturity}}" [...] CDS). The default or protection leg is mostly the same as the leg of a standard CDS. Often CMCDS are expressed in terms of participation rate. The participation rate may be defined as the ratio between the present value of the premium leg of a standard CDS with the same <b>final</b> <b>maturity</b> and the present value of the premium leg of the constant maturity CDS. CMCDS may be combined with CDS on the same entity to take only spread risk and not default risk on an entity. Indeed, as the default leg is the same, buying a CDS and selling a CMCDS or vice versa will offset the default legs and leave only the difference in the premium legs, that are driven by spread risk. Valuation of CMCDS has been explored by Damiano Brigo (2004) and Anlong Li (2006) ...|$|E
