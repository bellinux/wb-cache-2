5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E
5|$|The leopard {{catshark}} is {{the smaller}} and slimmer {{of the two}} Poroderma species. The head and snout are short and slightly flattened, with a somewhat pointed snout tip. Each nostril is split <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> incurrent and excurrent openings by a three-lobed flap of skin in front, of which the central lobe forms a slender barbel that reaches past the mouth. The horizontally oval eyes are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and placed rather high on the head, with a thick ridge running under each. The mouth is wide and arched, with short furrows at the corners extending onto both jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1830 and 1326 tooth rows {{on either side of}} the upper and lower jaws respectively. The teeth have a narrow central cusp with a pair of small lateral cusplets; those of adult males are slightly more curved than those of females.|$|E

25|$|The mucosa, {{the outer}} {{portion of the}} {{gallbladder}} wall, consists of a lining of a single layer of columnar cells, with cells possessing small hair-like attachments called microvilli. This sits on a thin later of connective tissue, the lamina propria. The mucosa is curved and collected <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> outpouchings called rugae.|$|E
50|$|A {{mulching}} blade, {{also known}} as an all-purpose blade, features a curved surface which allows it to work in three ways: lifting, mowing, and mulching. First, the blade pulls the grass up and cuts it. Then, clippings are sucked inside the deck and are chopped <b>into</b> <b>tinier</b> pieces. Finally, the blade’s innermost curve produces air pressure to blow the small clippings out, where {{they are used to}} feed the soil.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{materials}} with a nonzero spin density are molecular fluids, the electromagnetic field and turbulent fluids. For molecular fluids, the individual molecules may be spinning. The electromagnetic field can have circularly polarized light. For turbulent fluids, we may arbitrarily {{make a distinction}} between long wavelength phenomena and short wavelength phenomena. A long wavelength vorticity may be converted via turbulence <b>into</b> <b>tinier</b> and tinier vortices transporting the angular momentum into smaller and smaller wavelengths while simultaneously reducing the vorticity. This can be approximated by the eddy viscosity.|$|R

25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used in the seat belt {{pre-tensioner}} system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> Wankel engines which rotate to take up the slack in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.|$|E

However, in Tik-Tok of Oz Baum suggested that Oz people could go on living after being eaten and digested, and also that Nomes would continue to live after being cut <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> pieces, which disproves the destruction theory.|$|E
25|$|Fog {{begins to}} form when water vapor {{condenses}} <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> liquid water droplets {{suspended in the}} air. Six examples of ways that water vapor {{is added to the}} air are by wind convergence into areas of upward motion; precipitation or virga falling from above; daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies, or wet land; transpiration from plants; cool or dry air moving over warmer water; and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Fog, like its elevated cousin stratus, is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.|$|E

25|$|As the {{population}} of St. Louis County grew, local subdivisions began multiplying and incorporating <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> cities and towns, producing more than 90 separate municipalities by the 1960s. Those in favor of regional planning found some success, however, in the 1965 creation of the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, a regional council given the power to advance applications for federal aid from cities in the region. Among the more controversial proposals {{to come from the}} East-West Council was the proposal to build a second regional airport, located somewhere on the Illinois side of the region. In spite of initial approval for the plan in the 1976, Secretary of the Interior Brock Adams canceled the airport project in 1977 under political pressure from Missourians, who feared a loss of business at Lambert International Airport.|$|E
25|$|Chinese patent {{medicine}} (traditional Chinese: 中成藥, Simplified Chinese: 中成药, pinyin: zhōngchéng yào) {{is a kind}} {{of traditional}} Chinese medicine. They are standardized herbal formulas. From ancient times, pills were formed by combining several herbs and other ingredients, which were dried and ground into a powder. They were then mixed with a binder and formed into pills by hand. The binder was traditionally honey. Modern teapills, however, are extracted in stainless steel extractors to create either a water decoction or water-alcohol decoction, depending on the herbs used. They are extracted at a low temperature (below 100 degrees Celsius) to preserve essential ingredients. The extracted liquid is then further condensed, and some raw herb powder from one of the herbal ingredients is mixed in to form an herbal dough. This dough is then machine cut <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> pieces, a small amount of excipients are added for a smooth and consistent exterior, and they are spun into pills. Teapills are characteristically little round black pills.|$|E
25|$|In {{most species}} of caridean shrimp, the females lay 50,000 to 1 million eggs, which hatch after some 24 hours <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> nauplii. These nauplii feed on yolk {{reserves}} within {{their bodies and}} then undergo a metamorphosis into zoeae. This second larval stage feeds in the wild on algae {{and after a few}} days metamorphoses again into the third stage to become myses. At this stage, the myses already begin to appear like tiny versions of fully developed adults and feed on algae and zooplankton. After another three to four days, they metamorphose a final time into postlarvae: young shrimp having all the characteristics of adults. The whole process takes about 12 days from hatching. In the wild, the marine postlarvae then migrate into estuaries, which are rich in nutrients and low in salinity. There they grow and eventually migrate back into open waters when they mature. Most adult carideans are benthic animals living primarily on the sea floor.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} of an {{anadromous}} salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a gravel bed in {{the upper reaches of}} a stream or river. These are the salmon spawning grounds where salmon eggs are deposited, for safety, in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> larvae called sac fry or alevin. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on plankton. At this point the baby salmon are called fry. At {{the end of the summer}} the fry develop into juvenile fish called parr. Parr feed on small invertebrates and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars. They remain in this stage for up to three years.|$|E

500|$|Among Bedouins {{and most}} other Arabs {{throughout}} the region of Palestine, bitter coffee, known as qahwah sadah (Lit. plain coffee), {{was a symbol of}} hospitality. Pouring the drink was ceremonial; it would involve the host or his eldest son moving clockwise among guests—who were judged by age and status—pouring coffee <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> cups from a brass pot.

500|$|Auricularia auricula-judae has a soft, jelly-like texture. Though edible, it was {{not held}} in high culinary regard in the west for many years. It has been likened to [...] "eating an Indian rubber with bones in it", while in 19th-century Britain, {{it was said that}} [...] "it has never been {{regarded}} here as an edible fungus". It has a mild flavour, and is useful for mixed mushroom recipes, but is still considered bland in the west. It can be dried and rehydrated, sometimes swelling to a very large size. Young specimens are best, but the species is not edible when raw, needing to be cooked thoroughly. The whole fruit body can be eaten, but should be thoroughly washed before cooking. Cooking can sometimes take a comparatively long time. The nutritional content of 100g (3.5oz) of dried fungus includes 370kcal, 10.6g of protein, 0.2g of fat, 65g of carbohydrate, 5.8g ash, and 0.03%mg of carotene. Fresh mushrooms contain about 90% moisture. [...] Dried specimens may be ground up into a powder and used to absorb excess liquid in soups and stews, as it rehydrates <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> fragments.|$|E
500|$|The pyjama shark is {{the larger}} and thicker-bodied {{of the two}} Poroderma species, growing to [...] long and [...] or more in weight. Both sexes grow to roughly the same maximum size. The head and snout are short and {{slightly}} flattened, with a narrowly parabolic outline when viewed from above or below. Each nostril is split <b>into</b> <b>tiny</b> incurrent and excurrent openings by a flap of skin in front; the flap has a three-lobed shape with the central lobe forming a long, conical barbel. The barbels are thicker than in the leopard catshark, and do not reach the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed rather high on the head, with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids) and a thick ridge running underneath. The sizable mouth forms a broad arch, with short furrows extending from the corners onto both {{the upper and lower}} jaws; the upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. There are 1825 and 1424 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively. The teeth have a slender central cusp flanked by a pair of small cusplets; those of adult males are slightly thicker than those of females.|$|E
