50|$|February 28 - April 19, 1993. Heavily armed {{members of}} the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect</b> engaged federal agents of the BATF in an intense firefight during a raid of their {{compound}} building, initiating a 51-day siege by the FBI near Waco, Texas.|$|E
50|$|Charlie (Hieronymus) Pace {{is named}} after the Austrian theologian and {{historian}} Hieronymus Pez. This {{is in keeping with}} many of the characters in Lost who are named after famous philosophers and theologians, although the name Charlie Pace is also the name of one early member of the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect</b> that was raided in Waco, TX in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The Branch <b>Davidians</b> <b>sect</b> {{evolved from}} the Seventh-Day Adventists Church. David Koresh, {{who died in the}} {{well-known}} Waco Siege in 1993, in 1983 claimed to be their final prophet and [...] "the Son of God, the Lamb".|$|R

50|$|In 1995 Gallagher and James D. Tabor, an {{associate}} professor of religious studies at the University of North Carolina, co-authored Why Waco? Cults and the Battle for Religious Freedom in America. The book blamed the 1993 Waco siege, which resulted in the deaths of 76 members of the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect,</b> partly on misunderstanding of religious issues by law enforcement personnel.|$|E
5000|$|George Roden (January 17, 1938 [...] - [...] December 6, 1998), was {{a leader}} of the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect,</b> a Seventh-day Adventist {{splinter}} group, and the former husband of Amo Bishop Roden. In 1987, he was evicted from the Mount Carmel Center near Waco, Texas by his rival David Koresh. He was later confined in a Texas mental hospital for a 1989 murder, until his own death.|$|E
50|$|The Ken Ballew raid, and in {{particular}} some of the statements made {{in support of the}} raid by gun control advocates, radicalized many gun rights advocates in the 1970s. The Ballew raid is also notable because it formed the context of much of the reaction to subsequent federal raids at Ruby Ridge, Idaho (21-31 Aug 1992) against the Weaver family and at Waco, Texas (28 Feb-19 Apr 1993) against the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} 12" [...] {{version was}} pressed on sky-blue vinyl. The four track collection weaved the pair's now familiar motifs of nature, childhood and madness around a central theme: the Branch <b>Davidian</b> religious <b>sect</b> and their Waco retreat.|$|R
50|$|The Waco siege was a {{siege of}} a {{compound}} {{belonging to the}} group Branch Davidians by American federal and Texas state law enforcement and US military between February 28 and April 19, 1993. The Branch <b>Davidians,</b> a <b>sect</b> that separated in 1955 from the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was led by David Koresh and lived at Mount Carmel Center ranch {{in the community of}} Elk, Texas, nine miles (14 kilometers) east-northeast of Waco. The group was suspected of weapons violations, causing a search and arrest warrant to be obtained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).|$|R
50|$|The second {{incident}} was the Waco Siege of the Branch <b>Davidian</b> religious <b>sect</b> near Waco, Texas, on February 28, 1993. ATF agents, {{accompanied by the}} press, conducted a raid to execute a federal search warrant on the sect's compound, known as Mt. Carmel. The Branch Davidians were alerted to the upcoming warrant execution but ATF raid leaders pressed on, despite knowing the advantage of surprise was lost. (ATF Director Steve Higgins had promised Treasury Under Secretary for Enforcement Ron Noble that the Waco raid would be canceled if the ATF undercover agent Robert Rodriguez reported that {{the element of surprise}} had been lost.) The resulting exchange of gunfire killed six Davidians and four ATF agents. FBI HRT later took over the scene and a 51-day stand-off ensued, ending on April 19, 1993, after the complex caught fire. The follow-up investigation revealed the bodies of seventy-six people including twenty children inside the compound. A grand jury found that the deaths were suicides or otherwise caused by people inside the building. Shortly after the raid, the bureau's director, Stephen E. Higgins, retired early from his position.|$|R

5000|$|Initially, when {{producers}} Hamsher and Murphy {{had first}} brought the script to Stone's attention, {{he had seen}} it as an action film; [...] "something Arnold Schwarzenegger would be proud of." [...] As the project developed however, incidents such as the O.J. Simpson case, the Menendez brothers case, the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan incident, the Rodney King incident, and the Federal assault of the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect</b> all took place. Stone came {{to feel that the}} media was heavily involved in the outcome of all of these cases, and that the media had become an all-pervasive entity which marketed violence and suffering for the good of ratings. As such, he changed the tone of the movie from one of simple action to a satirical critique of the media in general. Also coloring Stone's approach, and contributing to the violent nature of the film, were the anger and sadness he felt at the breakdown of his second marriage. He also {{said in an interview that}} the film was influenced by the [...] "vitality" [...] of Indian cinema. He let Rodney Dangerfield write or rewrite all of his own character's lines.|$|E
50|$|The Tribune-Herald is {{best known}} for a series of stories in February and March 1993 about the Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect</b> which was {{headquartered}} in a compound in Mount Carmel, near Waco. The series reported that leader Vernon Howell, later known as David Koresh, had turned the group into a cult, engaged in polygamy, abused children living in the compound, and was amassing an arsenal of weapons. The Tribune-Herald had been reporting {{on a number of issues}} about the compound in the months before the series. Federal authorities asked managing editor Barbara Elmore to hold off on the series, but she refused, and the first of seven parts was published on February 27, 1993. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was planning a raid on the compound on March 1, with warrants for Koresh and several followers, but the raid was moved up a day in response to the Tribune-Herald series. The raid turned deadly, as the Davidians were tipped off early and were expecting the federal agents. A shootout occurred, leading to a 51-day siege that ended in an attack on the compound, which resulted in its fiery destruction that was seen live by television viewers around the world.|$|E
40|$|Strategically {{placed with}} the right degree of {{persistence}} and ‘sympathetic vibration’, sound can reveal itself as a potentially devastating force. As used against the Branch <b>Davidian</b> religious <b>sect</b> in 1993 at Waco Texas, the FBI’s little remembered ‘sonic assault’ – involving Tibetan monks in prayer, dentist drills, and other bizarre recordings – arguably contributed to the tragic denouement of events as they were witnessed live on TV by millions around the world. The use of sustained, high-pitched, loud or repetitive noises and music added to an already incendiary narrative endgame, established first by the sect but later supported by the media. This essay draws on this tragic event, and later ‘forensic’ research conducted by the author {{in the process of}} writing, scoring and producing an audio performance work, Cantata of Fire. Specifically, it explores the way in which amplified ‘concrete’ sound and electronic ‘viral’ voices were used as a weapon at Waco – materially, psychologically, theatrically and ‘diegetically’. And {{in the context of a}} much longer (and repressed) history of sound as used in ‘theatres of war’ and other conflicts, the author reconsiders the overlooked and underestimated powers of sound, music and noise in an age dominated by digital ‘real-time’ electronic media and ‘tele-visual’ surveillance. 11 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some of the}} {{the image}} processing techniques that were applied to seek {{an answer to the}} question whether agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were shooting at Branch <b>Davidian</b> <b>sect</b> members in the tragic event in Waco, Texas, U. S., 1993. The "flashes" seen on one of the surveillance videotapes were, by several experts, concluded to be gunfire. However, there were many reasons to question the correctness of that conclusion, such as {{the fact that some of}} the flashes appeared on a regular basis. The hypothesis for this work was that the flashes instead were caused by specular reflections and the technical approach was to analyze and compare the flashes spatial and temporal appearance. The result showed that the flashes were mainly caused by specular solar reflections and thereby they could not form evidence of gunfire. Further, the result highlights the importance of considering the characteristics of the imaging system within investigations that utilizes images as information source. This is to separate real data from other phenomena (such as solar reflections), distortions and artifacts in a correct manner. 1...|$|E
