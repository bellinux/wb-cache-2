5000|$|One {{means of}} {{exchange}} of angular momentum between the atmosphere and the non gaseous parts of the earth is evaporation and precipitation. Massive quantities of water are in continual flux between the oceans and the atmosphere. As the mass of water (vapour) rises its rotation must slow due to conservation of angular momentum. Equally when if falls as rain, its rate of rotation will increase to conserve angular momentum. Any net <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> of water mass from oceans to the atmosphere or the opposite implies {{a change in the}} speed of rotation of the solid/liquid Earth which will be reflected in LOD.|$|E
40|$|Taking {{departure}} in {{the premise}} that donor and recipient priorities differ {{with regard to the}} marginal costs and benefits associated with attacking global environmental externalities, and hence the relative importance attached to the global environment, this paper seeks to scrutinize specific <b>global</b> environmental <b>transfer</b> mechanisms in the light of proposed definitions of global environmental assistance and global environmental compensation. It is argued that most <b>global</b> environmental <b>transfer</b> mechanisms possess distinct compensatory elements, and that additionality of these transfers is essential {{in order to ensure that}} existing development assistance is not crowded out. Specifically, this should be achieved either directly through separation of funds for global environmental and local developmental purposes or indirectly through increased considerations for local development objectives directly in <b>global</b> environmental <b>transfer</b> design.

5000|$|All Finapres {{successor}} devices apply a <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> {{function for}} finger to brachial {{values and the}} Finometer Pro {{as well as the}} FInapres NOVA use an upper arm cuff as well. Besides a Height Correction Unit (HCU) is used, the upperarm cuff is only used ones in the beginning of every test, this because the Finapres technology uses a so-called Physiocalibration. The CNAP technology does not have this Physiocalibration for which regular inflating the upperarm cuff must be performed.This transfer function compensates damping up to 2.5 Hz with an amplification of the signal of 1.2. Hence, the devices generally increase the beat-to-beat values to 120% of the finger values. An exception is the Finometer - beside this global function it also considers the offset between finger and upper arm with a cuff.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, holding the International Conference on Qanats in Yazd drew {{a lot of}} {{attention}} to the qanats. In 2005 the Iranian government and UNESCO signed an agreement to set up the International Center on Qanats and Historic Hydraulic Structures (ICQHS) under the auspices of UNESCO. The main mission of this center is the recognition, transfer of knowledge and experiences, promotion of information and capacities with regard to all the aspects of qanat technology and related historic hydraulic structures. This mission aims to fulfill sustainable development of water resources and the application of the outcome of the activities in order to preserve historical and cultural values as well as the promotion of the public welfare within the communities whose existence depends on the rational exploitation of the resources and preservation of such historical structures. Another mission is to promote research and development to restore the qanats and other traditional historic hydraulic structures for sustainable development objectives through international co-operation and <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> of knowledge and technology.According to a report published in 2005 by the Water Resources Base Studies Department affiliated to the Ministry of Energy, there are 15 Regional Water Authorities throughout the country, based in 30 provinces, conducting research projects on water resources in 609 study sites. Each study site is the smallest research unit, containing one or several catchments. Out of 609 study sites, 214 sites with an overall area of 991,256 square kilometers have been declared as restricted regions, and 395 sites with an area of 630648 square kilometers are considered free. In the restricted regions there are 317,225 wells, qanats and springs that discharge 36,719 million cubic meters water a year, out of which 3409 million cubic meters is surplus to the aquifer capacity. This deficit in the volume of the aquifer reserves has led to a long-term groundwater level drop of 41 centimeters a year, on average. In the free regions, the number of wells, qanats and springs amounts to 241,091 with an output of 37,527 million cubic meters a year. Therefore, in 2005, in the country as a whole, there were 130,008 deep wells with a discharge of 31,403 million cubic meter, 33,8041 semi deep wells with a discharge of 13,491 million cubic meters, 34,355 qanats with a discharge of 8,212 million cubic meters, and 55,912 natural springs with a discharge of 21,240 million cubic meters.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{literature}} provides {{ample evidence that}} the <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> and local implementation of knowledge represents a key advantage for multinational corporations (MNCs), we lack comparable understanding as to whether knowledge-creating MNC parents can actively expand the absorptive capacity of their subsidiaries. Using a teacher-student lens, this study examines the combined impact of specific structural mechanisms and motivational processes by MNC parents {{on the ability of}} 216 subsidiaries to absorb parent-initiated marketing strategies. The findings reveal that MNC parents can indeed cultivate subsidiaries' ability to appropriate marketing knowledge through a combination of adopting specific social structures and investing in particular efforts. However, the effect of social structure on subsidiary absorptive capacity is indirect, and accounted for by the parents' intensity of effort. A number of theoretical implications emerge from the findings for research on absorptive capacity in relation {{to the role of the}} knowledge source, the need to examine organizational influences in relation to one another, and validating the original absorptive capacity dimensions. For managers in the global marketplace, the findings lead to the suggestion that MNCs devote attention to nurturing the absorptive capacities at different organizational levels in order to optimize the <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> of knowledge.

40|$|An exact {{and direct}} {{modeling}} technique is proposed for modeling of rotor-bearing systems with arbitrary selected degrees-of-freedom. This technique {{is based on}} the combination of the transfer and dynamic stiffness matrices. The technique differs from the usual combination methods in that the global dynamic stiffness matrix for the system or the subsystem is obtained directly by rearranging the corresponding <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> matrix. Therefore, the dimension of the global dynamic stiffness matrix is independent of the number of the elements or the substructures. In order to show the simplicity and efficiency of the method, two numerical examples are given...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new procedure {{to evaluate the}} <b>global</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient in orthogonal cutting. The knowledge of the actual heat transfer conditions is a fundamental issue {{as far as the}} life, tool wear and tool substitution interval are regarded. More in detail, an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach was utilised to model orthogonal cutting process and the numerical simulations were validated by making experimental tests for identifying cutting forces and internal tool temperatures. A mild steel was cut utilising both an uncoated (WC) and a coated (TiN) tool. On the basis of both experimental and simulative data, a consistent model of the <b>global</b> heat <b>transfer</b> coefficient as function of the local pressure and temperature at the tool-workpiece interface was developed...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{transfer}} of satellites between elliptic Keplerian orbits using Lyapunov stability theory specific to this problem. The construction of Lyapunov functions is {{based on the fact that}} a non-degenerate Keplerian orbit is uniquely described by its angular momentum and Laplace (- Runge-Lenz) vectors. We suggest a Lyapunov function, which gives a feedback controller such that the target elliptic orbit becomes a locally asymptotically stable periodic orbit in the closed-loop dynamics. We show how to perform a <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> between two arbitrary elliptic orbits based on the local transfer result. Finally, a second Lyapunov function is presented that works only for circular target orbits...|$|E

Making use of a suitable decimation scheme, inspired by real-space renormalization-group concepts, we obtain closed analytical expressions for the <b>global</b> <b>transfer</b> matrix and transmission coefficient for several resonant critical normal modes. The fractal structure of the frequency spectrum significantly influences both the cumulative contribution of the different normal modes to the thermal transport and the dependence of the thermal conductivity with the temperature over a wide temperature range. The role of resonant effects in the heat transport through the FQC is numerically and analytically discussed...|$|E
