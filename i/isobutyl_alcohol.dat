50|$|Tequila is a {{distilled}} beverage {{that is made}} from the fermentation of the sugars found from the blue agave plant once it has been cooked, the main sugar being fructose. Through the fermentation process, many factors influence the higher alcohol content of tequila, which are molecules such as <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol. These parameters include the type of yeast strain, {{the age of the}} agave plant itself, temperature, and the carbon/nitrogen ratio. However, the type of yeast strain used and the carbon/nitrogen factors have the biggest influence on the production of higher alcohols, this is not surprising as higher alcohol and ethanol production is an intrinsic property of the metabolism of each strain. The type of yeast most commonly found in tequila is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which contains many strains. For example, CF1 agaves, a type of yeast, produces much more ethanol than a strain of CF2, as the yeast's metabolism mechanisms differ from one another. This factor may be influenced from different agricultural practices that occur to cultivate the different yeasts strains. It was found that the higher the carbon/ nitrogen ratio, the higher the production of higher alcohols such as <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and isoamyl alcohol. A high ratio imparts that there is less nitrogen in the fermentation process, which results in deamination reactions of amino acids, leading to the synthesis of higher alcohols. The Ehrlich pathway is the name for this process, where a-ceto acids are decarboxylated and transformed to aldehydes and to higher alcohols. The temperature of the fermentation process also greatly effects the alcohol content of the resulting product. For example, a study conducted by Pinal et al. found that cultivating two strains at a temperature of 35 degrees as compared to a temperature of 30 degrees produced more isoamyl alcohol. The higher temperature suggests that this is a much more optimal condition for the yeast to ferment the {{distilled beverage}}. Lastly the age of the agave plant itself, the older the plant the greater the alcohol production. It was shown in a study that the concentration of amyl alcohol increased as the plant aged by a factor 30%. However, it is also found that there is a higher concentration of methanol found when using younger plants. This may be due to differences in agricultural practices that occur when taking care of plants of different ages.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Superabsorbent polymers, as raw {{material}} for disposable material, will cause environmental problems. One of the organic materials that used for superabsorbent is carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). Water hyacinth, which has a relatively high cellulose content, is potentially used as non-wood cellulose resources. Study on the synthesis of CMC from water hyacinth has been reported with a maximum degree of substitution (DS) of 0. 72 with isopropyl alcohol as solvent. There are opportunities {{to find the best}} solvent in order to obtain CMC from water hyacinth with higher DS. <b>Isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> which has lower polarity than isopropyl alcohol, is a potential solvent. By mixing <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> with other solvent which has good ability to swell the cellulose it is expected to reduce the effects of steric hindrance on the <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> the polarity of the solvent mixture is lower than isopropyl alcohol and water hyacinth-based CMC with a higher DS could be obtain. Synthesis of superabsorbent material from CMC with optimum DS will results in highest absorption capacity. With a broader range of DS value of CMC, the optimum DS is expected to be more easily determined. In addition, the water hyacinth-based CMC with a higher DS are expected to be more valuable.

30|$|Once a {{suitable}} piece of graphene has been deposited and identified using the procedure described above, {{the next step}} is to electrically contact the graphene with metal electrodes using e-beam lithography. We begin by spinning on a layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) e-beam resist and baking on a hotplate at 180 °C for 2 minutes. Then we use e-beam lithography to write a 2 mm by 2 mm grid of alignment marks at roughly the location of the graphene, and develop in a solution of methyl <b>isobutyl</b> ketone:isopropal <b>alcohol</b> (MIBK:IPA) 1 : 3 for 5 – 10 seconds. This quick development leaves alignment mark “holes” in the PMMA, which we use for alignment in the following e-beam lithography step, eliminating the need for metal alignment mark deposition or another PMMA spin step. Electrodes are patterned in this PMMA layer with e-beam lithography, using an optical image of the sample with the alignment mark holes for design and alignment. Thermal evaporation is then used to deposit 1 – 2 nm of chrome and 25 – 50 nm of gold, and the chip is placed in acetone overnight at room temperature for lift-off (Figure 1 (b)).|$|R

40|$|Beer is an {{extremely}} popular beverage worldwide, representing the third-most popular drink after water and tea. And barley is the major raw material used for beer production. However, various combinations of pesticides are widely used at several stages of barley culti¬vation and during post-harvest storage to control pest and fungal disease. Hence, traces of these pesticides might remain in the beer produced from the treated ingredients. Hence, monitoring trace levels of pesticide residues during beer brewing and investigated the effects of pesticide residue {{on the quality of}} beer is essential. First, the behavior and fate of 3 pesticides (triadimefon, malathion, and dichlorvos) and the main metabolites (triadimenol and malaoxon) during barley storage or beer processing were assessed using a pilot-plant equipment. The residues of all products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Field investigation of the dissipation rate kinetics for triadimefon and malathion during storage indicated that their half-life was twice as high when 5 times the recommended dosage was used. Milling had little effect on removing dichlorvos and malathion residues, whereas they were substantially removed when the spent grains were mashed. The calculated processing factors after processing were all < 1, indicating that the residual ratios of dichlorvos and malathion were reduced during the entire process. In conclusion, storage and processing extensively reduced pesticide residue levels in barley and beer; however, greater focus needs to be paid to the toxicity of their metabolites in commercial by-products. Then we selected the triadimefon as the target fungicide to further study its behavior, the dissipation kinetics of TF during fermentation mediated by two different yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae IAPPST 1401 (Y 1) and CICC 1202 (Y 2), and found that Y 2 promoted the degradation of TF. Response surface methodology was used to optimize fermentation process variables, in order to achieve the maximum removal rate of TF and the minimum production of its corresponding metabolite, triadimenol (TN). Triadimefon is also a widely used triazole fungicide with one chiral carbon center, Stereoselective degradation of triadimefon was found during barley storage, the half-life of S-(+) -triadimefon was 36. 5 d, 31. 5 d and 30. 1 d, while R-(-) -traidmefon was 69. 3 d, 53. 3 d and 33 d under 4 °C, 25 °C and 40 °C, respectively. During brewing process, both enantiomers of triadimefon were easily degraded. After fermentation, little triadimefon detected in the beer, while RS-(+) and SS-(-) -triadimenol were detectable. This research provides accurate information for evaluating the risk of food safety. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of triadimefon affect the quality and flavor of the fermented beer, The effect of triadimefon on yeast growth and the sensory quality of beer were studied. There were significant differences in sensory quality between beer samples fermented with and without triadimefon based on data obtained with an electronic tongue and nose. Such an effect was most likely underlain by changes in yeast fermentation activity, including decreased utilization of maltotriose and most amino acids, reduced production of <b>isobutyl</b> and isoamyl <b>alcohols,</b> and increased ethyl acetate content in the fungicide treated samples. Furthermore, yeast metabolic profiling by phenotype microarray and UPLC/TOF-MS showed that triadimefon caused significant changes in the metabolism of glutathione, phenylalanine and sphingolipids, and in sterol biosynthesis. Thus, triadimefon negatively affects beer sensory qualities by influencing the metabolic activity of S. cerevisiae during fermentation, emphasizing the necessity of stricter control over fungicide residues in brewing by the food industry...|$|R

Other sources of organic compounds in the reservoir (besides fermentation) included compounds (acetonitrile and ethanol) at least partially produced by active algal growth and associated bacteria. Melting snowpack and mountain streams that feed the reservoir also contained organic compounds similar to those found in the reservoir, however at lower levels. Most of the compounds at low concentrations had no effect on the growth of certain algae tested, however there was some indication that certain organics may have increased the net growth of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} chemical descriptors {{to distinguish}} Cuban from non-Cuban rums, analyses of 44 samples of rum from 15 different countries are described. To provide the chemical descriptors, {{analyses of the}} the mineral fraction, phenolic compounds, caramel, alcohols, acetic acid, ethyl acetate, ketones, and aldehydes were carried out. The analytical data were treated through the following chemometric methods: principal component analysis (PCA), partial least square-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA), and linear discriminate analysis (LDA). These analyses indicated 23 analytes as relevant chemical descriptors for the separation of rums into two distinct groups. The possibility of clustering the rum samples investigated through PCA analysis led to an accumulative percentage of 70. 4 % {{in the first three}} principal components, and isoamyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, copper, iron, 2 -furfuraldehyde (furfuraldehyde), phenylmethanal (benzaldehyde), epicatechin, and vanillin were used as chemical descriptors. By applying the PLS-DA technique to the whole set of analytical data, the following analytes have been selected as descriptors: acetone, sec-butyl alcohol, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> ethyl acetate, methanol, isoamyl alcohol, magnesium, sodium, lead, iron, manganese, copper, zinc, 4 -hydroxy 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzaldehyde (syringaldehyde), methaldehyde (formaldehyde), 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 furfuraldehyde (5 -HMF), acetalclehyde, 2 -furfuraldehyde, 2 -butenal (crotonaldehyde), n-pentanal (valeraldehyde), iso-pentanal (isovaleraldehyde), benzaldehyde, 2, 3 -butanodione monoxime, acetylacetone, epicatechin, and vanillin. By applying the LIDA technique, a model was developed, and the following analytes were selected as descriptors: ethyl acetate, sec-butyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> caramel, catechin, vanillin, epicatechin, manganese, acetalclehyde, 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxybenzoic acid, 2 -butenal, 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxybenzoic acid, cyclopentanone, acetone, lead, zinc, calcium, barium, strontium, and sodium. This model allowed the discrimination of Cuban rums from the others with 88. 2 % accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of <b>isobutyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> ((BuOH) -Bu-i) from methanol (MeOH) and n-propanol (PrOH) through the Guerbet condensation {{has been studied}} in batch experiments using bifunctional heterogeneous systems based on a dehydrogenating/hydrogenating metal (Pd, Rh, Ni or Cu) and a basic Mg-Al mixed oxide derived from hydrotalcite-type (HT) precursors. Only copper-based systems showed appreciable performances. In particular, the Cu/Mg/Al mixed oxides catalysts obtained by the co-precipitation method offered the best results in terms of activity and selectivity, thus allowing to reduce pollution problems connected with the up to now adopted copper chromite. These co-precipitated systems were also tested in some preliminary experiments carried out in gas-solid phase in a flow reactor, thus confirming promising application perspectives.
