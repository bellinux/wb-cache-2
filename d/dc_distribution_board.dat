The <b>dc</b> <b>distribution</b> system is expected to be more efficient and economical than a system of ac-dc battery chargers directly interfaced with an ac grid. In the first part, a systematic method for developing a model for a <b>dc</b> <b>distribution</b> system, based on the configuration of the system is proposed. The developed model is of the matrix form and, therefore, can readily be expanded to represent a <b>dc</b> <b>distribution</b> system of any desired number of dc-dc converters. The model captures both the steady-state and dynamic characteristics of the system, and includes the port capacitors of the converters, as well as the interconnection cables. Thus, it can be used for identifying the condition for the existence of a steady state, as well as for stability analysis. In the second part, the thesis proposes a method for enhancing the stability of the <b>dc</b> <b>distribution</b> system. Using a nonlinear control strategy, the proposed stability enhancement method mitigates the issue of instability by altering the power setpoints of the battery chargers, bidirectional dc-dc converters, without a need for changing system parameters or hardware.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the behavior of}} voltage weak <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems. These systems have relatively small system capacitance. The size of system capacitance, which stores energy, has a considerable effect {{on the value of}} fault currents, control complexity, and system reliability. A number of potential definitions of voltage weak <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems are proposed. These definitions address the main characteristics of voltage weak systems. A small signal model of a general voltage weak <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> system is developed in order to observe sufficient conditions for system stability. This is achieved by analyzing the dominant poles. The source converters are modeled as droop-controlled current sources in parallel with their respective terminal capacitors. As constant power loads have incremental negative impedances, which affect the system stability, especially, in voltage weak system, ideal constant power loads with their terminal capacitors are included in the small signal model. A three-node voltage weak <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> grid is analyzed, as a case study, by implementing the developed small signal model. The effects on system stability by the values of system capacitance, cable inductance, and cable resistance are investigated using dominant pole placement. Likewise, the influence of proportional-integral regulators and droop coefficients of source converters on the stability of the system is examined. Finally, the three node <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> grid is developed in MATLAB/Simulink in order to demonstrate the influence of small capacitance on system stability.

H 577 P EE 2016 Yexviii, 201 pages :color illustrationsAs {{numerous}} {{advantages in}} {{the aspects of}} efficiency, power handling, power coupling and harmonics elimination etc., <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> has received extensive attention worldwide. When switched-capacitor (SC) power conversion technology is applied in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution,</b> the system will be very flexible and more reliable. Different from conventional switched-mode power converters (SMPCs), there is no bulky magnetic component employed in SC power conversion circuits. This type of power conversion circuits therefore has the advantages of low cost and high power density. One application of SC in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems is to use SC-based DC-DC power converters for voltage level shifting. Its function {{is very similar to}} transformers widely used in AC power systems. In this thesis, a family of single-stage dual-phase-combined SC resonant converters is developed. Each of the proposed dual-phase-combined SC converters has one more capacitor than its single-phase version, but has the advantages of higher power and lower output voltage ripple. This design provides a more stable output voltage and significantly reduces the quantity of switches. These converters therefore have the common features of smaller size, lower cost, and higher power density than the conventional multiphase SC power converters. Moreover, a series of non-isolated multi-output PWM converters is developed by combining the advantages of SMPCs and SC converters. This type of converters employs only one inductor and one active switch, which contributes to the features of simple structure and easy control. Another application of SC in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> is voltage balancing. In the thesis, several SC-based cell balancing circuits are developed for voltage equalization of series-connected batteries used in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems as energy storage devices. These cell balancing circuits have the features of simple structure and easy control as well as the absence of magnetic components. Their balancing speed is independent of both of the number of battery cells and initial mismatch distribution of cell voltages. Another achievement of SC-based voltage balancing is in multilevel inverters. In this aspect, a novel multilevel inverter is developed by cascading an H-bridge with multiple SC units. It has the advantages of simple structure and self-balancing of capacitor voltages. Multiple LED strings connected in parallel manner in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems as lighting devices need to share a common current. Several current-sharing LED drive circuits are therefore developed by combining the conventional SMPCs and SC techniques. Only one active switch and one magnetic component are employed in each of the proposed LED drivers. It makes these lighting devices can be designed with simple structure and cost-effectiveness. To ensure these SC's applications to be implemented smoothly in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, both resonant and non-resonant SC techniques are optimized in the aspects of efficiency improvement, current spike limitation and output voltage ripple reduction. An intuitive and simple modeling method is also developed to analyze and evaluate the performance of SC power converters, in this thesis. Importantly, this thesis aims to promote various applications of SC power conversion technology in <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> systems, rather than to establish a <b>DC</b> <b>distribution</b> system based entirely on SC power conversion techniques.
