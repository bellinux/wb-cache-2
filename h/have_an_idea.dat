5|$|Following the Elliot Minor tour, {{the group}} began writing {{material}} for their debut album. In late November and early December, the band went {{on their first}} headlining tour of the UK, with support from Flood of Red. During the latter month, the band wrote further material. All of the songs on the album were written and arranged by themselves. Typically, Helyer or Franceschi would <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that the band would then flesh out together. Occasionally, the band would record demos and change sections of them.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{there is}} some degree of {{empiricism}} and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems. By establishing a pattern, sometimes {{with the use of}} a powerful computer, mathematicians may <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of what to prove, and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof. For example, the Collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about 2.88×1018. The Riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first 10 trillion zeroes of the zeta function. Neither of these statements is considered proved.|$|E

If a particular publisher in 1977 {{were satisfied with the}} exchange-value of 60 Steloj for one year, Mee's studies concerning the Stelo predicted that the exchange value of 60 Steloj would continue to be sufficient in future years. That publisher, therefore, would need only the currency tables for September to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of the required subscription price level in national currencies for the next year.|$|E

25|$|We can <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of {{the quality}} of the {{university}} in what were seeing what some of his professors. Among the most famous, who are many, just to cite Estius (1542–1613), the famous commentator of the epistles of Paul. After classical studies at Utrecht, he then spent two decades in Leuven, studying philosophy, theology and Scripture and in 1580 he received the degree of doctor of theology. In 1582 he became professor of theology at Douai, a position he held for thirty-one years, and he joined her in the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the university, while also being the many years rector of the diocesan seminary. The works of Estius were written in Latin and for the most part, their publications were posthumous. Note also Lessius Leonardus (1554–1623), professing the philosophy, and Francois du Bois, said Franciscus Sylvius (1581–1649) , professor of theology and vice-chancellor of the university, but also Nemius Gaspard Dubois, George Colveneere, and Philippe Bossuet Cospéan which involved in the controversy of Douai.|$|E

500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to {{imagine what it would be}} like to wake up one morning and to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> for our next film." ...|$|E

If I'm collaborating with someone, I'll direct them in the direction that I'm going chord wise, because I get all these melody ideas and then I lose them if I don't have someone really good with the keyboard with me. That's why I tend to collaborate because I lose the ideas by the time I figure out the chord. All these melody ideas just go." ...|$|E

500|$|Actress and women's-health {{advocate}} Gabrielle Union, a rape victim, voiced {{support for}} the video on Twitter. Union called it [...] "brave" [...] and, although she {{did not agree with}} the eye-for-an-eye sentiment, she could relate to the situation. Union said that every rape victim or survivor is a unique situation, and that they all <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of how justice should be served. She admitted that she tried to shoot her rapist, but missed, and that she has since realised that committing murder as a form of justice for herself would not have made the situation better. She continued to say that while it is [...] "understandable" [...] to desire to kill a rapist, unless it is in self-defense then it is not advisable.|$|E
500|$|Plans for {{a sequel}} to The Expendables were in place before the film's release in August 2010; Stallone said, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> ready to go...I'm {{going to try to}} do {{something}} that's quite radical". In an interview in August 2010 he noted that he did not have a new script yet, but [...] "It's plotted out in my mind's eye." [...] On April 18, 2011, Stallone confirmed that he would not be repeating his directing duties in The Expendables, making a list of directors to serve as his replacement. In April 2011, the film was given a scheduled release date of August 17, 2012 and a teaser poster for the film was released at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. In June 2011, Simon West was confirmed as director.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} season, The Simpsons aired the first Halloween special, [...] "Treehouse of Horror". The annual series {{typically}} consist of four parts: an opening and Halloween-themed {{version of the}} credits, followed by three segments. These segments usually have a horror, science fiction or supernatural theme and quite often are parodies of films, novels, plays, television shows, Twilight Zone episodes, or old issues of EC Comics. Part of the attraction for the writers {{is that they are}} able to break the rules and include violence that would not make a regular episode. In some cases, the writers will <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. The first [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episode was the first time that an alternate version of the theme airs over the end credits.|$|E

500|$|By July 25, 1883, Cleveland {{newspapers}} were taking {{note of the}} literary mystery, with initial guesses that the author was some former Clevelander who had moved east. In early August, the New-York Tribune reported that the author was the late Leonard Case, a Cleveland industrialist and philanthropist—the manuscript had supposedly been found among his papers. Few believed the chronically ill and introverted bachelor could have created the vivid portrait of the shapely Maud Matchin. With Case dismissed, speculation turned to other Ohioans, including Cleveland Superintendent of Schools Burke Aaron Hinsdale, former congressman Albert Gallatin Riddle (author of twelve books), and John Hay. [...] The Boston Evening Transcript on August 18 stated, [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> {{that none of these}} guesses are correct". Others suggested that the anonymous author of Democracy (Henry Adams's authorship was not yet known) had penned a second controversial work.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thought that}} it would be a great {{opportunity}} to showcase herself as an artist, as well as expressing the true meaning of her songs. She stated: [...] "I really wanted to do MTV Unplugged, obviously, because it has such a great history of showing off really who the person is... You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> who I am, a little piece of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E
500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I try {{to figure}} out what I'm saying and then try to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if you can write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E

500|$|Matheos and Moore {{primarily}} work alone, exchanging {{files and}} ideas by email. The writing process for all OSI's albums {{has been the}} same, with Matheos sending Moore an idea [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs", which Moore then edits and sends back to Matheos. Moore, the band's vocalist and lyricist, has described {{the process of writing}} lyrics as an [...] "audio Rorschach test". The lyrics on Office of Strategic Influence feature political themes, but the lyrics on later releases are less political, instead being based on Moore's personal experiences. [...] "I'll start writing a song that has {{a little bit of a}} world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." [...] On Blood, Moore largely abandoned his earlier stream-of-consciousness approach to writing lyrics, in an attempt to make the lyrics more coherent. [...] "I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' I wanted to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable," [...] he explained.|$|E
500|$|In October 2014, {{in terms}} of Phase Four films, Feige said, for the time being, [...] "We're {{not going to talk}} {{specifically}} about the story of any of those films, the plot of any of those films, what happens to any of the characters in any of those films. In fact, even to talk about any of those characters – who will be involved in those movies – will {{be a bit of a}} spoiler as to what may or may not happen to them in earlier movies." [...] In April 2016, Feige added, [...] "We're only working on what’s been announced through the end of 2019. And it is still a big chess board for 2020 and beyond". A year later, Feige noted, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> , and it's gonna be very, very different," [...] but cautioned that Marvel would not be [...] "actively discussing anything past untitled Avengers" [...] besides dating the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and that James Gunn would be working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. He also was not sure if Marvel would continue to group the films in phases once Phase Three concluded, that [...] "it might be a new thing." [...] A second sequel to Homecoming is also planned.|$|E

In some cases, the writers will <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> that is too violent and far-fetched or too short for a normal episode, but {{can be used as a}} segment in the seasonal special. Several of the writers, former executive producer David Mirkin among them, believe that the episodes should be scary and not just funny. [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] has been described by Mirkin as being one of [...] "the most intense, disturbing Halloween show ever" [...] as it was filled with violence and gore in response to new censorship rules. Earlier [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] episodes began with Marge issuing a disclaimer that [...] "if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow." [...] However, these episodes seem mild compared to the carnage that followed in later episodes, according to Jean, who calls it [...] "a societal thing". [...] He points out that his 10-year-old daughter loves films like Coraline, and that, [...] " [...] the age of scary stories [...] appropriateness has gotten lower." ...|$|E
