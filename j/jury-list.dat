This was to be his last ever speech, and in it took the views of the prisoner and made them his own.

6000|$|I {{remember}} {{one of those}} sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we call a jury trial. A noted desperado killed Mr. B., a good citizen, in the most wanton and cold-blooded way. Of course the papers were full of it, and all men capable of reading, read about it. And of course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic, talked about it. A <b>jury-list</b> was made out, and Mr. B. L., a prominent banker and a valued citizen, was questioned precisely {{as he would have}} been questioned in any court in America: ...|$|E
6000|$|There is, of course, {{also the}} {{suggestion}} that an English Academy of Letters might be of great service in discounting vulgar [...] "successes" [...] and directing respect and attention to literary achievements. One may doubt whether such an Academy as a Royal Charter would give {{the world would be}} of any service at all in this connection. But Mr. Herbert Trench has suggested recently that {{it might be possible to}} organize a large Guild of literary men and women, which would include all capable writers, and from which a sort of Academy could be elected, either by a general poll or, I would suggest, by a Jury of Election or successive Juries confirming one another. The New Republican would like to see such a Guild not purely English, but Anglo-American, or in duplicate for the two countries. With a very carefully chosen nucleus and some little elaboration in the admission of new members--whose works might be submitted to the report of a critical jury--such a Guild might be made fairly representative of literary capacity. Election, one may suggest, should be involuntary. There would be a number of literary men, one fears--great men some of them--who would absolutely refuse to work with any such body, and from the first the Guild would have to determine to make such men unwilling members, members to whom all the honours and privileges of the Guild would be open whenever they chose to abandon their attitude of scorn or distrust. Such a Guild would furnish a useful constituency, a useful <b>jury-list.</b> It could be used to recommend writers for honours, to check the distribution of public pensions for literary services, perhaps even to send a member or so to the Upper Chamber. It is, at any rate, an experiment worth trying.|$|E
