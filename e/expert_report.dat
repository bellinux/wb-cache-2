5|$|According to Savenko, the Serbsky Center {{has long}} labored to legalize its monopolistic {{position}} of the Main expert institution of the country. The ambition and permissiveness—which, due to proximity to power, allow the Serbsky Center {{to get in touch}} over the telephone with the judges and explain to them who is who and what is the guideline, although the judges themselves have already learned it—have {{turned out to be a}} considerable drop in the level of the expert reports on many positions. Such a drop was inevitable and foreseeable in the context of the Serbsky Center efforts to eliminate adversary character of the expert reports of the parties, then to maximally degrade the role of the specialist as a reviewer and critic of the presented <b>expert</b> <b>report,</b> and to legalize the state of affairs. Lyubov Vinogradova believes there has been a continuous diminution in patients' rights as independent experts are now excluded from processes, cannot speak in court and can do nothing against the State experts.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the <b>expert</b> <b>report,</b> its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' findings for their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E

25|$|The Phoenician port of Beirut {{was located}} between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby {{on the north}} coast. The port or harbor was {{excavated}} and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city. Another suggested port or dry dock was {{claimed to have been}} discovered ~ to the west, in 2011 by a team of Lebanese archaeologists from the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanese University. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorization was given by Lebanese Minister of Culture Gaby Layoun for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching at Marburg in Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may now never be discovered, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.|$|E

The normal values utilized by Dr. Byers, however, were for adults, not children" [...] and that [...] "when she herself instead compared Michelle's results to an age-adjusted set of normal values, Michelle's results fell within the normal ranges," [...] with McCusker noting in her <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> that the only marker of Th2 cell activity that was assessed in Michelle's case, namely serum Immunoglobulin E level, was entirely normal. Additionally, Ward's <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> stated that Byers' <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> contained [...] "many statements that appear to be entirely unsubstantiated." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsbourne's {{testimony}} was countered {{by that of}} Ward, who noted that if Kinsbourne were correct and persisting measles virus were causing autism, then {{it ought to be}} detectable in the blood, since Kinsbourne himself had stated that MV would travel throughout the body via the bloodstream; he also criticized Kinsbourne's <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> for citing Bradstreet et al.'s case series which had been published in the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons. With regard to this study, Ward said that [...] "the cerebrospinal antibody data from the three ASD children included in this manuscript actually argue powerfully AGAINST a persistent measles infection in the brains of these children." [...] Ward also noted that Krigsman had cited research conducted by Vijendra K. Singh of Utah State University which had concluded that more than 80% of children with autism had elevated measles antibodies. However, Ward stated in his <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> that [...] "Unless virtually all cases of autism are caused by measles virus (a position expressly excluded by the MRC, IOM and Cochrane reports), then Singh's work must be in error or there must be an alternate explanation for this finding. We have recently tested anti-measles antibodies in children with ASD and found no differences with control children." [...] Another point of contention was a paper by Paul Ashwood, which had been cited by Kinsbourne in his expert report; however, as Ward noted, Kinsbourne had neglected to mention that Ashwood's paper concluded that [...] "the overwhelming majority of epidemiological, population studies indicate there is no established correlation between vaccinations and autism." [...] Additionally, Ward noted that this paper made no mention of the potential link between MMR and autism.|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 2009, {{the working}} group chaired by the Director of the Serbsky Center Tatyana Dmitrieva sent the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation a joint {{application}} whose purport was to declare appealing against the forensic expert reports of state expert institutions illegal and prohibit courts from receiving lawsuits filed to appeal against the reports. The reason put forward for the proposal was that the appeals against the expert reports were allegedly filed [...] "without regard for {{the scope of the}} case" [...] and that one must appeal against the <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> [...] "only together with the sentence." [...] In other words, according to Yuri Savenko, all professional errors and omissions are presented as untouchable by virtue {{of the fact that they}} were infiltrated into the sentence. That is cynicism of administrative resources, cynicism of power, he says.|$|E

500|$|The {{draft of}} the {{application}} to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper [...] "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" [...] by Elena Shchukina and Sergei Shishkov focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> without regard for {{the scope of the}} evaluated case. While talking about appealing against [...] "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the [...] "parallel" [...] examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case. Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and legitimate interests of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.|$|E
500|$|Owen's later {{views on}} {{international}} affairs did not escape controversy. [...] Though initially a firm {{supporter of the}} Treaty of Versailles, including its assertion of German responsibility for the outbreak of [...] World War I, during 1923 his views changed radically {{under the influence of}} [...] "revisionist" [...] studies, including the publication of extensive (though incomplete) materials from the diplomatic archives of the pre-War Tsarist Russian Foreign Office. [...] He made a major speech in the Senate on 18 December 1923 attributing primary responsibility for the war to France and (especially) Russia rather than Germany. [...] Owen hoped that a public revisiting of the issue of war guilt might encourage reversal of some of the penal clauses imposed on Germany under the Versailles settlement, and pave the way to reconciliation between Germany and France, but his attempts to promote a Senate investigation of the war guilt question were narrowly defeated, largely along party lines — with many of his fellow Democrats concerned not to undermine the reputation of Woodrow Wilson — while an <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Library of Congress, though broadly supportive of Owen's arguments, was in the event never published as it was considered unlikely to obtain the support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [...] In 1926, following his retirement from the Senate, Owen was to publish a book advancing his revisionist thesis, under the title: The Russian Imperial Conspiracy, 1892-1914: The Most Gigantic Intrigue of all Time.|$|E

2500|$|Reforms {{are made}} {{to the extent to}} which the defence must {{disclose}} their case in order to trigger both the revised duty to disclose and the right to a [...] "section 8" [...] application to the court to force the prosecution to disclose an item of evidence. A defence statement must now state each point at which issue is taken with the prosecution and why, any particular defence or points of law (such as evidential admissibility or abuse of process) upon which he or she would rely. The defendant must also give a list of defence witnesses, along with their names and addresses. The police may then interview those witnesses, according to a code of practice issued by the Home Secretary. The Explanatory Notes make it clear the police interviewing of potential defence witnesses is one of the intents of the Act. The details of any defence expert witness instructed must also be given to the prosecution, whether or not they are then used in the case. However, no part of the Act explicitly amends the law on legal privilege, so the contents of any correspondence or <b>expert</b> <b>report</b> would remain confidential to the same extent as before.|$|E
