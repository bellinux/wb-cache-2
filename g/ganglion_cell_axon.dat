Fibroblast growth factors function in retinal cell proliferation, retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> guidance and target recognition, craniofacial patterning and lens induction. Hedgehog proteins are required for progression of the neurogenic wave, cell proliferation, photoreceptor differentiation, retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> growth and craniofacial patterning.

40|$|The LIM-homeodomain {{transcription}} factor Islet- 1 (Isl 1) {{has been widely}} used as a marker of different subtypes of neurons in the developing and mature retina of vertebrates. During retinal neurogenesis, early Isl 1 expression is detected in the nuclei of neuroblasts {{that give rise to}} ganglion, amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells. In the mature retina, Isl 1 expression is restricted to the nuclei of ganglion cells, cholinergicamacrine cells, ON-bipolar cells, and subpopulations of horizontal cells. Recent studies have explored the functional mechanisms of Isl 1 during specification and differentiation of these retinal cell types. Thus, conditional inactivation of Isl 1 in the developing mouse retina disrupts retinal function, and also results in optic nerve hypoplasia, marked reductions in mature ganglion, amacrine, and bipolar cells, and a substantial increase in horizontal cells. Furthermore, conditional knockout shows delayed <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> growth, <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> guidance error, and ganglion cell nerve fiber defasciculation. These data together suggest a possible role for Isl 1 in the early differentiation and maintenance of different vertebrate retinal cell types.

40|$|Abstract Background Pbx genes encode TALE class {{homeodomain}} transcription {{factors that}} pattern the developing neural tube, pancreas, and blood. Within the hindbrain, Pbx cooperates with Hox proteins to regulate rhombomere segment identity. Pbx cooperates with Eng to regulate midbrain-hindbrain boundary maintenance, and with MyoD to control fast muscle cell differentiation. Although previous results {{have demonstrated that}} Pbx is required for proper eye size, functions in regulating retinal cell identity and patterning {{have not yet been}} examined. Results Analysis of retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> pathfinding and outgrowth in pbx 2 / 4 null embryos demonstrated a key role for pbx genes in regulating neural cell behavior. To identify Pbx-dependent genes involved in regulating retino-tectal pathfinding, we conducted a microarray screen for Pbx-dependent transcripts in zebrafish, and detected genes that are specifically expressed in the eye and tectum. A subset of Pbx-dependent retinal transcripts delineate specific domains in the dorso-temporal lobe of the developing retina. Furthermore, we determined that some Pbx-dependent transcripts also require Meis 1 and Gdf 6 a function. Since gdf 6 a expression is also dependent on Pbx, we propose a model in which Pbx proteins regulate expression of the growth factor gdf 6 a, which in turn regulates patterning of the dorso-temporal lobe of the retina. This, in concert with aberrant tectal patterning in pbx 2 / 4 null embryos, may lead to the observed defects in RGC outgrowth. Conclusion These data define a novel role for Pbx in patterning the vertebrate retina and tectum in a manner required for proper retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> outgrowth. </p...|$|E
40|$|In glaucoma, harmful intraocular {{pressure}} often contributes to retinal ganglion cell death. It is not clear, however, if {{intraocular pressure}} directly insults the retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon,</b> the soma, or both. The pathways that mediate pressure-induced retinal ganglion cell death are poorly defined, and no molecules {{are known to}} be required. DBA/ 2 J mice deficient in the proapoptotic molecule BCL 2 -associated X protein (BAX) were used to investigate the roles of BAXmediated cell death pathways in glaucoma. Both Bax + / and Bax / mice were protected from retinal ganglion cell death. In contrast, axonal degeneration was not prevented in either Bax + / or Bax / mice. While BAX deficiency did not prevent axonal degeneration, it did slow axonal loss. Additionally, we compared the effects of BAX deficiency on the glaucoma to its effects on retinal ganglion cell death due to two insults that are proposed to participate in glaucoma. As in the glaucoma, BAX deficiency protected retinal ganglion cells after axon injury by optic nerve crush. However, it did not protect retinal ganglion cells from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) -induced excitotoxicity. BAX is required for retinal ganglion cell death in an inherited glaucoma; however, it is not required for retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> degeneration. This indicates that distinct somal and axonal degeneration pathways are active in this glaucoma. Finally, our data support a role for optic nerve injury but not for NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in this glaucoma.

In vivo protein phosphorylation assays in drug-treated tadpoles indicated that the treatments decreased 32 P incorporation into some protein bands {{by as much as}} 60 %. Although the drugs did not cause a desegregation of the eye-specific stripes, treated retinal axon arbors covered about half the area covered by untreated arbors or arbors treated with inactive analogs of the drugs. We conclude that eye-specific segregation can be maintained under conditions that markedly alter retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> arbor size and that significantly perturb protein phosphorylation.

Rtca {{along with the}} RNA ligase Rtcb and its catalyst Archease operate in the RNA repair/splicing pathway important for stress induced mRNA splicing, including that of Xbp 1, a cellular stress sensor. dRtca and dArchease had opposing effects on Xbp 1 splicing, and deficiency of dArchease or Xbp 1 impeded axon regeneration in Drosophila. Moreover, overexpressing mammalian Rtca in cultured rodent neurons reduced axonal complexity in vitro, whereas reducing its function promoted retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> regeneration after optic nerve crush in mice.

40|$|AbstractTo {{elucidate}} molecular mechanisms underlying activity-dependent synaptic remodeling in {{the developing}} mammalian visual system, we screened for genes whose expression in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is regulated by spontaneously generated action potentials present prior to vision. Activity blockade did not alter expression in the LGN of 32 known genes. Differential mRNA display, however, revealed a decrease in mRNAs encoding class I major histocompatibility complex antigens (class I MHC). Postnatally, visually driven activity can regulate class I MHC in the LGN during the final remodeling of retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> terminals. Moreover, in the mature hippocampus, class I MHC mRNA levels are increased by kainic acid–induced seizures. Normal expression of class I MHC mRNA is correlated with times and regions of synaptic plasticity, and immunohistochemistry confirms that class I MHC is present in specific subsets of CNS neurons. Finally, β 2 -microglobulin, a cosubunit of class I MHC, and CD 3 ζ, a component of a receptor complex for class I MHC, are also expressed by CNS neurons. These observations indicate that class I MHC molecules, classically thought to mediate cell–cell interactions exclusively in immune function, may play a novel role in neuronal signaling and activity-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity...|$|E

40|$|Adult {{mammalian}} CNS neurons often degenerate after injury, {{leading to}} lost neurologic functions. In the visual system, retinal or optic nerve injury {{often leads to}} retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> degeneration and irreversible vision loss. CNS axon degeneration is increasingly linked to the innate immune response to injury, which leads to tissue-destructive inflammation and scarring. Extracellular matrix (ECM) technology can reduce inflammation, while increasing functional tissue remodeling, over scarring, in various tissues and organs, including the peripheral nervous system. However, applying ECM technology to CNS injuries has been limited and virtually unstudied in the visual system. Here we discuss advances in deriving fetal CNS-specific ECMs, like fetal porcine brain, retina, and optic nerve, and fetal non-CNS-specific ECMs, like fetal urinary bladder, {{and the potential for}} using tissue-specific ECMs to treat retinal or optic nerve injuries in two platforms. The first platform is an ECM hydrogel that can be administered as a retrobulbar, periocular, or even intraocular injection. The second platform is an ECM hydrogel and polymer “biohybrid ” sheet that can be readily shaped and wrapped around a nerve. Both platforms can be tuned mechanically and biochemically to deliver factors like neurotrophins, immunotherapeu-tics, or stem cells.

Loss-of-function studies in mice, with targeted deletions in either the Bmp 7 or Bmp 4 genes, have shown that these molecules are critical for early eye development. On {{the basis of the}} asymmetry in the dorsal–ventral expression patterns of several members of this family, it has been proposed that these molecules are critical for some aspect of dorsal–ventral patterning in the eye; however, it has been difficult to test this hypothesis because of the early requirement for BMPs in eye development. We have therefore examined the effects of loss of one of the BMP receptors, the BmprIb, {{on the development of the}} eye by using targeted deletion. We have found that BmprIb is expressed exclusively in the ventral retina during embryonic development and is required for normal ventral <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> targeting to the optic nerve head. In mice with a targeted deletion of the BmprIb gene, many axons arising from the ventrally located ganglion cells fail to enter the optic nerve head, and instead, make abrupt turns in this region.

In the present study, subunit-specific antisera were used to determine the distribution of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunits GluR 1 - 4 in retinorecipient areas of the chick brain. Six white leghorn chicks (Gallus gallus, 7 - 15 days old, unknown sex) were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 4 % buffered paraformaldehyde and brain sections were stained using immunoperoxidase techniques. The AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunits GluR 1, GluR 2 / 3 and GluR 4 were present in several retinorecipient areas, with varying degrees of colocalization. For example, perikarya in layers 2, 3, and 5 of the optic tectum contained GluR 1, whereas GluR 2 / 3 subunits appeared mainly in neurons of layer 13. The GluR 4 subunit was only detected in a few cells of the tectal layer 13. GluR 1 and GluR 2 / 3 were observed in neurons of the nucleus geniculatus lateralis ventralis, whereas GluR 4 was only present in its neuropil. Somata in the accessory optic nucleus appeared to contain GluR 2 / 3 and GluR 4, whereas GluR 1 was the dominant subunit in the neuropil of this nucleus.

To understand the embryonic basis of ocular defects observed in adultKrd/+ mice, we used immunohistochemistry, digital three-dimensional reconstructions, and quantitative morphometry to examine Pax 2 protein distribution and ocular development in normal andKrd/+ mice from E 10. 5 to P 2. In +/+ embryos, Pax 2 immunopositive (Pax 2 +) cells demarcate the embryonic fissure as it forms in the ventral optic cup and optic stalk.

40|$|AbstractThe {{vertebrate}} optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is a compensatory oculomotor {{behavior that}} is evoked by movement of the visual environment. It functions to stabilize visual images on the retina. The OKN can be experimentally evoked by rotating a drum fitted with stripes around the animal and has been studied extensively in many vertebrate species, including teleosts. This simple behavior has earlier been used to screen for mutations affecting visual system development in the vertebrate model organism zebrafish. In such a screen, we have found {{a significant number of}} homozygous belladonna (bel) mutant larvae to be defective in the correct execution of the OKN [1]. We now show that about 40 % of homozygous bel larvae display a curious reversal of the OKN upon visual stimulation. Monocular stimulation leads to primary activation of ipsilateral eye movements in larvae that behave like the wild type. In contrast, affected larvae display contralateral activation of eye movements upon monocular stimulation. Anatomical analysis of retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> projections reveal a morphological basis for the observed behavioral defect. All animals with OKN reversal are achiasmatic. Further behavioral examination of affected larvae show that OKN-reversed animals execute this behavior in a stimulus-velocity-independent manner.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of eye-specific axonal projections to the dorsal {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} (dLGN) is a well established model system for exploring the mechanisms underlying afferent targeting during development. Using modern tract tracing methods, we examined {{the development of this}} feature in the macaque, an Old World Primate with a visual system similar to that of humans. Cholera toxin fragment conjugated toAlexa 488 was injected into the vitreous of one eye, andCT conjugated toAlexa 594 into the other eye of embryos at known gestational ages. On embryonic day 69 (E 69), which is 100 d before birth, inputs from the two eyes were extensively inter-mingled in the dLGN. However, even at this early age, portions of the dLGN were preferentially innervated by the right or left eye, and segregation is complete within the dorsalmost layers 5 and 6. By E 78, eye-specific segregation is clearly established throughout the parvocellular division of the dLGN, and substantial ocular segregation is present in themagnocellular division. ByE 84, segregation of left and right eye axons is essentially complete, and the six eye-specific domains that characterize the mature macaque dLGN are clearly discernable. These findings reveal that targeting of eye-specific axonal projections in themacaque occursmuch earlier andmore rapidly than previously reported. This segregation process is completed before the reported onset of <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axon</b> loss and retino-dLGN synapse elimination, suggesting that, in the primate, eye-specific targeting occurs independent of traditional forms of synaptic plasticity.

Synapses from retinula fibres to empty (long) transverse fibres are similar. Synapses from secretory or empty transverse fibres to ganglion cell axons are axon-to-axon contacts; there are vesicles one side but both membranes are thickened; the cleft is 11 - 13 m/t wide. Between empty transverse fibres the synapses are similar but symmetrical; from empty to secretory transverse they have vesicles one side. Synapses from secretory fibres to each other (symmetrical) or to empty transverse fibres (vesicles on one side and with only the postsynaptic membrane thickened) reveal a sharp distinction between synaptic vesicles and secretory vesicles. Serial synapses occur (a) from empty transverse fibre to secretory fibre to another empty transverse fibre, and (b) from retinula cell to secretory fibre to ganglion cell fibre.

In vitro, substrate stiffness determined growth patterns of Xenopus retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axons.</b> In vivo {{atomic force microscopy}} revealed a noticeable pattern of stiffness gradients in the embryonic brain. Retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axons</b> grew toward softer tissue, which was reproduced in vitro {{in the absence of}} chemical gradients. To test the importance of mechanical signals for axon growth in vivo, we altered brain stiffness, blocked mechanotransduction pharmacologically and knocked down the mechanosensitive ion channel piezo 1. All treatments resulted in aberrant axonal growth and pathfinding errors, suggesting that local tissue stiffness, read out by mechanosensitive ion channels, is critically involved in instructing neuronal growth in vivo.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} issue in {{central nervous system}} development regards the effect of target tissue on the differentiation of innervating neurons. We address this issue by characterizing the role the retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> target, i. e., the optic tectum, plays in regulating expression of tubulin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes in regenerating retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cells.</b> Tubulins are involved in axonal growth, whereas nicotinic acetylcholine receptors mediate communication across synapses. Retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axons</b> were induced to regenerate by crushing the optic nerve. Following crush, there was a rapid increase in a-tubulin RNAs (3 days),-which preceded the increase in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor RNAs (10 - 15 days). Both classes of RNAs approached control levels by the time retinotectal synapses and functional recovery were restored (4 - 6 weeks). If the optic nerve was repeatedly crushed or its target ablated, tubulin RNAs remained elevated, {{and the increase in}} receptor RNAs that would otherwise be seen 2 weeks after a single nerve crush did not occur. The interaction of retinal <b>ganglion</b> <b>cell</b> <b>axons</b> with their targets in the optic tectum appears, then, to exert a suppressive effect on the RNA encoding a cytoskeletal protein, tubulin, and an inductive effect on RNAs encoding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors involved in synaptic communication...|$|R
