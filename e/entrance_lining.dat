There are stained-glass windows above every <b>entrance,</b> <b>lining</b> {{both sides of the}} sanctuary, lining the narthex, and in the four roof dormers. [...] The dominant, largest window is {{at the rear of the}} sanctuary (its east end) and [...] "contains a cross made of chunks of split and fractured glass, with a white dove descending on the cross." [...] Most other windows display biblical fruit and flower motifs. The separate chapel also has Povey windows, including a large rose window at its south end. [...] Most other windows in the chapel are now covered up, those along the west wall by the erection, in 1912, of the three-story ancillary building immediately west of the 1890 building, and those along the south wall as a result of a remodeling of the chapel's interior in 1954.|$|E

50|$|The scrubtit forages individually, {{in pairs}} {{or in small}} family groups near the ground in dense cover. It feeds on small invertebrates, {{particularly}} insects and their eggs. The species will associate with mixed-species feeding flocks. The species is territorial and monogamous, with the breeding season lasting from September to January. The nest is a weaved globe with a side <b>entrance,</b> <b>lined</b> with feathers and fur, camouflaged and usually found between 1-3 m off the ground. The clutch size is usually three eggs but sometimes four, although no information exists about incubation or nestling times. Both parents feed the chicks in the nest, but unlike many Australian passerines helpers have never been reported. The species is victim to brood parasitism by fan-tailed cuckoos and shining bronze cuckoos, and quolls also take eggs and nestlings.|$|R
