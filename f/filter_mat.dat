5000|$|Green planted roofs: A {{green roof}} is a roof that is {{partially}} or completely covered with vegetation {{and a growing}} medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. A green roof typically consists of many layers, including an insulation layer; a waterproof membrane, often vinyl; a drainage layer, usually made of lightweight gravel, clay, or plastic; a geotextile or <b>filter</b> <b>mat</b> that allows water to soak through but prevents erosion of fine soil particles; a growing medium; plants; and, sometimes, a wind blanket. Green roofs are classified as either intensive or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium and amount of maintenance required. Traditional roof gardens, which are labor-intensive and require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants are considered intensive, while extensive green roofs are nearly self-sustaining and require less maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{device was}} {{originally}} a standard platinum laboratory crucible with a perforated base into which asbestos pulp was placed {{to form the}} <b>filter</b> <b>mat.</b> [...] The crucible was then heated in an oven to dry out until it attained constant weight. The use of these materials meant that after filtration, the crucible and its contents could be subjected to high temperature to dry the filtrate and possibly oxidize or ash it to minimum weight. However, {{because of the high}} cost of platinum, versions made of porcelain were introduced in 1882. Some Gooch crucibles, such as the one in the drawing, permit two layers of asbestos to be used, separated by a perforated porcelain plate. Other inorganic fibers, notably glass, have been used in place of asbestos. Gooch crucibles made of borosilicate glass with fritted glass bases are more common today. [...] Platinum may still be required for the most corrosive materials, and porcelain ones are used where ashing at high temperature is required, but the borosilicate glass ones are adequate for drying.|$|E
50|$|Structures, {{which are}} {{designed}} as integral arches, {{can be constructed}} as stiff individual objects or {{by means of a}} sprayed concrete procedure. Arches made of sprayed concrete provide for free and organic shapes, allowing rooms to become suffused with light. The sprayed concrete procedure was first used by natural scientist Carl Akeley in 1911. Akeley patented a device able to spray fine-grained concrete. While sprayed concrete is mainly applied in underground engineering and tunnel construction, Friedrich Kiesler was the first to use this technique for the construction of buildings. Swiss architect Peter Vetsch improved the technique over several years. To date, he has built over 40 earth houses using sprayed concrete, and he can therefore be considered the leading authority in this area of expertise. The sprayed concrete is applied to a finely meshed metal stretch net which is welded onto the supporting armature. The curvatures are bent and formed according to the intended shape of the building. A 20 cm thick polyurethane solid-foam-insulation is sprayed onto the outside of the arches, protecting the house from low or high temperatures. A fleece <b>filter</b> <b>mat</b> is then laid on top of this and the building is covered with a thick layer of soil some 80 cm to 3 metres thick. The foundation of the buildings designed by Peter Vetsch are built conventionally. The interior walls of an earth house are furnished using loam rendering which provides superior humidity compensation. The loam rendering is finally coated with lime-white cement paint.|$|E

40|$|Oily {{wastewater}} is a {{major problem}} in industries that can cause severe environmental pollution without proper treatment. In this paper, an easily fabricated, robust and durable nonwoven fibrous <b>filter</b> <b>mat</b> was prepared for coalescence filtration of four kinds of oil-in-water emulsions, namely hexadecane/water, octane/water, soybean oil/water and engine oil/water. An aromatic thermoplastic polyurethane resin (TPU) was selected to bind the fibers together for structure integrity of the mat. Special roughening treatment to the mat was conducted to deliver the required wettability for effective coalescence separation of these emulsions. The <b>filter</b> <b>mat</b> thus prepared reached a tensile strength of 2. 99 MPa, 20 times stronger than that of the pristine mat. The mat surface was made both hydrophilic and superoleophilic, allowing it to have separation efficiency as high as 99. 61 % in a single pass flow. Moreover, even pre-saturated with oil, the mat remained effective in separation and permitted high flow, proving its high caliber for potential industrial applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

We determined at laboratory scale the retention efficiency of different air filter types either composed of a prefilter (EU class G 4) and a secondary fiberglass filter (EU class F 9) or consisting of a <b>filter</b> <b>mat</b> (EU class M 6 and F 8 - 9). Four filter prototypes were tested for their capability to remove aerosol containing equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), bovine enterovirus 1 (BEV), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP), and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus from air. Depending on the filter prototype and utilisation, the airflow was set at 1, 800 m 3 /h (combination of upstream prefilter and fiberglass filter) or 80 m 3 /h (<b>filter</b> <b>mat).</b> The pathogens were aerosolized and their concentration was determined in front of and behind the filter by culture or quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, survival of the pathogens over time in the filter material was determined. Bacteria were most efficiently filtered with a reduction rate of up to 99. 9 % depending on the filter used. An approximately 98 % reduction was achieved for the viruses tested. Viability or infectivity of APP or PRRSV in the filter material decreased below the detection limit after 4 h and 24 h, respectively, whereas S. aureus was still culturable after 4 weeks. Our results demonstrate that pathogens can efficiently be reduced by air filtration. Consequently, air filtration combined with other strict biosecurity measures markedly reduces the risk of introducing airborne transmitted pathogens to animal facilities. In addition, air filtration might be useful in reducing bioaerosols within a pig barn, hence improving respiratory health of pigs...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{filtration}} in {{the broadest}} sense includes any filtration technique that utilizes biological (living) organisms to remove impurities from the wastewater. Filter media selection is critical in the operation to achieve effluent quality requirements. The most important is to choose the correct types of filter media. Laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the optimum ammonia removal performance using four different types of filter media (Ceramic Ring A, Ceramic Ring B, Japanese <b>Filter</b> <b>Mat</b> and Filter Wool) at different ammonia loading rates of 20 until 120 mg L - 1. Ceramic Ring A has been found to give the best performance with respect to their efficiency of ammonia removal because of high surface area and characteristic roughness. In general, nitrification is most efficient at pH levels ranging from about 7. 5 to 9. 0. Water temperature was kept between (27 and 30 °C). Nitrification efficiency is slower at lower temperatures...|$|E

40|$|A {{network of}} {{entangled}} multiwall carbon nanotubes and the composite consisting of filter-supported multiwall carbon nanotube network are conductors whose conductivity {{is sensitive to}} compressive stress both {{in the course of}} monotonic stress growth and when loading/unloading cycles are imposed. The testing has shown as much as 100 % network conductivity increase at the maximum applied stress. The entangled carbon nanotube net-works are prepared by vacuum filtration method and peeled off from the filter. The carbon nanotubes are used in pristine condition or chemically functionalized. The filter-supported entangled networks are prepared by the nanotube dispersion filtration through a non-woven flexible polystyrene filter. The nanotubes infiltrate partly into the filter surface pores and link the accumulated filtrate layer with the <b>filtering</b> <b>mat.</b> The filter-support increases nano-tube network mechanical integrity, the composite tensile ultimate strength and affects fa-vorably the composite electrical resistance.

40|$|The {{collection}} of rainwater from roofs, its storage, and subsequent {{use is a}} simple method of reducing the demand on both the public water supplies and waste treatment facilities. However, {{it is almost impossible}} to utilize rainwater directly without appropriate treatments because the rainwater contains substantial amounts of contaminants in the urban area. In this work, a treatment system for building drainage of rainwater using filtration media was investigate to clarify rainwater for use or discharge. The system consists of an initial settling tank and a separation tank containing the mat and the filter media. The rainwater is either used or discharged after passing through the system. The system is designed to treat only the first flush of rainwater containing a substantial amount of contaminants.

40|$|Svenska kraftnät is the Swedish {{transmission}} system operator, {{responsible for the}} national electrical grid with power lines of 220 kV and 400 kV, and the electrical substations of the grid. In this master thesis an old substation located in a sensitive environmental area is inspected and its environmental risks defined and assessed. From this “worst case scenario” measures are recommended, that should be applicable on other existing substations, and for new constructed substations. This thesis {{is limited to a}} more detailed analysis on how oil spill can be handled. The insulating oil is used in different machines and equipment on the substation to avoid electrical charges. The inspected substation has a special feature; a pipe system that connects wells on the substation area, water pipes from the substation house, and transformer pits to an oil-water separation house. The oil pits are made of concrete and placed under machines with large amounts of oil to capture the oil in case of a breakdown or leakage. In the oil-water separation house oil is separated from water and the clean water is sent to a lake in the vicinity. The most severe environmental risks found are the filter in the oil-water separation house and the risk of oil leakage from the open water-cooling system of the synchronous generator. In addition, {{there is no way to}} catch oil spill from current and voltage transformers and it is not known if the pipe system that transports water and oil spills is completely sealed. Finally, there is no permanent installation to catch spills from tank filling areas and Svenska kraftnät does rarely follow up the environmental work of the entrepreneurs. Svenska kraftnät is recommended to use the products and services from the companies Qlean Scandinavia AB and TTL Miljöteknik AB to attend to the noted environmental risks. Qlean Scandinavia AB offers an environmental friendly cleaning procedure with ultraclean water and sealing of concrete, which can be used for the transformer pits and oil-water separation house. They also sell profile planks as a fire-extinguishing layer for transformer pits. These are considered better and safer than the conventional stones used. The price is almost the same, however the maintenance costs are lower for the profile planks, since they are easier to clean and do not require heavy transports to landfill. They also require less space than the stones, therefore a smaller transformer pit can be built, and cost savings can be made on concrete. TTL Miljöteknik AB has products based on environmental friendly oil solidifying polymers placed in different textiles and filters. They let water and other substances pass, but react with hydrocarbons, like oil, forming a tight rubberlike mass. These installations are new to Europe, but more than 12 000 installations have been made, mainly in the United States and Australia. For the inspected substation in this thesis it is recommended to manage oil spill at each machine and to clean the pipe system. An HFF-filter should be installed in cleaned and sealed transformer pits. The filter lets water from precipitation pass, but binds oil, thanks to the solidifying polymers. The clean water is further transported through the pipe system to the oil-water separation house and from there water is pumped to the lake. Wells must be sealed and the pipes from the substation house led to a septic tank. Agent X, a type of <b>filter</b> <b>mat,</b> should be placed on the substation area to catch oil spills from current and voltage transformers, since previous breakdowns show that oil can be spread over a large area. For plants without a pipe system the water will be released outside the transformer pits. For new constructions it is suggested that transformer pits are built with a polyvinyl mat in the bottom and a filter on the sides, which will capture the oil. A concrete fundament still needs to be built to support the machine; therefore the price will almost be the same as for the conventional transformer pit in concrete, although less concrete is needed. However, with this technique the transformer pit will not require any maintenance...|$|E

50|$|The baleen whales (Mysticeti), {{one of two}} suborders of the Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), are {{characterized}} by having baleen plates for filtering food from water, rather than teeth. This distinguishes them from the other suborder of cetaceans, the toothed whales (Odontoceti). The suborder contains four families and fourteen species. Baleen whales typically seek out a concentration of zooplakton, swim through it, either open-mouthed or gulping, and filter the prey from the water using their baleens. A baleen is a row {{of a large number}} of keratin plates attached to the upper jaw with a composition similar to those in human hair or fingernails. These plates are triangular in section with the largest, inward-facing side bearing fine hairs forming a <b>filtering</b> <b>mat.</b> Right whales are slow swimmers with large heads and mouths. Their baleen plates are narrow and very long — up to 4 m in bowheads — and accommodated inside the enlarged lower lip which fits onto the bowed upper jaw. As the right whale swims, a front gap between the two rows of baleen plates lets the water in together with the prey, while the baleens filter out the water. Rorquals such as the blue whale, in contrast, have smaller heads, are fast swimmers with short and broad baleen plates. To catch prey, they widely open their lower jaw — almost 90° — swim through a swarm gulping, while lowering their tongue so that the head's ventral grooves expand and vastly increase the amount of water taken in. Baleen whales typically eat krill in polar or subpolar waters during summers, but can also take schooling fish, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. All baleen whales except the gray whale feed near the water surface, rarely diving deeper than 100 m or for extended periods. Gray whales live in shallow waters feeding primarily on bottom-living organisms such as amphipods.|$|R
40|$|Electrospun {{polyamide}} 6 (PA 6) and polyamide 6 / 6 (PA 6 / 6) nanofibers {{were produced}} {{in order to}} investigate their experimental characteristics {{with the goal of}} obtaining filtration relevant fiber media. The experimental design model of each PA nanofibers contained the following variables: polymer concentration, ratio of solvents, nanofiber media collection time, tip-to-collector distance, and the deposition voltage. The average diameter of the fibers, their morphology, basis weight, thickness, and resulting media solidity were investigated. Effects of each variable on the essential characteristics of PA 6 / 6 and PA 6 nanofiber media were studied. The comparative analysis of the obtained PA 6 / 6 and PA 6 nanofiber characteristics revealed that PA 6 / 6 had higher potential to be used in filtration applications. Based on the experimental results, the graphical representation—response surfaces—for obtaining nanofiber media with the desirable fiber diameter and basis weight characteristics were derived.

Efficient, reliable fluid reclamation is therefore necessary for manned space exploration. Space habitats require a compact, flexible, and robust apparatus capable of solid-fluid mechanical separation {{over a wide range}} of fluid and particle densities and particle sizes. In space, centrifugal filtration, where particles suspended in fluid are captured by rotating fixed-fiber <b>mat</b> <b>filters,</b> is a logical candidate for mechanical separation. Non-colloidal particles are deposited on the fibers due to inertial impaction or direct interception. Since rotation rates are easily adjustable, inertial effects are the most practical way to control separation rates {{for a wide variety of}} multiphase mixtures in variable gravity environments. Understanding how fluid inertia and differential fluid-particle inertia, characterized by the Reynolds and Stokes numbers, respectively, affect deposition is critical in optimizing filtration in a microgravity environment. This work will develop non-intrusive optical diagnostic techniques for directly visualizing where and when non-colloidal particles deposit upon, or contact, solid surfaces: 'particle proximity sensors'. To model particle deposition upon a single filter fiber, these sensors will be used in ground-based experiments to study particle dynamics as in the vicinity of a large (compared with the particles) cylinder in a simply sheared (i. e., linearly-varying, zero-mean velocity profile) neutrally-buoyant, refractive-index matched solid-liquid suspension...|$|R
