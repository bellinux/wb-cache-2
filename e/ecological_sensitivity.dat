2500|$|The Metacomet Ridge hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England. Dry, hot upper ridges support oak savannas, often dominated by chestnut oak {{and a variety of}} understory grasses and ferns. Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Prickly pear cactus has been recorded on the south-facing slopes of Ragged Mountain. [...] Backslope plant communities tend to be more similar to the adjacent upland plateaus containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in Massachusetts. Many bogs, ponds, and reservoirs lie cupped between trap rock ridge shelves, demonstrating the value of these ridges as important aquifers and wetland ecosystem habitats. Because the Metacomet Ridge generates such varied terrain, it is the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare. The Traprock Wilderness Recovery Strategy (1991) was an early attempt to protect the ridges from sprawl. It received the Connecticut Governor's Green Circle Award yet was ignored by authorities in Southington, Berlin, New Britain, and Meriden. Since then, sprawl has eroded the ecological integrity of the trail corridor, particularly in Southington. That said, Southington has acquired the Crescent Lake compartment, yet now has plans to log it (2014) without regard for the <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the area.|$|E

These [...] "subcritical" [...] bombs use fissile materials which do not reach the self-sustaining chain reaction of a typical nuclear bomb. The bombs are designed by Los Alamos National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, whereby the data collected can be fed to computers to simulate full-scale nuclear explosions for the US National Security Agency (NSA) and DOE. Their explosive yield is low, and small amounts of radiation may be released. Because each sub-critical experiment costs roughly [...] and much time from the humans working within the nuclear weapons management industry, the tests indicate to nuclear abolition activists a strong continued interest (within the U.S. Government) in favor of nuclear weapons.

40|$|This paper advocates {{the stance}} that {{sustainable}} approaches in architecture, although usually associated to contemporary practice, {{have a very}} complex relationship {{with the history of}} architecture and urbanism. By adopting an interpretative framework, the paper highlights the environmental aspects of the architectural practice of Belgrade’s large-scale residential settlements created under the cultural influences of socialist ideology. The socialist system enabled systematic implementation of the principles of the Congrès International d’Architecture Moderne (CIAM) on a large urban scale, in contrast to capitalist countries where these principles were applied on a smaller scale. The paper starts with the premise that these cultural influences, together with the integration of the principles of modernism, caused the rejection and the loss of traditional and ambience values in architecture. Research has shown that these values play a very important role in meeting the needs of <b>ecological</b> and cultural <b>sensitivity</b> in architecture. In its final consequences, the results of research have revealed that, although widely criticized for its break with tradition and the loss of ambience values, residential architecture in Belgrade during the socialist era included significant aspirations of the architectural practice directed at the improvement of aspects of sustainability, and especially aspects of <b>ecological</b> and cultural <b>sensitivity...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper applies {{two methods}} {{to analyze the}} <b>{{ecological}}</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in Huixian wetland, (Guangxi province, China). The one method (the ecological unit method) is that the Huixian wetland reserve is divided into several ecological units according to different geographic condition and agricultural structure; the main factors of <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> are selected; Delphi and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) are applied to determine evaluation factors {{and the weight of}} each factor; at last, Index Accumulation Method (IAM) is adopted to evaluate the <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The other method (the GIS method) is that using <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> indexes and GIS spatial analysis module, makes a comprehensive evaluation of the <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in Huixian wetland. The results of the <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis show that the most sensible zone lies in the centre of the wetland reserve, which can be set to the core protection area. The high sensibility zone is around the core protection area, which can be set to the buffer zone or experimental zone. The lowest sensibility zone is located in the east of the wetland reserve, which can be set to the demonstration area. The compared results of the two different methods show that the first method, the ecological unit method, can be used in case of comparative shortage of existing data. The ecological sensibility distribution is relatively explicit. The second method, the GIS method, can be used in case of the abundant Remote Sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) data. The analytical results are meticulous and objective.

Remote sensing data and geographic information system (GIS) technology are employed to analyze topographic conditions, land-use types, the intensity of urban development, and ecological environmental sensitivity to create reasonable evaluation indicators to analyze urban land carrying capacity based on <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the rapidly developing megacity of Hangzhou, China. In the study, <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is grouped into four levels: non-sensitive, lightly sensitive, moderately sensitive, and highly sensitive. The {{results show that the}} <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> increases progressively from the center to the periphery. The results also show that ULCC is determined by ecologically sensitive levels and that the ULCC is categorized into four levels. Even though it is limited by the four levels, the ULCC still has a large margin if compared with the current population numbers. The study suggests that the urban ecological environment will continue to sustain the current population size in the short-term future. However, it is necessary to focus on the protection of distinctive natural landscapes so that decision makers can adjust measures for ecological conditions to carry out the sustainable development of populations, natural resources, and the environment in megacities like Hangzhou, China...|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} reflection upon {{the development of}} <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in inquiring the educators' agency in two Municipality-led after-school programmes in NE Italy. <b>Ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is a researcher's disposition to maintain an encompassing perspective during the fieldwork, in order to highlight the 'gravitational world' [1] that impacts over the educators' agency in their daily practice. As a consequence, <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> is the researcher's constant attitude of critical inspection on the relevance of context in analysing human activity. In developing an <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> during the fieldwork, the researcher keeps an enlarged focus   of   observation   to   connect   the   educators’   agency   to   their   past   experience and motives in practice, the complex texture of the situation at hand, the tools and {{the events in the}} setting. In this proposal, I discuss the recognition of the gravitational forces that affect the educators' agency in a case study research, by focussing on two interactional situations emerging {{in the context of a}} Municipality-led "Schooling Integrative Support",   which   are   specifically   designed   services   to   support   the   children’s homework duties. I select situations as the relevant units of analysis to support <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> because they contain all the characterising elements of a given activity and the specific contingencies in which the educators' agency unfolds. Situations are interactions that are nested within institutional activities and are based   on   children’s   emergent   interests   and   improvisations.   The   educators   interpret   the ongoing situation and intentionally act in order to achieve educational objectives by recognising constraints and resources in the setting, through the use of specific repertoires of practice. In the two different situations presented in this contribution, the different paths of the  educators’  agency  are  analysed  in  terms  of  their  relations  with the repertoires of practice,  the  nature  of  the  school  tasks  and  the  educators’  positionality  in  relation  to   their institutional mandate, as well as to the schoolteachers. The development of an <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitivity</b> in the case study research can improve the analysis of professional agency by highlighting: - the different paths that professional agency can follow in a single institutional practice; - the complex and conflicting relationships among different educational practices and the overwhelming role of schooling in other activities; - the potential directions for participatory action research, based upon ecologically valid  evidence  of  the  practitioners’  professional  experience...|$|E

Their ability to manage risk associated with such uncertainty and subsequently adapt to change is largely a function of individual circumstances, including their access to different fisheries.

The strain demonstrated an unexpected tolerance to chromium (VI), having an EC 50 value (3. 45 mg Cr (VI) /L) similar to that of arsenic. The {{inclusion of}} a unicellular, microbial test-species into the suite of existing multicellular test species for toxicity evaluation is a key step towards strengthening the assessment of risk for groundwater ecosystems. 8 page(s...|$|R
