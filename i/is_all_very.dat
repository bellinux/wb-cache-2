Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time."

In describing [...] "Exit", Bono said [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well to address America and the violence that is an aggressive foreign policy but to really understand {{that you have to}} get under the skin of your own darkness, the violence we all contain within us.

500|$|Around {{the same}} time, there were rumours of a {{possible}} repeat of the New York concert triumph, {{to be held at}} London's Wembley Stadium in early October. Harrison and Klein quashed the idea, but an English version of the Concert for Bangladesh did take place, on 18 September, before 30,000 fans at The Oval in south London, with a bill featuring the likes of the Who, the Faces, Mott the Hoople, America and Lindisfarne. On 22 September, George and Pattie Harrison arrived home in the UK, with mixing having been completed on the upcoming live album, and Harrison due to meet with Patrick Jenkin of the British Treasury, to deal with the unforeseen obstacle of a [...] "purchase tax" [...] being levied on the album. This was {{one of a number of}} problems that hindered Harrison's Bangladesh project following the Madison Square Garden shows, and the British politician would allegedly tell him: [...] "Sorry!

But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E

500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

[...] "Freedom to be oneself <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well," [...] he would write. [...] "The greater freedom is not to be oneself." [...] Merrill painted a candid portrait in his memoir of gay life in the early 1950s, describing friendships and relationships with several men including Dutch poet Hans Lodeizen, Italian journalist Umberto Morra, U.S. writer Claude Fredericks, art dealer Robert Isaacson, David Jackson, and his partner from 1983 onward, actor Peter Hooten.|$|E
2500|$|Gaitskell's support {{became more}} cautious. On 2 August {{he said of}} Nasser's behaviour, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> familiar.

He cautioned Eden, however, that [...] "e must not, therefore, allow ourselves to get into a position where we might be denounced in the Security Council as aggressors, or where the majority of the Assembly was against us". He had earlier warned Eden that Labour might not support Britain acting alone against Egypt. In two letters to Eden sent on 3 and 10 August 1956, Gaitskell condemned Nasser but again warned that he would not support any action that violated the United Nations charter. In his letter of 10 August, Gaitskell wrote: ...|$|E

Business Week listed a number of difficult fundamental questions finance ministers would now have to resolve by the end of March. These included trade tensions and protectionism, consumer spending, housing prices, a clampdown on lending practices and how to achieve global coordination. The Hindu's Business Line opined that [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well to speak blithely of new Bretton Woods institutions but, when there is no acceptance of a world mediated by Western ideas, the move is doomed ab initio." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Stokowski's death, Tom Burnam writes, the [...] "concatenization of canards" [...] {{that had}} arisen around him was revived {{that his name}} and accent were phony; that his musical {{education}} was deficient; that his musicians did not respect him; that he cared about nobody but himself. Burnam suggests {{that there was a}} dark, hidden reason for these rumours. Stokowski deplored the segregation of symphony orchestras in which women and minorities were excluded, and, so Burnam claims, his detractors got revenge by slandering Stokowski. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the claims made by Tom Burnam, attitudes towards Stokowski have changed dramatically over the years since his death. In 1999, for Gramophone magazine, the noted music commentator David Mellor wrote: [...] "One of the great joys of recent years for me has been the reassessment of Leopold Stokowski. When I was growing up there was a tendency to disparage the old man as a charlatan. Today it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> different. Stokowski is now recognised as the father of modern orchestral standards. He possessed a truly magical gift of extracting a burnished sound from both great and second-rank ensembles. He also loved the process of recording and his gramophone career was a constant quest for better recorded sound. But the greatest pleasure of all for me is his acceptance now as an outstanding conductor of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music, including a lot that was {{at the cutting edge of}} contemporary achievement." ...|$|E
2500|$|In uncharacteristically bold discussions {{after dinner}} Darwin asked his guests [...] "Why {{do you call}} yourselves Atheists?" [...] When they responded that they [...] "did not commit the folly of god-denial, [...] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion", Darwin gave a {{thoughtful}} response, concluding that [...] "I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist." [...] Aveling replied that, [...] "after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive." [...] Darwin smiled and responded [...] "Why should you be so aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?" [...] Aveling and Büchner questioned {{what would have happened}} if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the Origin, and had confined [...] "the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were [...] "proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Byrdmaniax {{was greeted}} {{positively}} by the UK music press but received scathing reviews in the U.S. [...] Richard Meltzer's {{review in the}} August 1971 edition of Rolling Stone magazine was particularly vicious, with Meltzer describing the album as [...] "increments of pus". [...] The same review also described the McGuinn–Levy composition [...] "I Wanna Grow Up to Be a Politician" [...] as a song that was [...] "degenerating into namby pamby innocuous mickey mouse with latent-blatant political content". [...] Meltzer concluded his withering attack by deriding The Byrds themselves as [...] "a boring dead group." [...] In the UK, Roy Hollingworth's review in the August 14, 1971 edition of Melody Maker was more positive and described the album as [...] "one sweet length of bursting Byrds sunshine, so perfect in quality and quantity you'd feel an absolute heel to ask for more." [...] Record Mirror was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, describing it as [...] "another fine album by The Byrds." [...] However, not all British reviews of Byrdmaniax were positive, with Richard Green of the NME noting that [...] "When the true history of rock comes to be written, The Byrds will get a deserved place of honour {{on the strength of}} tunes like 'Mr. Tambourine Man', 'Eight Miles High', and 'So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star'. [...] Hopefully the writer will not have listened to Byrdmaniax or he may drastically alter his opinion." [...] Green was also critical of Terry Melcher's use of strings and horns on many of the tracks, concluding that [...] "Orchestration <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well for some bands, but not, on this showing, for The Byrds." ...|$|E
