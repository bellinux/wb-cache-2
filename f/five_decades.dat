5|$|Dayton's {{population}} declined {{significantly from}} a peak of 262,332 residents in 1960 to only 141,527 in 2010. This was in part due to the slowdown of the region's manufacturing and the growth of Dayton's affluent suburbs including Oakwood, Englewood, Beavercreek, Springboro, Miamisburg, Kettering, and Centerville. The city's most populous ethnic group, white, declined from 78.1% in 1960 to 51.7% by 2010. However, recent census estimates show a 1.3% population increase since 2010, the first increase in <b>five</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than <b>five</b> <b>decades</b> on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, {{it has been argued that}} prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|Following Rai's {{death in}} 1940, Devika Rani {{took control of}} the studio and {{produced}} some more films in partnership with her late husband's associates, namely Sashadhar Mukherjee and Ashok Kumar.

In 1945, she retired from films, married the Russian painter Svetoslav Roerich and moved to his estate on the outskirts of Bangalore, thereafter leading a very reclusive life for the next <b>five</b> <b>decades.</b> Her persona, no less than her film roles, were considered socially unconventional. Her awards include the Padmashri (1958), Dadasaheb Phalke Award (1970) and the Soviet Land Nehru Award (1990).|$|E

5|$|In 1908, {{historian}} Herbert Eugene Bolton identified an area along Garcitas Creek, near Matagorda Bay, as {{the location}} of Fort St. Louis. Other historians, before and after Bolton, argued that the fort was located on Lavaca River in Jackson County. <b>Five</b> <b>decades</b> later, the University of Texas at Austin funded a partial excavation of Bolton's site, {{a part of the}} Keeran ranch. Although several thousand items were recovered, archaeologists could not accurately distinguish between French and Spanish artifacts of the 17th century, and no report on the findings was ever issued. In the 1970s, the artifacts were reexamined by Kathleen Gilmore, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. She determined that while most of the artifacts were Spanish, some definitively matched artifacts recovered from French and French-Canadian excavations of the same time period.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Obama {{administration}} {{passed the}} Affordable Care Act, {{which made the}} most sweeping reforms to the nation's healthcare system in nearly <b>five</b> <b>decades,</b> including mandates, subsidies and insurance exchanges.

Although the recession reached its trough in June 2009, voters remained frustrated with the slow pace of the economic recovery. The Republicans, who stood in opposition to Obama's policies, won control of the House of Representatives with a landslide in 2010 and control of the Senate in 2014.|$|E
