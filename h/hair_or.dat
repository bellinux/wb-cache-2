5|$|Beginning in 1619, {{the ethnic}} Manchu Qing dynasty forced all men in China {{to adopt the}} queue: a long braid down the back with the hair near the {{forehead}} completely shaved. Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them either their <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> their head would be cut.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{clear evidence}} of <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> fur is in fossils of Castorocauda and Megaconus, from 164 million {{years ago in the}} mid-Jurassic. In the 1950s, it was suggested that the foramina (passages) in the maxillae and premaxillae (bones {{in the front of the}} upper jaw) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae (whiskers) and so were evidence of <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> fur; it was soon pointed out, however, that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae, as the modern lizard Tupinambis has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian cynodont Thrinaxodon. Popular sources, nevertheless, continue to attribute whiskers to Thrinaxodon. Studies on Permian coprolites suggest that non-mammalian synapsids of the epoch already had fur, setting the evolution of hairs possibly as far back as dicynodonts.|$|E

Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, Armstrong became {{involved}} in an unusual legal dispute with his barber of 20 years, Mark Sizemore. After cutting Armstrong's hair, Sizemore sold some of it to a collector for $3,000 without Armstrong's knowledge or permission. Armstrong threatened legal action against Sizemore unless he returned the <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> donated the proceeds to a charity of Armstrong's choosing. Sizemore, unable to retrieve the hair, decided to donate the proceeds to the charity of Armstrong's choice.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> changes in hair color (e.g. dark hair turning reddish).|$|E

5|$|Chewing lice {{live among}} the <b>hairs</b> <b>or</b> {{feathers}} of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole {{life on a}} single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to <b>hairs</b> <b>or</b> feathers. The eggs hatch into nymphs, which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.|$|R

5|$|The western rock {{nuthatch}} builds an elaborate flask-shaped nest from mud, dung and <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> feathers, and decorates the nest's exterior and nearby crevices with feathers and insect wings. The nests are located in rock crevices, in caves, under cliff overhangs or on buildings. The eastern {{rock nuthatch}} builds a similar but less complex structure across {{the entrance to a}} cavity. Its nest can be quite small but may weigh up to 32kg (70lb). This species will also nest in river banks or tree holes and will enlarge its nest hole if it the cavity is too small.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks later}} a hard-hat diver, sent down {{to recover the}} gold and other valuables, found the bodies of two women {{at the foot of}} the saloon staircase, one with her arm around the other. The diver tried to reach them to take a lock of <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> some other {{personal}} item that could be identified by their loved ones, but the restriction of the air line made it impossible. The gold in the Captain's cabin was recovered after much difficulty. While recovering the gold, several sharks that were caught near the wreck were found to contain human bones, remains and jewellery.|$|E

They appear to deter feeding insects to some degree by impeding movement and restricting access {{to the surface of}} the stem or leaf. Some plants have glandular hairs, either as well as non-glandular <b>hairs</b> <b>or</b> instead of them. Glandular hairs have regions of tissue that produce secretions of secondary metabolites. These chemical substances can repel or poison feeding insects.|$|R

Among all provinces, Luapula recorded the highest TFR of 7.3, and also the highest infant mortality rate (IMR) of 100 deaths per 1,000 births as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee breeches of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers in their <b>hair</b> (<b>or</b> both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches}} from the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, {{with the}} help of a friend, the then 28-year-old Ho set up shop in Chinatown with only a comb, a stool, and a {{kerosene}} lamp. She worked from 8am to 3am, charging five cents to comb <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> weave plaits and buns for amahs and Samsui women. She did that every day for almost three decades, interrupted only by periods when she was incapacitated by acute attacks of arthritis. She scrimped and saved, and by the time she was in her 40s, she had enough to buy a shophouse in Club Street. Although illiterate, she made some property investments and eventually became a landlord, renting out rooms. As her wealth grew, she acquired more properties, and she began to adopt children from poor families, becoming a single mother of six daughters and twenty-five godchildren.|$|E

5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had to ring his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was {{to abstain from}} all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair. He {{was to be a}} Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach them how to raise the boy {{who was going to be}} born.|$|E
5|$|The maximum {{terminal}} hair length {{depends on}} the length of the anagen (period of hair growth) for the individual. Waist-length <b>hair</b> <b>or</b> longer is only possible to reach for people with long anagen. The anagen lasts between 2 and 7 years, for some individuals even longer, and is followed by shorter catagen (transition) and telogen (resting) periods. At any given time, about 85% of hair strands are in anagen. The fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) gene affects the hair cycle in mammals including humans; blocking FGF5 in the human scalp (by applying a herbal extract that blocked FGF5) extends the hair cycle, resulting in less hair fall and increased hair growth.|$|E
