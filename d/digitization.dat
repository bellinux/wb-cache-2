5|$|Kalimpong {{has access}} {{to most of the}} {{television}} channels aired in the rest of India. Cable Television still provides service to many homes in the town and it's outskirts, while DTH connections are now practically mandatory throughout the country. Besides mainstream Indian channels, many Nepali-language channels such as Dainandini DD Kalimpong Television KTv Haal Khabar (an association of the Hill Channel Network), Jan Sarokar, Himalayan People's Channel (HPC), and Kalimpong Times are broadcast in Kalimpong. These channels, which mainly broadcast locally relevant news, are produced by regional media houses and news networks, and are broadcast through the local cable network, which is now slowly becoming defunct due to the Indian government's ruling on mandatory <b>digitization</b> of TV channels.|$|E
5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor <b>digitization</b> contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look {{is a question of}} fashion rather than function.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Anton Gimenez of the Filmoteca de Catalunya {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} this print, which he believed to be in a state of total decomposition, to Serge Bromberg and Eric Lange of the French film company Lobster Films. Bromberg and Lange offered to trade a recently rediscovered film by Segundo de Chomón for the hand-colored print, and Gimenez accepted. Bromberg and Lange consulted various specialist laboratories in an attempt to restore the film, but because the reel of film had apparently decomposed into a rigid mass, none believed restoration to be possible. Consequently, Bromberg and Lange themselves set to work separating the film frames, discovering that only the edges of the film stock had decomposed and congealed together, and thus that many of the frames themselves were still salvageable. Between 2002 and 2005, various <b>digitization</b> efforts allowed 13,375 fragments of images from the print to be saved. In 2010, a complete restoration of the hand-colored print was launched by Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage. The digitized fragments of the hand-colored print were reassembled and restored, with missing frames recreated {{with the help of a}} black-and-white print in the possession of the Méliès family, and time-converted to run at an authentic silent-film speed, 14 frames per second. The restoration was completed in 2011 at Technicolor's laboratories in Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 2006, the {{university}} began to digitize the materials {{of the collection}} and place them online at the Darlington Digital Library. The original, sometimes fragile, materials of the library were placed in storage for availability to researchers upon request. In 2009, following <b>digitization</b> and protective storage of the library's materials, the space was renovated by architect Rob Pfaffmann in order to house {{the university}}'s Humanities Center which, while retaining much of the original character and furnishings, now includes office space for staff and visiting fellows.|$|E

25|$|Interactivity can be {{considered}} a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of interactivity, and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television {{as an example of a}} new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike <b>digitization</b> and convergence.|$|E
25|$|The University of Pittsburgh's Humanities Center, part of School of Arts and Sciences, {{is housed}} in room 602 of the Cathedral of Learning which was a sixth-floor space {{formerly}} occupied by the Darlington Memorial Library. Following <b>digitization</b> and protective storage of the library's materials, its space was renovated by architect Rob Pfaffmann in 2009 in order to house the center which now includes office space for staff and visiting fellows. The Humanities Center space retains much of the original character {{and many of the}} antique furnishings originally bequeathed to the university by the Darlington family, and features moldings and green walls that are duplicated from the 18th mansion Graeme Park, a Pennsylvania colonial-era governor’s residence. The Center for Humanities was finished in time for an open house that was part a conference hosted by the center on November 14–15, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In November {{pictures}} and a story cover the tents of activities set up around a chiropractor's house Bahá'ís {{from across the}} nation are visible in a local newspaper and programs describing {{the teachings of the}} religion are more visible in February 1972 scattered across the State. Rumors of the intensity of the wave of conversions echo in Lumberton, North Carolina even in 1975 - meanwhile a statewide conference in South Carolina was held February 1973 and a public presentation of the Bahá'í New year, (Bahá'í Naw-Rúz) was set in nearby Florence. The Bahá'í Faith at the University of South Carolina at Columbia was covered in the student newspaper The Gamecock. <b>Digitization</b> has been run from 1908 to 1988. There are about 45 pages that mention the religion (not including trivial repeats.) All but one are after 1967 but none of the articles mention the spread of the religion in South Carolina - there are a few larger profiles of the religion.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Ron Tyler {{returned}} to the Amon Carter in 2006 as director. (Dr. Tyler began his museum career at the museum from 1969 to 1986.) During his tenure as director, the museum presented major exhibitions {{of the work of}} Alfred Jacob Miller (1810–1874) and William Ranney (1813–1857), and an important exhibition of African-American art from the private collection of Harmon and Harriet Kelley. Paintings by George de Forest Brush (1855–1941) and Charles Sheeler (1883–1965), as well as a complete, 20-volume set of Edward Sheriff Curtis’ The North American Indian (1907–1930), were added to the museum’s permanent collection during Dr. Tyler’s administration. Dr. Andrew J. Walker has led the Amon Carter since 2011.

He has overseen additions to the permanent collection of works by Robert Seldon Duncanson (1821–1872), Raphaelle Peale (in memory of Ruth Carter Stevenson), and John Singer Sargent (1856–1925), and he initiated major upgrades to the museum’s digital presence, including the Connecting to Exhibitions <b>digitization</b> project, a two-year initiative that will allow online access to many of the museum’s previous art exhibitions.|$|E
25|$|From 2015, Hornby plc {{began to}} {{announce}} a series of declining financial results. The major reason behind the decline Hornby declared was two fold, with {{the decline in the}} number of (now aged, and hence older) collectable customers, and a lack of interest in modelling as a hobby in light of the <b>digitization</b> and advancement of the internet games industry. After the PLC shares dropped by more than 50% in a year, at the 2016 results Hornby declared that it planned to cut more than half of the toys it made, after discovering that it generated 90% of its profits from only 50% of its range. In the year to 31 March 2017, revenues fell further to £47.4m from £55.8m, while underlying losses widened to £6.3m from a £5.7m deficit in 2016. The financial declines culminated in July 2017, when the largest shareholder Phoenix Asset Management (PAM) agreed to buy 17.6 million Hornby shares for 32.375p from the second largest - and activist/protagonist shareholder - New Pistoia Income (NPI), which gave PAM a 55.2% holding in the company. This triggered under stock exchange rules a mandatory takeover offer of Hornby by PAM, at the NPI strike price of 32.375p, valuing Hornby at £27.4million. As a result of the takeover, the chairman of Hornby resigned from the company in August 2017, followed by the Chief Executive in September 2017.|$|E

First unveiled in August 2007, the C-SPAN Video Library contains all of the network's programming since 1987, totaling more than 160,000 hours at its completion of <b>digitization</b> and public debut in March 2010. Older C-SPAN programming continues {{to be added to}} the library, dating back to the beginning of the network in 1979, and some limited earlier footage from the National Archives, such as film clips of Richard Nixon's 1972 trip to China, is available as well. Most of the recordings before 1987 (when the C-SPAN Archive was established) were not saved, except for approximately 10,000 hours of video which are slated to be made available online. As of June 2013, the C-SPAN Video Library held approximately 200,000 hours of programming. Described by media commentators as a major educational service and a valuable resource for researchers of politics and history, the C-SPAN Video Library has also had a major role in media and opposition research in several U.S. political campaigns.
