50|$|A lemma's shape, {{their number}} of veins, whether they <b>are</b> awned <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> the {{presence}} <b>or</b> absence of hairs {{are particularly important}} characters in grass taxonomy.|$|R
50|$|A. porphyreus <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{aggressive}} <b>or</b> territorial, <b>and</b> {{several of}} them will often live together in a single retreat. These sociable lizards will even share nests, where several females will lay their eggs.|$|R
25|$|November – Then apostle James Faust gave {{a speech}} at BYU in which he stated that {{homosexuality}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> biological <b>or</b> inborn <b>and</b> that same-sex marriage would unravel families, the fabric of human society.|$|R
30|$|Since {{obtaining the}} permit <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simple <b>or</b> immediate, <b>and</b> {{this is even}} more the case when {{applying}} (a housing accommodation is mandatory) short-term migrants tend to end up included in irregular or unregistered population.|$|R

3000|$|The {{important}} consideration {{is how to}} ensure (1) whether the nanofibers <b>are</b> nanotubes <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>and</b> (2) whether the solid microspheres <b>are</b> core-shell microspheres <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> i.e., {{how to make them}} hollow-like structures.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{modifications}} to firearms made by gunsmiths are restricted as well. The ATF specifies what modifications <b>are</b> permitted <b>or</b> <b>not</b> permitted <b>and</b> to which firearms that may <b>or</b> may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> applied.|$|R
50|$|Finally, Crow and Pie {{is unusual}} in that the lady, {{although}} angry <b>and</b> ashamed, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> despondent <b>or</b> suicidal <b>and</b> appears ready to resume her normal life (to the extent {{that this will be}} permitted by society).|$|R
30|$|Considering Styles, it is {{important}} to mention that they <b>are</b> preferences and <b>not</b> abilities. Styles <b>are</b> <b>not</b> good <b>or</b> bad, <b>and</b> can vary across the lifespan. What is valued at one time and place may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> valued at another.|$|R
25|$|Members of a squad may spawn {{near their}} squad leader, {{provided}} that the leader <b>is</b> <b>not</b> dead (<b>or</b> incapacitated), <b>and</b> that the team holds at least one control point. This feature allows squads to more quickly regroup after taking casualties.|$|R
50|$|Elst {{tries to}} show that personalities like Veer Savarkar <b>or</b> Golwalkar <b>were</b> <b>not</b> fascist <b>or</b> racist <b>and</b> also writes in detail about Savitri Devi. Other topics that are treated by Elst in this book are the caste system and the swastika.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{design of}} all-optical logic gates based on {{nonlinear}} slot waveguide couplers <b>is</b> proposed. <b>NOT,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>and</b> AND logic gates {{can be realized}} by simple single optical directional coupler configuration. Strong polarization dependencies of slot waveguides are effectively utilized for realizing polarization-independent optical directional couplers in linear regime and polarization-dependent all-optical switches in nonlinear regime. All the simulations performed in this paper are done for three-dimensional nonlinear channel waveguide structures by using rigorous numerical schemes based on full-vector finite-element method specially formulated for nonlinear optical waveguides...|$|R
30|$|Both, {{the limit}} {{dynamics}} and the transitional dynamics, are important, since a priori it cannot be decided whether an economy {{is close to}} its dynamic equilibrium (and, thus, limit dynamics <b>are</b> prevalent) <b>or</b> <b>not</b> (<b>and,</b> thus, transitional dynamics are prevalent).|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} is that digital marketing is easy to be measured allowing businesses to know the reach that their marketing is making, whether the digital marketing <b>is</b> working <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> the amount of activity and conversation that is involved.|$|R
30|$|Analysis of {{variance}} (ANOVA) {{is widely used}} statistical methods to compare the mean {{of more than two}} groups of sample. ANOVA uses the F statistic to compare whether the differences between sample means <b>are</b> significant <b>or</b> <b>not</b> (Miller <b>and</b> Miller 2005).|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} every {{language}} L {{in the class}} ACC can be recognized by depth-two deterministic circuits with a symmetricfunction gate at the root and 2 log O(1) n AND gates of fan-in log O(1) n at the leaves, or equivalently, there exist polynomials p n (x 1; : : :; x n) over Z of degree log O(1) n and with coefficients of magnitude 2 log O(1) n and functions h n : Z ! f 0; 1 g such that for each n and each x 2 f 0; 1 g n, ØL (x) = h n (p n (x 1; : : :; x n)). This improves an earlier result of Yao (1985). We also analyze and improve modulus-amplifying polynomials constructed by Toda (1991) and Yao (1985). 1. Introduction and Overview 1. 1. The ACC Problem. Strong lower bounds have been established for the size of constant-depth circuits that compute explicit Boolean functions in {{the case that the}} allowable gates <b>are</b> <b>NOT,</b> <b>OR,</b> <b>AND,</b> and MOD q, where q is a fixed prime power. (For Boolean variables y 1; : : :; y, MODm (y 1; : : :; y) = 1 if P y i j 0 (mod m), [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The Constitution of Brazil {{provides}} that only willful crimes against life, namely full or attempted murder, abortion, infanticide and suicide instigation, {{be judged by}} juries.

30|$|The leiomyomas were laparoscopically {{retrieved}} {{after the}} use of morcellator. In every patient, a blue dye test was done {{at the end of}} the operation in order to assess if the uterine cavity <b>was</b> opened <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>and</b> if the fallopian tubes were patent.|$|R

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of Assyria, ended not only the Iron Age, but also the era referred to as Pre-History, {{to make way for}} what has been variously described as Recorded History, or more specifically late Ancient History or Classical Civilisation.
