25|$|I {{think that}} Amphiaraos {{most of all}} {{dedicated}} himself to interpreting dreams: it is clear that, when he was considered a god, he set up an oracle of dreams. And the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to purify oneself, when someone comes to consult Amphiaraos, and the purification ritual is to sacrifice to the god, and people sacrifice to him and to all those whose names are on (the altar), and - when these things are finished – they sacrifice a ram and spread out its skin under themselves, lie down waiting for the revelation of a dream.|$|E
25|$|When the King {{toured the}} front (24 October) Haig {{told him that}} Robertson should go home and become CIGS, whilst Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) “The Conduct of the War”, arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany. Robertson told Haig from London (15 November 1915), where he was seeing the King and Kitchener, “the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to get you in command”.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, Sinatra {{released}} Watertown, one of {{his most}} acclaimed concept albums, with music by Bob Gaudio (of the Four Seasons) and lyrics by Jake Holmes. However, it sold a mere 30,000 copies that year and reached a peak chart position of 101. He left Caesars Palace in September that year after an incident where executive Sanford Waterman pulled a gun on him. He performed several charity concerts with Count Basie at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On November 2, 1970, Sinatra recorded the last songs for Reprise Records before his self-imposed retirement, announced the following June at a concert in Hollywood {{to raise money for the}} Motion Picture and TV Relief Fund. He finished the concert with a [...] "rousing" [...] performance of [...] "That's Life", and stated [...] "Excuse me while I disappear" [...] as he left the stage. He told LIFE journalist Thomas Thompson that [...] "I've got things to do, like the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> not to do [...] at all for eight months... maybe a year", while Barbara Sinatra later claimed that Sinatra had grown [...] "tired of entertaining people, especially when all they really wanted were the same old tunes he had long ago become bored by". While he was in retirement, President Richard Nixon asked him to perform at a Young Voters Rally in anticipation of the upcoming campaign. Sinatra obliged and chose to sing [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] for the rally held in Chicago on October 20, 1972.|$|E
2500|$|Boulanger {{accepted}} pupils {{from any}} background; her only criterion {{was that they}} had to want to learn. She treated students differently depending on their ability: her talented students were expected to answer the most rigorous questions and perform well under stress. The less able students, who did not intend to follow a career in music, were treated more leniently. Each student had to be approached differently: [...] "When you accept a new pupil, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to try to understand what natural gift, what intuitive talent he has. Each individual poses a particular problem." [...] "It does not matter what style you use, as long as you use it consistently." [...] Boulanger used a variety of teaching methods, including traditional harmony, score reading at the piano, species counterpoint, analysis, and sight-singing (using fixed-Do solfège).|$|E
2500|$|Haig sent {{copies of}} the {{relevant}} orders and a critique of GHQ's conduct of the battle to his wife, who showed them to Stamfordham (10 November) for the King to see. Robertson was working against French, telling Haig (15 November) that [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to get you in command". The Prime Minister discussed the matter with the King and Kitchener (both of whom thought French {{not up to the}} job, although Kitchener thought the time not right for a change), and, on 23 November, Haig. Asquith then asked Esher to convey to French in person the news that he must resign, but that he was being offered a peerage and the newly created job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces. [...] However, French insisted on seeing Asquith again (29 November) at which meeting Asquith told him that he must take the first step and that he was not being [...] "recalled" [...] (sacked). [...] French's official critique of Haig's performance at Loos finally reached the War Office on 1 December. [...] He wrote to Asquith (2 December) suggesting that Kitchener be removed {{to be replaced by a}} civilian Secretary of State to avoid friction with the new job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, and writing that he would await Asquith's decision on this point. [...] He returned to France (3 December), but Asquith had been exchanging further letters with Stamfordham and they agreed that French must now be pressed to quit. [...] Walter Long telephoned French (4 December) passing on the Prime Minister's message that he must resign.|$|E
60|$|When we met together, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{to consult}} as to taking Mina again into our confidence. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> getting desperate, {{and it is}} at least a chance, though a {{hazardous}} one. As a preliminary step, I was released from my promise to her.|$|R

50|$|Once Basset was {{established}} in Valencia, practically exercising the function of Viceroy, and {{with most of the}} country under control of the Maulets (meaning, of the armed villagers), the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to abolish all taxes to the Nobles.|$|R

60|$|When {{the boys}} rose the next morning, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> {{to look out}} of the window, {{to see what the}} promise was in respect to the weather. It was not raining, but the sky was {{overcast}} and heavy.|$|R
60|$|I am sure I did {{not know}} how we were to get ready, or what we were to do, but my main idea was that no time was to be lost in doing something. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> to awaken our friends.|$|R
60|$|But God {{inspired}} Moses and the Prophets {{to write}} {{as they have}} written. They were not to tell men that the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> learnt was how to be rich; nor how to be strong; nor even how to be happy: but that the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to <b>be</b> learnt was that God created the heaven and the earth.|$|R

Randy organizes his neighbors to provide housing, food, and water for themselves.|$|R
60|$|Stooping down I saw {{the bear}} under the bed, now {{crowding}} himself {{back as far}} as possible into a corner.
