500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier than hers with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E
2500|$|McCain also {{received}} {{the support of}} Independent Democrat Joe Lieberman, who said, [...] "I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> (McCain) {{is the best of}} all candidates to unite our country across political lines so we can begin to solve some of the problems people have." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bloomberg {{supported}} {{the legalization of}} same-sex marriage in New York. Still, he appealed a decision finding the limiting of same-sex marriage {{in the state of}} New York unconstitutional. [...] "My personal opinion is that anybody should be allowed to marry anybody. I don't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we should put restrictions on who you should marry.... What the city doesn't want to have happen is people getting a marriage license and then six months, or one year later, or two years later, finding out it's meaningless," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Bridge. [...] "A mob is {{not open}} to reason. If they get us I shall hang, unless someone <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the stake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very well}} for Jupiter that he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the curtain," [...] said Mrs. Brinkley. [...] "They couldn't have kept it up at that level much longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the man." [...] Phil's manner showed {{increased}} excitement. [...] "Isn't {{this the}} strangest thing that ever <b>happened?</b> <b>To</b> <b>think</b> of my running across my uncle in this out-of-the-way place!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Cuccinelli stated [...] "homosexuality is wrong." [...] During his 2009 {{campaign}} for attorney general, he stated [...] "My {{view is that}} homosexual acts, not homosexuality, but homosexual acts are wrong. They’re intrinsically wrong. And I think in a natural law based country it’s appropriate to have policies that reflect that. ... They don’t comport with natural law. I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that it represents (to put it politely; I need my thesaurus to be polite) behavior that is not healthy to an individual and in aggregate is not healthy to society." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Daily Show episode on 17 March 2010 showed {{clips from}} the Texas State Board of Education in which [...] "a panel of experts" [...] {{recommended}} including Romero in the state's history books, but an amendment proposed by Patricia Hardy to exclude Romero was passed on 10 March 2010. The clip of Ms. Hardy shows her arguing against including Romero because [...] "I guarantee you {{most of you}} did not know who Oscar Romero was. ...I just <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it's not [...]" [...] Romero has also had a house at Cardijn College named after him.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2002, {{appearing}} on CNN's Crossfire, Fossella argued for partly privatizing Social Security and allow {{some of the}} funds be placed on Wall Street investments. He said [...] "I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the President {{is on the right}} side of history here. And I think the more you empower American people, the more you give them the opportunity to invest on their own and being in control of their own destiny and their own retirement, the better off we'll be." [...] In a standardized constituent letter in February 2005, Fossella said [...] "We need to examine the viability of voluntary personal savings accounts in which young people would have the opportunity to invest a small portion of their savings." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, O' Grady; I {{have had}} {{tremendous}} luck. And {{it has all}} come about owing <b>to</b> my <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{it would be a}} good thing to take possession of that French lugger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] replied Peter thoughtfully. [...] "I never <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it before. Just the same, I don't see how {{you find}} food enough on the trees when they are all bare in winter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How awful! I {{never dreamed}} you had put sugar in, because I knew your mother never does. I <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, for a wonder [...] . I'm always forgetting it [...] . so I popped a spoonful in." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Eugenics and Other Evils Chesterton {{attacked}} eugenics as Britain {{was moving}} towards {{passage of the}} Mental Deficiency Act 1913. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called {{for the government to}} sterilise people deemed [...] "mentally defective"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, [...] "It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> intelligent from having any wife or children." [...] He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including [...] "Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point … we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "there {{are a great}} many. I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mr. Wentworth, {{because he}} was in the hotel this morning. He is in the Tremont Building." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only wanted}} to warn you," [...] said Mary, rather repentantly. [...] "Of course, your father's so {{absent-minded}} he mightn't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of getting married again. But it's better to be prepared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that our}} old Dad once said I'd never {{be worth a}} dollar in all my life. What would he say now, Jane, if he knew I stood good to have five thousand--if I can manage to outlive you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will be {{so simple}} that every one will accept it willingly and gladly, and wonder that no one <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it before. And, perhaps, the world is now grown old enough and docile enough to receive the truth without resentment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Peter thoughtfully. [...] "I {{would be}} easily {{seen in a}} coat like that, for a fact. I hadn't thought of that. I guess Old Mother Nature knows best. I--I wonder how she ever <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a coat like yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he admitted. [...] "There isn't {{much chance}} unless she should <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{the same way}} you do: that I had {{suffered}} enough, and {{that it was time to}} stop punishing me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, sir {{the very}} {{circumstance}} {{that we were}} brought up together has prevented us all from regarding the thing as possible. But, why 'too late,' my excellent guardian, if we {{who are the most}} interested in the thing should <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> otherwise?" ...|$|E
60|$|Forester, however, did not <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of this; {{and so when}} {{it began}} to snow, his only {{immediate}} desire was to go forward as fast as possible, so as {{to get into the}} woods again where he and Marco would be in some measure under shelter.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're disabled, lad, but not killed, an' {{the first}} bit of soldierin' {{that you have}} been called on to do is like to give great credit with such as Colonel Allen and Colonel Easton. Tell me how you <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of {{overcoming}} them in this shape?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{just come}} on a visit, you know," [...] said Ozma. [...] "Both Dorothy and I were {{wondering}} how we should pass the day when we <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> we'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the Sawhorse and rode straight here." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{a spirit}} of {{mischief}} came into the boy's head, for he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the present opportunity to have fun would never occur again. He tied Father Time to his uncle's hitching post, {{that he might not}} escape, and then crossed the road to the corner grocery.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know it; {{and though}} I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> myself that her other child would better repay her devotion,'--this he said, {{looking up to}} Hetta and smiling,--'I quite feel how good a mother she is to Felix. You know, when she first came the other day we almost had a quarrel.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} meant {{everything}} that's honourable; only, you see, the law mayn't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> so," [...] says Mr. Draper, winking his eye. ("Hang the supercilious beast; I touch him there!) Your aunt says it's the most imprudent thing ever she heard of--to call it by no worse name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are salted almonds in this one," [...] went on Spud, opening an {{imitation}} of a sweet potato. [...] "And here are stuffed dates, and this had raisins in it--and here are soft gum drops! Say, Max, this is certainly great! How did you <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it?" [...] And Spud looked tremendously pleased.|$|E
6000|$|Before he had got many {{chips in}} it, however, he <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the {{wheelbarrow}} {{would be a}} better thing to get them in with. They would not stick in that {{as they did in the}} basket. “Men always use a wheelbarrow,” he said to himself, “and why should not I?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then walk {{to them at}} once!" [...] cried Isabel, wholly unabashed, and in fact {{unable to}} see what he had to be ashamed of. [...] "Actually, I believe you would have allowed me to leave Rochester without telling me the falls were here, if you hadn't <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Sam Patch." ...|$|R
6000|$|And it was so! There was the {{greatest}} excitement in the court while that lawyer and the judges were reaching for coins and examining them and exclaiming. And everybody was full of admiration of Wilhelm's brightness in <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that neat idea. At last order was called and the court said: ...|$|R
60|$|HOTCHKISS. I did my duty--my higher duty. If I {{had made}} that attack, my {{commanding}} officer's plan {{would have been}} successful, {{and he would have}} been promoted. Now I <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that the British Army should be commanded by gentlemen, and by gentlemen alone. This man was not a gentleman. I sacrificed my military career--I faced disgrace and social ostracism rather than give that man his chance.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was only}} {{yesterday}} evening that I came to London with my brother. I sent round to Mrs Plornish {{almost as soon}} as we arrived, that I might hear of you and let you know I had come. Then I heard that you were here.

[...] For it cannot be successfully maintained that {{our understanding of}} a word, for example, is an actual existent content of the mind at times when we are not thinking of the word. It is merely what may be called a [...] "disposition," [...] i.e. {{it is capable of}} being aroused whenever we hear the word or <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it.

6000|$|... "Well, {{he came in}} here to get a five-dollar bill changed. I <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> see him as he {{was going}} out and I called to him, {{thinking}} it was you.

6000|$|... "Yes. Did you see them? I just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it. I was in here, looking round. Mr. Berkeley {{had this}} room {{while you were}} away. He left this morning.
