5|$|Large {{waves in}} Puerto Rico caused minor coastal {{flooding}} in Cataño. Near-hurricane-force winds in Bermuda downed trees and power lines, which left 20,000people without power. Rough surf {{on the island}} damaged a few boats and hotels. In addition, the passage of Felix postponed Bermuda's 1995independence referendum. Large waves produced by the storm affected nearly the entire East Coast of the United States. In New York, two houses were washed away <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hamptons,</b> and two boats capsized in Maine. While passing southeast of Newfoundland, Felix produced moderate rainfall and large waves across the island, although damage was minimal. Overall, Felix caused nine deaths due to drowning along the coasts of Rhode Island, New Jersey, and North Carolina. The storm did approximately $2.5 million (1995 USD) in damage on Bermuda, while rough seas produced about $132,000 in losses along the United States coastline.|$|E

25|$|As a whole both Suffolk and Nassau {{counties}} are considered swing counties.

500|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} set <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hamptons,</b> a wealthy enclave in New York, but {{was transferred to}} London when Allen found financing for the film there. The film was partly funded by BBC Films, which required that he make the film in the UK with largely local cast and crew. In an interview with The Guardian, Allen {{explained that he was}} allowed [...] "the same kind of creative liberal attitude that I'm used to", in London. He complained that the American studio system was not interested in making small films [...] "They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500m." [...] A further change was required when Kate Winslet, who was supposed to play the part of Nola Rice, resigned a week before filming was scheduled to begin. Scarlett Johansson was offered the part, and accepted, but the character had to be re-written as an American. According to Allen, [...] "It was not a problem...It took about an hour." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} the summer of 2012 <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hamptons,</b> New York, where Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z were living. She invited producers and songwriters to accompany them, including Sia, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and The-Dream. Beyoncé described the atmosphere as unconventional, saying, [...] "we had dinners with the producers every day, like a family... it was like a camp. Weekends off. You could go and jump in the pool and ride bikes... the ocean and grass and sunshine... it was really a safe place." [...] She would spend the majority of her day with her newborn daughter, taking some hours out to record music. The album's opening track [...] "Pretty Hurts", co-written by Sia, was completed during these sessions. The project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to New York City's Jungle City and Oven studios where most of the album was recorded.

I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, {{but for the most part}} people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E
