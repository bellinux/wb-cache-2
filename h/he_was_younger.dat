5|$|Although a real ninja wears {{black to}} be inconspicuous, Kishimoto gave Naruto an orange {{jumpsuit}} {{to fit the}} shōnen genre. His wardrobe is based on clothing that Kishimoto wore when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger.</b> According to him, a pre-existing design {{would not have made}} Naruto unique, whereas something original would have made him too distinctive. Because Naruto is associated with spirals in terms of objects he uses, the designer incorporated swirl patterns into the costume. Initial illustrations depicted Naruto in boots, but Kishimoto replaced these with sandals, because he enjoys drawing toes. The goggles Naruto used to wear were replaced with a hitai-ite, or shinobi headband, because they were too time-consuming to draw. One of the most difficult design choices was the color palette of Naruto's outfit. The orange in his costume makes Naruto pop and the blue parts are complementary. Kishimoto apologized to the anime staff for Naruto's design, as he considered it too difficult to animate.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{defeated}} Betterman 2 to 0 at {{the finals}} of the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials.

5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> he learned from the veterans in the industry and that Joe and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
