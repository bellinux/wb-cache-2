5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is {{a simple way to}} control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces the thickness of the electrical <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff {{determined}} that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting {{would soon be}} beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore {{the surface of the}} painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed.

5|$|The patagium is {{the wing}} membrane. The patagium is {{stretched}} between {{the arm and}} hand bones, down the lateral {{side of the body}} and down to the hind limbs. This skin membrane consists of connective tissue, elastic fibers, nerves, muscles, and blood vessels. The muscles keep the membrane taut during flight. The skin on the body of the bat, which has one layer of epidermis and dermis, as well as the presence of hair follicles, sweat glands and a fatty subcutaneous layer, {{is very different from the}} skin of the wing membrane. The patagium is an extremely thin <b>double</b> <b>layer</b> of epidermis; these layers are separated by a connective tissue center, rich with collagen and elastic fibers. The membrane has no hair follicles or sweat glands, except between the fingers. Unlike birds whose stiff wings deliver bending and torsional stress to the shoulders, bats have a flexible wing membrane which can only resist tension. To achieve flight, a bat exerts force inwards at the points where the membrane meets the skeleton, so that an opposing force balances it on the wing edges perpendicular to the wing surface. However, this adaptation does not permit bats to reduce their wingspan as birds do, which means they cannot travel over long distances like birds can.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{mechanism for}} acceleration of auroral particles may be through electrostatic <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> Birkeland-currents can create favorable conditions for <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> {{by reduction of}} the electron density at high altitudes. When <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> appear, a reduction of the current density will occur due to broadening of the current-carrying region {{in response to the}} increased resistivity associated with the <b>double</b> <b>layers.</b> However, the <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> will persist, and a balance can be established between the current-broadening and concentrating effects operative in the low ionosphere. Methods to observe <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> with rockets and satellites include measurements of pitch-angle distributions with high resolution, three-axis electric double probes, and topside sounders. Due to the small field-aligned extent (10 - 100 Debye-lengths) of <b>double</b> <b>layers,</b> they will only show up as spikes of short duration in the output signal of a double probe. Such signals should therefore not be discarded as spurious, but analyzed carefully. Simultaneous measurements of Birkeland-currents, electron density, ion composition, and fluxes and energies of precipitating and upgoing particles are also very desirable, but they cannot alone discriminate between <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> and other anomalous resistivity effects...|$|R

The outer layer cloak of the GL <b>double</b> <b>layered</b> cloak has the invisible function, the inner layer cloak has fully absorption function. The GL <b>double</b> <b>layered</b> metamaterials are weak degenerative and weak dispersive. When the source is located outside of the GL <b>double</b> <b>layered</b> cloak, the excited EM wave field propagation outside of the <b>double</b> <b>layered</b> cloak is as same as in free space and never be disturbed by the cloak; also, the exterior EM wave can not penetrate into the inner layer and concealment. When local sources are located inside of the GL double cloaked concealment with the normal EM materials, the excited EM wave is propagating under Maxwell equation governing, it is complete absorbed by the inner layer cloak of GL double cloak and never propagate to outside of the inner layer of the GL cloak, moreover, the EM wavefield in concealment never be disturbed by the cloak. The GL <b>doubled</b> <b>layered</b> cloak is a robust cloak and has complete and sufficient invisibility functions. Its concealment is the normal electromagnetic environment.

Using a more recent fluid-dynamical approach, with polytropic equations of state indices gamma(j), one finds analytically that no <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> can be formed for gamma(j) >= 3 / 2, due to total rarefaction of the cooler electrons or infinite compression of the ions. For gamma(j) < 3 / 2, rarefactive <b>double</b> <b>layers</b> occur, but, just below 3 / 2, at unrealistically small cool electron densities or large Mach numbers. As gamma(j) decreases towards 1, these constraints become less restrictive and go over smoothly to those known from Boltzmann studies.
