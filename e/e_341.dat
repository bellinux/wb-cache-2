Here, we report a genetic strategy to identify residues that function in autoinhibition of a novel calmodulin-activated Ca(2 +) -pump with an N-terminal regulatory domain (isoform ACA 2 from Arabidopsis). Mutant pumps with constitutive activity were identified by complementation of a yeast (K 616) deficient in two Ca(2 +) -pumps. Fifteen mutations were found that disrupted {{a segment of the}} N-terminal autoinhibitor located between Lys(23) and Arg(54). Three mutations (E 167 K, D 219 N, and <b>E</b> <b>341</b> K) were found associated with the stalk that connects the ATPase catalytic domain (head) and with the transmembrane domain. Enzyme assays indicated that the stalk mutations resulted in calmodulin-independent activity, with V(max), K(mATP), and K(mCa(2 +)) similar to that of a pump in which the N-terminal autoinhibitor had been deleted. A highly conservative substitution at Asp(219) (D 219 E) still produced a deregulated pump, indicating that the autoinhibitory structure in the stalk is highly sensitive to perturbation. In plasma membrane H(+) -ATPases from yeast and plants, similarly positioned mutations resulted in hyperactive pumps. Together, these results suggest that a structural feature of the stalk is of general importance in regulating diverse P-type ATPases...|$|E
40|$|Fabry {{disease is}} a {{metabolic}} and lysosomal storage disorder caused by the functional defect of the α-galactosidase A enzyme; this defect is due to mutations in the GLA gene, that is composed of seven exons and {{is located on the}} long arm of the X-chromosome (Xq 21 – 22). The enzymatic deficit is responsible for the accumulation of glycosphingolipids in lysosomes of different cellular types, mainly in those ones of vascular endothelium. It consequently causes a cellular and microvascular dysfunction. In this paper, we described five novel mutations in the GLA gene, related to absent enzymatic activity and typical manifestations of Fabry disease. We identified three mutations (c. 846 _ 847 delTC, p. <b>E</b> <b>341</b> X and p. C 382 X) that lead to the introduction of a stop codon in positions 297, 341 and 382. Moreover we found a missense mutation (p. R 227 P) in the exon 5 of the GLA gene and a single point mutation (c. 639 + 5 G > T) occurring five base pairs beyond the end of the exon 4. These mutations have never been found in our group of healthy control subjects > 2300. The studied patients presented some clinical manifestations, such as cornea verticillata, hypo-anhidrosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, cerebrovascular disorders and renal failure, that, considering the null enzymatic activity, suggest that the new mutations reported here are related to the classic form of Fabry disease. The identification of novel mutations in patients with symptomatology referable to FD increases the molecular knowledge of the GLA gene and it gives clinicians an important support for the proper diagnosis of the disease...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the alterations of surface microhardness and wear caused by the sodium bicarbonate jet on bovine enamel and the further remineralizing effect of artificial saliva. METHODS: Fifteen enamel samples (4, 0 mm x 4, 0 mm) were used, which constituted the groups: no treatment (MI); treatment with sodium bicarbonate jet (MII and DI); treatment with sodium bicarbonate jet and immersion in saliva for one hour (MIII and DII), 24 hours (MIV and DIII) and 7 days (MV and DIV). Microhardness tests were carried out using a microdurometer in groups M and wear tests by a rugosimeter in groups D. The data were assessed by the one criterion variance analysis and Tukey test. RESULTS: The mean value of microhardness, in KHN, in groups MI, MII, MIII, MIV and MV were 359, 80; 335, 46; 369, 20; 377, 73 and 341, 86, respectively, whereas the mean values in µm, of wear for group DI, DII, DIII and DIV were 0, 564; 0, 519; 0, 441 and 0, 428, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The sodium bicarbonate jet caused a wear and a reduction in microhardness on the enamel surface; saliva promoted the recovery of initial condition surface microhardness and reduced the wear; the repairing effect of saliva on the surface microhardness alterations occurred within one hour of treatment, having no significant statistical difference from the effect obtained in 24 hours; the best saliva repairing effect on the wear occurred with treatment of 24 hours. OBJETIVO: A finalidade do trabalho foi avaliar as alterações da microdureza e o desgaste provocado pelo jato de bicarbonato de sódio em esmalte bovino e o posterior efeito remineralizador da saliva artificial. MÉTODOS: Utilizaram-se 15 espécimes de esmalte (4, 0 mm x 4, 0 mm) que constituíram os grupos: sem tratamento (MI); tratamento com jato de bicarbonato de sódio (MII e DI); tratamento com jato de bicarbonato de sódio e imersão em saliva artificial por uma hora (MIII e DII), 24 horas (MIV e DIII) e sete dias (MV e DIV). Foram realizados testes de microdureza com um microdurômetro nos grupos M e testes de desgaste com um rugosímetro nos grupos D. RESULTADOS: Os dados foram avaliados pela Análise de Variância a um critério e pelo Teste de Tukey. O valor das médias da microdureza, em KHN, nos grupos MI, MII, MIII, MIV e MV foram 359, 80; 335, 46; 369, 20; 377, 73 <b>e</b> <b>341,</b> 86; respectivamente, enquanto que os valores médios, em µm, do desgaste para o grupo DI, DII, DIII e DIV foram 0, 564; 0, 519; 0, 441 e 0, 428, respectivamente. CONCLUSÕES: o jato de bicarbonato de sódio causou desgaste e diminuição da microdureza superficial; a saliva promoveu o retorno da microdureza superficial à condição inicial e reduziu o desgaste; o efeito reparador da saliva sobre as alterações na microdureza superficial já ocorreu com uma hora de tratamento, não havendo diferença estatisticamente significante do efeito obtido com 24 horas; o melhor efeito reparador da saliva sobre o desgaste ocorreu com 24 horas de tratamento...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to assess the effect of different dietary inclusion levels of palm (Elaeisguineensis L.) kernel cake (PKC) for lactating dairy cows on feed intake, nutrient digestibility and milk production. Diets containing 0, 113, 228, 342 g of PKC/kg dry matter were formulated and fed to eight crossbred (Holandês x Zebu) dairy cows with mean weight of 382 kg at 60 - 90 days of lactation. The cows were used in a double 4 x 4 Latin square design. Each experimental period lasted for 15 days, with 11 days adaptation and four days sampling. Increasing the levels of PKC in the diet reduced the intake of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), hemicellulose, non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) and total digestible nutrients (TDN). The NDF intake was higher at the 113 g/kg PKC inclusion level compared to other treatments. There was linear decreasing effect on fat corrected milk with the inclusion of PKC. There was linear reduction in digestibility of dry matter(DM) and total carbohydrate (TC), but no effect was observed on the NDF and ADF digestibility. Linear increase was observed on crude protein (CP), NFC and ether extract (EE) digestibility. The digestibility of these nutrients probably increased because of the longer retention time of the digest in the rumen caused by reduced DM intake. The addition of PKC decreased the nutritive value of the diets, which subsequently reduced linearly milk production. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o efeito da inclusão (0. 0; 113, 4; 227, 8 <b>e</b> <b>341,</b> 7 g/kg de matéria seca) da torta de dendê (TD) em dietas para vacas leiteiras lactantes sobre o consumo, digestibilidade aparente da matéria seca e dos nutrientes e produção de leite. Foram utilizadas oito vacas mestiças Holandês x Zebu, primíparas, com peso médio de 382 kg, entre 60 e 90 dias de lactação, distribuídas em duplos quadrados latinos 4 x 4. Cada período experimental teve duração de 15 dias, sendo 11 dias para adaptação e quatro para coletas. Avaliou- se o consumo, expresso em kg/dia, g/kgpv 0, 75 e g/kg PV, a digestibilidade aparente da matéria seca (MS), proteina bruta (PB), fibra em detergente neutro (FDN), fibra em detergente ácido (FDA), hemicelulose (HEM), carboidratos não fibrosos (CNF), extrato etéreo (EE) e nutrientes digestíveis totais (NDT) e a produção de leite corrigida para gordura (PLCG). A inclusão de níveis crescentes de TD na dieta acarretou redução linear no consumo de MS, PB, HEM, CNF e NDT. O consumo de FDN apresentou efeito quadrático e os maiores valores foram observados com o nível de inclusão de TD de 113, 4 g/kg MS. Houve efeito linear decrescente sobre a PLCG com a inclusão da TD. Houve redução linear da digestibilidade da MS e dos CT, porém não se observou efeito sobre a digestibilidade da FDN e FDA. Observou-se ainda aumento linear da digestibilidade da PB, CNF e EE. O aumento da digestibilidade destes nutrientes provavelmente ocorreu devido ao maior tempo de retenção da digesta no rúmen ocasionado pela redução no consumo de MS. A adição de TD diminui o valor nutritivo das dietas reduzindo linearmente a produção de leite...|$|E

Diante disso, o objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a variabilidade espacial tridimensional das caracterÃsticas fÃsicas e quÃmicas de frutos em pomar de laranjas, a partir da geraÃÃo de mapas tridimensionais com o auxÃlio do software SGeMS. O experimento foi conduzido em pomar de laranjas da variedade Monte Parnaso, localizado no municÃpio de Nova Laranjeiras - PR, com altitude mÃdia de 760 m e coordenadas UTM centrais aproximadas de 7. 191. 655 m S <b>e</b> <b>341.</b> 660 m E, 22 J.

Para o teor de SST, os maiores valores foram encontrados na Ãrea perifÃrica da Ãrvore e no terÃo apical; e para o teor de ATT, a mesma tende a diminuir com o aumento da cota vertical do fruto. A metodologia utilizada mostrou-se adequada para o estudo tridimensional de caracterÃsticas fÃsicas e quÃmicas de frutosThe {{increase in}} production and yield {{as well as the}} correct use of agricultural inputs are essential factors to be taken into consideration when thinking about modern agriculture. Several techniques, previously used, mainly in the mining sector, have been incorporated to the agricultural sector with the precision agriculture management. The orcharding has also been improved by several studies under development in order to make such sector more competitive both nationally and internationally. The physical and chemical characteristics of orange fruits may change depending on the conditions to which they are exposed to, up from their blossoming period until harvest. Such conditions can be both climatic and related to the fruit position on the treetop. Although good fruit appearance is important, physical and chemical characteristics are as well, both for fresh consumption and industrial processing. Thus, this trial aimed at studying the three-dimensional spatial variability of physical and chemical characteristics of orange fruits in orchards, based on the generation of threedimensional maps and the SGeMS software. The trial was carried out in an orchard with Monte Parnaso orange variety, in Nova Laranjeiras city, ParanÃ, whose average altitude is 760 m and UTM central coordinates are around 7191655 m S and 341660 m E, 22 J. So, 715 orange fruits from nine trees were analyzed during 2011, 2012 and 2013. Physical and chemical parameters showed weak correlation according to their position on the tree, but there was a trend of increasing values concerning the following attributes: diameter, fruit weight and juice mass as the vertical position of the fruits increases. For TSS content, the highest values were observed in the peripheral area of the tree and in its apical third part; but, for TTA content, it tended to decrease with the increasing vertical position of fruit. At last, the applied methodology was appropriate for the three-dimensional study concerning physical and chemical characteristics of orange fruit...|$|E

40|$|Cbl {{proteins}} are ubiquitin ligases (E 3 s) {{that play}} a significant role in regulating tyrosine kinase signaling. There are three mammalian family members: Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-c. All have a highly conserved N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain, a catalytic RING finger domain, and a C-terminal proline-rich domain that mediates interactions with Src homology 3 (SH 3) containing proteins. Although both Cbl and Cbl-b have been studied widely, little is known about Cbl-c. Published reports have demonstrated that the N terminus of Cbl and Cbl-b have an inhibitory effect on their respective E 3 activity. However, the mechanism for this inhibition is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate that the N terminus of Cbl-c, like that of Cbl and Cbl-b, inhibits the E 3 activity of Cbl-c. Furthermore, we map the region responsible for the inhibition to the EF-hand and SH 2 domains. Phosphorylation of a critical tyrosine (Tyr- 341) in the linker region of Cbl-c by Src or a phosphomimetic mutation of this tyrosine (Y <b>341</b> <b>E)</b> is sufficient to increase the E 3 activity of Cbl-c. We also demonstrate for the first time that phosphorylation of Tyr- 341 or the Y <b>341</b> <b>E</b> mutation leads to a decrease in affinity for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E 2), UbcH 5 b. The decreased affinity of the Y <b>341</b> <b>E</b> mutant Cbl-c for UbcH 5 b results in a more rapid turnover of bound UbcH 5 b coincident with the increased E 3 activity.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the behavior of the new lettuce cultivars available in the market, in terms of agronomic characteristics and yield, in the climatic and soil conditions of Rio Branco. Two trials were accomplished in the Embrapa Acre experimental farm, in a dark red claysoil, of loamy texture. The first from May to July 1996 (dry season) and the second from December 1996 to February 1997 (rainy season). The cultivars Babá de Verão, Brisa, Carolina AG- 576, Elisa, Lucy Brown, Marisa AG- 216, Piracicaba 65, Regina 71, Tainá, Simpson, Vanessa and Verônica were evaluated. 'Regina 71 ' and 'Elisa' were only included on the dry season trial. The experimental design was a randomized block, with three replications. During the dry season, the cultivars Simpson, Lucy Brown and Regina 71 presented the largest average weights (373; 362 and 341 g, respectively) and commercial yields (49. 8; 48. 3 and 45. 5 t/ha, respectively). In general, the cultivars with smooth leaves with or without head presented larger nematoid (Meloidogyne javanica) attack index, when compared to the curly type ones.

Mutations found in four families caused amino acid substitutions A <b>341</b> <b>E,</b> A <b>341</b> V, Q 256 K, and H 385 P, which drastically decreased expression of the PIGV protein. Hyperphosphatasia resulted from secretion of ALP, a GPI-anchored protein normally expressed on the cell surface, into serum due to PIGV deficiency. In contrast, a previously reported PIGM deficiency, {{in which there is a}} defect in the transfer of the first mannose, does not result in hyperphosphatasia. To provide insights into the mechanism of ALP secretion in HPMR patients, we took advantage of CHO cell mutants that are defective in various steps of GPI biosynthesis. Secretion of ALP requires GPI transamidase, which in normal cells, cleaves the C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide and replaces it with GPI. The GPI-anchored protein was secreted substantially into medium from PIGV-, PIGB-, and PIGF-deficient CHO cells, in which incomplete GPI bearing mannose was accumulated. In contrast, ALP was degraded in PIGL-, DPM 2 -, or PIGX-deficient CHO cells, in which incomplete shorter GPIs that lacked mannose were accumulated. Our results suggest that GPI transamidase recognizes incomplete GPI bearing mannose and cleaves a hydrophobic signal peptide, resulting in secretion of soluble ALP.

We demonstrate that the hopTum-l hematopoietic phenotype is caused by a single amino acid substitution of glycine to glutamic acid at residue 341. We generate a true revertant of the hopTum-l mutation, in which both the molecular lesion and the mutant hematopoietic phenotype revert back to wild type. We also examine the effects of the G <b>341</b> <b>E</b> substitution in transgenic flies. The results indicate that a mutant Jak kinase can cause leukemia-like abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{characterization}} of ancient oral (dental calculus) and gut (coprolite) microbiota has been primarily accomplished through a metataxonomic approach involving targeted amplification {{of one or}} more variable regions in the 16 S rRNA gene. Specifically, the V 3 region (<b>E.</b> coli <b>341</b> - 534) of this gene has been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired amplicon (V 3 U 341 F/ 534 R) and shotgun sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that extensive length polymorphisms in the V 3 region are a consistent and major cause of differential amplification leading to taxonomic bias in ancient microbiome reconstructions based on amplicon sequencing. We conclude that systematic amplification bias confounds attempts to accurately reconstruct microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16 S rRNA V 3 amplicon data generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis indicates that alternative 16 S rRNA hypervariable regions will present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun metagenomics approach in ancient microbiome reconstructions...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{efforts to}} evaluate a recently proposed continuum model for the dense flow of dry granular materials (Jop, Forterre & Pouliquen, 2006, Nature, 441, 167 - 192). The model, based upon a generalisation of Coulomb sliding friction, is known to perform well when modelling certain simple free surface flows. We extend the application of this model {{to a wide range}} of flow configurations, beginning with six simple flows studied in detailed experiments (GDR MiDi, 2004, Eur. Phys. J. <b>E,</b> 14, <b>341</b> - 366). Two-dimensional shearing flows and problems of linear stability are also addressed. These examples are used to underpin a thorough discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the model. In order to calculate the behaviour of granular material in more complicated configurations, it is necessary to undertake a numerical solution. We discuss several computational techniques appropriate to the model, with careful attention paid to the evolution of any shear-free regions that may arise. In addition, we develop a numerical scheme, based upon a marker-and-cell method, that is capable of modelling two-dimensional granular flow with a moving free surface. A detailed discussion of our unsuccessful attempt to construct a scheme based upon Lagrangian finite elements is presented in an appendix. We apply the marker-and-cell code to the key problem of granular slumping (Balmforth & Kerswell, 2005, J. Fluid Mech., 538, 399 - 428), which has hitherto resisted explanation by modelling approaches based on various reduced (shallow water) models. With our numerical scheme, we are able to lift the assumptions required for other models, and make predictions in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data. An additional chapter describes the largely unrelated problem of contact between two objects separated by a viscous fluid. Although classical lubrication theory suggests that two locally smooth objects converging under gravity will make contact only after infinite time, we discuss several physical effects that may promote contact in finite time. Detailed calculations are presented to illustrate how the presence of a sharp asperity can modify the approach to contact. Supported by a Natural Environment Research Council Studentship...|$|R
40|$|A green {{hydrothermal}} strategy {{starting from}} the Ti powders was developed to synthesis {{a new kind of}} well dispersed anatase TiO nanosheets (TNSTs) with dominant (001) facets, successfully avoiding using the HF by choosing the safe substitutes of LiF powder. In contrast to traditional approaches targeting TiO with dominant crystal facets, the strategy presented herein is more convenient, environment friendly and available for industrial production. As a unique structured anode applied in lithium ion battery, the TNSTs could exhibit an extremely high capacity around 215 mAh g at the current density of 100 mA g and preserved capacity over 140 mAh g enduring 200 cycles at 400 mA g. As a further step toward commercialization, a model of lithiating TiO was built {{for the first time and}} analyzed by the electrochemical characterizations, and full batteries employing lithiated TNSTs as carbon-free anode versus spinel LiNiMnO (x = 0, 0. 5) cathode were configured. The full batteries of TNSTs/LiMnO and TNSTs/LiNiMnO have the sustainable advantage of cost-effective and cobalt-free characteristics, and particularly they demonstrated high energy densities of 497 and 580 Wh kg (i. <b>e.,</b> 276 and <b>341</b> Wh kg) with stable capacity retentions of 95 % and 99 % respectively over 100 cycles.

40|$|Chevron {{concentrically}} braced {{frames are}} one of the most cost-effective solutions for seismic resistant steel buildings. Therefore, this system is widely used in Europe and North America. Both European and North American codes adopt capacity design rules aiming at enforcing the dissipative behaviour into the braces and at preventing the damage in the remaining structural members. However, in order to achieve this purpose, European and North American codes recommend some different requirements and detailing rules, which substantially influence the overall performance and energy dissipation capacity. The research presented in this paper is addressed (i) to verify the effectiveness of the design requirements prescribed by Eurocode 8 (EC 8) compared to North American codes (i. <b>e.</b> both AISC <b>341</b> and CSA-S 16), (ii) to identify the criticisms of EC 8 needing revision and upgrading. In order to achieve these objectives, a comprehensive parametric numerical study based on nonlinear dynamic analyses is carried out. 2 D frames extracted from low, medium and high-rise buildings are analysed and the main structural parameters affecting the performance against lateral loads are described and discussed. The critical review of the examined standards and the discussion of numerical results highlight that the design rules given by North American codes are more effective than those recommended by the current version of EC 8. In particular, EC 8 -compliant frames show the poorest energy dissipation capacity with tension bracing members almost in elastic range and severe demand on those in compression. On the contrary, both CSA- and AISC-compliant cases exhibit satisfactory energy dissipation capacity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{increasing}} interest to better understand endosymbiont capabilities in insects both from an ecological {{point of view and}} for pest control. Blochmannia floridanus provides important nutrients for its host, the ant Camponotus, while the bacterium in return is provided with a niche to proliferate. Blochmannia floridanus proteins and metabolites are difficult to study due to its endosymbiontic life style; however, its complete genome sequence became recently available. Results Improved sequence analysis algorithms, databanks and gene and pathway context methods allowed us to reveal new information on various enzyme and pathways from the Blochmannia floridanus genome sequence [EMBL-ID BX 248583]. Furthermore, these predictions are supported and linked to experimental data for instance from structural genomics projects (<b>e.</b> g. Bfl <b>341,</b> Bfl 499) or available biochemical data on proteins from other species which we show here to be related. We were able to assign a confirmed or at least a putative molecular function for 21 from 27 previously conserved hypothetical proteins. For 48 proteins of 66 with a previous putative assignment the function was further clarified. Several of these proteins occur in many proteobacteria and are found to be conserved even in the compact genome of this endosymbiont. To extend and re-test predictions and links to experimentally verified protein functions, functional clusters and interactions were assembled. These included septum initiation and cell division (Bfl 165, Bfl 303, Bfl 248 et al.); translation; transport; the ubiquinone (Bfl 547 et al.), the inositol and nitrogen pathways. Conclusion Taken together, our data allow a better and more complete description of the pathway capabilities and life style of this typical endosymbiont. </p...|$|R

She gave a history of low grade intermittent fever and night sweats, and weight loss of about 3 kg over the previous 4 months, but denied anorexia. She had a long-standing history of intermittent breathlessness, cough, wheeze, runny nose and sneezing related to smells dating back to childhood. She was diagnosed to have mild asthma and allergic rhinitis, and responded to treatment with inhaled salbu-tamol and intranasal steroid sprays. She was, otherwise in excellent health, and was never admitted to hospital. She admitted possible contact with tuberculous patients 1 year earlier, when she was training as a student nurse at a chest hospital. She was a nonsmoker. Her family his-tory was unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a well-built female with normal vital signs. The examination was unremarkable except for some dullness over the left apex. Investigations showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4. 63 × 109 cells·L- 1 (differential: neutrophils 59 %, lym-phocytes 33 %, eosinophils 6 %). Spirometry showed a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) of 2. 68 L (103 % predicted) and forced vital capacity (FVC) of 3. 03 L (110 % predicted).

40|$|We present multi-epoch, R-band imaging {{obtained}} from the Palomar Transient Factory of a small, fan-shaped reflection nebula in NGC 1333 that experiences prominent brightness fluctuations. Photometry of HBC 340 (K 7 <b>e)</b> and HBC <b>341</b> (M 5 <b>e),</b> a visual pair of late-type, young stellar objects lying near {{the apex of the}} nebula, demonstrates that while both are variable, the former has brightened by more than two magnitudes following a deep local minimum in September 2014. Keck high dispersion (R∼ 45, 000 - 66, 000), optical spectroscopy of HBC 340 suggests that the protostar is a spectroscopic binary (HBC 340 Aa + HBC 340 Ab). Both HBC 340 and HBC 341 exhibit strong Hα and forbidden line emission, consistent with accretion and outflow. We conclude that the brightness fluctuations in the reflection nebula represent light echos produced by varying incident radiation emanating from HBC 340. The short-term variability observed in the protostar is attributed to irregular accretion activity, while correlated, dipping behavior on a several hundred day time scale may be due to eclipse-like events caused by orbiting circumstellar material. Archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the region reveals a second, faint (F 814 W∼ 20. 3 mag) companion to HBC 340 that lies 1. 02 " (∼ 235 AU) east of the protostar. If associated, this probable substellar mass object (20 - 50 Jupiter masses), HBC 340 B, is likely unrelated to the observed brightness variations. The sustained brightening of HBC 340 since late 2014 can be explained by an EXor-like outburst, the recovery from a long duration eclipse event caused by obscuring circumstellar dust, or by the gradual removal of extincting material from along the line of sight. Our analysis here favors one of the extinction scenarios. Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal; 11 pages, 9 figures, 3 table...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Exogenous {{ubiquitin}} reduces cortical contusion {{volume and}} tends to reduce brain water content after controlled cortical impact injury Controlled Cortical Impact Injury (CCII) in rats. The mechanisms how exogenous ubiquitin exerts these effects remain unclear. Some studies revealed ubiquitin’s immune modulatory abilities; therefore, we hypothesized that ubiquitin influences the local innate inflammatory response after CCII. Materials and Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to CCII and randomized to either 1. 5 mg/kg ubiquitin or 0. 9 % NaCl intravenously within 5 minutes after CCII. Levels of IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10, TNF-α_, and IL- 1 ra were quantified using rt-PCR. Immune cells were immunohistochemically stained with OX- 42, MPO, HIS 48, ED 1, and GFAP. Apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL. Results: IL- 10 expression after 3 days was significantly lower in the verum group (1. 0651 e 5 ± 0. 60931 e 5 vs. 2. 2661 e 5 ± 1. 2441 e 5 relative messenger RNA expression; p = 0. 02) and TNF-α-levels tended to be higher in the verum group (22. 011 e 5 ± 10. 871 e 5 vs. 9. <b>341</b> <b>e</b> 5 ± 4. 441 e 5 relative messenger RNA; p = 0. 06).

Quantification of apoptotic cells did not differ between the groups.
