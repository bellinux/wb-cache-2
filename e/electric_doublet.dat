40|$|The {{applicable}} {{ranges of}} the principle of relativity were reconsidered. There are magnetic field forces between positive charge and negative charge in an <b>electric</b> <b>doublet</b> which is moving in a laboratory reference frame, whereas, analyzing the <b>electric</b> <b>doublet</b> with the same physical method in a reference frame which is at rest relative to the <b>electric</b> <b>doublet,</b> no magnetic field force exists between the two charges. The results obtained in the two frames are self-contradictory. Maxwellâ€™s equations maintain the form invariant under Lorentz transformation can not fully prove that electromagnetism laws satisfy requirement {{of the principle}} of relativity, because the form invariant are the same as the expression for Doppler effect...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of {{confining}} vacua {{which appear}} as deformed superconformal theory with a non-Abelian gauge symmetry, is studied {{by taking a}} concrete example of the sextet vacua of N = 2, SU(3) gauge theory with n(f) = 4, with equal quark masses. We show that the low-energy "matter" degrees of freedom of this theory consist of four magnetic monopole doublets of the low-energy effective SU(2) gauge group, one dyon doublet, and one <b>electric</b> <b>doublet.</b> We find a mechanism of cancellation of the beta function, which naturally but nontrivially generalizes that of Argyres-Douglas. Study of our SCFT theory as a limit of six colliding N = I vacua, suggests that the confinement in the present theory occurs in an essentially different manner from those vacua with dynamical abelianization, and involves strongly interacting non-Abelian magnetic monopoles.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of a confining vacuum in N = 2 USp(4) gauge theory with nf = 4. The vacuum {{appears to be a}} deformed conformal theory with nonabelian gauge symmetry. The low-energy degrees of freedom consist of four nonabelian magnetic monopole doublets of the effective SU(2) colour group, two dyon doublets and one <b>electric</b> <b>doublet.</b> In this description the flavour quantum number is carried only by the monopoles. We argue that confinement is caused by the condensation of these monopoles, and involves strongly interacting nonabelian degrees of freedom. N = 2 gauge theories have been a consistent source of hints as to the nature of real-world QCD. Different types of confining vacua are realized in these models. For example some models exhibit confinement due to the condensation of monopoles charged under the maximally abelian subgroup, as in the N = 1 vacua surviving th...|$|E
40|$|The antenna has {{two units}} e. g. <b>electric</b> and {{magnetic}} <b>doublet,</b> for realizing operating modes, radiating circular polarizations, and possessing toric diagrams along two axes (Ox, Oy), respectively. One {{of the units}} is placed adjacent to another unit and oriented with 90 degrees phase shift. One of the operating modes is in advance quadrature or delay quadrature with respect to another operating mode. The units have a ring-shaped helix comprising spires (2) formed by folding a copper wire or copper strip...|$|R
40|$|The {{compound}} BaFe 2 Se 3 (Pnma) {{has been}} synthesized {{in the form}} of single crystals with the average composition Ba 0. 992 Fe 1. 998 Se 3. The Moessbauer spectroscopy used for investigation of the valence states of Fe in this compound at temperature ranging from 4. 2 K till room temperature revealed the occurrence of mixed-valence state for iron. The spectrum is characterized by sharply defined <b>electric</b> quadrupole <b>doublet</b> above magnetic ordering at about 250 K. For the magnetically ordered state one sees four iron sites at least and each of them is described by separate axially symmetric electric field gradient tensor with the principal component making some angle with the hyperfine magnetic field. They form two groups occurring in equal abundances. It is likely that each group belongs to separate spin ladder with various tilts of the FeSe 4 tetrahedral units along the ladder. Two impurity phases are found, i. e., superconducting FeSe and some other unidentified iron-bearing phase being magnetically disordered above 80 K. Powder form of BaFe 2 Se 3 is unstable in contact with the air and decomposes slowly to this unidentified phase exhibiting almost the same quadrupole doublet as BaFe 2 Se 3 above magnetic transition temperature...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} of CeFeAsO, {{large enough}} to study the anisotropy of the magnetic properties, were grown by an optimized Sn-flux technique. The high quality of our single crystals is apparent from the highest residual resistivity ratio, RRR = 12, reported among undoped RFeAsO compounds (R=rare earth) as well as sharp anomalies in resistivity, specific heat, C(T), and thermal expansion at the different phase transitions. The magnetic susceptibility chi(T) presents a large easy-plane anisotropy consistent with the lowest crystal <b>electric</b> field <b>doublet</b> having a dominant Gamma_ 6 character. Curie-Weiss like susceptibilities for magnetic field parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic c-axis do not reveal an influence of a staggered field on the Ce site induced by magnetic ordering of the Fe. Furthermore, the standard signatures for antiferromagnetic order of Ce at T_N = 3. 7 K observed in chi(T) and C(T) are incompatible with a Zeeman splitting Delta = 10 K of the CEF ground state doublet at low temperature due to the Fe-magnetic order as previously proposed. Our results can be reconciled with the earlier observation by assuming a comparatively stronger effect of the Ce-Ce exchange leading to a reduction of this Zeeman splitting below 15 K.

40|$|We extend {{some two}} Higgs doublet models, where the Yukawa {{couplings}} for the charged fermion mass generation only involve one Higgs doublet, by two singlet scalars respectively carrying a singly electric charge and a doubly <b>electric</b> charge. The <b>doublet</b> and singlet scalars together can mediate a two-loop diagram {{to generate a}} tiny Majorana mass matrix of the standard model neutrinos. Remarkably, {{the structure of the}} neutrino mass matrix is fully determined by the symmetric Yukawa couplings of the doubly charged scalar to the right-handed leptons. Meanwhile, a one-loop induced neutrinoless double beta decay can arrive at a testable level even if the electron neutrino has an extremely small Majorana mass. We also study other experimental constraints and implications including some rare processes and Higgs phenomenology. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, references are adde...|$|R
40|$|The Smoluchowski {{equation}} for electrophoresis {{predicts that}} the electrophoretic velocity of a particle is proportional to its zeta potential but not its size, shape, or orientation. Furthermore, the equation {{predicts that the}} rotation rate is identically zero. The Smoluchowski equation fails for heterogeneous particles (i. e., those with nonuniform zeta potentials). Recent theories and experiments show that particles with a dipole moment of zeta potential rotate into alignment with an externally applied <b>electric</b> field. For <b>doublets</b> (particles composed of two spheres) the rotation rate depends on (1) whether the spheres are rigidly rocked or freely rotating, and (2) the gap distance between the spheres. The relative configuration of two coagulated spheres {{is determined by the}} colloidal forces of the system. The goal of our research is to use measurements of electrophoretic rotation to determine the gap between two spheres of a colloidal doublet and also {{to determine whether or not}} the doublet is rigid...|$|R
40|$|The highest antiferromagnetic (AFM) {{temperature}} in Ce based compounds {{has been reported}} for CeScGe with T-N = 47 K, but its local or itinerant nature has not been deeply investigated yet. In order to shed more light into this unusually high ordering temperature we have investigated structural, magnetic, transport, and thermal properties of CeTi 1 -xScxGe alloys {{within the range of}} stability of the CeScSi-type structure: 0. 25 <= x <= 1. Along this concentration range, this strongly anisotropic system presents a complex magnetic phase diagram with a continuous modification of its magnetic behavior, from ferromagnetism for 0. 25 <= x <= 0. 50 (with 7 K <= T-C <= 16 K) to AFM for 0. 60 <= x <= 1 (with 19 K <= T-N <= 47 K). The onset of the AFM phase is associated to a metamagnetic transition with a critical field increasing from H-cr = 0 at x approximate to 0. 55 to approximate to 6 T at x = 1, coincident with an increasing contribution of the first excited crystal <b>electric</b> field <b>doublet.</b> At a critical point x(cr) approximate to 0. 65 a second transition appears at T-L <= T-N. In contrast to observations in itinerant systems like CeRh 2 Si 2 or CeRh 3 B 2, no evidences for significant hybridization of the 4 f electrons at large Sc contents were found. Therefore, the exceptionally large T-N of CeScGe can be attributed to an increasing Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between Ce double layers as Sc content grows...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystals}} {{of the new}} compound CeCu 0. 18 Al 0. 24 Si 1. 58 {{have been}} grown by high-temperature solution growth method using a eutectic Al-Si mixture as flux. This compound {{is derived from the}} binary CeSi 2 (tetragonal ThSi 2 -type, Pearson symbol tI 12, space group I 41 /amd) obtained by partial substitution of Si by Cu and Al atoms but showing full occupation of the Si crystal site (8 e). While CeSi 2 is a well-known valence-fluctuating paramagnetic compound, the CeCu 0. 18 Al 0. 24 Si 1. 58 phase orders ferromagnetically at TC = 9. 3 K. At low temperatures the easy-axis of magnetization is along the a-axis, which re-orients itself along the c-axis above 30 K. The presence of hysteresis in the magnetization curve, negative temperature coefficient of resistivity at high temperatures, reduced jump in the heat capacity and a relatively lower entropy released up to the ordering temperature, and enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient (~ 100 mJ/mol K 2) show that CeCu 0. 18 Al 0. 24 Si 1. 58 is a Kondo lattice ferromagnetic, moderate heavy fermion compound. Analysis of the high temperature heat capacity data in the paramagnetic region lets us infer that the crystal <b>electric</b> field split <b>doublet</b> levels are located at 178 and 357 K, respectively, and Kondo temperature (8. 4 K) is of the order of TC in CeCu 0. 18 Al 0. 24 Si 1. 58...|$|R
