25|$|The First World War made {{material}} {{scarce and}} progress in bus technology {{which meant that}} many cities abandoned their tram networks. Sheffield considered trolleybuses, but found no favours in the Council who preferred motor buses. Twenty second-hand double-deck tramcars were purchased from London County Council Tramways in 1917 and 1918, due to the material shortage. This was a rare move but a necessary one to replace single-deck cars. The scarcity of material did not deter the Corporation, though, who extended the network to Handsworth, Mansfield Road and to Sheffield Lane Top. In 1927, the Beauchief and Meadowhead lines were joined by the laying of track along Abbey Lane. Prince of Wales Road line {{was linked to the}} Handsworth and Intake line. The Nether <b>Edge</b> <b>line</b> was closed in 1934, in face of line renewal costs, the Nether Green via Broomhill line suffering the same fate.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was {{a rectangular}} plywood covered structure, slender in plan. [...] A 28hp (21kW) Aero Engines Sprite, an air-cooled [...] flat twin engine, was mounted on steel bearers and well streamlined. The single cockpit {{was over the}} wing, with a baggage compartment aft. [...] The Dove was offered with an enclosed Coupé cockpit cover. [...] The tail unit was built of fabric covered wood. [...] Both horizontal and vertical surfaces were heavily revised for the third aircraft, though on all three, all control surfaces were horn balanced. [...] The early machines had tailplanes which were strut braced {{to the top of}} the fin, with a straight leading edge of modest sweep and carrying generous, curved elevators. [...] The fin was sharply triangular, but the rudder extended the leading <b>edge</b> <b>line,</b> was curved at the rear and ended above the elevators. [...] On the third Dove the bracing was abandoned, the leading edge sweep increased and the elevators decreased in chord and made straight edged. [...] Its vertical surfaces were altered to produce a more conventional shape, the rudder projecting less above the fin but continuing downwards between the elevators to the fuselage bottom.|$|E

Triad Toys released a [...] action figure of Taki from Soulcalibur IV in red and blue versions in 2008. In 2007-2010, Futene Karada and Aya released two resin kits for Taki's appearances in her prime costumes in Soulcalibur III, [...] (crouching) and [...] (dashing), as well as an alternate version of the latter.

40|$|Pavement {{markings}} have definite {{functions in}} a proper traffic control system. They are applied {{for the purposes of}} regulating and guiding the movement of traffic, and promoting safety without diverting the driver’s attention from the roadway. It was observed that pavement markings located {{to the right of the}} car are detected more easily and at distances farther away when compared with the corresponding markings placed to the left of the car. However, compared to other types of longitudinal markings, the effect of <b>edge</b> <b>lines</b> on safety and driver behavior has been much less investigated. The conducted crash statistic analysis found that edge-line treatments on rural two-lane roadways may reduce accident frequency up to 26 percent and the highest safety impacts occur on curved segments of roadways with lane widths of 9 to 10 feet. The next stage was focused on complex investigations of <b>edge</b> <b>lines</b> impacts on driver behavior and reactions, including vehicle navigational and positioning issues, speed selection, and effect on driver visual perception. Stationary traffic observation, test driving, and several laboratory experiments were conducted on the selected rural two-lane highways with different roadway width before and after <b>edge</b> <b>lines</b> placement...|$|R

By comparison, we find the rationality and insufficient points of the simplification of the spiral staircase to the calculation assumption which makes the axle wires as rod pieces.

50|$|Generally, {{the quality}} of the Dukes Highway is of a high standard, with the entire road having wide lane widths and sealed {{shoulders}} with at least five (and usually six) metres clear beyond the <b>edge</b> <b>line.</b> The final 17 km of the highway after Bordertown, was originally built on unstable ground but was re-constructed in 2005. There are a total of 16 rest areas or parking bays along the Dukes Highway, at approximately 15km intervals. Each one provides sealed parking space for at least four B-double trucks, with bins, tables, shelter and lighting.|$|E
5000|$|In France, roadway {{shoulders}} are usually 2.5 m wide, or 3 m wide when the roadway carries more than 2000 vehicles/day. The main difference from other European countries {{is that the}} white line is dashed, typically 39 m long with gaps 13 m long. The design is intended to provide a guide for drivers to maintain a safe distance between vehicles. Road signs can be found along motorways, to indicate the safe distance (1 line = too close, 2 lines = safe distance). At some points (tunnel, bridge, narrow road with no shoulder, tight curve) the <b>edge</b> <b>line</b> becomes solid.|$|E

40|$|Phong-shaded 3 D imagery {{does not}} provide {{geometric}} information of the same richness as human-drawn technical illustrations. A non-photorealistic lighting model is presented that attempts to narrow this gap. The model is based on practice in traditional technical illustration, where the lighting model uses both luminance and changes in hue to indicate surface orientation, reserving extreme lights and darks for <b>edge</b> <b>lines</b> and highlights. The lighting model allows shading to occur only in mid-tones so that <b>edge</b> <b>lines</b> and highlights remain visually prominent.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} assist landing of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV), a vision-based method is proposed, which only {{makes use of}} the two <b>edge</b> <b>lines</b> and the {{threshold}} line on the runway. In the earlier stage, through seeking the geometric constraints among the three lines, the coordinates of the points of intersection of the three lines in the camera frame are solved, and the vectors of the three lines in the camera frame can be obtained using the vanishing point. The attitudes are solved by the Umeyama method, and the position vector of the UAV can be calculated using the coplanarity characteristic. In the later stage, the threshold line is invisible, the yaw, the pitch, the cross position and the altitude can be estimated by two <b>edge</b> <b>lines.</b> Simulation results show the proposed algorithm is accurate and fast...|$|R

The termen is dull ochreous brown. The hindwings are paler brown, with three or four obscure darker lines across the median area: a pale, darkly <b>edged</b> postmedian <b>line,</b> followed by a broad dark grey band with a scalloped external margin.

5000|$|In some {{countries}} major roads have [...] "tone bands" [...] impressed or {{cut into the}} edges of the legal roadway, so that drowsing drivers are awakened by a loud hum as they release the steering and drift {{off the edge of the}} road. Tone bands are also referred to as [...] "rumble strips", owing to the sound they create. An alternative method is the use of [...] "Raised Rib" [...] markings, which consists of a continuous line marking with ribs across the line at regular intervals. They were first specially authorised for use on motorways as an <b>edge</b> <b>line</b> marking to separate the edge of the hard shoulder from the main carriageway. The objective of the marking is to achieve improved visual delineation of the carriageway edge in wet conditions at night. It also provides an audible/vibratory warning to vehicle drivers, should they stray from the carriageway, and run onto the marking.|$|E

50|$|The Latécoère 6 was a sesquiplane, {{its lower}} wing having a span only 75% {{that of the}} upper plane and about 50% of its chord. The wings had {{straight}} and parallel edges but were markedly swept at about 7°. The {{leading edge of the}} narrow lower wing was slightly ahead of the upper. There were ailerons on both wings. It was a single bay biplane, the sesquiplane arrangement requiring the simple parallel inter-plane struts, streamlined and wide, to lean heavily outwards. The duralumin internal structure was complicated but based on double I section spars, nine in the upper wing and six in the lower. The wings were covered with thin steel. The tail unit was of similar construction. The tailplane was triangular and its incidence could be adjusted in flight for trim. It carried balanced elevators which reached well beyond the tailplane and which had a pair of mid-span cut-outs to allow the movement of a pair small fins. These moved along with a central rudder mounted on the short, square topped fin; the rudder's balance left a pronounced notch in the fin/rudder leading <b>edge</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
