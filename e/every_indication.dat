Utility workers also stood on standby before the storm hit, preparing for large-scale power outages.|$|E
5|$|After {{eliminating}} an Austrian army {{during the}} Ulm Campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until {{the arrival of}} the Russians bolstered Allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies, but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness. Desperate to lure the Allies into battle, Napoleon gave <b>every</b> <b>indication</b> in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. Meanwhile, the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened the allied center on the Pratzen Heights, which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically, capturing thousands of prisoners in the process.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} {{returned to}} the England on 4 February 1943, and was placed {{under the command of}} XI Corps, and based in Essex. Between 4–12 March, the division participated in Exercise Spartan; the largest military exercise ever held in the United Kingdom. David French commented that the exercise [...] "was designed to analyse the problems that would arise after a force had landed on a hostile shore and was advancing from a bridgehead." [...] The exercise revealed weaknesses in elements of the senior leadership, in particular the officers in overall command of the armies deployed for the exercise, and highlighted the improvements made in general by the infantry. This was followed, in April and May, by exercise Jantzen. This was an administrative undertaking by the division and the headquarters of I Corps, aimed at improving the support techniques that would be used in the upcoming invasion of Europe. In May, the division was transferred to II Corps, and moved to Kent following-which Major-General Charles Wainwright took command, and was to remained {{until the end of the}} war. The division was earmarked for a role in Operation Overlord and Marcus Cunliffe wrote that Exercise Spartan [...] "seemed to be <b>every</b> <b>indication</b> that" [...] the division was to be a front-line unit. In September, the division, in conjunction with the 1st Polish Armoured Division, was placed under the control of II Canadian Corps for Exercise Link. In the months following the exercise, the division was relegated to 'Lower Establishment' status. This meant that the division was now to be strictly used for home defence in a static role compared to 'Higher Establishment' divisions that were intended for deployment overseas and combat. As part of this change in priorities, the division also became a training formation and one intended to find suitable replacements for fighting formations. By October, the division had also been assigned to anti-invasion duties in Kent. While based there, German cross-Channel guns periodically shelled the area, and in 1944 V-1 flying bombs became a minor issue. In December 1943, the division (reinforced, for the exercise, by the 31st Tank Brigade) played the defending force in Exercise Vulcan; a four-day training exercise aimed at improving the attacking process of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division.|$|E

RESULTS: A policy implying a liberal practice of episiotomy is not better compared to a restrictive policy. The evidence-based medical literature favors avoiding routine episiotomy in low risk deliveries. Data are quite scarce concerning the different specific indications for episiotomy, and finally we can retain only one specific indication which is the short perineum when {{the distance between the}} fourchette and the center of the anus is less than 3 cm. Nevertheless, in order to improve delivery conditions obstetricians can advisably use episiotomy in accordance with their clinical assessment. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence in the literature favoring a liberal policy over a restrictive policy for the use of episiotomy, both in terms of fetal (Grade C) and maternal (Grade A) indications. A number of obstetrical situations considered as at risk do not systematically indicate an episiotomy. There are however circumstances in which a pertinent and prudent clinical assessment will lead the obstetrician to use an episiotomy...|$|R
