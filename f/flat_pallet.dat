40|$|In this study, we {{manufactured}} {{three types}} of the wooden <b>flat</b> <b>pallet</b> with different {{in the number of}} sheets of the top board of the backside. First type (7 – 7 type); the number of sheets of the top board of the backside was seven pieces. Second type (7 – 5 type); the number of that was five pieces. Third type (7 – 3 type); the number of that was three pieces. The number of the surface of three types was all seven pieces. In the manufacturing, the staggered connections using sugi (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) compressed–dowel were applied to the pallet, and the evaluation test in accordance with Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS Z 0602) was performed. The main results are summarized as follows: The pallet weight became small in decreasing the number of sheets of the top board and the difference of the weight was about 6 kgf (20 %). The bend rate in the bending test for each type pallet was smaller than 2. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. The residual bend rate in the bending test for each type pallet was also smaller than 0. 5 % of the standard value of JIS. Therefore, it was confirmed that the condition as the pallet of both the bend rate and the residual bend rate was cleared. In each type pallet, the condition as the pallet in the change rate of the diagonal length in the fall down test was cleared because the change rate of the each value was smaller than 3 % of the standard value of JIS. The remarkable difference of the withdrawal strength of each type pallet in the pull–out test for the staggered connections using sugi compressed dowel was not recognized. Moreover, it became clear that approximately 56 minutes in manufacturing process of one pallet can be shortened and the manufacturing cost can be decreased because four top boards of the backside of the pallet were decreased...|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) Runaway escapements {{of various}} types are {{utilised}} as timing regulators or inertial governors in clockwork mechanisms. This work developed a computer simulation of a spring driven runaway escapement having a <b>flat</b> sided <b>pallet.</b> The mathematical analysis took into account the three motion regimes of the escapement, that is, coupled motion, free motion and impact, and allows for equal and unequal arm pallets and pallets with arbitrarily located centres of mass. Rotor disc friction was also taken into account. Three escapement types were designed using geometric design principles developed. Two of these escapements were then manufactured and tested for arming time on a specially built test base. Simulation runs using the dimensions of these escapements were in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The simulation model {{was found to be}} well suited for conducting parametric studies of the spring driven escapement...|$|R
50|$|For the Detour, {{the teams}} chose between שקשק אותו (Sheqsheq Aotov; Slosh It) and פוצץ אותו (Potzetz Aotov; Pop It). In Slosh It, the teams tasted a fresh-fruit {{smoothie}} {{and had to}} identify the fruits from which it was made by taste. They then had to collect the fruits (scattered along the beach) while hopping in a sack. In Pop It, the teams participated in a traditional activity meant to scare off evil spirits. One team member put on a blindfold and entered a pool filled with balloons. Their partner chose a color of balloon the blindfolded member had to pop with their mouths or buttocks. In this leg's Roadblock, the participating contestant had to wear a white T-shirt and lie on the ground while an elephant put his leg on their body and hit them with its trunk. The team member then had to put a <b>flat</b> wooden <b>pallet</b> under the T-shirt and let the elephant paint on the T-shirt before the elephant gave them the next clue. In the Double-Battle at Ban Amphur, teams had to attach coconut shells {{to their feet and}} race around a course collecting coconuts; if they dropped any coconuts, they had to start again.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{originally}} {{envisioned a}} 100-vehicle mixed fleet, but rampant inflation in the 1970s led to budget cutbacks {{that were made}} good by reducing the fleet to 60. The basic passenger vehicle emerged as a four-person design {{that looked like a}} minivan with no [...] "hood" [...] area for the engine. Since the emergency braking was extremely powerful, passengers were seated facing to the rear, and Japanese law already precluded standing in automated vehicles. In some versions, two of the four seats could be folded to allow larger loads, like prams or bicycles. CVS also tested light cargo vehicles, carrying between 300 and 400 kg. Three types of cargo bodies were tried; a <b>flatbed</b> version for <b>palleted</b> cargo that was loaded using two conveyor belts on a trackside [...] "station", another was similar to a pickup truck with a box end, and the last was an enclosed postal van.|$|R
