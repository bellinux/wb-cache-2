40|$|Objectives: This paper {{suggests}} the experimental guidelines {{to evaluate the}} electro-mechanical safety of <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> equipment. The electro-mechanical safety was determined by using the International Electrotechnical Commission guidelines, which are widely used as important factors for assessing the electro-mechanical safety of <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> equipment. However, the local guidelines on wearable healthcare sensors are currently not well-established. Therefore, safety guidelines suited for the actual circumstances in Korea are required, and this paper attempts to try a new experimental safety test procedure of the wearable healthcare sensor. Methods: This <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> device measures the electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rates by attaching to the chest. Examination lists were selected by analyzing the common standards ofelectro-mechanical safety (IEC 60601 - 1) and environment tests (IEC 60068 - 1, IEC 60068 - 2) of home-healthcare equipment. Results: The essential electrical safety, which was required for the RS 300 G 3 as a medical device, was evaluated, {{and most of the}} examination lists were selected by considering the circumstances of the users. The device passed all the selected examinable lists that are applicable to the Korean environment. Conclusions: This study has limitations to estimate and to conduct electro-mechanical safety experiments because our study focused on the <b>belt</b> <b>type</b> of heart-rates equipment. We are not taking into account the overall electro-mechanical home-healthcare measurements. According to industrial and technological development, there are infinite possibilities for the advancement of home-healthcare equipment, so more examination lists for safety are being added in addition to what w...|$|R
