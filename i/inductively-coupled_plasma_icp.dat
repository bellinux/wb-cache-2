40|$|Due to {{its small}} size, low weight, and low power consumption, the Rb atomic {{frequency}} standard (RAFS) is routinely {{the first choice}} for atomic timekeeping in space. Consequently, though the device has very good frequency stability (rivaling passive hydrogen masers), there is interest in uncovering the fundamental processes limiting its long-term performance, {{with the goal of}} improving the device for future space systems and missions. The ac Stark shift (i. e., light shift) {{is one of the more}} likely processes limiting the RAFS' long-term timekeeping ability, yet its manifestation in the RAFS remains poorly understood. In part, this comes from the fact that light-shift induced frequency fluctuations must be quantified in terms of the RAFS' light-shift coefficient and the output variations in the RAFS' rf-discharge lamp, which is a nonlinear <b>inductively-couple</b> <b>plasma</b> (<b>ICP).</b> Here, we analyze the light-shift effect for a family of 10 on-orbit Block-IIR GPS RAFS, examining decade-long records of their on-orbit frequency and rf-discharge lamp fluctuations. We find that the ICP's light intensity variations can take several forms: deterministic aging, jumps, ramps, and non-stationary noise, each of which affects the RAFS' frequency via the light shift. Correlating these light intensity changes with RAFS frequency changes, we estimate the light-shift coefficient, jLS, for the family of RAFS: kLS=-(1. 9 +- 0. 3) x 10 ^- 12 /%. The 16 % family-wide variation in kLS indicates that while each RAFS may have its own individual kLS, the variance of kLS among similarly designed RAFS can be relatively small. Combining kLS with our estimate of the ICP light intensity's non-stationary noise, we find evidence that random-walk frequency noise in high-quality space-borne RAFS is strongly influenced by the RAFS' rf-discharge lamp via the light shift effect...|$|R

For this reason it is interesting to have fast, cheap, respectful with the environment, with an appropriate accuracy and precision analytical methodologies. Nowadays, analytical methodologies used for the analysis of these types of samples are based on a wet microwave digestion process and its subsequent analysis by <b>Inductively-coupled</b> <b>Plasma</b> Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) or <b>Inductively-coupled</b> <b>plasma</b> mass spectrometry (<b>ICP</b> -MS). Despite the fact that these methods have an appropriate sensitivity, their sample treatment involves an important consumption of reagents and time. In view of this problem, in this research project, we have evaluated the possibilities of Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF) for the determination of metals and metalloids in different types of cosmetics (lipsticks, eye shadow and creams). In order to obtain the best conditions of work to carry out the analysis of the target samples by TXRF, different experimental parameters regarding sample preparation and measurement conditions were evaluated. Once established the optimal conditions, analytical detection limits, accuracy and precision of the results obtained in the determination of analytes were studied, in order to assess the potential of the methods. Finally, the developed methodologies have been applied to the analysis of cosmetic samples and the results have been compared with those obtained by ICP-OES and ICP-MS.

In general, the detection limits {{and the quality of the}} results are adequate.

40|$|The {{interest}} in plasma-assisted ALD has increased significantly in recent years, which is mainly catalyzed by the additional freedom in material properties and process parameters compared to thermal ALD [1]. A plasma contains a large variety of species, such as ions, photons and radicals, which can {{all have a}} contribution to the growth process and resulting film properties [2]. The presence and importance of ions during the ALD process, however, has not extensively been addressed yet. In this contribution we will therefore consider the role of the ions during ALD.

The extensive alteration of the parent rocks resulted from the circulation of hydrothermal fluids through faults and fractures.

Kaolinite, dickite, halloysite, illite, smectite and mixed-layer illite-smectite and jarosite were detected in the altered volcanic rocks forming locally various alteration zones. Smectite-rich zones and illite-rich zones are relatively infrequent. In the halloysite-rich zones, the kaolinization of feldspars is accomplished in four stages. The kaolinizaton of feldspars in the kaolinite-dickite-rich zones follows five discrete stages. In the less altered rocks, thin layers of kaolinite are formed on the surface of feldspars. With increasing kaolinization, kaolinite is developed on the surface of feldspars forming extended parallel booklets of newly formed kaolinite. In the third stage, feldspar crystals are partially altered to kaolinite booklets.
