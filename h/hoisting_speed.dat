The service cage {{would not be able to}} fit into the hoisting compartments in the production shaft due to different shaft sizes, and different compartment configurations. Due to this fact a smaller cage with a slower <b>hoisting</b> <b>speed</b> was used in the skip compartments. As a result evacution of the trapped miners took longer than had the miners been able to use the service shaft as an egress. Eventually all the miners were rescued unharmed from the mine.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} into the dynamics of skips in deep mine shafts {{have led to the}} identification of slamming as a phenomenon that results in exceptionally high forces in the shaft steelwork and conveyance. Slamming may occur when the rollers on the skip, that normally act on the guide, fail.

This study extends previous work by investigating the effect of secondary stiffening, due to axial tension effects as the guide deforms, on the slamming response of the skip. A mathematical model of a single slamming event is formulated and a numerical solution procedure presented. A number of computer simulations, including parametric studies, are presented. An important conclusion is that previous slamming models were shown to predict a reduced response when low axial compressive forces are present in the guides while predicting an increased response for high (near the buckling load) axial compressive forces. The inclusion of secondary stiffening; due to axial tension effects, thus represents a significant refinement of the slamming model...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{a problem of}} dynamic impact of hoisting mechanisms, {{which are based on}} the multistage hydro-cylinders, on the hoisted object. Hydro-cylinders have high specific characteristics, but there are also some drawbacks. One of them is an impact at the beginning {{and at the end of}} hoist and in switching the stages. And in case of switching the stages under certain conditions the impact in nature can be a high impact impulse. The paper explores the impacts at the beginning of hoist and when switching the stages. Numerical modeling is assumed to be a method of study. To build a mathematical model the following factors have been considered: geometrical cylinder parameters, hydraulic liquid compressibility, and friction between cylinder elements. Elasticity of ground, elasticity of rod, and elasticity of cylinder walls have been ignored. The modeling results allowed us to reveal a hydraulic nature of the stage-switching impact, introduce a formula to estimate the impact impulse value, show the friction effect on the impact impulse value and give a proposal to use a counter-pressure chamber to eliminate the stage-switching impact. An expression for the optimal counter-pressure is presented. The results obtained can find application in designing the new and upgrading the existing hoisting multistage hydro-cylinder mechanisms to increase a <b>hoisting</b> <b>speed</b> and simultaneously eliminate the impact on hoisted object.

40|$|During {{the early}} 1970 s the {{offshore}} {{market in the}} North Sea was growing rapidly. Due to discoveries of natural reserves {{and development of the}} oil price, {{the oil and gas industry}} developed and deployed many bottom founded offshore structures in the North Sea. Apart from steel jacket structures, many concrete gravity based structures (CGBSs) were constructed. In the coming decades many of the fields with these CGBSs approach the end of their lifetime and must be decommissioned. However, currently no solid solution for the removal of these concrete substructures is available. The introduction of Allseas’ Pioneering Spirit and her capabilities could provide new possibilities for the decommissioning of CGBSs. The Pioneering Spirit is designed for the decommissioning of platforms and its substructure using a unique “single lift” technique. A complete removal of the concrete substructure using this single lift technique is, due to its constructive condition, a perilous operation. However, the decommissioning regulations allow a partial removal of the concrete legs above a water depth of 55 meters. At this water depth a cut is made in the legs and after cutting the Pioneering Spirit can perform a lift of the leg using the Jacket Lift System (JLS). During this removal operation various problems may arise. In this study the main technical difficulties of the partial removal operation are identified. A focus is laid on the difficulties during the lifting phase. The <b>hoisting</b> <b>speed</b> of the JLS is relatively slow compared to the ship motions. This can result in a rebound of the leg during the initial lifting phase. Damage to the leg and a probable damage to the part of the GBS where the oil storage was located may then occur. The objective in this study is to design a solution for the initial lifting phase and analyze the feasibility of this concept. An adequate fast lifting solution after cut-off could overcome the problems associated with the rebound of the concrete legs. The designed solution for fast lifting is based on the concept of a passive heave compensator (PHC). To gain insight into the feasibility of this concept a model has been made in MATLAB/Simulink. Input data for the simulation model are mechanical dimension parameters and physical pressure parameters. By altering the parameters an estimation of the motions of the leg and hence the feasibility of the concept is determined.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this report is the upending of a {{floating}} monopile for an offshore wind turbine foundation. This is an assignment of Van Oord Dredging and Marine Contractors BV. An analytical model has been developed to simulate the upending of a monopile in MapleTM, based on the general theoretical principles {{and the experience of}} Van Oord. An experiment was then done to validate the analytical model. The MapleTM script can be used to calculate the forces of the crane for future projects. The monopile, sealed with two end-caps, is towed by a tugboat from the storage site to the installation site and is then upended by the jack-up vessel of Van Oord, the Aeolus. The end-caps guarantee buoyancy during transport and upending. After upending the end-caps are removed, either internally or externally. A conceptual design has been developed for both removal methods. With upending the vertical position of the monopile can be reached with a nett weight of the pile greater than the safe working load of the crane using the buoyant force. The minimum draught needed for the buoyant force to remain within the safe working load of the crane, determines the minimum hydrostatic pressure needed for the external removal of the bottom-cap. The top-cap can only be removed once the pile has been placed on the seabed, since the buoyant force is the auxiliary of the crane. As shown in figure 1, the upending of the monopile is performed, by vertically displacing the connection point between the pile and the crane. Because the crane hook is attached to the pile with a hinge, the monopile can rotate freely around this point. For the analytical model in MapleTM it is assumed that the upending process is quasi-static because the influence of the inertia is negligible. The experiment has confirmed that the inertia may indeed be neglected by showing the similarity between two scaled upending tests at different continuous hoisting velocities and the corresponding quasi-static simulation. Therefore the scaled upending correlates to the quasi-static model. It is found that, only when the lifting starts and stops, and respectively the acceleration and deceleration are relatively large, the inertia influences the upending process. Further research to refine the upending process, as well as the design of the end-caps is recommended. The <b>hoisting</b> <b>speed</b> of the crane can be optimized if the expectations of the experiment and the analytical model are confirmed in practice. The design depends on the airflow when releasing the end-cap and the internal pressure when lowering the pile towards the seabed. The internal pressure can be controlled using a pressure valve. These recommendations will lead to the optimized upending process of monopiles for offshore wind turbine foundations that are transported by towage using end-caps.

40|$|Marine lifting {{operations}} play a {{key role}} in the installation of turbines and bottom-fixed foundations. Offshroe installations of the bottom-fixed foundations, tripod foundation in this study, are costly and risky due to the challenging environmental conditons and the bulkiness of the object. It becomes more and more challenging due to the tendency to intall larger turbines in the sites further away from shoreline. To minimize the risks and better prepare the operations, careful study and analysis are essential. This thesis addresses numerical studies of the installation of tripod foundations using a heavy lift vessel (HLV). Both frequency and time-domain methods are applied in the study. Investigation is first carried out in the frequency domain using the response aptitude operators (RAOs) of the HLV. The wave induced rigid body motions of the vessel are calculated, represented by response spectrum and spectral moment. Thus, the vertical motion of the crane tip can be predicted, which is used as a criterion to find the limiting weather. As the frequency domain method is based on the simplification of linear response, detailed numerical modelling and simulation of the installation system have been carried out in time domain to analyse the coupled dynamic system. The predicted limiting weather using frequency domain method is firstly verified in time domain by running stationary simulations. It is found that the predicted limiting sea states are inaccurate. The calculated limiting (significant wave height) is underestimated with (spectral peak period of the wave) approaching the natural periods of the installation vessel. During the lifting operations, some potential critical events may be encountered, such as slack wire or re-hit, collision with the lifting vessel due to excessive motions of the tripod. To identify the potential risks, nonstationary simulations are conducted with emphasis on two lifting scenarios, the lift-off and the lowering phases. Moreover, comparative studies in response using two types of installation vessel, the HLV and the Jack-up, are investigated for the lowering process. Furthermore, sensitivity study on various <b>hoisting</b> <b>speeds</b> is also performed for the case onboard lift-off. It is found that the wire tension and response of the tripod using the jack-up are relatively smaller, during the lowering process in the selected sea states, than the case utilizing floating vessel. Especially for the lowering in air, huge difference exists between the two types of installation vessels and barely any tripod motion is induced for the jack-up case thanks to the great bottom-fixed stability. Compared to the onboard lift-off, it turns out that there would be much more challenges for the lift-off from barge. Under the considered wave condition, the onboard lift-off operation can be smoothly implemented while the operation from the barge experiences snap load and re-hit...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the mathematical analysis of the speed control of the Hoist Motor installed in the Transtainer, Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Transtainer is a crane used for the handling of containers and the Hoist Motor installed in the transtainer is used for the lifting and lowering of the containers from the container vessel to the container yard or vice versa. This analysis has been done for the hoist operation of the transtainer. The <b>hoisting</b> <b>speed</b> is started from the zero speed and reached to a steady speed after the acceleration is finished and finally, it is reached to the zero speed again. This complete cycle is known as the hoist operation. A separately excited DC motor is used for the Hoist Motor to lift a container load. The operator of the transtainer uses the joystick controller having five notch positions to control the speed of the hoist motor and when the operator uses the joystick controller from zero to fourth notch, the speed varies from zero up to the base speed and when the joystick controller is put from fourth notch position to fifth notch position, the speed of the motor is varied from the base speed to the final steady state speed which is higher than the base speed. This final speed depends on the container load which is lifted by thehoist motor. The Hoist Motor speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the hoist motor is controlled by changing the DC generator out put voltage which is directly supplied to the hoist motorThe Hoist Motor speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the hoist motor is controlled by changing the DC generator out put voltage which is directly supplied to the hoist motor. The out put voltage of the DC generator is controlled by changing the generator field current which is controlled by the firing signals of the thyristors. Firing signals of the thyristios are controlled by the speed controller mainly consisting of Automatic Speed Regulator (ASR) and Automatic Current Regulator (ACR). The speed reference signal produced by the joystick controller in the crane is given to the speed controller via a soft starter and this speed reference input to the speed controller is a ramp signal. In addition to the speed reference input, the armature current feedback and the motor speed feed back are given to the speed controller to control the motor speedIn this research, two mathematical models were made to analyse the motor armature voltage control and the motor field control and the both transient and steady state analysis of the hoist motor speed have been done in addition to the stability analysis...|$|E

For the purpose of controller design, the model is reduced to a constrained double pendulum with variable length hoisting cable and a kinematic angular constraint. The generated commands were based on both a linear and a nonlinear frequency approximations of the payload oscillation period.
