40|$|BackgroundThe present {{randomized}} double-blind multicenter {{study was}} designed to assess the efficacy of a progressive compressive stocking (new concept with maximal pressure at calf), compared to a <b>degressive</b> compressive stocking graded 30 mm Hg, evaluating the improvement of lower leg symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in ambulatory patients with moderate to severe chronic venous disease. MethodsBoth gender outpatients presenting symptomatic moderate to severe CVI were eligible for a treatment by compressive stockings. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either <b>degressive</b> compressive stockings (30 mm Hg at ankle, 21 mm Hg at upper calf) or progressive compressive stockings (10 mm Hg at ankle, 23 mm Hg at upper calf). The primary outcome, evaluated after 3 months, was a composite success outcome, including improvement of pain or heavy legs without onset of either ulcer, deep or superficial vein thrombosis of the lower limbs, or pulmonary embolism. The ease of application of the compressive stockings reported by patients was one of secondary outcome. ResultsOverall, 401 patients (199 in the progressive compressive stocking group and 202 in the <b>degressive</b> compressive stocking group) were randomized by 44 angiologists in France. Among them, 66 % were classified in the C 3 CEAP category. The rate of success was significantly higher in the progressive compressive stocking group compared to the <b>degressive</b> compressive stocking group (70. 0 % vs 59. 6 %; relative risk, 1. 18; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 - 1. 37; P =. 03). This was mainly due to more frequent symptom improvement in the progressive compressive stocking group. The compressive stockings were considered easy to apply by 81. 3 % of patients in the progressive compressive stocking group vs 49. 7 % of patients in the <b>degressive</b> compressive stocking group (P <. 0001). The rate of related serious adverse events was low and similar in both groups. ConclusionsThis trial has demonstrated that progressive compressive stockings are more effective than usual <b>degressive</b> compressive stockings in the improvement of pain and lower leg symptoms in patients with CVI. Moreover, progressive compressive stockings were easier to apply, raising no safety concern at 3 months...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiopathic subglottic {{stenosis}} {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} acute respiratory distress, {{that is difficult to}} treat (corticosteroids, tracheotomy). CASE REPORT: A nine-year-old boy presented with acute respiratory distress due to tracheal stenosis. The symptoms recurred after the endotracheal inflammatory membranes had been removed with forceps, despite 6 -months of <b>degressive</b> corticotherapy. Absence of other causes of tracheal stenosis and biopsies led to diagnosis of idiopathic subglottic stenosis. The patient was treated by CO 2 laser followed by <b>degressive</b> corticotherapy. The respiratory distress recurred within 3 months of discontinuing corticosteroids, requiring two further CO 2 laser treatments. The patient became corticodependent.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the basic}} {{socio-economic}} problems {{is the problem of}} distribution of benefits and dues. The historically shaped principles of justice direct the {{solution to the problem of}} the Aristotelian rule of proportionality. But applying this rule not always gives the expected, satisfactory solutions. This occurs, for instance, regarding the allocation of seats among the member states in the European Parliament. For this reason, the principle of <b>degressive</b> proportionality was legitimized. Although the definition appears in the context of the European Parliament, the application of the rule distribution may be much wider due to certain universal priorities it embodies. The principle of <b>degressive</b> proportionality, however, has a significant drawback, namely, it does not clearly provide a exact division. This lack of clarity results in the fact that within the rule there may appear many different proposals. The article is an attempt to evaluate some of the proposals by the criterion of drawing nearer the most, under certain assumptions, degressively proportional allocation to the proportional one and proposing rules for determining the boundary conditions for such allocation...|$|E

40|$|Putamen atrophy and its {{long-term}} progress during disease course were recently shown {{in patients with}} multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we investigated retrospectively the time point of atrophy onset in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). 68 patients with RRMS and 26 healthy controls (HC) were admitted to 3 T MRI in a cross-sectional study. We quantitatively analyzed the putamen volume of individual patients in relation to disease duration by correcting for age and intracranial volume (ICV). Patient’s relative putamen volume (RPV), expressed in percent of ICV, was significantly reduced compared to HC. Based on the correlation between RPV and age, we computed the age-corrected RPV deviation (ΔRPV) from HC. Patients showed significantly negative ΔRPV. Interestingly, the age-corrected ΔRPV depended logarithmically on disease duration: Directly after first symptom manifestation, patients already showed a reduced RPV followed by a further <b>degressive</b> volumetric decline. This means that atrophy progression was stronger in the first than in later years of disease. Putamen atrophy starts directly after initial symptom manifestation or even years before, and progresses in a <b>degressive</b> manner.

40|$|AbstractThe {{distribution}} {{of seats in}} the European Parliament {{in accordance with the}} provisions of the Lisbon Treaty is of a degressively proportional nature. 751 seats are distributed among the 27 Member States {{with the use of a}} principle which is in some way a response to the need of constructing a division that ensures adequate representation of the smallest members of the community. There are many feasible solutions however - unfortunately, no unambiguous manner of such allocation has yet been put forward. Therefore, the current seat distribution has been chosen through political negotiations. It turns out that a number of seats are not subject to such negotiations. When performing the distribution and preserving boundary conditions, a certain number of seats gets allocated to individual countries independently of negotiations, but only through the application of the principle of <b>degressive</b> proportionality. This paper explores the problem of determining the scale of actual political negotiations. It presents the minimum and maximum number of mandates which can be granted to specific Member States. This paper determines certain situations in which the boundary conditions, supporting the principle of <b>degressive</b> proportionality are contradictory...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{many women}} with {{recurrent}} vulvovaginal candidiasis initially benefit from prophylactic intermittent treatment with antimycotics, {{most of them}} experience relapse after cessation of therapy, and often they return to the pretreatment recurrence rate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an individualized, <b>degressive,</b> prophylactic regimen in 136 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. STUDY DESIGN: After an induction dose of 600 mg fluconazole during the first week, 117 women started maintenance therapy: 200 mg fluconazole weekly for 2 months, followed by 200 mg biweekly for 4 months, and 200 mg monthly for 6 months, according to their individual response to therapy. All women were tested for recurrences monthly with wet mount microscopy and vaginal culture during the first 6 months and bimonthly during the next 6 months. Patients were allowed to move on to the next level of maintenance therapy only if they were symptom free and microscopy and culture negative. RESULTS: Of the women who were cured successfully after the induction phase, 101 women (90 %) were disease-free after 6 months of maintenance therapy with this <b>degressive</b> regimen, and 80 women (77 %) were disease-free after 1 year. The weekly incidence of the first clinical relapse was 0. 5 % during any period of the maintenance phase, and the rate of all new relapses, which included evidence of mycologic or microscopic colonization, was 1 % per week. Women who experienced several relapses (poor responders) had experienced more relapses before entering the study compared with the optimal responders (odds ratio, 4. 9; 95 % CI, 1. 8 - 13. 7; P =. 002), experienced the disease for a longer period of time (6. 5 vs 3. 7 years; P =. 06), and harbored significantly more Candida non-albicans during maintenance therapy (P =. 001). No serious side-effects were noted.
