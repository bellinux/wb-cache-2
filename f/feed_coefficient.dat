40|$|Research PaperApplied {{research}} is often {{motivated by the}} economic benefits it will give rise to. These benefits are due to either improved production techniques or new products. The realisation of these objectives depends much on the assessment of different research alternatives and allocation of resources between them. Also within aquaculture research {{one of the main}} goal is to start production of new species. Successful research will effect the profitability of the production by changing such factors as the <b>feed</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the mortality, the roe proportion, the fish price uncertainly, etc. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a general and theoretical approach that could be used in priority setting of different research project for example in aquaculture. A model of the decision of a potential fish farmer considering to start culturing a new species is build in order to determine the sensitivity of the profit to variations in both variables and the uncertainty concerned. Influence diagrams are used as a modeling method because uncertainty and its formulation are crucial, especially before a species is in production. The structure of the model is general and it can easily be used for almost any species, the payoffs of different types of research are the result of the costs and the probability of success of the research projects are evaluated independently. The information on the payoffs, costs and feasibility are then used to compare different research elements and to draw conclusions of the appropriate research policy for different species. The use of the model is illustrated with a case study of whitefish coregonus spp. On the basis of the whitefish data used, the result is that improvement in the <b>feed</b> <b>coefficient</b> would benefit the fish farmer twice as much as the equal percentage improvement in mortality or growth...|$|E
40|$|Fish diets were {{analyzed}} {{to evaluate the}} dynamic trophs of the fish community in the Churince wetland system of the Cuatro Ciénegas, where the fauna consists of nine species: endemic, native and introduced. In nine sampling events (between February 2011 and May 2014) 556 specimens of all nine species were collected.

The <b>feed</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Q) of the diets and the accumulated trophic diversity (Hk), {{as well as the}} amplitude of the trophic niche were evaluated. Feeding strategies in the fish community were found to be eurifagic. The main foods in general were insects, crustaceans, gastropods, plants and teleosts. According to the average linkage method, four functional trophic groups were defined, with no higher consumption species; nevertheless all were regulators, mainly invertebrates. Therefore, the chain reaction in food control was higher from top to bottom, meaning a downwards dietary control...|$|E

In two variants (four exprerimental fish-ponds of 1 ha each) 40 days old carp fry of average individual masa of 0. 0009 kg were bred in two setting densities: 30, 000 ind. ha - 1 (variant I) and 60, 000 ind. ha- 1 (variant II) in policulture with one month old fry of silver carp (5, 000 ind. ha- 1) and one month old fry of grass carp (10, 000 ind. ha- 1). Throughout the breeding season the research included observations of ecological factors (water chemism, zooplankton quantity, macrozoobenthos quantity) and of ichthyoproduction (yield growth, survival rate of fish, average individual mass of fish, Klark’s condition coefficient, Fulton’s condition <b>coefficient</b> and <b>feeding</b> <b>coefficient).</b> The research results show that all fish-ponds had similar water chemism. Average zooplankton quantity was in variant I 581 ind. l- 1, and in variant II 501 ind. l- 1 while the average quantity of macrozoobenthos was 9. 49 g m- 2 in variant I, and 5. 7 g m- 2 in variant II. In the carp setting density of 30, 000 ind. ha- 1 the average survival rate of carp fry was 72. 54 %, and the average growth of carp was 919. 1 kg ha– 1 with an average individual mass of 0. 044 kg. Klark’s condition coefficient was 3. 18 ± 0. 02, Fulton’s condidion coefficient was 4. 04 ± 0. 02 and <b>feeding</b> <b>coefficient</b> was 1. 045. With the carp fry setting density of 60, 000 ind. ha- 1 the survival rate of carp was 66. 75 %, total growth was 1150. 6 kg ha- 1 with an average individual mass of 0. 0295 kg.

The included genetic groups were crosses of native chickens and an exotic breed (group A), native chickens which were selected for two generations {{on the basis of}} 8 th week body weight (group B) and a control group of native chickens (group C). All the chicks were reared up to four weeks of age on the ground in separated pens according to their sire groups. In order to calculate <b>feed</b> conversion <b>coefficient,</b> 498 chicks were placed in individual cages during four to ten weeks of age. The results showed that the cross group (A) compared to the other two groups had a higher body weight at 2, 3, 6, 8 and 10 weeks of age.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the diet of seven small-sized fish species (Characidae) and assessed {{their use of}} food resources. The species were collected in 2001 from nine ponds with aquatic macrophytes in the Paraná river floodplain, Brazil. Astyanax altiparanae, Astyanax fasciatus, Hemigrammus marginatus and Moenkhausia intermédia consumed aquatic and terrestrial insects. Bryconomericus stramineus and Moenkhausia sanctaefilomenae co-dominantly ate insects and microcrustaceans, whereas Hyphessobrycon eques had microcrustaceans as their most important food resource. Overlapping <b>feeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> varied from intermediate (0. 4 - 0. 6) to low (< 0. 4) {{for the majority of}} the combination pairs. A high mean intestinal length was verified for A. altiparanae and A. fasciatus, while a smaller mean was found for H. eques. When comparing all these results, it is possible to conclude that the species were partially segregated by the trophic niche dimension. Thus, the co-existence and higher abundance of these small fish in the shoreline of the ponds is explained by high feeding adaptability, absence of specializations in the feeding tract (except intestinal length) and the wide food supply provided by aquatic macrophytes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coal {{particles}} are supplied to {{drop tube furnace}} (DTF) with a designed shaftless screw micro feeder. The condition of individual particles in furnace, which demands small particles size (10 2 µm) and low flow rate for micro feeder，is desired to reaction mechanisms research. When particle size is less than 1 mm, the interparticle forces such as van der Waals interactions have enormous effect on flow behavior of particles, so {{it is difficult to}} provide continuous and steady particles flow at low flow rate. In this paper, the micro feeder uses shaftless spring as its feeding element. To simulate dispersed particles flow, the feeding rate of coal particles should be decided by <b>feeding</b> <b>coefficient</b> M and is controlled by variable rotation speed of screw. The corresponding simplified model of feeding rate is presented, and interparticle forces are evaluated by the velocity coefficient. A vibrating metal rod is inserted {{into the middle of the}} shaftless screw to avoid particles agglomeration, and particle flow stability is also effectively improved. The given results show good linearity and stability of micro feeder. Moreover, the influences of the particle properties such as particle size and particle moisture content on the feeding rate are also investigated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Design and {{modeling}} of nonlinear systems require {{the knowledge of}} all inside acting parameters and effects. An empirical alternative is to identify the system’s transfer function from input and output data as a black box model. This paper presents a procedure using least squares algorithm for the identification of a <b>feed</b> drive system <b>coefficients</b> in time domain using a reduced model based on windowed input and output data. The command and response of the axis are first measured in the first 4 ms, and then least squares are applied to predict the transfer function coefficients for this displacement segment. From the identified coefficients, the next command response segments are estimated. The obtained results reveal a considerable potential of least squares method to identify the system’s time-based coefficients and predict accurately the command response as compared to measurements.

40|$|Studies have {{reported}} {{a positive effect}} of prebiotics on the bioavailability of iron. This study evaluated the effect of partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) on iron absorption mechanisms in anemic rats. Male Wistar rats were fed 75 g American Institute of Nutrition Rodent Diets for growth, pregnancy and lactation (AIN 93 ‐G) without iron for three weeks in order to induce iron deficiency anemia. Then they were fed a control diet (n = 12; without fiber) or a diet with 7. 5 % of PHGG (n = 12), both without iron. Food intake, body growth and the <b>feed</b> efficiency <b>coefficient</b> (FEC) were measured. The animals were euthanized {{after two weeks of}} treatment. The weight of the organs, the pH of the cecal content, and the hepatic iron and ferroportin expression in the cecum, duodenum, and liver were assessed. The intake of PHGG reduced food intake without affecting body growth, and there was a difference between the groups regarding the FEC (p = 0. 026), with the highest value found in the PHGG group. The weight of the cecal content increased (p ≤ 0. 001) and the pH of the cecal content was significantly lower in the PHGG group. The intake of PHGG significantly increased ferroportin expression in the cecum; however, the difference was not significant in the duodenum and the liver. PHGG seems to have a positive influence on iron absorption through transporter expression, and structural and physiological changes in the colon of anemic growing animals...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze the feeding ecology and trophic {{relationships}} {{of some of the}} main fish species (Soleidae, Moronidae, Mullidae, Sparidae, Mugilidae, and Batrachoididae) of the lower Estuary of the Guadiana River and the Castro Marim e Vila Real de Santo Antonio Salt Marsh. We examined the stomachs of 1415 fish caught monthly between September 2000 and August 2001. <b>Feeding</b> indices and <b>coefficients</b> were determined and used along with the results of multivariate analysis to develop diagrams of trophic interactions (food webs). Results show that these species are largely opportunistic predators. The most important prey items are amphipods, gobies (Gobiidae), shrimps (Palaemon serratus and Crangon crangon), and polychaete worms. The lower Estuary and associated salt marshes are important nurseries and feeding grounds for the species studied. In this area, it is therefore important to monitor the effects of changes in river runoff, nutrient input, and temperature that result from construction of the Alqueva Dam upstream.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of programming the rate of gain and delaying the first implant in feedlot steers on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics. Ninety-six growing steers (269 ± 16. 2 kg) were assigned to 12 pens in a completely randomized design. Treatments were implant (Synovex-S®; 20 mg estradiol benzoate and 200 mg progesterone; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Overland Park, KS) on d 1 or no implant and programmed feeding to gain at a slow (0. 68 kg/d) or fast (1. 14 kg/d) rate during the growing period; these treatments were randomly assigned (n = 8) to pens of steers in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Steers were fed a growing diet and after 88 and 60 d (for steers fed to gain at a slow or fast rate, respectively), steers were transitioned to ad libitum consumption of a high concentrate finishing diet. Growing period implant treatments did not affect ADG but did affect (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) gain efficiency during the finishing period. Feeding steers for a slow rate of BW gain during the growing period improved (P= 0. 062) gain efficiency in the finishing period (169 vs 145 g gain/kg <b>feed).</b> Correlation <b>coefficients</b> between fat thickness and marbling score obtained via ultrasound and fat thickness and marbling score measured at harvest were greater the closer the ultrasound measurements were made to the final harvest date. These data indicate that feeding level {{prior to the start of}} the finishing period may affect BW gain efficiency during the finishing period...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to develop {{calibration}} equations to predict the chemical composition of raw, homogenized rabbit meat by means of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). 44 Pannon White rabbits were housed in groups in three different pen types (16 anim. /m 2), and were fed the same diet. Another 45 animals were housed in cages (12 anim. /m 2) and fed by different feeding regimes. Rabbits were slaughtered at the bodyweight of 2. 4 - 2. 5 kg. Homogenized fresh and freeze-dried left total hind leg muscles were investigated by NIRS using a NIRSystem 6500 equipment with small ring cup sample holder. The ether extract and protein content of all samples were determined chemically. Samples 44 of housing experiment were applied in producing LOCAL calibration equations tested on the 45 samples from the separate <b>feeding</b> experiment. <b>Coefficients</b> of determination (R 2) of the predictions were 0. 89 and 0. 99 for fat, 0. 85 and 0. 96 for protein in fresh and freeze-dried samples, respectively. Results are reassuring, because the equations were applicable, however the analyzed samples were from independent housing and feeding systems. Therefore the chemical compositions differed in the two datasets, i. e. 9. 46 %, and 11. 79 % for fat, 85. 75 % and 83. 44 % for protein content in calibration and prediction datasets, respectively. The average of NIRS predicted values for fat and protein was 11. 36 %, 83. 88 % or 11. 54 %, 83. 45 % when using fresh or freeze-dried samples, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{proposes a}} {{multifunction}} cross-shaped dielectric resonator antenna (DRA) with separately fed broadside circularly polarized (CP) and omnidirectional linearly polar-ized (LP) radiation patterns. These distinct radiation patterns are achieved in overlapping frequency bands by exciting two different modes {{in a single}} dielectric resonator (DR) volume. This letter also investigates {{the effect of the}} feeding geometry on the mutual coupling between the modes and concludes that an asymmetric feeding degrades the orthogonality of the modes and thus increases the interport coupling coefficient. By using a symmetric <b>feeding,</b> the coupling <b>coefficient</b> can be significantly reduced to below 30 dB in the frequency band common to both operation modes. The experimental results show a good agreement with simulation and demonstrate a broadside CP operation over a bandwidth of 6. 8 %, which overlaps with the omnidirectional LP impedance bandwidth of 38. 5 %. The proposed antenna could be used not only as multifunction, but also as polarization diversity antenna due to the overlapping dual-feed CP and LP operation.

40|$|A {{baseline}} flowsheet {{capable of}} partitioning the transuranic (TRU) elements from dissolved zirconium calcines has been developed. The {{goal of the}} TRU partitioning process is to remove the TRUs from solutions of dissolved zirconium calcines to below the 10 CFR 61. 55 Class A waste limit of 10 nCi/g. Extraction, scrub, strip, and wash distribution coefficients for several elements, including the actinides, were measured in the laboratory by performing equal volume batch contacts. A solvent containing diheyl-N, N- diethylcarbamoylmethyl phosphonate (CMP), tributylphosphate (TBP), and a branched chain hydrocarbon as the diluent were used to develop this process. A non-radioactive zirconium pilot-plant calcine was spiked with the TRUs, U, Tc, or a radioactive isotope of zirconium to simulate the behavior of these elements in actual dissolved zirconium calcine <b>feed.</b> Distribution <b>coefficient</b> data obtained from laboratory testing were used to recommend: (1) solvent composition, (2) scrub solutions capable of selectively removing extracted zirconium while minimizing actinide recycle, (3) optimized strip solutions which quantitatively recover extracted actinides, and (4) feed adjustments necessary for flowsheet efficiency. Laboratory distribution coefficients were {{used in conjunction with}} the Generic TRUEX Model (GTM) to develop and recommend a flowsheet for testing in the 5. 5 -cm Centrifugal Contractor Mockup. GTM results indicate that the recommended flowsheet should remove the actinides from dissolved zirconium calcine feed to below the Class A waste limit of 10 nCi/g. Less than 0. 01 wt% of the extracted zirconium will report to the high- activity waste (HAW) fraction using the 0. 05 M H{sub 2 }C{sub 2 }O{sub 4 } in 3. 0 M HNO{sub 3 } scrub, and greater than 99 % of the extracted actinides are recovered with 0. 001 M HEDPA...|$|R
