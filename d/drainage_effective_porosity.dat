50|$|A {{dramatic}} {{example of}} a core <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> vs log <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> discrepancy comes from some Greensand reservoirs in Western Australia. Greensands are green because of iron-bearing glauconite which is usually recognized as illite/mica or mixed layer illite-smectite clay by x-ray diffraction. The glauconite per se will incorporate electrochemically bound water (CBW) because of the clay types. More importantly for the consideration of <b>effective</b> <b>porosity,</b> though, glauconite grains (part of the Vsh) have intra-particular microporous pore space which retains capillary-bound water. Glauconite can constitute {{a large percentage of}} the reservoir rock, and therefore the associated intra-particular pore space can be significant. Log <b>effective</b> <b>porosities</b> calculated at 25% in some Greensand reservoirs have yielded core analysis <b>effective</b> <b>porosities</b> of 35% at equivalent depths. The difference is the glauconitic microporosity which contains water at reservoir conditions and is included as part of the Vsh (non-effective porosity) by log analysis. However, glauconitic microporosity is measured as part of the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> in core plugs, even if they are humidity dried.|$|R

It is challenging to quantify the apparent porosity of fried potato crisps as they have a thin irregularly shaped cross section containing oil and water. This study uses a novel micro-CT technique to determine the solid volume fraction and hence the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> of three types of potato crisps: standard continuously fried crisps, microwaved crisps, and continuously fried ‘kettle’ crisps. Results It was found that continuously fried kettle crisps had the lowest <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> at 0. 54, providing the desired crunchy taste and lower oil contents. Crisps produced using a microwave process designed to mimic the dehydration process of standard continuous fried crisps had an <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> of 0. 65, which was very similar to the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> of 0. 63 for standard continuously fried crisps. The results were supported by the findings of a forced preference consumer test. Conclusion The <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> affects the product taste and is therefore a critical parameter.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a compacted soil liner is partly {{a function of the}} porosity, which is important because the transport of materials through the liner occurs via the pore space. This project studies the pore spaces of compacted soil materials to estimate the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity,</b> which is the portion of the pore space where the most rapid transport of leachate occurs. Pore space of three soil materials, till, loess. and paleosol, was studied by using mercury intrusion porosimetry, water absorption, and image analysis. These analyses provided cumulative porosity curves from which the pore size distribution of soil samples were estimated. Theory was developed to estimate the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> of a compacted soil material based upon a model of its pore size distribution and pore continuity. The <b>effective</b> <b>porosities</b> of compacted till. loess. and paleosol materials are estimated-to be 0. 04. 0. 08. and 0. 09. respectively. These values are 10 to 20 % of the total porosities.

The main aquifer properties determined were hydraulic conductivity, <b>porosity,</b> <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> and coefficient of uniformity. Samples for analysis were obtained from test water wells drilled to 100 m in selected parts of the Basin. The empirical method used was the Hazens method, while porosity was determined in the laboratory. The results show that three levels of aquifers generally exist in the Basin. The aquifer material consist of well sorted medium sand to fine gravel. The upper aquifer occurs {{at a depth of}} between 10 – 18 m and has a hydraulic conductivity of 18. 5 m/d and <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> of 9. 0.

Once permeability and <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> are determined for a selected material, travel times for noninteracting pollutants through specified thicknesses of compacted material at specified hydraulic gradients can easily be predicted. This paper presents a straightforward method of determining the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> of compacted soil materials and compares measured and predicted solute breakthrough times for three compacted soil materials, The determination of <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> is based upon the total porosity and the spread on a log scale in the pore sizes of a compacted sample, Once the total porosity and pore size distribution information are obtained for a particular sample, the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> can be determined by using a graphical solution.

40|$|The {{concept of}} an <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> is widely used in solute {{transport}} modeling {{to account for the}} presence of a fraction of the medium that effectively does not influence solute migration, apart from taking up space. This non-participating volume or ineffective porosity plays the same role as the gas phase in single-phase liquid unsaturated transport: it increases pore velocity, which is useful towards reproducing observed solute travel times. The prevalent use of the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> concept is reflected by its prominent inclusion in popular texts, e. g., de Marsily (1986), Fetter (1988, 1993) and Zheng and Bennett (2002). The purpose of this commentary is to point out that proper application of the concept for sorbing solutes requires more than simply reducing porosity while leaving other material properties unchanged. More specifically, <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> implies the corresponding need for an effective bulk density in a conventional single-porosity model. The reason is that the designated non-participating volume is composed of both solid and fluid phases, both of which must be neglected for consistency. Said another way, if solute does not enter the ineffective porosity then it also cannot contact the adjoining solid. Conceptually neglecting the fluid portion of the non-participating volume leads to a lower (<b>effective)</b> <b>porosity.</b> Likewise, discarding the solid portion of the non-participating volume inherently leads to a lower or effective bulk density. In the author's experience, practitioners virtually never adjust bulk density when adopting the <b>effective</b> <b>porosity</b> approach...|$|R
