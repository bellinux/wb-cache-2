40|$|If the {{equation}} of state of dark energy is anisotropic there will be additional quadrupole anisotropy in {{the cosmic microwave background}} induced by the time dependent anisotropic stress quantified in terms of Δ w. Assuming that the entire amplitude of the observed quadrupole is due to this anisotropy, we conservatively impose a limit of |Δ w| - 1 assuming that Ω_ m< 0. 5. This is considerably tighter than that which comes from SNe. Stronger limits, upto a factor of 10, are possible for specific values of Ω_ m and w. Since we assume this component is uncorrelated with the stochastic component from inflation, we find that both the expectation value and the sample variance are increased. There no improvement in the likelihood of an anomalously low quadrupole as suggested by previous work on an <b>elliptical</b> <b>universe...</b>|$|E
40|$|There are evidences {{that the}} cosmic {{microwave}} background (CMB) large-angle anomalies imply a departure from statistical isotropy and hence from the standard cosmological model. We propose a LCDM model extension whose dark energy component preserves its nondynamical character but wield anisotropic vacuum pressure. Exact solutions for the cosmological scale factors are presented, upper bounds for the deformation parameter are evaluated and its value is estimated considering the <b>elliptical</b> <b>universe</b> proposal to solve the quadrupole anomaly. This model can be constructed from a Bianchi I cosmology with cosmological constant from two different ways: i) a straightforward anisotropic modification of the vacuum pressure consistently with energy-momentum conservation; ii) a Poisson structure deformation between canonical momenta such that the dynamics remain invariant under scale factors rescalings.

40|$|Abstract. This talk summarises several {{different}} lines of argument suggesting {{that one should}} not expect cuspy nonaxisymmetric galaxies to exist as robust, long-lived collisionless equilibria, i. e., that such objects should not be idealised as time-independent solutions to the collisionless Boltzmann equation. Should elliptical galaxies be visualised as objects that {{spend most of their}} lives in or near a true equilibrium, continually disturbed somewhat by nearby objects, but not exhibiting any systematic dynamical evolution? Or should they be viewed instead as objects that may be close to some equilibrium, but are drifting through phase space in such a fashion as to manifest a systematic secular evolution on time scales shorter than tH, the age of the Universe? In other words: once they have settled down towards a near-equilibrium, should galaxies be viewed as static or dynamic entities? Over the age of the <b>Universe,</b> <b>ellipticals</b> clearly change in terms of such properties as colour. However, it is probably fair to say that, until recently...|$|R

40|$|In {{models of}} galaxy {{formation}} in a hierarchical <b>Universe,</b> <b>elliptical</b> galaxies form through {{the merging of}} smaller disk systems. These models yield a number of testable predictions if reliable techniques for determining the relative ages and compositions of the stellar populations of different galaxies can be found: 1) ellipticals in low-density environments form later than ellipticals in clusters, 2) more massive ellipticals form later, 3) more massive ellipticals form in dissipationless mergers from disk galaxies with low gas content. While colours and the Balmer line strengths of galaxies {{can be used to}} infer the average ages of the stellar populations of ellipticals, alpha/Fe element ratios carry information about the timescale over which star formation took place. Here we present preliminary results from semi-analytic models for the distribution of Mg/Fe ratios in galaxies as a function of morphological type, luminosity and environment.

40|$|Deep {{surveys in}} many wavebands {{have shown that}} the rate at which stars were forming was at least a factor of 10 higher at redshifts > 1 than today. Heavy {{elements}} (‘metals’) are produced by stars, and the star formation history deduced by these surveys implies that a significant fraction of all metals in the Universe today should already exist at z? 2 – 3. However, only 10 per cent of the total metals expected to exist at this redshift have so far been accounted for (in damped Lyman absorbers and the Lyman forest). In this paper, we use the results of submillimetre surveys of the local and high-redshift Universe to show that there was much more dust in galaxies in the past. We find that {{a large proportion of the}} missing metals are traced by this dust, bringing the metals implied from the star formation history and observations into agreement. We also show that the observed distribution of dust masses at high redshift can be reproduced remarkably well by a simple model for the evolution of dust in spheroids, suggesting that the descendants of the dusty galaxies found in deep submillimetre surveys are the relatively dust-free spiral bulges and <b>ellipticals</b> in the <b>Universe</b> toda...|$|R
50|$|An {{intermediate}} {{spiral galaxy}} is a galaxy {{that is in}} between the classifications of a barred spiral galaxy and an unbarred spiral galaxy. It is designated as SAB in the galaxy morphological classification scheme. By definition, a galaxy is a congregation of stars held together by gravity. The first intermediate spiral galaxy discovered is the Milky Way, by Galileo, in 1610. He {{was the first person}} with a telescope powerful enough to make such a discovery. Before Galileo, it was thought that all bright objects in the sky were either the planets in the Solar System, moons, comets, or stars. Until the beginning on the twentieth century, astronomers did not know the size of the Universe, but speculated it to be about as big as the Milky Way. In 1920, at the National Academy of Science, there was a big debate between Harlow Shapley and Heber D. Curtis on whether nebulae are small globular clusters surrounding the Milky Way, or separate galaxies located farther away. Nothing was resolved at the debate; neither side was able to provide conclusive evidence to prove their side correct over their opponent. In 1923, Edwin Hubble resolved the matter with a photograph that he took of the Andromeda Galaxy. What he found in his photograph was a very bright light source pulsing at a certain rate, a Cepheid variable, located outside the Milky Way. This can be used to determine the distance to it. Hubble proved that the Universe was full of galaxies, and disproved that the Milky Way was the extent of the Universe. There are many types of galaxies in the <b>Universe,</b> <b>elliptical,</b> barred spiral galaxies; they vary in shape and size, but on average spiral galaxies are the most abundant.|$|R
