50|$|The {{earliest}} commercially successful {{electric motors}} {{date back to}} {{the latter part of the}} 19th century when Nikola Tesla patented his induction motor in 1888. The development of <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> <b>motors</b> however would not have taken place without the push toward urban, and later rural, electrification, using alternating current. Electrification began in cities around 1915 and with electrification so too came the potential market for washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and a host of other commercial appliances. This was recognised by major manufacturers, like Westinghouse and General Electric, who were already in the business of manufacturing large motors for industrial installations. By 1920, over 500,000 fractional horse-power motors were powering washers and other appliances in America.|$|R

50|$|The 1900s {{began the}} decline of the Knickerbocker Ice Company and other ice {{companies}} across the Hudson River Valley. Inventors had devised ways to use electricity to refrigerate food.

Along with <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> <b>motors</b> for electric powered refrigerators, artificial ice was also created so that households no longer needed to call their local “iceman” to deliver their block of ice to their homes. The last block of ice was harvested from Rockland Lake in 1924 and the Knickerbocker Ice Company closed its doors to the public. Two years later during the demolition of the remaining icehouses, one that was still filled with sawdust to insulate the ice caught fire and destroyed almost all of Rockland Lake Village.|$|R

2500|$|The Italian {{inventor}} Galileo Ferraris {{invented a}} polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The {{idea was that}} two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents {{might be used to}} produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S. By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. [...] Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} types of motors {{that can be used}} in a linear {{actuator}} system. These include dc brush, dc brushless, stepper, or in some cases, even induction motors. It all depends on the application requirements and the loads the actuator is designed to move. For example, a linear actuator using an integral <b>horsepower</b> AC induction <b>motor</b> driving a lead screw can be used to operate a large valve in a refinery. In this case, accuracy and high movement resolution aren't needed, but high force and speed are. For electromechanical linear actuators used in laboratory instrumentation robotics, optical and laser equipment, or X-Y tables, fine resolution in the micron range and high accuracy may require the use of a <b>fractional</b> <b>horsepower</b> stepper <b>motor</b> linear actuator with a fine pitch lead screw. There are many variations in the electromechanical linear actuator system. It is critical to understand the design requirements and application constraints to know which one would be best.|$|R
