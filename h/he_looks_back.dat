5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back,</b> and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E
25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> {{over his shoulder at the}} World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
60|$|Hilary {{hastened to}} the door. From {{that point of}} vantage <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{into her}} eyes, and saw. His face flickered with sardonic comprehension.|$|R
60|$|Beamish {{nodded and}} started his horse, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> as <b>he</b> rode off.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Freddy battled fellow horror icon Jason Voorhees {{from the}} Friday the 13th film {{series in the}} {{theatrical}} release Freddy vs. Jason, a film which officially resurrected both characters from their respective deaths and subsequently sent them to Hell. The ending {{of the film is}} left ambiguous {{as to whether or not}} Freddy is actually dead; despite being decapitated, as a head <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> and winks at the viewers. A sequel featuring Ash Williams from The Evil Dead franchise was planned, but never materialized on-screen. It was later turned into Dynamite Entertainment's comic book series Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash.|$|E
25|$|Other {{terms are}} used to {{describe}} the lion's position in further detail. It should be noted that each coat of arms has a right and left (i.e. dexter and sinister) side - with respect to the person carrying the shield - so {{the left side of the}} shield as drawn on the page (thus the right side to the shield bearer) is called the dexter side. The lion's head is normally seen in agreement with the overall position, facing dexter (left) unless otherwise stated. If a lion's whole body is turned to face right, he is to sinister or contourné. If his whole body faces the viewer, he is affronté. If his head only faces the viewer he is guardant or gardant, and if <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> over his shoulder he is regardant. These adjectives follow any other adjectives of position.|$|E
25|$|Rucker {{was born}} and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, where his family history goes back generations. He lives in Charleston with his wife and three children. His single mother, Carolyn, a nurse at Medical University of South Carolina, raised him with his three sisters and two brothers. According to Rucker, his father was never around, and Rucker saw him only before church on Sundays. His father was in a gospel band called The Rolling Stones. Rucker has said that he had a typical Southern, African-American upbringing. His family {{attended}} church every Sunday and was economically poor, and at one point, his mother, her two sisters, his grandmother and 14 children were all living in a three-bedroom house. But he says that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on his childhood with very fond memories. His sister, L'Corine, recalled that singing was always his dream.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> and saw Mr. Sumner at his desk, and his astonishment increased.|$|R
60|$|A hand pressed Ken's shoulder. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> to see {{a student}} bending down toward him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at Ursula with a hard, cold look, {{and did not}} {{trouble to}} answer.|$|R
2500|$|While {{heading to}} a late-night {{business}} meeting with Bobby, Cliff finds a woman's body {{floating in the}} Southfork pool. He jumps into the pool to see who it is, and when <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> up, J.R. {{is standing on the}} balcony over the pool. Believing J.R. is responsible, Cliff says to his rival, [...] "She's dead. You bastard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Folktales tell {{of people}} trying to rid {{themselves}} of mischievous kobolds. In one tale, a man with a kobold-haunted barn puts all the straw onto a cart, burns the barn down, and sets off to start anew. As he rides away, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> and sees the kobold sitting behind him. [...] "It was high time that we got out!" [...] it says. A similar tale from Köpenick tells of a man trying to move out of a kobold-infested house. He sees the kobold preparing to move too and realises that he cannot rid himself of the creature. The lord of the Hundermühlen Castle disliked Heinzelmann and tried to escape him by taking up residence with his family and retinue elsewhere. Nevertheless, the invisible kobold travelled along with them as a white feather, which they discovered when they stayed at an inn.|$|E
60|$|To prevent drowsiness, to beguile the time, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> to {{his past}} experience, and the prison became his Patmos--the gate of heaven--a Bethel, {{in which his}} time was {{occupied}} in writing {{for the benefit of}} his fellow-Christians. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> upon all the wondrous way through which the Lord had led him from the City of Destruction to Mount Zion. While writing his own spiritual pilgrimage, his great work broke upon his imagination.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> seawards. His {{eyes were}} {{following}} {{the flight of}} a seagull, wheeling in the sunlight.|$|R
60|$|But Sir James {{was already}} on the topmost stair. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> with his kindly, shrewd glance.|$|R
60|$|It was Helen {{who finally}} led her lover from the room. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> from the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "You smothered me. I couldn't breathe--and now I'm going, do you hear, going away, to life, to love, {{behind the}} beyond!" [...] She gathers up Mr. Harding (practically) and carries him passionately away. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> weakly as he goes.|$|E
6000|$|... (He catches Mrs. Starkweather by the hand. Protesting, {{but highly}} pleased, she {{allows him to}} lead her to the door, where he extends his other hand to Linda. Thus, pausing in doorway, leading a woman by either hand, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> at Margaret.) (Roguishly.) Remember, mama, we're going to scout in a little while.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Helen, don't feel bad," [...] he said, kindly. [...] "Shore you're not to blame. Your comin' West hasn't {{made any}} {{difference}} in Beasley's fate, except mebbe to hurry it a little. My dad is old, an' when he talks it's like history. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> on happenin's. Wal, it's the nature of happenin's that Beasley passes away before his prime. Them of his breed don't live old in the West.... So I reckon you needn't feel bad or worry. You've got friends." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{kissed her}} tenderly. Returning to the sitting-room, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> across the passage. Her door was shut.|$|R
60|$|He {{gathered}} the empty pails and cooking pots together {{and opened the}} door. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at her.|$|R
60|$|But White Fang {{could not}} believe. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> at the master, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> at the dogs. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> eagerly and questioningly at the master.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; hope {{from the}} {{influence}} on him of time, if {{not from the}} influence of mercy. As I have already told you, he is now an old man; he cannot, {{in the course of}} nature, expect to live much longer. If <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> to the period when he and his brother were first at variance, he must look back through thirty years. Surely, these are softening influences which must affect any man? Surely, his own knowledge of the shocking circumstances under which he has become possessed of this money will plead with him, if nothing else does?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{then when}} <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back,</b> he is {{astonished}} at himself. He wonders {{how he could}} dare so much; wonders how he could endure so much; wonders how the right thought came into {{his head at the}} right moment. He hardly knows himself again. It seems to him, when he thinks over it all, like a grand and awful dream. And the world is astonished at him likewise. They cry, 'Who would have thought there was so much in this man? who would have expected such things of him?' And they call him a hero--and so he is.|$|E
60|$|But he will find, if <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> to {{the sixth}} {{paragraph}} of the opening chapter of the last volume, some statement of feelings, which, as they made me despondent {{in a time of}} apparent national prosperity, now cheer me in one which, though of stern trial, I will not be so much a coward as to call one of adversity. And I derive this encouragement first from the belief that the War itself, with all its bitterness, is, in the present state of the European nations, productive of more good than evil; and, secondly, because I have more confidence than others generally entertain, in the justice of its cause.|$|E
60|$|Granet {{turned a}} little around. There was a queer {{change in his}} face as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> at his uncle.|$|R
60|$|Conger hurried on. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back.</b> What {{was wrong}} with her? The woman was still staring; she had dropped the {{packages}} to the ground. He increased his speed. He turned a second corner and went up a side street. When <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> again the woman {{had come to the}} entrance of the street and was starting after him. A man joined her, {{and the two of them}} began to run toward him.|$|R
6000|$|The sudden silence {{surprised}} Allan; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> drowsily {{over his}} shoulder. [...] "Thinking again!" [...] he exclaimed, with a weary yawn.|$|R
6000|$|Selin. The {{wind and}} sun we equally divide, So let {{the event of}} arms the truth decide. The chances of the fight, and every wound, The trumpets, on the victor's part, resound. [...] [The Trumpets sound; ALMANZOR and ZULEMA [...] meet and fight; OZMYN and HAMET. After [...] some passes, the sword of OZMYN breaks; [...] he retires, {{defending}} himself, and is [...] wounded; the Zegrys' Trumpets sound their [...] advantage. ALMANZOR, in the mean time, [...] drives ZULEMA to the farther end of the [...] Stage, till, hearing the Trumpets of the [...] adverse Party, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back,</b> and sees [...] OZMYN'S misfortune; he makes at ZULEMA [...] just as OZMYN falls, in retiring, and [...] HAMET is thrusting at him.|$|E
60|$|Still it is {{necessary}} that something should be said of the subsequent adventures of those with whom we have for a while been so intimate, some short word spoken of {{the manner in which they}} adhered to the cause which was so dear to them. We cannot leave them in their temporary sojourn at Laval, as though a residence there was the goal of their wishes, the end of their struggle, the natural and appropriate term of their story; but as, unfortunately, their future career was not a happy one, we will beg the reader to advance with us at once over many years; and then, as <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> upon La Vendée, through the softening vista of time, the melancholy termination of its glorious history will be less painful.|$|E
60|$|Man is a blind, {{helpless}} creature. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> {{with pride}} upon his goodly {{heritage of the}} ages, and yet obeys unwittingly every mandate of that heritage; for it is incarnate with him, and in it are embedded the deepest roots of his soul. Strive as he will, he cannot escape it--unless he be a genius, {{one of those rare}} creations to whom alone is granted the privilege of doing entirely new and original things in entirely new and original ways. But the common clay-born man, possessing only talents, may do only what has been done before him. At the best, if he work hard, and cherish himself exceedingly, he may duplicate any or all previous performances of his kind; he may even do some of them better; but there he stops, the composite hand of his whole ancestry bearing heavily upon him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> again, {{and there}} were now two boats floating, and the one {{farthest}} out at sea pitched clumsily, bottom upward.|$|R
60|$|But the son gave no heed. Once <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> {{over his}} shoulder, and his dark glance saw no one save Moore.|$|R
60|$|Wingate {{picked up}} his hat and stick and moved towards the door. From the {{threshold}} <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back,</b> waiting whilst Josephine joined him.|$|R
