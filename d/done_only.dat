5|$|The true {{and only}} {{practicable}} object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, {{not of the}} minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be <b>done</b> <b>only</b> in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had <b>done</b> <b>only</b> once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
5|$|After the New Avengers {{are forced}} to allow Osborn to capture Luke Cage when he needs medical treatment, the team uses a {{tracking}} device Osborn had planted in Cage to trick him into blowing up his own house, after rescuing Cage from Osborn's custody. Osborn then creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming it poses a national security threat. During a pitched battle with several superheroes, Sentry causes Thor's world to fall to Earth. In the middle of Osborn's fight with Captain America, Stark removes Osborn's armor remotely, revealing Osborn used green facepaint to create a goblin-like look. Osborn screams {{that they do not}} know what they have <b>done,</b> <b>only</b> for Spider-Man to knock him down. He tells them they are all dead as the Void is released. Osborn knocks out Rogers and tries to escape, but is captured by Volstagg. Incarcerated in The Raft penitentiary, he blames his Green Goblin alter-ego for ruining his chance to protect the world as Iron Patriot.|$|E

5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{to explore the}} island of Rasay, which could be <b>done</b> <b>only</b> on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance {{on the top of}} Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} field, the document addressed {{the lack of}} a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development, and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism. Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories, manufacturing, arts, agriculture, navigation, and other critical areas. There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses. With the money generated, the state would then seek seeds and tools, and ultimately allow the continent to be economically autarchic. The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi, where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million. Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines. He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action, but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit. The state would not manage those areas indefinitely; Moreno proposed that this should be <b>done</b> <b>only</b> until there was a strong economic activity in each area, and then the state would just observe, making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society.|$|E
5|$|The fatwa {{reaffirmed the}} {{obligation}} of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual ablution (ghusl), {{even if they could}} not be performed in the correct form. It described {{the obligation of}} the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if <b>done</b> <b>only</b> by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E

25|$|While usually {{connected}} to a barge, the pushers are also capable of operating independently.
