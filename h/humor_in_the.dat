5|$|Family Guy is an American {{animated}} sitcom {{created by}} Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series {{centers on the}} Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show {{is set in the}} fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.|$|E
5|$|Social satire and {{the theme}} of {{consumerism}} are frequent sources of <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plot of Crash: Mind over Mutant, with the game featuring jokes about SUVs and the skyrocketing prices of gas at the time. The game's story is told {{through a number of}} cut scenes animated in 2D Animation with different styles, such as those of Dragon Ball, The Animatrix, and South Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Hepburn {{starred in}} the dark-comedy Grace Quigley, {{the story of an}} elderly woman who enlists a hitman (Nick Nolte) to kill her. Hepburn found <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morbid theme, but reviews were {{negative}} and the box-office was poor. In 1985, she presented a television documentary about the life and career of Spencer Tracy. The majority of Hepburn's roles from this point were in television movies, which did not receive the critical praise of her earlier work in the medium but remained popular with audiences. With each release, Hepburn would declare it her final screen appearance, but she continued to take on new roles. She received an Emmy nomination for 1986's Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry, then two years later returned for the comedy Laura Lansing Slept Here, which allowed her to act with her grandniece, Schuyler Grant.|$|E

50|$|Greek and Roman philosophers, who valued {{reasoning}} abilities, disparaged {{people with}} intellectual disability as barely human. The oldest physiological view of intellectual disability is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writings of Hippocrates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late fifth century BCE, {{who believed that}} it was caused by an imbalance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four <b>humors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain.|$|R
5|$|The film had regular showings in many theaters worldwide, {{with many}} as a monthly event. Fans {{interact}} with the film {{in a similar fashion}} to The Rocky Horror Picture Show; audience members dress up as their favorite characters, throw plastic spoons in reference to an unexplained framed photo of a spoon on a table in Johnny's living room, toss footballs to each other from short distances, and yell insulting comments {{about the quality of the}} film as well as lines from the film itself. Wiseau has claimed that it was his intent for audiences to find <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, although viewers and some of the cast members generally have viewed it as a poorly-made drama.|$|E
5|$|Although {{meant to}} take place in Santa Barbara, California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed in and around the Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked to the set every day. The scripts for each Psych episode had to go through several reviews, and often were cut down by as much as a few dozen pages. A large portion of show's dialogue consists of on-the-spot improvisation by the actors, specifically Roday and Hill. The writers noted that much of the <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> installments came from improvisation. The episode also included several reoccurring gags on the show, such as an introductory flashback and the inclusion of a pineapple; both gags were created by the action of one of the actors.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E
25|$|There {{are still}} {{remnants}} {{of the theory of}} <b>the</b> four <b>humors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current medical language. For example, modern medicine refers to humoral immunity or humoral regulation when describing substances such as hormones and antibodies that circulate throughout the body. It also uses the term blood dyscrasia to refer to any blood disease or abnormality.|$|R

25|$|In 2005, David Berkeley {{released}} Live from Fez, {{the testimony}} of a live event held on the 22nd of February of the same year, {{one of the last}} concerts held at the popular Lower Manhattan club. Along with the CD is a DVD including four songs recorded in the same occasion. This live release displays not only David Berkeley's heartfelt musical style, but also his sense of <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intermissions between songs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{show was}} based on farce, often relying on {{innuendo}} and misunderstanding, {{as well as physical}} comedy to punctuate the hare-brained schemes the characters would invariably conjure up to get themselves out of situations and dilemmas. Running jokes were frequently based on Jack's (supposed) sexual orientation, Mr. Roper's lack of sexual prowess, and Chrissy's blonde moments. Conflict in the show came from the dysfunctional marriage of the Ropers, Janet's intolerance for a roommate romance, and later on, Jack's friendship with Larry and Larry's abuse thereof. Of all the characters, only Jack, Janet, and Larry appeared in all eight seasons of the series.|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{comparisons}} between {{the game and the}} Austin Powers film series, Hubbard pointed out on several occasions that, unlike Austin Powers, No One Lives Forever is not a parody of the spy genre. Contrasting the source of the <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two series, Hubbard noted that while the game is [...] "campy and silly, [...] the underlying premise borders on apocalyptic. That dichotomy in tone results in a very different style of humor from a parody, where everything is in good fun and nobody, including the characters, takes anything very seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for the show's premiere episode were mixed. Linda Stasi of the New York Post praised its humor {{as almost}} as funny as the film, and Nancy Smith of The Wall Street Journal called it [...] "a dream come true" [...] for {{fans of the}} film. Ed Bark of UncleBarky.com enjoyed the show {{and said it was}} [...] "far funnier" [...] than the Fox {{animated}} comedies Bob's Burgers and Allen Gregory. Simon Moore of Flickering Myth compared the show's [...] "left-field laughs" [...] favorably to the <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons and Futurama.|$|E
500|$|Sakura Eries, also of Mania.com, gave volumes five, six, {{and eight}} to eleven {{positive}} ratings overall. She noted that volume five may appeal to readers {{more interested in}} the side characters, and that appreciating Kobayashi's <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of chapter eight [...] "requires a bit more mental effort". In volume ten, she remarks that while Kobayashi borrows the oft-used cliché of a disastrous school play, he manages to add enough twists to make it unique. The play's climax, however, confused her more than it amused her.|$|E

500|$|Goodbye, Galaxy did not {{initially}} sell {{as well as}} the first trilogy, which was attributed by the publisher and designer to its lack of a third episode hurting it given the shareware model of publishing. The pair of episodes has since been referred to as [...] "Apogee's hottest sellers", however. Reviews of the series praised the challenge and <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> graphics and gameplay, especially in Goodbye, Galaxy. Although another Keen game was planned, during development id Software began work on Wolfenstein 3D, and its success, along with the development of Doom, led id to not develop any further Keen games.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews complimented the episode's songs. Huffington Post {{reviewer}} Mike Moody {{noted that}} both the dry <b>humor</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode and its songs were humorous, writing, [...] "I usually find myself heading to the kitchen when the songs come on -- but I usually glance back at the TV to see if Jemaine is making a funny face – and I rush back to the couch once the last note drops.

500|$|Before Yao's {{first meeting}} with Shaquille O'Neal on January 17, 2003, O'Neal said, [...] "Tell Yao Ming, Ching chong-yang-wah-ah-soh", {{prompting}} accusations of racism. O'Neal denied that his comments were racist, {{and said he was}} only joking. Yao also said he believed O'Neal was joking, but he said a lot of Asians would not see the <b>humor.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> game, Yao scored the Rockets' first six points of the game and blocked O'Neal twice in the opening minutes as well as altering two other shots by O'neal, all 4 of those attempts coming right at the rim, and made a game-sealing dunk with 10seconds left in overtime. Yao finished with 10points, 10rebounds, and 6blocks; O'Neal recorded 31points, 13rebounds, and 0blocks. O'Neal later admitted that he regretted how he hazed Yao early in his career.|$|E
