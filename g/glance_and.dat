5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg <b>glance</b> <b>and</b> eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, England's bowlers {{continued}} to make regular inroads. Ward fell in the third over of the day, and the debutant Lindsay Hassett was dismissed soon after, leaving Australia at 5/150. McCabe, who had hit two boundaries thus far in the morning, was joined by Jack Badcock. The former {{continued to}} score boundaries regularly, and hit Sinfield for four and three from a leg <b>glance</b> <b>and</b> late cut to reach his 50 in 90 minutes. He then hit Hammond for consecutive on-driven fours before Badcock fell at 6/194, having made only 9 of the 43 runs in their partnership. McCabe had struck 62 of the 83 runs added since {{he had come to}} the crease. With all the other specialist batsmen dismissed, McCabe was now batting with wicket-keeper Ben Barnett and began to attack the English bowlers with powerful drives and hook shots. Hammond brought back Farnes to try and finish off the tail, but McCabe responded by hitting three fours in one over, forcing the English captain to remove his fast bowler after McCabe had hooked him for six.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first Test, West Indies were bowled out 296 as Grimmett took seven wickets, including Headley first ball. In the second innings, with West Indies 80 behind, Grimmett again attacked Headley's leg stump. After having his scoring restricted, Headley lost patience and after scoring 11 was stumped, trying to hit Grimmett. Bowled out for 249, West Indies lost by ten wickets. After scoring only three in the following tour match against Tasmania, Headley contributed 14 and two in an innings defeat in the second Test. After two heavy Test defeats for the tourists, some critics believed that the series was too one-sided and that some of the five Tests should be cancelled. Headley's poor run of form continued in the West Indian victory over Queensland and, having put on weight, he was also struggling with his fitness. In an effort to overcome Australia's leg stump attack Headley had altered his batting stance; instead of standing at right angles to the bowler, he turned his body more front-on, to enable him to improve his placement of the ball on the leg side. His quick footwork enabled him to alter his position if necessary to play the ball on the off side. He also eliminated from his strokes a risky cover drive he had developed on Caribbean pitches. During the third Test at Brisbane, Headley made his first substantial contribution to the series, after Australia scored 558 batting first. Facing Grimmett's leg side tactics, Headley managed to score freely, and forced Grimmett to alter to an off stump attack. With ten fours in total, Headley became the first West Indian to score a century against Australia, and was left 102 not out when West Indies were bowled out for 193. Forced to follow-on, West Indies were dismissed for 148 of which Headley made 28, the highest score of the innings. Ironmonger tricked him into playing the leg <b>glance</b> <b>and</b> he was caught by the wicket-keeper who had moved across in anticipation of the shot.|$|E

25|$|Ian Redpath and Rick McCosker {{came out}} to open for Australia on another wet wicket, but this time {{failed to make the}} stand that saved Australia at Adelaide. They were not even able to claim that their wickets fell because of the damp patch on a fast bowler's length. Lever had {{increased}} his pace with age and was thought to be fast than Willis, but had dropped the ball short at Brisbane for figures of 0/111. Back in the England team he pitched the ball up and moved it in the heavy atmosphere to have both men caught by Greig at second slip. The English fielding perked up, Mike Denness set aggressive fields and it took 25 minutes for Australia to score their first run. In the Melbourne heat Geoff Arnold was replaced by Old after four overs, but Lever stayed on for seven overs and was rewarded with figures of 4/13 as Greg Chappell was caught in the covers by Denness, Ross Edwards was taken by Dennis Amiss at leg-slip for 0 and Australia were 23/4. The ball was now leaping dangerously, Ian Chappell had to fend a ball off his head and Greg had been hit on the chin. The captain decided that attack was the best form of defence and made 43 of his team's 66/5 by lunch, with Doug Walters popping the ball off Old to Edrich in gully with a frightful stroke. The exhausted Lever only managed two overs after lunch and Chappell and Rod Marsh hit 54 runs for the sixth wicket. Chris Old (3/50) has Chappell (65) caught behind after making a too fine a <b>glance</b> <b>and</b> bowled Marsh (29) for 115/7. Max Walker and Lillee hit out a few more runs, even turning down bad light so that they could continue play and get England in. The burly Tasmanian ran straight into Umpire Brooks trying to avoid a run out they were both sent to the ground. Lever returned to remove Lillee and Mallett and Greig ended the innings by having Dymock out for a duck, with Walker 20 not out. Lever's 6/38 was his best bowling in Tests and Australia were out four minutes before tea for 152, easily their lowest score of the series.|$|E

He notes that Charlotte is written {{in much the same way}} as Maeda's previous works by inserting jokes between serious moments to offer some relief to the viewer.

[...] According to the theatre writer H. M. Walbrook, [...] "Through {{the years of the}} Great War they continued to be on tour through the country, drawing large and grateful audiences everywhere. [...] They helped to sustain the spirits of the people during that stern period, and by so doing they helped to win the victory." [...] Nevertheless, Carte later recalled, [...] "I went and watched the Company playing at a rather dreary theatre down in the suburbs of London. [...] I thought the dresses looked dowdy.... I formed the view that new productions should be prepared, with scenery and dresses to the design of first class artists who understood the operas but who would produce a décor attractive to the new generation." [...] In a 1922 memoir, Henry Lytton, having admired Richard D'Oyly Carte's keen eye for stagecraft, added, [...] "That 'eye' for stagecraft ... has been inherited in a quite remarkable degree by his son, Mr. Rupert D'Oyly Carte. [...] He, too, has the gift of taking in the details of a scene at a <b>glance,</b> <b>and</b> knowing instinctively just what must be corrected". [...] In 1911, the company hired J. M.

500|$|In {{his final}} University Match, Oxford batted first and Jardine's innings began after {{his team had}} lost two wickets without scoring any runs. He batted for 285 minutes, scoring 140. Before lunch, he played very {{carefully}} but increased his scoring rate afterwards. In total, he hit 21 fours and The Times described his innings as faultless. Wisden noted his strong defence and his powerful leg glance. Critics noted that he frequently hit Stanley Jackson to the leg side, a method of play which was unusual at the time. Players educated at Public School generally considered hitting to leg highly unorthodox and almost unfair. K. S. Ranjitsinhji, {{who was in the}} crowd at Lord's, would develop the leg <b>glance</b> <b>and</b> make it respectable within a few years, but he had not yet made his first-class debut in 1892. It is likely that Jardine {{was one of the first}} players to use this shot. Jackson refused to depart from the orthodox methods of the time, continuing to bowl with seven fielders on the off side and only two on the leg side, making it easier for Jardine to score runs.The Times commented that Cambridge [...] "appeared a little slow to grasp the idea of putting a man on the leg side for [...] ". Jardine also hit 39 in the second innings as Oxford chased down a target to win for the only time in his University career. Jardine's first innings remained his only first-class century.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Story" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who previously directed the videos for the singles from Taylor Swift. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again {{because she had been}} able to balance both of their ideas for music videos, something Swift appreciated deeply. The video is a period piece that draws influence from Medieval, Renaissance, and Regency eras. Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed. When writing the song, she envisioned it in a prior time period, and encoded it with details accordingly. She believed [...] "Love Story"'s plot was a timeless scenario: [...] "I think it could happen in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008." [...] Thus, she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest. With six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of Nashville Star, recommended contestant Justin Gaston. Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video. Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a [...] "Prince Charming that could've been alive in the 1800s." [...] However, because Gaston was competing on Nashville Star, he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video. Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: [...] "I was so impressed by the way his [...] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain <b>glance</b> <b>and</b> it really came across well." ...|$|E
