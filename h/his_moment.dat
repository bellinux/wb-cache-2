25|$|In 1976, Frazier (32–3) fought George Foreman for {{a second}} time. With a shaved head for a new image Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the big shots which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> and then lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the book brought some literary fame to Goyen, both in New York and in Texas. He would later recall that he felt that “everyone he met in the literary world wanted a piece of him, wanted to admire him as the moment’s fashion, {{and yet at the}} same time he felt that others were angry at him for <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> of public recognition.” He would also recall later that he was “just about disinherited” by his family after the book’s publication, and “fell out of favor with many people” in his home town.|$|E

25|$|After being rescued and {{returning}} to Lestat's home with him, Nicki pleads to become a vampire. Lestat refuses, but is finally convinced to turn Nicki into a vampire. As Lestat feeds from Nicolas, he is plunged into the darkness in which Nicolas resides. He describes the scene as a seamless black sea, where all colours have faded, and that he sees only a bird soaring over the void expanse. He describes a feeling of having lost all that was once cherished. He describes it also as worse than <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> of darkness at the Inn, and tries to recoil from it. He finally turns Nicki into a vampire, which strains their friendship.|$|E
25|$|Whilst <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> of {{personal}} celebrity was fleeting, Findlater remained a popular {{figure in the}} public memory, continuing to be a subject of artwork and stories for some years. He was {{the focal point of}} Edward Hale's painting Piper Findlater winning the VC (1897), Stanley Berkeley's Charge of the Gordon Highlanders (1897), Vereker Hamilton's Piper Findlater at Dargai (1898), Richard Caton Woodville's The Storming of Dargai Heights (1898) and Robert Gibb's Dargai (1909). Findlater's playing at Dargai, along with the charge itself, became one of the more well-remembered moments of the Gordons' regimental history; they later applied for the Dargai Heights to be recognised as a battle honour, {{the only one of the}} nine participating regiments to do so, but were declined.|$|E
500|$|Mylod, {{spoke about}} the {{decision}} to show Blackfish's death off screen, saying [...] "there {{was a lot of}} tonal discussion about this, and I think I can safely speak for the writers that the choice was a conscious one in the writing not to see his actual death, because the emotional focus was really about the final moments between him and Brienne -- two warriors, two samurais, facing each other -- and Brienne's acknowledgment that this fellow samurai has chosen <b>his</b> <b>moment,</b> and this is <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> of dignity and choice of his death. So it was really about that moment of choice and the dignity and acceptance between these two great warriors, rather than the actual detail of his actual death. That was actually a tonal choice as to how we saw that character." ...|$|E

Completely objectively from watching the show, I was like, 'Why does Blaine get all these songs? This is ridiculous. I want to hear other people doing stuff.'

In that same training round, Espen Bredesen claimed the world record for himself with a clean jump of [...] The restrictive rule concerning jumps beyond 191m, in place since 1986, was subsequently abolished by the FIS. However, as the rule was still in place at the time of Nieminen and Bredesen's jumps, their additional distances were nullified.

"What {{interests}} {{me is the}} defining features of Gregory's vision of the just society: his unequivocal stance against 'the peculiar institution of slavery' and his call for the manumission of all slaves. I am interested in reading Gregory as a fourth century abolitionist intellectual....His outlook surpassed not only St. Paul's more moderate (but {{to be fair to}} Paul, in <b>his</b> <b>moment,</b> revolutionary) stance on the subject but also those of all ancient intellectuals -- Pagan, Jewish and Christian - from Aristotle to Cicero and from Augustine in the Christian West to his contemporary, the golden mouthed preacher himself, John Crysotom in the East. Indeed, the world would have to wait another fifteen centuries -- until the nineteenth century, late into the modern abolitionist movement -- before such an unequivocal stance against slavery would appear again." ...|$|E

Conein reasoned that Diệm and Nhu were doomed once they escaped from Gia Long Palace, instead of surrendering there and accepting the offer of safe exile. Having successfully stormed the palace, Minh had presumed that the brothers would be inside, and arrived at the presidential residence in full ceremonial military uniform [...] "with a sedan and everything else."

500|$|Kumar {{described}} his character as [...] "realistic" [...] and a [...] "new-age metrosexual" [...] man.

[...] Kumar further stated: [...] "There's a quiet dignity and heroism associated with my character. He doesn't fight for applause. He fights for his convictions." [...] In an interview with Tribune India, Kapoor remarked that Indian women would identify with her character.

[...] Chopra described her character Sonia as [...] "charming and focused", commenting that her [...] "philosophy is that she has to achieve her goals at any cost.

500|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not age or age very little, and as such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events {{have been linked to}} specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s. In [...] "Simpsorama" [...] (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23. He lived with his parents in the Lower East Side of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that [...] "Bart" [...] was her first word. Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him [...] "you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow {{for the rest of your}} life! Now, what do you say?" [...] In <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> of truth, Bart responded, [...] "eat my shorts". The episode [...] "That '90s Show" [...] (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.|$|E

(Trilling later acknowledged that the character was inspired by his Columbia College compatriot and contemporary Whittaker Chambers). His short stories include [...] "The Other Margaret." [...] Otherwise, he wrote essays and reviews in which he reflected on literature's ability to challenge the morality and conventions of the culture. Critic David Daiches said of Trilling, [...] "Mr. Trilling likes to move out and consider the implications, the relevance for culture, for civilization, for the thinking man today, of each particular literary phenomenon which he contemplates, and this expansion of the context gives him both <b>his</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>his</b> greatest perceptions, and <b>his</b> <b>moments</b> of disconcerting generalization." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although in {{some ways}} <b>his</b> <b>moment</b> of triumph, Cotterill was by this time, in Roger Sales's words, riding [...] "two horses… moving in {{different}} directions".
