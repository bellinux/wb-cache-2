25|$|Carrying their wounded, {{with the}} Americans and the PARUs as a rear guard and heavy small arms fire popping overhead, 400 to 500 Hmong {{of all ages}} and both genders began a {{dispersal}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b> At midnight, attracted by flashlights used by some of the Hmong, the PAVN mortared the escaping column. Fortunately for the Hmong, the muddy earth absorbed most of the explosives' force. At daybreak, Air America H-34s showed up to evacuate the PARU, Shirley, and Vang Pao's wife. The Hmong may have lost Ban Pa Dong, but they had not suffered overwhelming casualties in the process. Vang Pao subsequently shifted his headquarters to Long Tieng, which would remain the guerrilla headquarters until war's end.|$|E
500|$|Inflexible and Indomitable {{remained}} in company with Beatty {{for the rest}} of the battle. They encountered Hipper's battlecruisers only [...] away as the sun was setting about 8:19 and opened fire. Seydlitz was hit five times before the battlecruisers were rescued by the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve and the British shifted fire to the new threat. Three of the predreadnoughts were hit before they too were able to turn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b>|$|E

60|$|It was in June, and {{the country}} was very beautiful. Groves heavy with foliage, rivers curving away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glooms</b> of bending elm and bass-wood trees, fields of wheat and corn {{alternating}} with smooth pastures where the cattle fed--a long panorama of glorified landscape which his escape from manual labor now enabled {{him to see the}} beauty of, its associations of toil and dirt no longer acutely painful.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dad was {{all right}} for a few days. Really, he seemed nicer and kinder for Jack's absence. Then all at once he sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>glooms.</b> I couldn't cheer him up. When Ben Wade came in after supper dad always got him to tell some of those terrible stories. You know what {{perfectly}} terrible stories Ben can tell. Well, dad had to hear the worst ones. And poor me, I didn't want to listen, but I couldn't resist. Ben can tell stories. And oh, what he's lived through! ...|$|R
60|$|Milt Dale quietly sat up to gaze, with {{thoughtful}} eyes, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b>|$|E
60|$|Out of the {{sunlight}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> and mist below descended horse and rider.|$|E
60|$|Ormsgill made {{a little}} gesture with his hand, and the men sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are there no--no {{men in the}} house--none at all?" [...] enquired <b>the</b> girl, peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} <b>gloom</b> nervously. [...] "There is {{no person}} {{at all in the}} house, but you and I." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had just}} {{completed}} this task when she glanced up and saw a face at her window--indistinctly, for even as she raised her head it drew back and faded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>gloom.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is too absurd. There {{ought to}} be some decently {{thought-out}} system--for--for dealing {{with this sort of}} thing.' He peered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rushing <b>gloom.</b> There seemed to be no end to the moisture and the racket. In town he had noticed nothing.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Hardy {{looked out}} anxiously <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> and quickly {{perceived}} the appearance that his friend alluded to.|$|E
60|$|Presently he saw {{the woman}} stand up in her {{division}} of the compartment and peep over <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{swung the}} gate wide, {{made a few}} paces <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> of the enclosure, and retraced his steps suddenly.|$|E
60|$|He turned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dusky <b>gloom</b> of <b>the</b> shop, and {{sat down}} at the table, rubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of carpets. It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His thin {{shoulders}} worked with grief.|$|R
60|$|So {{the ghostly}} figure which has haunted these pages, as it haunted my life, goes down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> impenetrable <b>gloom.</b> Like a shadow she {{first came to}} me in the {{loneliness}} of the night. Like a shadow she passes away in the loneliness of the dead.|$|R
60|$|Leonard {{drank the}} brandy and sat awhile in silence, pushing up his beard {{with his hand}} and gazing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{gathering}} <b>gloom</b> with his hawk-like eyes. Thus he had sat beside his dying brother's bed; it was a pose that he adopted unconsciously when lost in thought.|$|R
60|$|The {{old man in}} the bow {{peered out}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b> He was shaking, not with cold but with agitation.|$|E
6000|$|Filled with strange, anxious foreboding, he, too, went to {{the door}} of the hut, and peering <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom,</b> he asked quickly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{another word}} {{my father and}} brother wheeled their horses round and {{departed}} at full gallop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> of the gathering night.|$|E
60|$|Without {{waiting for}} a reply, the pirate captain walked down the sloping beach and waded slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dark sea. His motions were so {{noiseless}} and stealthy that those who watched him with eager eyes could only discern a figure moving gradually away from them and melting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> thick <b>gloom.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Ever {{the rustle}} of the {{advancing}} foam, [...] The surges' desolate thunder, and the cry [...] As of some lone babe in the whispering sky; Ever I peer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> restless <b>gloom</b> [...] To where a ship clad dim and loftily Looms steadfast in the wonder of her home.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' asked Merton, as {{they reached}} the level, and saw the old keep black in front of them, 'what is that rope {{stretched}} about the lawn for? It seems to go all round the house, and there are watchers.' Dark figures with lanterns were visible at intervals, as Merton peered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gathering <b>gloom.</b> <b>The</b> watchers paced to and fro like sentinels.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he is camping now," [...] {{announced}} Dave, {{peering down}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b> The moment the mastiff saw him, the canine {{set up a}} loud barking.|$|E
60|$|Miss Ruey {{looked through}} the window-pane, and saw the light go {{twinkling}} far down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom,</b> and ever and anon came the mournful boom of distant guns.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{they would}} knock again,' said Quilp, trying to peer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> {{by which he}} was surrounded, 'the sound might guide me! Come! Batter the gate once more!' ...|$|E
5000|$|Philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote [...] "Pinker wades resolutely <b>into</b> <b>the</b> comforting <b>gloom</b> {{surrounding}} these {{not quite}} forbidden topics and calmly, lucidly marshals {{the facts to}} ground his strikingly subversive Darwinian claimsâ€”subversive not {{of any of the}} things we properly hold dear but subversive of the phony protective layers of misinformation surrounding them." ...|$|R
60|$|Ten steps {{would have}} taken Hurree <b>into</b> <b>the</b> {{creaking}} <b>gloom</b> utterly beyond their reach--to the shelter and food of the nearest village, where glib-tongued doctors were scarce. But he preferred to endure cold, belly-pinch, bad words, and occasional blows {{in the company of}} his honoured employers. Crouched against a tree-trunk, he sniffed dolefully.|$|R
60|$|Magdalen Crawford {{lingered on}} the point until the last dull red faded out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> violet <b>gloom</b> of <b>the</b> June sea dusk, than which nothing can be rarer or diviner, {{and listened to the}} moan and murmur of the sea far out over the bay with sorrowful eyes and sternly set lips.|$|R
60|$|All saw the figure, and Tom at once {{proposed}} that {{they follow the}} fellow. Frank was willing, and away they went {{across the street and}} also <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "BI NAI!" [...] And {{when that}} sonorous Indian name rolled in dignity {{from his lips}} he silently stalked away <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom.</b> That was his answer to the white man.|$|E
6000|$|Now Cuitlahua pondered, staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>gloom</b> {{above him}} and pulling at his beard, {{and the silence}} was great, for none knew what his {{judgment}} would be. At last he spoke: ...|$|E
60|$|I landed {{somewhere on}} the right bank, about three-quarters {{of the way down}} the lake. It was almost dark. Yet I must walk away. I climbed a long hill from the lake, came to the crest, looked down the {{darkness}} of the valley, and descended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> deep <b>gloom,</b> down <b>into</b> a soulless village.|$|R
60|$|Pierre {{had always}} been an admiring reader of Hamlet; but neither his age nor his mental {{experience}} thus far, had qualified him either to catch initiating glimpses <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hopeless <b>gloom</b> of its interior meaning, or to draw from the general story those superficial and purely incidental lessons, wherein the painstaking moralist so complacently expatiates.|$|R
6000|$|As I {{said this}} I held the {{knapsack}} {{with one hand}} while I quickly turned the screw with the other. In a few moments it was high above my head, while I with difficulty held it down by the straps. [...] "Look!" [...] I cried. And then I released my hold, and <b>the</b> knapsack shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air and disappeared <b>into</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>gloom.</b>|$|R
