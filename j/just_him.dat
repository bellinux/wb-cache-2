25|$|There were no cartels at {{that time}} in Mexico. Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers. He oversaw all operations; there was <b>just</b> <b>him,</b> his cronies, and the {{politicians}} who sold him protection. However, the Guadalajara Cartel suffered a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder Rafael Caro Quintero was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. Félix Gallardo afterwards kept a low profile and in 1987 he moved with his family to Guadalajara. According to Peter Dale Scott, the Guadalajara Cartel prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS), under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro.|$|E
25|$|A more {{detailed}} Georgian government account was released later on August 30. According to it, the crisis had begun on August 28, when the armed group captured a patrol of the Border Police of Georgia {{who had been}} searching for the five missing local residents. The gunmen agreed to an offer by a senior border guard officer to keep <b>just</b> <b>him</b> as a hostage and to let go the civilians and the other border guards. Later, an official from the Georgian Interior Ministry arrived to negotiate and demanded their surrender, which was rejected. The group then decided to swap the last captive border guard for the official, telling him {{that he is now}} their hostage. Two of the gunmen then accompanied the official to a location where he could talk with his superiors to update them about the new developments, but instead they were led to an ambush site, where one of them was shot dead by a government sniper. The shooting sparked a firefight, in which 10 more members of the armed group and three Georgian troops were killed. Georgian forces used helicopters and aerial drones.|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} other {{producers}} usually {{a majority of the}} track was already done {{by the time he got}} to the recording studio, but with West, the process was more creative in nature. Pusha described the recording process with West as a [...] "roller coast" [...] and stated that he never knew what to expect while working with the producer. Upon hearing the production of the song, Pusha-T commented that it was so good it persuaded him to write a particularly inspired verse. On the production of [...] "So Appalled", he said [...] "it's Kanye, the beat brings the ghost out of you." [...] The rapper described his verse as [...] "self-explanatory" [...] and stated that it was one of his favorite of his career. Pusha T called his verse [...] "his personal favorite" [...] and that the track was originally supposed to be <b>just</b> <b>him</b> and Kanye. When the song was finished, Pusha-T was so impressed with the track that he argued with West to include it on his album, stating that the song was so good it didn't matter whether or not it had leaked. He commented; ...|$|E

500|$|... "Stormy Monday" [...] {{echoes the}} band's blues roots, and many guitar parts {{come from the}} version cut by Bobby [...] "Blue" [...] Bland in the early 1960s. Allman and Betts trade solos, as does Gregg Allman on the organ as the tempo shifts into a [...] "swinging" [...] beat. [...] "You Don't Love Me" [...] kicks off {{the first of the}} jazz-inspired jams and {{features}} a solo from Duane Allman in which the entire group stops, leaving it <b>just</b> <b>him</b> and his guitar. The song's conclusion also contains elements of [...] "Joy to the World." [...] "Hot 'Lanta" [...] is an instrumental, which has elements in common with jazz rock and progressive rock, and is a showcase for Berry Oakley's bass-playing. [...] "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed", with its harmonized melody, Latin feel, and burning drive invited comparisons with jazz saxophonist John Coltrane (especially Duane's solo-ending pull-offs, a direct nod to the musician). The performance begins with a [...] "long, laconic intro" [...] by Betts employing volume swells, reminiscent of the [...] "dreamy trumpet" [...] used to open songs on Miles Davis' Kind of Blue (1959).|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} saw the {{introduction}} of a writing team; Sara Cooper, Alan McCullough and James Thorpe were hired as additional writers to Kindler. Because of the writing team, it allowed Kindler and the team had to hold meetings, where as in the first season it was <b>just</b> <b>him</b> discussing with Egan. One of the goals in writing the second season is to further explore the global Sanctuary Network, because in the Sanctuary universe abnormals can be found all around the world. Some international Sanctuary bases were mentioned in the first season, but in the second season, the producers wished to visit some of those bases. Introducing new Sanctuaries and its characters would widen the breadth of the show. They also wished to start introducing abnormals that cannot walk, including an oil-like abnormal in [...] "End of Nights" [...] and the fire elemental [...] "Penance". Kindler wrote both parts of [...] "End of Nights", [...] "Pavor Nocturnus", [...] "Next Tuesday", [...] "Haunted" [...] and the second part of [...] "Kali". McCullough wrote [...] "Hero", [...] "Veritas", [...] "Penance" [...] and the first part of [...] "Kali". Cooper wrote [...] "Eulogy" [...] and [...] "Fragments", while Thorpe wrote [...] "Sleepers", and co-wrote [...] "Pavor Nocturnus" [...] and [...] "Haunted" [...] with Kindler.|$|E
500|$|Make-up {{supervisor}} Michael Westmore {{had previously}} used makeup to age DeForest Kelley {{in the season}} premiere [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but [...] "Too Short a Season" [...] proved a unique challenge as four stages of make-up were required to show Admiral Jameson de-aging. The initial stage to show Jameson at his oldest, involved Rohner wearing a bald-cap and wig plus latex prosthetics applied to his eyes, forehead, throat and jowls. That stage took up to four hours {{to apply to the}} actor. Westmore found himself worn out by the volume of work during this episode, as at the time the make-up team on the series included <b>just</b> <b>him</b> and Werner Keppler. On the second day of shooting the first stage make-up, Westmore arrived after Rohner had been in make-up for three hours only to find that he was only half finished. Keppler and Westmore rushed to get him so as not to delay the filming of the episode. Bowman later criticised the make-up used on Rohner, describing it as sub-par. Westmore said that [...] "if I was working on a film, and had several months to test Clayton's make-up beforehand, it probably would have turned out more to my liking. With less than a week to work with, I don't think it turned out too badly." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the album}} did receive some criticism, mostly {{pertaining}} to its lavish and decadent style. Blenders RJ Smith called Wainwright's [...] "carnival-esque piano playing... so thick, the music all but drowns in pretty surfaces". The Independent mostly complimented Want One, though its review revealed {{a preference for}} the simpler tracks like [...] "Want" [...] and [...] "Dinner at Eight", [...] "when it's <b>just</b> <b>him</b> and his piano". The review also criticized [...] "Movies of Myself", describing the song as having [...] "plaintive vocals [...] jar against stadium-rock guitars and dubious Eighties keyboards". Contrastingly, Pitchforks review singles out [...] "Vibrate", [...] "Natasha", [...] "Pretty Things", and [...] "Want" [...] for being [...] "simply too sparse to offer any real substance".|$|E
2500|$|On 9 August 1991, {{during a}} match between England and the West Indies at the Oval, Ian Botham fell over his stumps whilst {{attempting}} to hook Curtly Ambrose {{and so was}} dismissed [...] "hit wicket". Later in the day, Brian Johnston of BBC Radio's Test Match Special read {{out the details of}} the scorecard as normal. When he came to Botham's dismissal, his fellow presenter Jonathan Agnew commented that Botham 'just didn't quite get his leg over'. This was a double entendre meaning that {{he was not able to}} avoid hitting his stumps by getting his leg higher than the stumps, and also a reference to sex. Johnston slowly started laughing until he could commentate no more, leaving about a minute of broadcasting being <b>just</b> <b>him</b> in a fit of giggles.|$|E
2500|$|Penned scripts for Ricky's exit in April 2000 {{had to be}} rewritten {{to account}} for the absence of Mike Reid who played Ricky's father Frank.

[...] Of his departing episode, Owen stated that he was pleased Ricky's final scenes featured <b>just</b> <b>him</b> and Phil (Steve McFadden). He comments, [...] "both Phil and Ricky have had babies, broken marriages and loads of ups and downs in their lives, and it was good to talk about it all in that episode. It's a brilliant script [...] I burst out crying, really sobbing".|$|E

Returning to the office, he is subject to yet another offensive comment from Chris Finch (Ralph Ineson) about his date, and Brent, {{in a moment of}} anger, and having finally been pushed too far with the insults, tells him bluntly, [...] "why don't you fuck off". In the final scenes, Dawn returns to the office and kisses Tim, indicating that she has left Lee. The whole office staff gather for a group photo. Brent asks to have a group photo of <b>just</b> <b>him</b> and the [...] "old gang".
