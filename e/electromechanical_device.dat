25|$|The {{tachograph}} was {{a device}} that monitors speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (analogue tachograph). The chart recorder is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>device</b> that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. The tachograph is a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes. The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion.|$|E
25|$|In {{electrical}} controls, {{a stepping}} switch, {{also known as}} a stepping relay, is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>device</b> which allows an input connection to be connected to {{one of a number of}} possible output connections, under the control of a series of electrical pulses. The major use for these devices was in early automatic telephone exchanges to route telephone calls. It can step on one axis (called a uniselector), or on two axes (a Strowger switch). As the first automated telephone switch using electromagnets and hat pins, stepping switches were invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1888. Strowger filed his patent application on March 12, 1889, and it was issued on March 10, 1891.|$|E
500|$|The Enigma {{machine was}} an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>device,</b> {{equipped}} with a 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Inside was a set of wired drums (rotors and a reflector) that scrambled the input. The machine used a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, and the encipherment varied from one key press to the next. For two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, and the settings were changed daily, so the machine code had to be [...] "broken" [...] anew each day.|$|E
