40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{concurrent}} {{validity of the}} short-form version of the trait emotional intelligence questionnaire (TEIQue-SF) against the long-form version (TEIQue-LF), and {{the construct validity of}} each questionnaire. In total, 1889 Spanish adults (935 women, 954 men; mean age = 21. 56 years, age range = 18 - 37 years) completed the TEIQue-SF and TEIQue-LF, the order of which was counterbalanced across participants. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the 4 -factor structure of both the short-form and long-form versions, with marginally stronger factor loadings observed for the long-form. Bivariate correlations demonstrated a high degree of similarity in scoring on the TEIQue-SF and TEIQue-LF for <b>each</b> <b>subscales</b> and the global trait emotional intelligence (EI) : well-being (r = 0. 76), self-control (r = 0. 69), emotionality (r = 0. 78), sociability (r = 0. 71), and global trait EI (r = 0. 83).

50|$|The Sensation Seeking Scale {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{psychological}} instrument for measuring sensation seeking. It was created in 1964 by Marvin Zuckerman, at the University of Delaware. Zuckerman created the scale with the purpose of better understanding personality traits such as neuroticism, antisocial behavior, and psychopathy. This has gone through a few iterations and is currently on its 1978 version: SSS-V. There are 4 different aspects (subscales), which are: Thrill and Adventure Seeking (TAS), Disinhibition (Dis), Experience Seeking (ES), and Boredom Susceptibility (BS). <b>Each</b> <b>subscale</b> contains 10 items, making a total of 40 items.

Modifications of scoring include normalizing the total score on a scale of 0-100 through mathematical transformations, as well as the use of a Trial Outcome Index (TOI).

Two major limitations include the lack of consistent anchor among subscales and the low emphasis on the nonmotor features of PD. The modified UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales.

40|$|Introduction: In {{this study}} it was aimed to study {{validity}} and reliability of Turkish form of Massachusetts outh Screening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI- 2). Method and materials: Totally 387 adolescents, 333 boys and 54 girls participated to the study. Calculation of <b>each</b> <b>subscale’s</b> Cronbach’s alpha and inter subscales correlation coefficiency has been performed to assess reliability of Turkish form of MAYSI- 2. Explanatory factor analysis and Turkish form of Youth Self Report (YSR) {{have been used to}} assess validity of the scale. Results: Cronbach’s alpha coefficiency values were 0. 84 for Alcohol/Drug Use, 0. 78 for Anger/Irritability, 0. 66 for Depression/Anxiety, 0. 58 for Somatic Complaints, 0. 84 for Suicidal Ideation, 0, 15 for Thought Disturbance, 0. 55 for Traumatic Experiences for boys and 0. 66 for Traumatic Experiences for girls. Turkish form of MAYSI- 2 consisted of seven factor structure as the original one in explanatory factor analysis. Statistically significant correlation coefficiencies which range between 0. 27 and 0. 69 were found in between all the subscales of both Turkish form of MAYSI- 2 and Turkish YSR.

50|$|Each of {{the four}} DOCS subscales begins with a general {{description}} and broad inclusive examples of the obsessions and compulsions within the particular symptom dimension.

Thus, the DOCS subscales assesses {{the severity of the}} patient's own symptoms, rather than pre-defined symptoms as in most OCD measures.

50|$|The Collective Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) was {{developed}} by Luhtanen and Crocker as a measure to assess individuals’ social identity based on their membership in ascribed groups such as race, ethnicity, gender, and the like. The CSES {{has been one of}} the most widely used instruments in the field of psychology to assess collective group identity among racial and ethnic populations. In the initial CSES development study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques were used to examine the underlying factor structure of the proposed four-factor CSES. The preliminary prototype of the CSES consisted of 43 items. To shorten the instrument, Crocker and Luhtanen selected the 4 items with the highest factor loadings from <b>each</b> <b>subscale</b> to represent the final 16-item CSES. The actual scale is a list of statements that pertain to the person’s membership in a group or category and each is rated on a 7-point scale. The scoring is done through four subscales that are categorized as follows: 1) Items 1, 5, 9, and 13 = Membership self-esteem. 2) Items 2, 6, 10, and 14 = Private collective self-esteem. 3) Items 3, 7, 11, and 15 = Public collective self-esteem. 4) Items 4, 8, 12, and 16 = Importance to identity. First, reverse-score answers to items 2,4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 15, such that (1=7), (2=6), (3=5), (4=4), (5=3), (6=2), (7=1). Then sum the answers to the four items for each respective subscale score, and divide each by 4. Because the subscales measure distinct construct, it is strongly recommended against creating an overall or composite score for collective self-esteem.|$|E

The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine goal orientations and coping strategies among athletes based on selected demographic variables of gender, types of sport and level of sport participated. The study was also evaluated the relationship between goal orientations and coping strategies. Athletic Coping Skill Inventory- 28 (ACSI) and Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ) were administered to 217 Bukit Jalil Sport School’s athletes age ranged 13 to 19 years old to evaluate the differences of goal orientations and coping strategies among athletes. The results based on Independent T-Test showed that, there were no significant difference on task orientation among athletes based on gender, types of sport and level of sport participated but ego orientation was reported to be significant difference according to these variables. In coping strategies, the demographic variables of gender, types of sport and level of sport participated demonstrated a variety of results for <b>each</b> <b>subscales</b> of coping strategies. Then, a Pearson Correlation reported there were significant relationships between task orientation with all subscales of coping strategies except freedom from worry and there were significant relationships between ego orientations with four subscales of coping strategies except coachability, concentration and freedom from worry.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the effects of ibasho (the person who eases one's mind), emotional intelligence (EI) and experience of contingency (EOC) on loneliness. In Study I, undergraduates were asked to choose one of ibasho alternatives (e. g. myself, mother, friend, etc.) to answer the question "Who is the best person that eases your mind ?" and to rate the degree of ease to each ibasho alternative. They were then asked to rate items from scales corresponding to EI (J-ESCQ; Toyota et al., 2005) and loneliness (J-UCLA; Moroi, 1985). J-ESCQ consisited of three subscales, Perceiving and Understanding emotion (PU) : Expressing and Labelling emotion (EL) : and Managingand Regulating emotion (MR). Ibasho groups were determinded by the choice of ibasho alternatives. Negative correlations were observed between the degree of ease to friend, and loneliness in all Ibasho groups ("myself", "mother" and "friend"). For the participants in "myself" and "friend" groups, negative correlations were observed between <b>each</b> <b>subscales</b> of EI （EL, PU and MR) and loneliness. Whereas for those in "mother" group, negative correlation was not observed between PU and loneliness. In Study II, undergraduates were asked to rate the degree of ease to each ibasho alternative, and items from scales corresponding to EOC (Maki et al., 2003) and loneliness (J-UCLA). Negative correlations were observed between EOC and loneliness., and positive correlations were also observed between EOC, and degree of ease to mother and that of friend.
