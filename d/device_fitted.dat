25|$|The Tachograph is a {{recording}} device that combines {{the functions of}} a clock and a speedometer. A controller (device) is a device used to measure and regulate {{the speed of a}} machine, such as a motor (Greek: tele = far away (distant), tacho = speed, graphein = write). A tachograph is a card with a <b>device</b> <b>fitted</b> to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes.|$|E
25|$|The {{tachograph}} was {{a device}} that monitors speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (analogue tachograph). The chart recorder is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. The tachograph is a <b>device</b> <b>fitted</b> to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes. The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion.|$|E
500|$|While Slessor {{lost some}} units, his ASW {{capability}} was enhanced {{with the arrival}} of H2S radar, which was used in Coastal Command's operations over the Bay and was undetectable to Metox. On the night of the 2/3 February, a Stirling bomber was shot down over Rotterdam, enabling the Germans to examine the radar and develop counter measures. They were shocked by the advanced nature of its design, which had proven their own research to be wide of the mark. Harris had won the majority of the resources for Bomber Command and used H2S. The radar was, however, used for ASW. No. 172 Squadron RAF and No. 407 Squadron RCAF had the <b>device</b> <b>fitted</b> to supplement their Leigh Lights. No. 172 attacked the first U-boat, [...] on 5 March, but was shot down. The submarine noted the lack of warning, and sent the warning to U-boat command. However, Operation Enclose, 20–28 March 1943 achieved revenge. During this period, 41 U-boats passed through the Bay, with 26 sightings and 15 attacks. Only [...] was sunk, by a No. 172 Squadron Wellington. Operation Enclose II, on 6 to 13 April, sighted 11 and attacked four of the 25 submarines passing through, sinking one U-boat; U-376, sunk by No. 172 Squadron. Operation Derange soon followed, and Bromet was able to deploy 70 ASV III equipped B-24s, Wellingtons, and Halifaxes. Only one U-boat (U-526 [...] ), was sunk, and it was dispatched by a mine. The offensive ended on 30 April 1943. The results had been disappointing. The Command had flown 80,443 hours, lost 170 aircraft, sunk 10 submarines, and damaged 24.|$|E

2500|$|In aviation, {{aircraft}} can {{be equipped}} with radar devices that warn of aircraft or other obstacles in or approaching their path, display weather information, and give accurate altitude readings. The first commercial <b>device</b> <b>fitted</b> to aircraft was a 1938 Bell Lab unit on some United Air Lines aircraft. Aircraft can land in fog at airports equipped with radar-assisted ground-controlled approach systems in which the plane's position is observed on radar screens by operators who radio landing instructions to the pilot, maintaining the aircraft on a defined approach path to the runway. [...] Military fighter aircraft are usually fitted with air-to-air targeting radars, to detect and target enemy aircraft. [...] In addition, larger specialized military aircraft carry powerful airborne radars to observe air traffic over a wide region and direct fighter aircraft towards targets.|$|E

40|$|Objectives of the Study: There is {{research}} done in mobile <b>device</b> <b>fit</b> to organization, {{but it is}} missing a closer examination of a tablet <b>device</b> <b>fit</b> to organization, as of a business tool. The {{aim of this study}} is to extrapolate existing studies of smart <b>device</b> <b>fit</b> to organization in the context of tablet devices. Tasks that can be completed with a smartphone or a laptop differ from tasks that are more efficiently completed with a tablet device. Companies are currently seeking best uses of tablet devices to capture efficiency benefits. This study discusses theory on technology fit to tasks in the context of tablet devices and portrays a case company from retail and its tasks' fit to using tablet devices in its business. The study is beneficial especially for companies thinking about whether they should adopt tablet devices for their business. Academic background and methodology: The academic literature is analyzed from the perspective of mobile devices, their features, and benefits that have been gained by using mobile information systems (IS). A definition of a tablet device is presented. The main theories and research are centered on technology fit with tasks, and utilization effects on performance impacts. A case company and its use of tablet devices in three different managerial levels is researched by analyzing the results of interviews on the subject, and case company tablet <b>device</b> use <b>fit</b> with tasks. Findings and conclusions: Technology affects performance positively only if it fits the task of the technology user. Fit between tasks and technologies, user skills, abilities and opinions affect the performance of the individual. Performance impacts cannot be gained without utilizing a technology. Beliefs, social norms and habits affect IS utilization. Mobile IS brings benefits through flexibility and improved productivity. Tablet devices bring efficiency in business managerial work, when there is a recognized fit between the tasks and the tablet <b>device.</b> Tablets <b>fit</b> best managerial positions that include mobile work. Tablet devices' strengths are in efficient information management and search, time management, communication, and making jobs more interesting to managers. Most benefits can be reached if a tablet device is in a manager's personal use, while having a mobile access to the Internet, company resources and email. Still, the need of producing a large amount of information content is more efficiently made with a PC and its business productivity software...|$|R
