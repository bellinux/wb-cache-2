25|$|In {{the case}} of a fossil fueled {{cogeneration}} plant, the heat output is typically sized to meet half of the peak <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> but over the year will provide 90% of the heat supplied. The boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the cogeneration plant. It is not economic to size the cogeneration plant alone to be able to meet the full <b>heat</b> <b>load.</b> In the New York City steam system, that is around 2.5 GW. Germany has the largest amount of CHP in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{district}} heating has a {{market share of}} around 14% in the residential buildings sector. The connected <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> is around 52.729MW. The heat comes mainly from cogeneration plants (83%). Heat-only boilers supply 16% and 1% is surplus heat from industry. The cogeneration plants use natural gas (42%), coal (39%), lignite (12%) and waste/others (7%) as fuel.|$|E
25|$|The {{governor}} {{could not}} actually hold a set speed; the engine would assume a new constant speed {{in response to}} load changes. The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.|$|E

40|$|The {{surface damage}} of W under D plasma and ELMs-like {{transient}} <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> was studied by combined stationary and pulsed D plasma. Low-flux transient <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> will promote blister formation {{due to the}} gas expansion inside the blisters. On the contrary, high-flux transient <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> will mitigate blistering due to the high surface temperature. Therefore, blistering on W surface first increased and then decreased with the increasing transient <b>heat</b> <b>loads.</b> The promotion effect of pulsed plasma on blistering is more obvious on [001] and [110] surfaces than on [111] surface, and the orientation dependence of blisters was mitigated by the transient <b>heat</b> <b>loads.</b> Surface modification induced by transient <b>heat</b> <b>loads</b> only formed on [001] and [110] surfaces, but did not form on [111] surface. The orientation dependence of surface modification was mainly due to the slipping system of dislocations...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} advances of this redesign was an Earth-trailing orbit. Cryogenic satellites that require liquid helium (LHe, T ≈ 4 K) temperatures in near-Earth orbit are typically exposed to a large <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> from the Earth, and consequently require large amounts of LHe coolant, which then tends to dominate the total payload mass and limits mission life. Placing the satellite in solar orbit far from Earth allowed innovative passive cooling such as the sun shield, against the single remaining major heat source to drastically reduce the total mass of helium needed, resulting in an overall smaller lighter payload, with major cost savings. This orbit also simplifies telescope pointing, but does require the NASA Deep Space Network for communications.|$|E
25|$|If the PTCS cannot keep up {{with the}} <b>heat</b> <b>load,</b> an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) {{maintains}} the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including Kibō and Columbus, as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70kW. This is much more than the 14kW of the Early External Active Thermal Control System (EEATCS) via the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), which was launched on STS-105 and installed onto the P6 Truss.|$|E
25|$|Stirling engines, {{especially}} those that run on small temperature differentials, are quite large {{for the amount of}} power that they produce (i.e., they have low specific power). This is primarily due to the heat transfer coefficient of gaseous convection, which limits the heat flux that can be attained in a typical cold heat exchanger to about 500W/(m2·K), and in a hot heat exchanger to about 500–5000W/(m2·K). Compared with internal combustion engines, this makes it more challenging for the engine designer to transfer heat {{into and out of the}} working gas. Because of the thermal efficiency the required heat transfer grows with lower temperature difference, and the heat exchanger surface (and cost) for 1kW output grows with (1/ΔT)2. Therefore, the specific cost of very low temperature difference engines is very high. Increasing the temperature differential and/or pressure allows Stirling engines to produce more power, assuming the heat exchangers are designed for the increased <b>heat</b> <b>load,</b> and can deliver the convected heat flux necessary.|$|E

[...] Secondary goals {{have also been}} met: the LMG {{has the potential to}} improve battlefield effectiveness (due to its simpler and more consistent weapon action, its light weight and low recoil, and its stiffer barrel); its use of recoil compensation (with a long-stroke gas-system, for example) has produced positive feedback regarding controllability; the simpler mechanism of the LMG is both more reliable and easier to maintain; a rounds counter has been integrated to improve maintainability, and the weapon is capable of accepting other electronic devices; improved materials used in the chamber and barrel have reduced <b>heat</b> <b>load</b> on the weapon; and the weapon cost is equivalent to the existing M249.

The <b>heating</b> <b>load,</b> the coefficient of performance (COP), and the heating-load density, i. e. the ratio of <b>heating</b> <b>load</b> to the maximum specific volume in the cycle, are the optimization objectives. The analytical formulae relating the <b>heating</b> <b>load</b> and pressure-ratio, between the COP and pressure-ratio, {{as well as between}} the heating-load density and pressure-ratio are derived assuming heat resistance losses occur in the hot- and cold-side heat-exchangers.

The cycle performance optimizations are performed by searching the optimal distribution of heat conductance of the hot- and cold-side heat-exchangers for the fixed total heat-exchanger inventory. The influences of some design parameters, including heat-capacity rate of the working fluid, heat-reservoir temperature-ratio and heat-exchanger inventory on the optimal distribution of heat conductance, the maximum <b>heating</b> <b>load</b> and the maximum heating-load density are indicated by numerical examples.
