In Beaufort County, city and county offices were closed early and businesses were advised to send their workers home prematurely. Officials in Chatham County, Georgia evacuated nursing homes on Tybee Island, and encouraged others to leave due to the potential for high tides to isolate the island by cutting off U.S. Route 80.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{cemetery}} {{is surrounded}} by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought-iron gate entrance. For cemeteries in France and Belgium, a land tablet near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments. All but the smallest cemeteries contain a register with an inventory of the burials, a plan of the plots and rows, and a basic history of the cemetery. The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> within the cemetery. More recently, in larger sites, a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign. The headstones within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the storm, about 21,800fishing boats in the Chinese province of Hainan returned to port, and about 120,000people evacuated from fish farms and low-lying areas on the island. Officials halted ferry service between Hainan and the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong province. Offshore, 56fishermen rode out the storm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> on the Paracel Islands; 38people were rescued shortly after the storm, and initially eighteen people were reported missing. The eighteen missing fishermen were found thirty hours after Neoguri struck. The ship they were on had sunk, and the crew clung to debris and made makeshift rafts {{to survive in the}} waters. However, another 18 Chinese fisherman and 22 Vietnamese fisherman remain missing. On Hainan island, the storm left the city of Wenchang without power.|$|E

25|$|HUD {{estimates}} {{that it costs}} $60,000 each year to house a homeless family <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter.</b> Because of this, HUD has various programs in place to help families, including rapid rehousing and permanent housing vouchers. Housing vouchers from HUD are considered especially important for helping to prevent families with children from becoming homeless and also to help these families {{be able to leave}} the shelter system permanently.|$|E
25|$|Homeless shelters {{often provide}} other {{services}} to the community at large. The classic example is the soup kitchen for persons who are not staying at the shelter. Others include support groups, and/or substance abuse treatment. If they do not offer any of these services, they can usually refer their clients to agencies that do. Supportive housing integrates services in a more assertive fashion. The typical pathway through the interlocking system is that a person may start <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> and move through transitional housing into supportive housing and finally independent housing.|$|E
25|$|When the Second World War {{broke out}} Sark was {{occupied}} by the German military and Beaumont joined the Royal Air Force, reaching the rank of flight lieutenant. In May 1941 Flt Lt Beaumont received a week's leave and he, Lawson, friends and family travelled to Liverpool, where according to Hathaway they stayed at a hotel at 126 Smithdown Road in the Sefton Park district. This, however, is unlikely as 126 Smithdown Road was the address for Smithdown Road Infirmary (later Sefton General Hospital) and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission information suggests they were staying at 74 Bedford Street in Toxteth. On 1 May the German Luftwaffe began a bombing campaign on Liverpool that would last more than a week. On 4 May as the warning sirens went off, family and friends at the home, including Lawson's sister Dorothy, took safety <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter,</b> while Lawson and Beaumont stayed in their room. The home was destroyed, killing the couple, while all those who sought safety in the shelter survived. Lawson's death was announced in newspapers around the globe, but was overshadowed by the greater destruction of the war.

500|$|The main plot {{centers around}} the {{confrontation}} between Otoha and Eko. After a cold open that announces Eko's plan to remake Tokyo, the story moves ahead three years. Nue arrives in Shinjuku to free his brother from Eko's hold, while Otoha is in a hospital from heavy injuries. The early parts of the show proceed in a [...] "mikura of the week" [...] fashion as Otoha (as a karas) and Nue separately fight against Eko's minions. When the mikuras attack hospitals across the ward to locate Otoha's body, Otoha and Nue work together but when they separate Otoha's Yurine is abudcted and he is deprived from the power {{to turn into a}} karas. Nue then goes to Eko's base, where Eko kills Yurine and reveals capturing Nue completes the final part of his plan. Meanwhile, Otoha gets into a yakuza fight only to be rescued by Homura, another city's karas. When Eko launches the last stage of his plan and ravages Tokyo with metal tentacles, Otoha ends up among human refugees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> the chief of police had commissioned.|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} base in Masirah was first warned about the cyclone on June11. The next day, officials there raised a Category3 warning, which was soon upgraded to Category2. Aircraft were stored in hangars, and workers inspected the roofs of buildings before riding out the storm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter.</b> Hurricane-force winds struck during the morning hours of June13, with sustained winds peaking at 167km/h (104mph) and gusts to 200km/h (124mph). After a lull during the eye's passage, winds then increased out of the southwest towards 185km/h (115mph). The strong winds caused buildings to collapse and roof beams to be blown through the air. Every building at the base sustained damage, and virtually all homes in the nearby village were leveled. The radio relay station on the island was also damaged. Overall, the storm wrecked about 95% of the buildings in Masirah, leaving 2,000people homeless there. Rain totals were significant, {{with a total of}} [...] falling [...] northeast of Salalah. A station on Masirah Island reported [...] in 24hours, more than six times the average annual precipitation there. The total was the highest daily rainfall in the period from 1977 to 2003 nationwide. Floods washed away thousands of animals as well as lime and palm-tree plantations, downing thousands of trees across the region. The rains flooded the main highway from Muscat to Salalah, and also accumulated in the typically dry Dhofar region. There, most drains were unable to withstand the unusual flooding.|$|E

2500|$|Behavior {{problems}} are a {{primary cause of}} cats being relinquished to shelters. [...] Proponents of declawing argue that declawing reduces undesired behaviors (scratching) and thus reduces the likelihood of relinquishment. [...] Opponents of declawing argue the surgery itself creates more behavioral problems leading to relinquishment of cats. A study by Patronek et al. (1996) found in a univariate analysis that declawed cats were only 63% {{as likely to be}} relinquished as non-declawed cats. [...] A multivariate analysis conducted in the same study shows odds of being relinquished to a shelter were 89% higher for declawed cats. [...] The authors concluded that the conflicting results of the two analysis made it difficult to interpret the effects of declawing. [...] <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> setting, more declawed cats were reported by their owners to have problems with inappropriate elimination (house soiling). [...] However, this study ultimately found no association between the declaw status of cats and their aggression towards humans or frequency of inappropriate elimination (house soiling).|$|E

2500|$|The Hizbullah fighters {{generally}} fought from well-protected positions.

The {{first time he saw}} Israeli soldiers he could not believe his eyes: [...] "They were so close that sometimes our units would overlap theirs". The Israeli soldiers would advance into a neighborhood and seek cover in a building when exposed to fire. The fighters would then target the building with remote-controlled missiles or rocket-propelled grenades. Most of the casualties sustained by the IDF were caused by rockets or missiles. When Israeli forces retreated the fighters would generally take cover in tunnels or shelters to avoid the shelling or bombardment from the air that would usually follow. When the shelling stopped the fighters would emerge to face the expected Israeli advance. In one case, three Hizbullah fighters took cover <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shelter</b> during an air raid.
