5|$|The first {{official}} <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Register</b> was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian. During the Register's earliest {{years in the}} late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed, and underfunded. However, funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first for house museums and institutional buildings, but later for commercial structures as well.|$|E
2500|$|Another Interior agency, the National Park Service, had past {{experience}} overseeing the Historic American Buildings Survey (1933) and the Historic Sites Survey authorized in 1935. Because of this, {{and the fact}} that the Park Service was already managing numerous historic properties within national parks, the NPS was the logical choice to head up the newly created historic preservation program. To encompass the newly created National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service, under director George B. Hartzog, Jr., created an administrative division called the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP). The division oversaw several existing cultural resources programs, including the Historic Sites Survey, Utley's history division and the Historic American Buildings Survey, as well as the new NRHP and Historic Preservation Fund. Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director and it was he who observed that American historic preservation ought be carried out, [...] "with the informed advice and assistance of the professional and scholarly organizations of the disciplines most directly related to the endeavor; namely history, architecture, and archeology." [...] Within OAHP new divisions were created to deal with the National Register. The first official <b>Keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Register</b> was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian.|$|E
6000|$|Old customs {{survive in}} the parish {{register}}s. Scolding wives were ducked, and in Kingston-on-Thames, 1572, the register tells how the sexton's wife [...] "was sett on a new cukking-stoole, and brought to Temes brydge, and there had three duckings over head and eres, {{because she was a}} common scold and fighter." [...] The cucking-stool, a very elaborate engine of the law, cost 1L. 3S. 4D. Men were ducked for beating their wives, and if that custom were revived the profession of cucking-stool maker would become busy and lucrative. Penances of a graver sort are on record in the registers. Margaret Sherioux, in Croydon (1597), was ordered to stand three market days in the town, and three Sundays in the church, in a white sheet. The sin imputed to her was a dreadful one. [...] "She stood one Saturday, and one Sunday, and died the next." [...] Innocent or guilty, this world was no longer a fit abiding-place for Margaret Sherioux. Occasionally the <b>keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>register</b> entered any event which seemed out of the common. Thus the register of St. Nicholas, Durham (1568), has this contribution to natural history:- ...|$|E

6000|$|A novelty was {{introduced}} into registers in 1678. The law required (for purposes of protecting trade) {{that all the}} dead should be buried in woollen winding-sheets. The price of the wool was the obolus paid to the Charon of the Revenue. After March 25, 1667, no person was to be [...] "buried in any shirt, shift, or sheet other that should be made of woole only." [...] Thus when the children in a little Oxfordshire village lately beheld a ghost, [...] "dressed in a long narrow gown of woollen, with bandages round the head and chin," [...] {{it is clear that}} the ghost was much more than a hundred years old, for the act [...] "had fallen into disuse long before it was repealed in 1814." [...] But this has little to do with parish registers. The addition made to the duties of the <b>keeper</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>register</b> in 1678 was this--he had to take and record the affidavit of a kinsman of the dead, to the effect that the corpse was actually buried in woollen fabric. The upper classes, however, preferred to bury in linen, and to pay the fine of 5L. When Mistress Oldfield, the famous actress, was interred in 1730, her body was arrayed [...] "in a very fine Brussels lace headdress, a holland shift with a tucker and double ruffles of the same lace, and a pair of new kid gloves." ...|$|E
