This {{paper is}} {{positioned}} within the broader context {{of public transportation}} systems, with specific focus {{on the development of}} urban micro <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> mobility solutions, and what it could mean for individuals and the economy. Globally, urban problems such as traffic congestion, poor public transport integration, and carbon emissions are forcing us to rethink traditional means of transport. Large fossil-fuelled vehicles and limited public transport infrastructure characterize South Africa’s transport market. Despite the growth in car use, public transport and walking are still the predominant “lifeline” forms of mobility {{for the vast majority of}} South Africans in order to access work, schools and services. Moreover, the lack of public transport services in key economic corridors and rural areas of South Africa, the role of the metered taxi industry which is currently effectively limited to serving only the needs of the tourist market due to high charging regimes, and finally, the absence of an effective inner city transport system endorses the lack of <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> transportation solutions, and the integration thereof with other transport mediums. This adds to the conflict commuter’s face on a daily basis in obtaining a seamless distribution of transport services. 80 % of trips in urban areas are less than 3 km, placing urban micro mobility vehicles in an ideal position as a solution to transportation. This describes the investigation conducted into micro-mobility trends within South Africa to identify a key mode of transport that would comply with the stated requirements, and allow accessibility to commuters within the city and to the surrounding communities. In 2014, Mellowcabs, which are electric public transport vehicles that provide <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> transport services, was identified as a promising candidate within the local micro-mobility vehicle context. They were in need of a design input for their immediate next requirement, which thus describes the development of a good protective side door system that would isolate passengers in adverse weather conditions, whilst similarly affording comfort and safety features found in normal passenger vehicles. The design process is focused on creating a new side door, however, at the same time the product should be, elegant, smart, fashionable, comfortable, economical, maneuverable and safe. In addition, the virtual product lifecycle management tool, CATIA, allows the design team to get feedback in terms of physical-based data that correspond to how the door could hinder the passengers interaction while they ingress and egress the vehicle. This enables us to try various designs to perform a comparative study without building a single physical prototype...|$|E

The system composed of 8 -channel dense {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (DWDM) ﬁber optic link for longhaul, and wireless optical diffused link for short-haul, multicasting applications. The use of wireless optical diffused links at either end, solve the today's <b>ﬁrst</b> <b>mile</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> problem of optical communication network. The wireless optical diffused link uses the optimized coherent optical {{quadrature phase shift keying}} modulation technique, as it offers the best performance in the presence of atmospheric turbulence effect. However, the ﬁber based DWDM system uses symmetrical dispersion compensation technique, with optimized modiﬁed duo-binary return-to-zero modulation format as it performs the best, in the presence of ﬁber non-linearity and dispersion. The system operates with the centre frequency of 193. 1 THz. The system performance is analyzed in terms of quality-factor, bit error rate, eye opening etc. For the bit rate of 160 Gbps, the optimized coverage distance found is 126 m of wireless optical diffused link and 450 km of ﬁber optic link.

This case study aimed to identify body core temperature and selected haematological and biochemical parameters before and after repeated Ice Miles. An experienced ice swimmer completed three consecutive Ice Miles within 15 h. Swim times, body core temperatures, and selected urinary and haematological parameters were recorded. Body core temperature reached its maximum between 5, 8 and 15 min after immersion (37. 7 °C, 38. 1 °C, and 38. 0 °C, respectively). The swimmer suffered hypothermia during the first Ice Mile (35. 4 °C) and body core temperature dropped furthermore to 34. 5 °C during recovery after the first Ice Mile. He developed a metabolic acidosis in both the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> the <b>last</b> Ice <b>Mile</b> (pH 7. 31 and pH 7. 34, respectively). We observed hyperkalaemia ([K⁺] > 5. 5 mM) after the second Ice Mile (6. 9 mM). This {{was followed by a}} drop in [K⁺] to 3. 7 mM after the third Ice Mile. Anticipatory thermogenesis (i. e. an initial increase of body core temperature after immersion in ice cold water) seems to be a physiological response in a trained athlete. The results suggest that swimming in ice-cold water leads to a metabolic acidosis, which the swimmer compensates with hyperventilation (i. e. leading to respiratory alkalosis). The shift of serum [K⁺] could increase the risk of a cardiac arrhythmia.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of express bus to serve travel demand in a polycentric region, using the Atlanta metropolitan area as a case study. Express bus, which serves as the primary mode of line-haul transit commuting for most suburbs in the Atlanta region, is primarily focused on serving traditional suburb-to-city commutes. However, {{more than half of}} the commutes in the Atlanta metro are to suburban locations. This thesis investigates {{the potential of}} an author-devised plan to enhance the transit commute to suburban employment centers, using express bus as the primary technology. Working mostly with existing routes, the plan incorporates ideas found in the literature, such as intermediate stops, transfer hubs, and local bus serving <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> connections. The thesis also tested existing plans, off of which the author's plan was devised. Tests were performed using the trip-based model of the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). Dramatic gains were seen as a result of the author-devised plan, such that 8, 000 daily transit trips are added, and express bus ridership increases by 50 %. Performance improved especially for routes in which intermediate stops were added. The results have implications for how transit can better serve travel demand in a polycentric region. M. S...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn most European {{congested}} {{urban areas}} the rail tracks of the 19 th and 20 th century serving locations {{of industry and}} goods stations were removed, transformed for public passenger transport, closed down or used for other purposes. The main reasons might be the de-industrialisation of the inner cities and the centralisation of the supply-sector (wholesale markets, shopping centres). Simultaneous the urban areas got an excellent road network {{on the surface and}} an efficient public transport system in the underground or on dedicated tracks. Nevertheless the amount of goods delivered to urban areas increased due to material prosperity. In this context “METRO. FREIGHT. 2020 ” analysed the possibilities of a reinforced utilisation of railway infrastructure for freight transport on the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> the <b>last</b> <b>miles</b> within the urban regions in Austria as exemplified in case studies for the metropolitan Region of Vienna, the agglomerations of Graz and Linz and for the urbanised Rhine-Valley in Vorarlberg. In this context the focus point of consideration was the interface of transport and urban development, to a lesser extent the theoretical approach behind. As a fundamental milestone a cadastre of existing or recoverable sidings or other rail shipping points has been surveyed. They were evaluated in respect of serviceability concerning tracking freight trains in the rail network and extensibility in the service area which was complemented with propositions for further developing. The recommendations focus measures intending technically and economically operable access points to rail net on one hand and potentially appropriate access points for the future. But, to reach this goal more strengthened integration of commercial location policy and of shippers’ transport demands with a coordinated land use planning and an infrastructure development policy is required. Finally the methodical approach elaborated comprises following components to push more rail freight shipping:•Traffic zoning is a hierarchical spatial approach subdividing an urban region in sectors, zones and ‘agglomerates’ as spheres of activity for political and private actors involved in freight traffic generation and infrastructure affaires. •Surveying a multimodal topology of infrastructure network which integrates all transport modes in its layout of freight infrastructure propped up on a public platform of a multimodal network graph in future. •Characterizing an ‘agglomerate’ typology of shipping sites with affinity to rail which describes the typical initial position and development trends of the freight transport inducing traffic zones. •Shaping spatial structures which consist of super structures of shipping industrial sites as traffic generators, the infrastructure with its capacity for freight movements and the ‘metastructure’ as external affected settlements and land uses are prime targets and intervention objects, the coordinated measures have to be allocated to. The railway operators are called on to offer more flexible train and operation forms tailored to the logistics of shippers if the rail infrastructure within the serving area from the consolidation node to the sidings enables it. In the end three scenarios have been identified, namely a scenario of ultimate displacement of rail freight service in towns, a retarding scenario which brakes the retreat of rail connected with a change of paradigm in transport and traffic planning leading into an offensive scenario of ‘clean freight mobility’ to revitalize and extend rail freight operations into areas of high consumption...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany {{urban areas}} are {{experiencing}} growing levels of traffic congestion and increased freight demand due to population growth, globalization and contemporary logistics systems. High Productivity Freight Vehicles (HPFVs) are large combination vehicles that offer significant benefits for lowering costs, improving safety {{and protecting the}} environment by {{reducing the number of}} truck movements in cities that would otherwise be needed. This paper describes how HPFV are being implemented in Australian urban areas within the Performance Based Standards (PBS) framework to allow better use of existing urban freight networks. PBS is a flexible non-prescription framework for regulating the weight and dimensions as well as network access of road freight vehicles. This paper presents details of case studies used to estimate the productivity gains from operating PBS vehicles in urban areas. A range of PBS vehicles have been identified as being suitable for urban freight operations including Super B-doubles and rigid trucks. This paper demonstrates how the productivity gains from PBS vehicles operating in urban areas can be estimated. The results of simulations of a number of freight networks for specific commodities are presented. The analysis presented shows that substantial benefits can be achieved by the take-up of PBS vehicles in urban freight networks. Case studies show a lowering of several key freight exposure metrics, which involve kilometres, trips, task travel times and vehicle numbers. A description of the HPFV route assessment process as well as the Intelligent Access Program (IAP) is also presented. The route assessment process is used to examine the road geometry and pavement conditions for the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> access.

40|$|Vehicle sharing {{services}} {{have become a}} major urban transportation mode. One-way vehicle sharing service facilitates access to public transportation systems, thereby addressing the <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>last</b> <b>mile</b> challenges and creating an integrated vehicle-sharing and public transportation network providing origin-to-destination service. In this thesis we provide models and methods for design one-way vehicle-sharing networks. The location of one-way vehicle sharing stations strongly influence the level of travel time savings achieved by the users of the system. Our goal, then, is to select station locations so as to maximize the connectivity with the public transportation system, increase the accessibility to the urban area, reduce travel times, reduce congestion, and reduce emissions. We select {{a certain number of}} stations to install from a set of candidates whose locations are predetermined. In Chapter 2, we review existing literature in which the objective is to minimize total user travel cost. In Chapter 3, we propose a new model with the objective to design a network such that more users experience travel time savings that are sufficiently large to elicit mode shifts to the integrated public transportation option. We develop a decomposition procedure to solve our model and propose cut generation methods to expedite the solution process. Computational results in Chapter 4 show that our algorithm reduces solution times, while increasing the number of travelers who can experience travel time savings of significance by using our newly designed network. In Chapter 5, we propose a heuristic method to generate a network design with (near-) minimal total travel cost. Our decomposition method that searches in a neighborhood around the known best design, and changes the neighborhood center when improved solution are identified or expands the neighborhood if no better solution is found. Computational results show that our algorithm finds improved solutions, compared to existing approaches, for large-scale networks with imposed limits on computation time. In Chapter 6, we conclude the thesis and provide future research guidance. by Tianli Zhou. Thesis: S.
