40|$|Abstract. The {{self energy}} of geometrically {{necessary}} dislocations (<b>GNDs)</b> <b>in</b> single crystals {{is considered to}} inevitably introduce a higher-order stress as the work conjugate to slip gradient. It is pointed out that this higher-order stress changes stepwise in response to in-plane slip gradient and thus explicitly influences the initial yielding of polycrystals. The self energy of GNDs is then incorporated into the strain gradient plasticity theory of Gurtin (2002). The resulting theory is applied to 2 D and 3 D model crystal grains of diameter D, leading to a D- 1 -dependent term with a coefficient determined by grain shape. This size effect term is verified using published experimental data of several polycrystalline metals. It is thus found that the D- 1 -dependent term is successful for predicting not only the grain size dependence of initial yield stress but also the dislocation cell size dependence of flow stress in the submicron to several micron range of D...|$|R

For this purpose, X-ray diffraction techniques are considered as the pertinent experimental tools. On the modelling side, the composite models of single/multiple slip serve to interpret the experimentally measured long-range internal stresses quantitatively in terms of densities of <b>GNDs.</b> However, <b>in</b> order to be able to deduce from experiment the evolution of those GNDs that are responsible for the observed lattice plane misorientations, the composite model must be refined. Quite generally, one and the same GND array can give rise to both long-range internal stresses and lattice plane misorientations. On this basis, available experimental data obtained on cyclically and tensile-deformed copper single crystals were analyzed quantitatively. The stresses acting locally in the “hard” dislocation cell walls and in the “soft” cell interiors and the magnitude of the internal stresses are found to increase approximately linearly with the applied stress. The density of the GNDs responsible for the long-range internal stresses (and/or for the misorientations) is always found to amount to only a few per cent of the total dislocation density. An analysis of the evolution of the lattice plane misorientations shows that the kink walls and the dislocation sheets/grids in stage II are geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs), whereas the dislocation cell walls formed by multiple slip are incidental dislocation boundaries (IDBs) ...|$|R

L. major parasites are capable of using N-acetylglucosamine and glucosamine as primarily carbon sources and contain key enzymes required for conversion of these sugars to fructose- 6 -phosphate. The last step in this pathway is catalyzed by glucosamine- 6 -phosphate deaminase (GND), which was targeted to glycosomes via a canonical C-terminal targeting signal when expressed as a GFP fusion protein. Mutant parasites lacking GND were unable to grow in medium containing amino sugars as sole carbohydrate source and rapidly lost viability, concomitant with the hyper-accumulation of hexosamine-phosphates.

40|$|International audienceElectron Backscatter {{diffraction}} (EBSD) {{is often}} used for semi-quantitative analysis of dislocations in metals. In general, disorientation is used to assess geometrically necessary dislocations (<b>GNDs)</b> densities. <b>In</b> the present paper, we demonstrate {{that the use of}} disorientation can lead to inaccurate results. For example, using the disorientation leads to different <b>GND</b> density <b>in</b> recrystallized grains which cannot be physically justified. The use of disorientation gradients allows accounting for measurement noise and leads to more accurate results. Misorientation gradient is then used to analyze dislocations boundaries following the same principle applied on TEM data before. In previous papers, dislocations boundaries were defined as Geometrically Necessary Boundaries (GNBs) and Incidental Dislocation Boundaries (IDBs). It has been demonstrated in the past, through transmission electron microscopy data, that the probability density distribution of the disorientation of IDBs and GNBs can be described with a linear combination of two Rayleigh functions. Such function can also describe the probability density of disorientation gradient obtained through EBSD data as reported in this paper.

The latter can occur either via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP) or via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The Embden-Meyerhof pathway is nonfunctional, and a cyclic operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle is prevented by the absence of succinate dehydrogenase. In this work, the cytoplasmic catabolism of fructose formed by oxidation of mannitol was analyzed with a Δgnd mutant lacking the oxidative PPP and a Δedd Δeda mutant devoid of the EDP. The growth characteristics of the two mutants under controlled conditions with mannitol as the carbon source and enzyme activities showed that the PPP is the main route for cytoplasmic fructose catabolism, whereas the EDP is dispensable and even unfavorable. The Δedd Δeda mutant (lacking 6 -phosphogluconate dehydratase and 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy- 6 -phosphogluconate aldolase) formed 24 % more cell mass than the reference strain. In contrast, deletion of gnd (6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase) severely inhibited growth and caused a strong selection pressure for secondary mutations inactivating glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, thus preventing fructose catabolism via the EDP also. These Δgnd zwf* mutants (with a mutation in the zwf gene causing inactivation of the glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase) were almost totally disabled in fructose catabolism but still produced about 14 % of the carbon dioxide of the reference strain, possibly by catabolizing substrates from the yeast extract.

40|$|In {{present day}} VLSI ICs, intra-die {{processing}} variations are becoming harder to control, {{resulting in a}} large skew in the clock signals {{at the end of}} the clock distribution network. In this paper, we describe a novel buffered H-tree technique to distribute the clock signal and to de-skew a clock network. The clock shielding wires (which are connected to <b>GND</b> <b>in</b> normal operation) are, in de-skewing mode, used to selectively return the clock signal for de-skewing, and for serial communication with the clock distribution sites for skew adjustment. Our forward and return clock networks are buffered, with identically sized and co-located wires and buffers. This results in both these networks exhibiting identical delay characteristics in the presence of intra-die process variations. Unlike existing approaches, our method utilizes a single phase detection circuit, and can achieve a very low maximum chip-level clock skew. This skew value is not dependent on the resolution of the phase detector. Further, our technique can be applied dynamically, either at boot time or periodically during the operation of the IC, as necessary. Additionally, our buffered H-tree enables us to implement efficient clock gating by allowing the user to turn off clocks in the distribution network itself, thus disabling entire sections of the clock network. We demonstrate the utility of our technique on a 6 -level H-tree clock distribution network. In a clock distribution network which is initially skewed by up to 300 ps, our technique can de-skew signals to within 4 ps of each other. We show that the total wiring area of our clock distribution and de-skewing methodology is about 35 % higher than a traditional H-tree (which does not have a deskewing functionality), while the active logic area overhead is about 25 %.

At the macroscale, a gradient crystal plasticity model, which incorporates scale-dependence by introducing the density of geometrically necessary dislocations (<b>GNDs)</b> <b>in</b> the expression of mean glide path length, is used. As a case study, bending of micro-sized single crystal beams is considered and the correspondence between the predictions of both models is made. In its current framework, the macroscale model did not capture the experimentally observed effect of specimen size on the initial yield stress. With this effect naturally captured in the corresponding DD analysis, the absence of a density-independent size effect in the expression for the strength of slip systems was concluded. In an independent work on the tensile loading of micrometer-sized polycrystals [1], a size effect, physically rooted in the size and location of Frank Read sources (FRS) relative to grain boundaries, was identified. This effect can be generalized in the context of dislocation interface interactions, typically missing to one degree or another, in current gradient crystal plasticity models and can, in principle, be used to understand the initial yield size-dependence in single crystal bending identified through DD analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compared}} EMG {{activity of}} young tennis players’ muscles during forehand drives in two groups, GD—those {{able to raise}} by more than 150 % the vertical velocity of racket-face at impact from flat to topspin forehand drives, and GND, those not able to increase their vertical velocity to the same extent. Upper limb joint angles, racket-face velocities, and average EMGrms values, were studied. At similar joint angles, a fall in horizontal velocity and a rise in racket-face vertical velocity from flat to topspin forehand drives were observed. Shoulder muscle activity rose from flat to topspin forehand drives <b>in</b> <b>GND,</b> but not for drives in GD. Forearm muscle activity reduced from flat to topspin forehand drives in GD, but muscle activation was similar <b>in</b> <b>GND.</b> The results show that radial deviation increased racket-face vertical velocity more at impact from the flat to topspin forehand drives than shoulder abduction...|$|R
