5000|$|In the 1590s records exist of {{what became}} known as the Upper <b>Forge</b> at Lydbrook built by Thomas Bainham and later owned by Robert Devereux, second Earl of Essex. In 1628 it was {{described}} as standing on [...] "Hangerbury Common, below the King's Forge". By 1668 the Upper <b>Forge</b> had disappeared. Three other <b>forges</b> existed. The Middle <b>Forge</b> built in the 1590s was opposite what is now Beard's bakery building. After the demise of the original Upper <b>Forge,</b> the Middle <b>Forge</b> eventually took on the name of Upper <b>Forge.</b> The Lower <b>Forge</b> was built in 1610 (standing within two hundred yards from the Wye). Standing up-stream from the Upper <b>Forge</b> was the King's Howbrook <b>Forge</b> (also known as the Lydbrook <b>Forge)</b> built in 1612/13. This stood opposite what is now Brook House (was once the Yew Tree Inn). In March 1650 the <b>Forge</b> was demolished. Not far away and built in the same period was the King's Furnace powered by the Lyd (where the How brook joins the Lyd) this ceased by 1674. By the early 18th century only two <b>forges</b> existed, the Upper <b>Forge</b> (the renamed old Middle <b>Forge)</b> and the Lower <b>Forge.</b> In 1702 a further <b>forge</b> existed, although it location is now unknown, the New <b>Forge.</b> This <b>forge</b> was somewhere between the two others as it took on the name of 'Middle Forge'. By 1818 after many changes of hands both owners and tenants, the Partridge family dominated the iron works at Lydbrook. In 1622 there are details of a grist mill and a battering works nearby a disused cornmill. The Lower <b>Forge</b> became in its turn a Corn Mill. Existing also in Lydbrook around the 1690s was an Anvil making works.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in 1985, a group {{including}} astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner {{published a}} series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of Archaeopteryx were <b>forged.</b> Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig {{and others at the}} Natural History Museum in London. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was <b>forged</b> as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of Archaeopteryx known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.|$|E

5|$|Edwards' {{trial was}} in June 1842 {{and was a}} media sensation. He secured a defense team of six lawyers, {{including}} John J. Crittenden, a sitting U. S. Senator, and Thomas F. Marshall, a sitting U. S. Representative. Both Crittenden and Marshall absented themselves from their legislative duties during the trial. One of the junior lawyers was William M. Evarts, who presented the opening remarks for the defense. Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds, who Edwards paid with a <b>forged</b> check. Edwards' handsome appearance worked against him, {{when one of the}} bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks. Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft. A final tie-in was the commonality of misspellings between letters from Edwards and the <b>forged</b> letters. The trial ended with Edwards being convicted and given a 10-year prison sentence. The trial's proceedings were published by a New York newspaper, The Herald, and ran to 50,000 copies. None of Edwards' lawyers were ever paid for their services. He was sent to Sing Sing prison, where he attempted to use <b>forged</b> letters to escape. Edwards died in prison on January 27, 1847, of consumption. He was insane {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second half}} of the 19th century was marked with the {{appearance}} of hydraulic <b>forging</b> presses that started to replace hammers at <b>forging</b> works. <b>Forging</b> in <b>forging</b> presses is carried out by two dies of which one makes reciprocal movements and the other one remains stationary. This is the reason for relatively low productivity and high labour intensity of conventional <b>forging</b> in presses. The <b>forging</b> of low-ductility and hard-to-deform steels and alloys by two dies using conventional <b>forging</b> methods is very difficult and sometimes is practically impossible because of high tensile stresses in deformation zone leading to various <b>forging</b> defects and high percentage of rejected products.In the 1970s the mechanical radial <b>forging</b> machines (RFM) started to be used for the large-scale production of long-axis forgings where a work piece is reduced in radial directions simultaneously by several pairs of dies. The process of radial <b>forging</b> in mechanical RFM features high productivity of <b>forging.</b> However small single reductions of a work piece restricted by the design of these machines lead to localization of strains mainly in surface zones of the work piece while metal in the core zone remains unworked. [...] In 80-90s hydro-mechanical and hydraulic radial <b>forging</b> machines appeared that do not have the disadvantages inherent to mechanical RFM. Nevertheless, radial <b>forging</b> machines are very specific and very expensive equipment in comparison with multipurpose <b>forging</b> presses. The application of such machines at enterprises {{with a wide range of}} forgings manufactured is economically disadvantageous and inexpedient.The problem of manufacturing long-axis forgings by radial <b>forging</b> method in open-die hydraulic <b>forging</b> presses can be solved with use of multi-die <b>forging</b> devices. First such devices different in design and principle of operation appeared in the 1980s. At present, the most widespread and famous is the four-die <b>forging</b> device of the above described design engineered by Ukrainian and Russian scientists. The four-die <b>forging</b> devices have no analogues in the world now. They are successfully used at works in Russia, Ukraine, Spain, China and Germany.|$|R
