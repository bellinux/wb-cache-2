500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it reminds me of a string of wet sponges, <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> tattered washing on the line; <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E

[...] They got {{matching}} tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a [...] "J" [...] on her left ankle. After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006. Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> a great, great period in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E

In the first Test at Johannesburg, playing his first Test in South Africa and batting at 4 {{for the first}} time, Kohli scored 119 and 96. His hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. Regarding Kohli's hundred, South Africa bowling coach Allan Donald said, [...] "The one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. I think he [...] showed great discipline and responsibility. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> Sachin Tendulkar when they came here in 1996." [...] The match ended in a draw, and Kohli was awarded man of the match. India failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second Test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.|$|E
500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} review {{came from}} The Wire, which felt that: [...] "In the end, Vespertine commits its magic by daring to go places more obvious and more human than {{one would have}} ever expected." [...] Calling it [...] "one {{of the most impressive}} and cohesive" [...] albums of the year, Tiny Mix Tapes found Vespertine to be Björk's most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Simon Reynolds, praised it in Uncut saying [...] "Her best yet, <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> the jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa In The Gold Dust Rush, of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie and the Banshees circa A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside." [...] Katy Widder, writer for PopMatters, believed the album was a masterpiece, stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender, particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "Women have seized rock 'n' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes, but we've yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself." [...] Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as [...] "a breath of fresh air." [...] Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer, musicOMH's Michael Hubbard wrote that [...] "It sounds like Björk has grown up while that would be a pity, it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music. She is a legend in her time." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, you immediately notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E

2500|$|American writer George Saunders, {{when asked}} for a {{literary}} influence said [...] "There's a Russian writer named Isaac Babel that I love. I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. <b>It</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> {{the difference between an}} OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel does it for me." ...|$|E

[...] "When I do the dances, <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> my younger years when I was doing similar dances during the Cultural Revolution," [...] a retired driver in her mid-60s told the Los Angeles Times in 2014. [...] "I {{feel the same}} kind of spirit and emotions." [...] Another woman, whose troupe used the [...] "red songs" [...] written during that era, was more political. [...] "The can always remind us what the Chinese leaders did for us to have a good life today and how they fought hard for the ordinary people in China." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, {{the poet}} Fred D'Aguiar (born in London to Guyanese parents) won the T. S. Eliot Prize, and in 1994 won the Whitbread First Novel Award for The Longest Memory. Linton Kwesi Johnson's rhyming and socio-political {{commentary}} over dub beats – including such favourites as [...] "Dread Beat An' Blood" [...] and [...] "Inglan Is A Bitch" [...] – {{made him the}} unofficial poet laureate of the British African-Caribbean community. Another dub poet, Benjamin Zephaniah, born in Birmingham to Jamaican parents, overcame a spell in prison to become a well-known writer and public figure. In 2003 he declined an OBE, stating that {{it reminded him of}} [...] "thousands of years of brutality, <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> how my foremothers were raped and my forefathers brutalised".|$|E

6000|$|... "Dr. John," [...] I began, [...] "Love is blind;" [...] {{but just}} then a blue subtle ray sped {{sideways}} from Dr. John's eye: <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> old days, <b>it</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> his picture: <b>it</b> half led {{me to think that}} part, at least, of his professed persuasion of Miss Fanshawe's naïveté was assumed; it led me dubiously to conjecture that perhaps, in spite of his passion for her beauty, his appreciation of her foibles might possibly be less mistaken, more clear-sighted, than from his general language was presumable. After all it might be only a chance look, or at best the token of a merely momentary impression. Chance or intentional real or imaginary, it closed the conversation.|$|R

2500|$|The Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian {{authorities}} of [...] "blaming" [...] the Russian government {{for all its}} troubles and stated [...] "Ukrainian {{people want to get}} a clear answer from Kiev to all their questions. It's time to listen to these legal claims". It also stated it was [...] "carefully observing" [...] events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for [...] "real constitutional reform" [...] that would turn Ukraine into a federation. In a 7 April opinion piece that appeared in The Guardian, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov wrote that it was Europe and the United States, and not Russia, that was guilty of destabilising Ukraine and that [...] "Russia is doing all it can to promote early stabilisation in Ukraine". The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a stern condemnation of the [...] "criminal order" [...] by Kiev for armed aggression against Donetsk: [...] "The Kiev authorities, who self-proclaimed themselves {{as a result of a}} coup, have embarked on the violent military suppression of the protests," [...] demanding that [...] "the Maidan henchmen, who overthrew the legitimate president, to immediately stop the war against their own people, to fulfill all the obligations under the Agreement of 21 February." [...] Russian president Vladimir Putin compared the siege of the DPR and LPR-controlled cities of Donetsk and Luhansk to the Siege of Leningrad during the Second World War: [...] "Sadly, <b>it</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> World War II, when German fascist forces surrounded our cities, like Leningrad, and shelled population centres and their residents".|$|E
