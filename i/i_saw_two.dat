We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> or three people get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
2500|$|Appearing as a {{prosecution}} witness {{at the trial}} {{of members of the}} unit in 2009, Jefto Jankovic, former investigative judge with the Basic Court in Banja Luka, told how on 23 August 1992, after receiving a call from the Public Safety Station in Banja Luka, he went to Korićanske Stijene to conduct a crime-scene inspection: [...] "We arrived there at about 3pm We saw that the area was rocky, the canyon was about 100 to 300 meters deep. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> piles of corpses {{at the bottom of the}} canyon. The corpses were lying there one on top of the other. It was a frightening scene. It was something I had never seen in my life. As it was impossible to approach them, I asked our crime technician to record it using a video camcorder. This is all that we did during the course of the crime-scene inspection." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went away}} very sick and miserable, {{and as the}} door closed <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> drinking.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's pause. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> {{exchange}} glances. Then Allan {{held out}} his hand.|$|R

2500|$|... “I tied {{a string}} (tied to the wire) to Smoky's collar {{and ran to}} the other end of the culvert [...] [...] [...] (Smoky) made a few steps in and then ran back. [...] `Come, Smoky,' I said sharply, and she started through again. [...] When she was about 10 feet in, the string caught up and she looked over her {{shoulder}} as much as to say `what's holding us up there?' [...] The string loosened from the snag and she came on again. [...] By now the dust was rising from the shuffle of her paws as she crawled through the dirt and mold and I could no longer see her. [...] I called and pleaded, not knowing for certain whether she was coming or not. [...] At last, about 20 feet away, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> little amber eyes and heard a faint whimpering sound [...] [...] [...] at 15 feet away, she broke into a run. [...] We were so happy at Smoky's success that we patted and praised her for a full five minutes.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{causing the}} {{collapse}} of the courtyard wall the explosion also destroyed a building just inside the mosque compound. The mosque sanctuary was damaged slightly and the mosque's turquoise dome remained standing. The blast badly burned many worshippers and the resulting rubble buried others. The mosque’s imam, Sheik Saleh al-Haidari said the bomb was especially deadly as worshippers were just leaving a prayer service. At least 78 were slain and more than 218 were wounded. Six of the slain had lived in a house behind the mosque. Twenty cars outside the mosque were incinerated and twenty-five nearby shops suffered damages from the attack. Imam Haidari went on to say [...] "This attack was planned and carried out by sick souls”, and that though he was not in the mosque at the time, his office and the room above collapsed in the explosion. Karim Abdullah an eyewitness who was headed to pray at the mosques reported [...] "I stopped in shock as I saw the smoke and people on the ground. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> or three men in flames as they were getting out of their car." [...] Gunfire was heard in the area following the explosion. Iraqi state television showed “black smoke billowing above the skyline as people on the street screamed in anguish. …storefronts were crumbled and on fire, {{and more than a dozen}} nearby cars were set ablaze. Residents walked through the area collecting body parts and unrecognizable chunks of flesh.” Many of the casualties were rushed to the nearby Al Kanadi, Al Sadr and Madinat Al Tob hospitals.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{while the}} twins heard the Sun enter. [...] He removed his glowing hot disk from his back and hung it on the wall. [...] "Who has come here today?" [...] he asked the woman. [...] She did not answer. [...] "From above <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> strangers come here," [...] said [...] [...] "Where are they?" [...] The woman {{remained}} silent. [...] "I know that two strangers are here," [...] said , [...] "And I demand {{to know where they}} are." [...] "Two young men did come here," [...] said the woman, [...] "and they claim they are your sons. [...] You have promised me that I am the only woman you see. [...] So whose sons are these?" [...] and she went to the bundle and pulled on the blankets. [...] The twins fell to the floor, and at once grasped the hoop of feathers that Spider Woman had given them. [...] the Sun said, [...] "I will see if you are my sons," [...] and he seized them at once and hurled them against the sharp spikes of white shell on the eastern wall of his house. [...] The twins, holding the , bounced back unharmed. [...] The Sun seized them again and hurled them against the turquoise spikes on his southern wall. [...] Again they held the [...] and bounced back unharmed. [...] "You must survive two more tests," [...] said [...] [...] He took them outside where there was a great sweathouse, and he started a fire to heat the four large rocks within it. [...] While he did this, , the Wind, came up to the twins and whispered [...] "You must dig a tunnel to the outside and hide in it after you have answered his question." [...] The twins dug the tunnel while the Sun prepared the fire, and hid its opening with a stone. [...] The Sun then commanded them to enter the sweatlodge. [...] After a while [...] said, [...] "Is it hot in there?" [...] "Yes," [...] answered the twins, and then they hid in the tunnel they had dug. [...] suddenly poured a great quantity of water {{through the hole in the}} top of the sweatlodge, and when it hit the hot rocks they exploded and hot steam hissed. [...] After {{a while the}} twins crawled back into the sweatlodge. [...] called, [...] "Is it hot in there?" [...] expecting to get no answer. [...] But the twins answered, [...] "Not so hot as before." [...] The Sun opened the door. [...] "Perhaps you truly are my sons," [...] he said. [...] "Come inside, and we will smoke." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's him," [...] said Tom, {{introducing}} a gawky youth with a bundle; and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> those <b>two</b> young men turn their faces to the East.|$|R
6000|$|I felt so {{grateful}} to Agnes, and admired her so! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> those <b>two</b> together, in a bright perspective, such well-associated friends, each adorning the other so much! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very good. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Jang-i-Lat Sahib [the Commander-in-Chief] {{come to a}} big dinner. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him in Creighton Sahib's office. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> {{read the}} white stallion's pedigree.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> faces smiling {{across at}} me--Miss Grant's and Catriona's.|$|E
60|$|As my eyes {{followed}} the direction indicated <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> women {{pacing back and}} forth in an enclosed garden.|$|E
60|$|At midnight, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> faint beams to the north-east, and two {{well defined}} {{parallel}} {{ones in the}} south-west.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was nearly}} home," [...] said she, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you <b>two</b> boys very busy talking, so I {{came all the}} way back to know what it was about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{that there}} can be no manner of doubt. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> vessels foul of each other with my night-glass--and {{seemingly}} both were on fire--as plainly as <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> Vesuvius in a dark night." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{never was}} so happy. I never was so pleased as when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> those <b>two</b> sit down together, side by side.

60|$|Tho. O! Sir, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> great staring saucer eyes, {{enough to}} fright any body {{out of their}} wits.|$|E
60|$|Shaynor {{clutched}} the counter, his handkerchief to his lips. When {{he brought it}} away <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> bright red stains.|$|E

60|$|But I {{was already}} pulling {{out into the}} stream. He {{continued}} to shout after me, and presently <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> joined by Booth, and all watched me in dismay as I made for the opposite shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> cabins in a barge before," [...] {{her husband}} said. [...] "I suppose, miss, the owner {{must have had}} the cabin {{specially}} done up for his own use sometimes, and the crew lived forward." ...|$|R

60|$|One afternoon, as I {{was passing}} the old ladies' house, saw, or thought <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> <b>two</b> men {{carrying}} in a coffin. I was struck with alarm.|$|E
60|$|Beyond me, in the burial-ground, {{standing}} {{together in}} the cold clearness of the lower light, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> women. They were looking towards the tomb, looking towards me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Commander-in-Chief {{observed}} to me, as we turned away: 'He had somebody with him, our friend Ruiz. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> figures for a moment. It was an unobtrusive companion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{the report}} of a {{sanguine}} mother who will not believe that his end is so near; but she is mistaken. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>two</b> days ago. The arrow-head is still rankling in his chest, and he knows himself to be dying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I feared when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> those <b>two</b> red {{spots on}} his cheeks in the evening. I know them well! But how white and thin he looks! I {{want to hear what}} you think of him. My father {{considers}} him fully recovered. Do you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, ma'am, I never should," [...] I answered, for the {{old lady}} was as ugly as possible; and at my saying this the two young ladies began {{screaming}} with laughter, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> great-whiskered footmen grinning {{over the back of}} the carriage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless my eyes deceive me, master, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> dark figures flit {{from that}} clump of bushes, some forty yards away, to those next to them. There they go again!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> cowboys, one evidently {{getting his}} name from his brick-red hair. They were the roistering type, hard drinkers, devil-may-care fellows, packing guns and wearing bold fronts--a kind that the Rangers always called four-flushes.|$|E
60|$|Another curious effect, {{and rather}} absurd mistake, {{resulted}} from the different densities in the super-heated atmosphere which caused this mirage. Fancying that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>two</b> springboks on the horizon I pointed them out to my boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ethel, what {{on earth}} can you mean? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> {{children}} dragging on her, and I thought she would see nothing that was going on, and {{would be glad to}} be released; and I wanted them to go with me and see Meta's gold pheasants." ...|$|R
60|$|The torch {{had been}} {{stuck in a}} socket beside the door, so that its rays {{illuminated}} both the corridor and the cell at the same time. As <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the <b>two</b> warriors disappear I approached {{the entrance to the}} cell, with a well-defined plan already formulated.|$|R
