40|$|We {{report an}} unusual {{presentation}} of a previously healthy three-year-old Chinese girl with a four-week history of apparently unexplained <b>generalized</b> intense <b>itch.</b> She had no past history of atopy or xerosis. Despite the severe itch, she had only minimal scratch marks on her right gluteal region but no flexural involvement. The girl was treated as having scabies and eczema and with oral antihistamines by various dermatologists without much improvement. She subsequently presented to a regional hospital with right hip pain and fever. Radiological and histopathological investigations confirmed {{that she had a}} peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The itch pattern prior to and following chemotherapy, as documented by the DigiTrac wrist-held movement monitor, showed a dramatic reduction of her nocturnal itch. The pattern was also very different from that of atopic dermatitis in that the scratching was of much higher intensity but lower frequency. Intractable pruritus associated with a peripheral T-cell lymphoma has not been previously reported in the pediatric literature. This report serves to alert clinicians of the gold paradigm that in a patient with an unexplained <b>generalized</b> <b>itch,</b> lymphoma and other malignancies must be considered...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} cutaneous field stimulation of C fibers {{for the treatment of}} itchy skin and its effect on peripheral nerve fibers as shown in skin biopsy specimens. DESIGN: We conducted an open-label uncontrolled study of 19 patients with itching. Each patient applied a flexible plate containing electrodes to the itchy area for 20 minutes at a time once daily for 5 weeks to stimulate nerve fibers with a constant current (0. 8 mA). Skin biopsy specimens were collected before treatment {{and at the end of}} treatment and were immunostained for calcitonin gene-related peptide and protein gene product 9. 5. SETTING: University hospital in Lund, Sweden. PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with nostalgia paresthetica or brachioradial pruritus and 3 with <b>generalized</b> <b>itch.</b> INTERVENTIONS: Cutaneous field stimulation and punch biopsies of the itchy skin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual analog scale for assessment of itching and counting the immunoreactive nerve fibers in 3 -mm biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Patients with localized itching experienced a reduction in mean values on the visual analog scale (from 78 % before treatment to 42 % by the end of the fifth week). The number of protein gene product 9. 5 - immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epidermis was reduced by 40 % by the end of treatment compared with baseline values. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous field stimulation is an effective alternative for the treatment of localized itching. The reduction in itching is accompanied by degeneration of the epidermal nerve fibers, as evidenced by the loss of protein gene product 9. 5 immunoreactivity...|$|R

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} {{under the terms of}} Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Background: Although gastrointestinal (GI), respiratory, and dermal symptoms are common, few studies have conducted concurrent and comparative prospective analyses of risk factors for these 3 morbidity outcomes. Methods: We used data from a community-based randomized controlled trial among 277 South Australian families to analyze GI (diarrhea, vomiting), respiratory (sore throat, runny nose, cough) and dermal (rash, <b>generalized</b> <b>itch,</b> dermal infection) symptoms. Results: Log-binomial regression analysis revealed similar risks of GI (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1. 65; 95 % CI, 1. 05 – 2. 58) and respiratory (RR, 1. 68; 95 % CI, 1. 31 – 2. 15) symptoms among childcare/kindergarten attendees. Swimming in public pools/spas in the current or previous week was associated with all 3 symptom complexes, conferring similar risk for each (RR for GI: 1. 33; 95 % CI, 0. 99 – 1. 77; respiratory: 1. 20; 95 % CI, 1. 04 – 1. 38; dermal: 1. 41; 95 % CI, 1. 08 – 1. 85). Pet ownership was not associated with symptoms. Household clustering of GI and respiratory symptoms was common, and clustering of respiratory symptoms correlated with number of individuals per household. Conclusions: This simultaneous examination of risk factors for 3 health outcomes yielded new comparative data that are useful for developing prevention strategies.

40|$|Humans are {{the only}} known {{reservoir}} for varicella-zoster virus, which causes two distinct clinical diseases. Varicella (chickenpox) is the primary infection and results from exposure of a person susceptible to the virus. Recurrences of infection (shingles) result in a more localized phenomenon known as herpes zoster, a common infection among the elderly. The medical significance of varicella-zoster (chickenpox) should be stressed, in {{that there have been}} approximately 250 deaths per year in the United States, even with the availability of the chickenpox vaccine since 1995 (5). Before the availability of varicella vaccine in the United States, almost everyone developed varicella. Thus the cases approximated the birth cohort over time, resulting in an estimated 4 million cases of varicella with approximately 11, 000 hospitalizations in the early 1990 s. For the healthy child, chickenpox mortality is less than 2 per 100, 000 cases. The risk increases by more than 15 -fold for adults. Chickenpox is an acute viral infectious disease that ordinarily manifests as a <b>generalized</b> pruritic (<b>itching),</b> maculopapular rash typically consisting of 250 to 500 lesions with malaise and fever up to 102 °F for 2 to 3 days.

40|$|Sensitization to latex {{seems to}} occur more {{frequently}} in women than in men. Obstetric and gynecological surgical procedures have recently {{been shown to be}} a common setting for latex anaphylaxis. We analyzed all the cases of anaphylactic reactions during 1240 cesarean sections in 2004; the patients were questioned for risk factors and underwent allergy testing for drugs and latex. Four patients had anaphylaxis under spinal anesthesia and in all cases it was due to latex allergy. Reported symptoms included facial edema, profuse sweating, <b>itching,</b> <b>generalized</b> erythematous rash and hypotension. Only one patient manifested a severe reaction which included bronchospasm, dyspnea, tachypnea and anaphylactic shock, requiring orotracheal intubation and epinephrine. Our data showed a high incidence (1 : 310) of intraoperative latex anaphylactic reactions in the one-year study period. This {{may be related to the}} very specific population (all women) in a very specific setting (obstetrics). To prevent anaphylactic reactions during obstetric surgery it is important to identify potential risk factors to include, for example atopy, adverse reactions to foods and latex items. If latex allergy is confirmed or strongly suspected, patients should be managed in a latex-safe environment. Premedication with antihistamines and steroids might be useful to further reduce the risk.

40|$|BACKGROUND Pruritus is {{a symptom}} {{frequently}} caused by dermatologic disorders and internal diseases; it {{can be defined as}} an urgent need of scratching and it can be localized or <b>generalized.</b> <b>Itching</b> is determined by physical or chemical inputs that activate nervous system differently from pain. AIM OF THE STUDY Itching symptom is examined as diagnostic element of internal diseases, especially internistic diseases. The most important internal diseases that can determine itching, their physiopathological mechanisms and therapies are studied with data-related literature and the experience of the author. CONCLUSIONS Internal physician should consider itching as dependent on an internal disease; he should cure the cause of symptom or, if not possible, the symptom itself. Further studies are needed to experience new therapies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Systemic {{reactions}} to inhaled drugs are rare. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, we report the first case of <b>generalized</b> <b>itching</b> related to the use of tiotropium bromide, a long acting inhaled anti-cholinergic agent commonly used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Case presentation A 78 -year-old Caucasian woman was referred to our facility for allergological evaluation. Our patient had been treated twice with tiotropium for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had experienced an allergic reaction with itching. We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled inhalation challenge for our patient with tiotropium and a placebo. Inhalation tests yielded positive results for tiotropium and negative results for the placebo. The results of a skin prick test with tiotropium were negative. Conclusions These findings reveal that tiotropium may elicit immediate skin allergic reactions. The negative result from the skin test suggests that such a reaction is not immunoglobulin E-mediated. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested that individuals whose body-awareness pattern con-centrates {{more on the}} exterior than the interior experience relatively more exterior than interior symptoms when ill. One hundred healthy young college students were used as subjects. The {{hypothesis was}} tested by correlating a Rorschach measure of differential body awareness obtained by utilizing the barrier (Fisher and Cleveland) minus the body-interior (Cassell) score with a subject's symptom pattern. The latter was obtained by use of a self-administered medical history questionnaire concerning the subjects * symptoms during illnesses for 2 years pre-ceding the study. From the questionnaire an index of symptom localization was derived by totaling external symptoms (e. g., <b>itching,</b> <b>generalized</b> muscle pain) and subtracting {{the total number of}} internal symptoms (e. g., heartburn, pain in-side the chest). A. direct relation was found between the body-awareness measure and the symptom index. MX. ix OF us experience illness in a high-ly personal and idiosyncratic fashion. This study proposes to investigate the re-lationship between an individual's sys-tem of attitudes to his body and this ex-perience. It is based upon the assump-tion that in this system spatial relations are of paramount importance. It is as-sumed that every individual develops a psychologic model to demarcate his own body from other physical objects in space.

40|$|Significant factors {{associated}} with severity and outcome of an initial episode of acute urticaria in children Acute urticaria is a common disease in the pediatric emergency department (ED). Many parents seek emergency medical treatment for their children when they experience an initial episode of acute urticaria, especially when these children develop severe clinical presentations, including recurrent <b>itching,</b> <b>generalized</b> wheals, swelling of the lips or eyelids, or shortness of breath. Risk {{factors associated}} with the severity of urticaria have been investigated in adults but have not been adequately addressed in children (1 – 3) especially in children with an initial episode of acute urticaria. Although the results of specific laboratory examinations {{have been shown to}} be predictors of the severity and duration of chronic urticaria(1, 4), rapid useful methods that can be simply applied in a clinic to predict the severity and duration of an initial episode of acute urticaria in children have not been studied. The diagnosis of acute urticaria is usually based on detailed history taking and clinical manifestations, such as the presence of transient, well-circumscribed wheals that involve the upper and mid-dermis. Urticarial lesions can be eva-nescent, disappearing within minutes to hours. Acute urticaria is defined as urticaria that has been present for less than 6 wk (5).

40|$|Background: Scabies {{is highly}} {{prevalent}} in socially disadvantaged communities such as indigenous populations and in developing countries. <b>Generalized</b> <b>itching</b> causes discomfort to the patient; however, serious complications can {{occur as a}} result of secondary bacterial pyoderma, commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) or Staphylococcus aureus. In the tropics, skin damage due to scabies mite infestations has been postulated to be an important link in the pathogenesis of disease associated with acute rheumatic fever and heart disease, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis and systemic sepsis. Treatment of scabies decreases the prevalence of infections by bacteria. This study aims to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between scabies and GAS infections. Methodology/Principal Findings: GAS bacteria were pre-incubated with blood containing active complement, phagocytes and antibodies against the bacteria, and subsequently tested for viability by plate counts. Initial experiments were done with serum from an individual previously exposed to GAS with naturally acquired anti-GAS antibodies. The protocol was optimized for large-scale testing of low-opsonic whole blood from non-exposed human donors by supplementing with a standard dose of heat inactivated human sera previously exposed to GAS. This allowed an extension of the dataset to two additional donors and four proteins tested at a range of concentrations. Shown first is the effect of scabies mite complement inhibitors on human complement using ELISA-based complement activation assays. Six purified recombinan...|$|E
