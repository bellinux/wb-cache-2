25|$|Historically, {{the provinces}} were grouped in three lands: Götaland, being {{southern}} and western Sweden; Svealand being eastern and south-eastern, and Norrland being the entire northern half. The {{names of the}} first two refer to ancient tribes, and the third is a <b>geographical</b> <b>reference.</b> They are still commonly used as geographical references. The boundaries have changed over time, with the most significant in 1658 (the cession of provinces from Denmark-Norway to Sweden) and 1812 (due to the loss of Finland to Russia in 1809). In 1812 some provinces were moved from Götaland to Svealand.|$|E
500|$|Another {{important}} {{theme in}} many of García Márquez's work is {{the setting of the}} village he calls Macondo. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and <b>geographical</b> <b>reference</b> to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, [...] "Macondo {{is not so much a}} place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, and how you want to see it." [...] Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with [...] "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis." [...] This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, [...] "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." [...] makes it [...] "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication." [...] In Leaf Storm García Márquez depicts the realities of the Banana Boom in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies. As well, One Hundred Years of Solitude takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.|$|E

2500|$|In 1772, Galicia was {{the largest}} part of the area annexed by the Habsburg Monarchy in the First Partition of Poland. As such, the Austrian region of Poland and what was later to become Ukraine {{was known as the}} Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria to {{underline}} the Hungarian claims to the country. However, after the Third Partition of Poland, {{a large portion of the}} ethnically Polish lands to the west (New or West Galicia) was also added to the province, which changed the <b>geographical</b> <b>reference</b> of the term Galicia. Lviv (Lemberg) served as capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly Ukrainian, or [...] "Ruthenian", as they were known at the time. In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ruthenians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province.|$|E

The tool provides an easy way to highlight <b>geographical</b> <b>references</b> in an eBook text, map to visualize the <b>geographical</b> <b>references</b> in Google Maps, and save the geotag metadata as a special type of annotation in an eBook document. The tool uses annotations to generate Keyhole Markup Language (KML) files; which are shareable via Google My Places, email, or transfer to other sites such as social media. The geotag annotations provide a user with a toolset to explore geography, imagery and literature associated with <b>geographical</b> <b>references</b> included in eBooks in a seamless and user-friendly manner...|$|R
