25|$|The need {{to raise}} funds to improve and expand {{operations}} {{during the second half}} of 1931 was answered by Abe Cahan, <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social democratic Jewish Daily Forward, the largest Yiddish-language newspaper in the world. Cahan was firmly committed to the importance of the project and he made the newspapers funds freely available, depositing $70,000 on account in the fall of 1931 for the expansion of the station assuming the renewal of its broadcast license. Together with previous and subsequent cash infusions, the Forward had invested $200,000 in WEVD by the end of that year.|$|E

25|$|The Associated Press {{was formed}} in May 1846 by five daily {{newspapers}} in New York City to share the cost of transmitting news of the Mexican–American War. The venture was organized by Moses Yale Beach (1800–68), second publisher of The Sun, joined by the New York Herald, the New York Courier and Enquirer, The Journal of Commerce, and the New York Evening Express. Some historians believe that the Tribune joined at this time; documents show it was a member in 1849. The New York Times became a member shortly after its founding in September 1851. Initially known as the New York Associated Press (NYAP), the organization faced competition from the Western Associated Press (1862), which criticized its monopolistic news gathering and price setting practices. An investigation completed in 1892 by Victor Lawson, <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Daily News, revealed that several principals of the NYAP had entered into a secret agreement with United Press, a rival organization, to share NYAP news and the profits of reselling it. The revelations led {{to the demise of}} the NYAP and in December 1892, the Western Associated Press was incorporated in Illinois as The Associated Press. A 1900 Illinois Supreme Court decision (Inter Ocean Publishing Co. v. Associated Press)—that the AP was a public utility and operating in restraint of trade—resulted in AP's move from Chicago to New York City, where corporation laws were more favorable to cooperatives.|$|E

500|$|California Senator Sheridan Downey {{was first}} elected in 1938. An attorney, he ran unsuccessfully in 1934 for Lieutenant Governor of California as Upton Sinclair's running mate, and had a {{reputation}} as a liberal. As a senator, however, his positions gradually moved to the right, and he began to favor corporate interests. Manchester Boddy, the <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Los Angeles Daily News, was born on a potato farm in Washington state. He had little newspaper experience when, in 1926, he was given the opportunity to purchase the Daily News by a bankruptcy court, but built it into a small but thriving periodical. He shared his views with his readers through his column, [...] "Thinking and Living", and, after initial Republican leanings, was a firm supporter of the New Deal. While the Daily News had not endorsed the Sinclair-Downey ticket, Boddy had called Sinclair [...] "a great man" [...] and allowed the writer-turned-gubernatorial candidate to set forth his views on the newspaper's front page.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{has said}} that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather {{an example of how}} an author [...] "should write about what he knows and write truthfully". Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's {{childhood}} parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated, he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the <b>editor</b> <b>and</b> <b>publisher</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years. Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent. Lee's older brother Edwin was the inspiration for Jem.|$|E

[...] Growing up in Ann Arbor, Pond lived in a house on the current site of the Michigan Union, a building he later designed. [...] His next door neighbor as a child was the noted legal scholar, Thomas M. Cooley. [...] Cooley encouraged the young Pond, who aspired to be an artist, by presenting him with his first art book and by commissioning Pond to draw a set of cartoons of the Cooley family. [...] Pond attended the public schools in Ann Arbor before enrolling at the University of Michigan.|$|E
