50|$|On some projectors, the {{operator}} would be alerted {{to the time}} for a change by a bell that operated when the <b>feed</b> <b>reel</b> rotation exceeded a certain speed (the <b>feed</b> <b>reel</b> rotates faster as the film is exhausted), or based on the diameter of the remaining film (Premier Changeover Indicator Pat. No. 411992), although many projectors do not have such an auditory system.|$|R
50|$|In the two-reel {{system the}} {{projector}} has two reels-one is the <b>feed</b> <b>reel,</b> which holds {{the part of}} the film that has not been shown, the other is the takeup reel, which winds the film that has been shown. In a two-reel projector the <b>feed</b> <b>reel</b> has a slight drag to maintain tension on the film, while the takeup reel is constantly driven with a mechanism that has mechanical 'slip,' to allow the film to be wound under constant tension so the film is wound in a smooth manner.|$|R
50|$|Long {{used for}} home movies before the video camera, this uses double sprocketed 16 mm film, which is {{run through the}} camera, exposing one side, then removed from the camera, the takeup and <b>feed</b> <b>reels</b> are switched, and the film run through a second time. exposing the other side. The 16 mm film is then split {{lengthwise}} into two 8 mm pieces that are spliced to make a single projectable film with sprockets holes on one side.|$|R
50|$|Reel-to-reel or open-reel {{audio tape}} {{recording}} is {{the form of}} magnetic tape audio recording in which the recording medium is held on a reel, rather than being securely contained within a cassette. In use, the supply <b>reel</b> or <b>feed</b> <b>reel</b> containing the tape is mounted on a spindle; {{the end of the}} tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a tape head assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of a second, initially empty takeup reel.|$|R

5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} <b>feed</b> 35mm <b>reels</b> into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|R
50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser <b>feeding</b> first-aid hose <b>reels</b> as well as fire extinguishers. For <b>feeding</b> the hose <b>reels,</b> there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roofâ€”one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.|$|R
5000|$|Offset {{printing}} is {{a commonly}} used printing technique {{in which the}} inked image is transferred (or [...] "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. When used {{in combination with the}} lithographic process, which is based on the repulsion of oil and water, the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier on which the image to be printed obtains ink from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a water-based film (called [...] "fountain solution"), keeping the non-printing areas ink-free. The modern [...] "web" [...] process <b>feeds</b> a large <b>reel</b> of paper through a large press machine in several parts, typically for several metres, which then prints continuously as the paper is fed through.|$|R
5000|$|Many nitrate {{films have}} been {{transferred}} in recent decades to safety stock, and original nitrate prints are generally stored separately to prevent a nitrate fire from destroying other non-nitrate films; the gas they give off also affects the emulsion of safety film. Usually nitrate collections are even split up into several different fireproof rooms to minimize damage to an entire collection should a fire occur in one part. It is normal for a theater today to pass rigorous safety standards and precautions before being certified to run nitrate films; this includes a fireproof projection booth, fire chambers surrounding the <b>feed</b> and take-up <b>reels,</b> and several fire extinguishers built into the projector and aimed at the projector's film gate in case a trigger piece of film fabric ignites. Nitrate film is classified as [...] "dangerous goods", which requires licenses for storage and transportation.|$|R
50|$|Cinema fires {{caused by}} {{ignition}} of nitrocellulose film stock were {{the cause of}} the 1926 Dromcolliher cinema tragedy in County Limerick in which 48 people died and the 1929 Glen Cinema disaster in Paisley, Scotland, which killed 69 children. Today, nitrate film projection is normally highly regulated and requires extensive precautionary measures including extra projectionist health and safety training. Projectors certified to run nitrate films have many precautions, among them the chambering of the <b>feed</b> and takeup <b>reels</b> in thick metal covers with small slits to allow the film to run through. The projector is modified to accommodate several fire extinguishers with nozzles aimed at the film gate. The extinguishers automatically trigger if a piece of flammable fabric placed near the gate starts to burn. While this triggering would likely damage or destroy {{a significant portion of the}} projection components, it would prevent a fire which could cause far greater damage. Projection rooms may be required to have automatic metal covers for the projection windows, preventing the spread of fire to the auditorium. The Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum is one of a few theaters in the world that is capable of safely projecting nitrate films, and regularly screens films to the public.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower system}} largely resembles the two-reel system, except {{in that the}} tower itself is {{generally}} a separate piece of equipment used with a slightly modified standard projector. The <b>feed</b> and takeup <b>reels</b> are held vertically on the axis, except behind the projector, on oversized spools with 12,000 foot (3,660 m) capacity or about 133 minutes at 24 frame/s. This large capacity alleviates {{the need for a}} changeover on an average-length feature; all of the reels are spliced together into one giant one. The tower is designed with four spools, two on each side, each with its own motor. This allows the whole spool to be immediately rewound after a showing; the extra two spools on the other side allow for a film to be shown while another is being rewound or even made up directly onto the tower. Each spool requires its own motor in order to set proper tensioning for the film, since it has to travel (relatively) much further between the projector film transport and the spools. As each spool gains or loses film, the tension must be periodically checked and adjusted so that the film can be transported on and off the spools without either sagging or snapping.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} removal of pharmaceutics present in hospital wastewaters by conventional activated sludge and MBR systems of treatment and under various operating conditions to elucidate the removal mechanism and increasing the efficiency of removal. In this study, laboratory scales was composed to four types of reactors used: Bach reactors, conventional activated sludge, submerged membrane bioreactor and extern membrane bioreactor and all these reactors were <b>feed</b> in <b>reel</b> hospital wastewaters. Different Technical studies and many experiments were affected to develop the MBR systems: the beginning was with biofilm supports media and the attached growth of biofilms in the reactor and the finish by using the powder activated carbon. En general, the reported results show high performance for the MBR with compared to CAS system in treating the basic organic pollutants. Presence the biofilm supports media was very important for high removal of pharmaceuticals compounds from the hospital wastewaters. The presence of the pharmaceutical compounds stimulated the mechanisms of survival higher production of EPS. Fouling potential seems to be linked more closely to polysaccharides than other EPS. In this study, for the first time, was employed the confocal microscopy for qualities and quantities analyses for the EPS in the biologic reactors. Microscopic observations were confirmed the chemical analyses of EPS compounds. In final experiment 21 pharmaceuticals were eliminated from the hospital effluents during the treatment in extern membrane (UF) with modified granular activated carbon. In addition to many biomolucles analyses which study the principals impact of hospital effluents on the microorganismâ€™s especially the bacteria in using different, recent techniques. This study demonstrates by reel conditions the role the developed MBR systems in treating the hospital effluents and its impact direct on the environment. Cette recherche porte sur lâ€™Ã©limination des micropolluants pharmaceutiques des effluents hospitaliers par des procÃ©dÃ©s biologiques classiques (boue activÃ©e) et membranaire. Il est montrÃ© que les systÃ¨mes Ã  membrane, externe ou immergÃ©e, permettent un meilleur traitement, ou une meilleure rÃ©tention, de plus de 50 % des molÃ©cules pharmaceutiques mesurÃ©s. Afin dâ€™amÃ©liorer lâ€™efficacitÃ© des procÃ©dÃ©s membranaires, des supports bactÃ©riens ont Ã©tÃ© ajoutÃ©s dans le bassin biologique permettant de diminuer considÃ©rablement le colmatage. Il est montrÃ© quâ€™une des consÃ©quences de la prÃ©sence de ce garnissage est une diminution globale des EPS produits, donc du colmatage membranaire, et de la rÃ©tention des molÃ©cules pharmaceutiques,. Afin dâ€™augmenter encore lâ€™efficacitÃ© du procÃ©dÃ©, du charbon actif en poudre ou en grain a Ã©tÃ© ajoutÃ© avant la filtration (CAP) ou en sortie de filtration (CAG), permettant une Ã©limination quasi complÃ¨te des molÃ©cules mesurÃ©es. La qualitÃ© des biomasses Ã©puratrices a Ã©tÃ© suivie par microscopie confocale avec marquage fluorescent des exopolymÃ¨res et de la viabilitÃ© cellulaire. Il est montrÃ© que les effluents hospitaliers modifient la structure des flocs et des biofilms, leur composition biochimique, avec une augmentation des concentrations en protÃ©ines extracellulaires, et la rÃ©partition des populations caractÃ©risÃ©es par mÃ©tagÃ©nomique...|$|R
