50|$|The Cultural Radio Station of Boruca, {{founded on}} September 24, 1982, {{operates}} as an informer and cultural preservative for the Brunka people. ICER, a Costa Rican governmental {{organization based in}} San Jos√©, initiated the formation ofthis radio station. The radio broadcast reaches {{the vast majority of}} Costa Ricans living in the southwest region of the country. The station functions as an organizational, developmental, and cultural instrument for the Brunka community. Regarding organization and development for the society, various community groups utilize this <b>information</b> <b>diffuser</b> for distributing knowledge of celebrations and meetings in the town. Culturally, education administrators use the station to broadcast and teach the Brunka language, along with programming cultural programs on the air such as presentations of local legends. The station is designated {{for the use of the}} Brunka people. Consequently, the radio station has worked with most of the community's groups, including the Women's Organization, the Youth Organization (ASJOB), the local EBAIS (primary Costa Rican health care unit), and the local high school. The music played at the station includes a wide variety of genres, ranging from traditional mestizo Latin American music to modern reggaeton.|$|E

This research project, covered in three papers, establishes the diffuser baseline performance and then determines the field installation adjustment values. The first paper covers baseline performance. This paper documents the field conditions difference in throw and pressure loss from ideal conditions of six types of ceiling diffusers, each with three different inlet sizes at three different inlet velocities. The third paper covers differences in sound generation from ideal conditions. Full scale laboratory testing of typical field installation variations was completed with variations in damper installation, duct approach angle, duct type, duct vertical height above the diffuser, and close coupling duct installation. A predictive model was developed and {{used to create a}} set of look-up tables {{that can be used to}} easily predict how the installation configuration would affect diffuser performance compared to published data. The results in this report can be used to determine the corrections for throw and pressure loss for field conditions from baseline results...|$|R
