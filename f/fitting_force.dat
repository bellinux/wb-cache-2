40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel region-based method for extracting useful information from microscopic images under complex conditions. It is especially used for blood cell segmentation and statistical analysis. The active model detects several {{inner and outer}} contours of an object from its background. The method incorporates a local binary fitting model into a maximum regional difference model. It utilizes both local and global intensity information as the driving forces of the contour model {{on the principle of}} the largest regional difference. The local and global fitting forces ensure that local dissimilarities can be captured and globally different areas can be segmented, respectively. By combining the advantages of local and global information, the motion of the contour is driven by the mixed <b>fitting</b> <b>force,</b> which is composed of the local and global fitting term in the energy function. Experiments are carried out in the laboratory, and results show that the novel model can yield good performances for microscopic image analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{model is}} presented as a framework for muscle activation, fatigue, and recovery. By describing the effects of muscle fatigue and recovery in terms of two phenomenological parameters (F, R), we develop a set of dynamical equations to describe the behavior of muscles as a group of motor units activated by voluntary effort. This model provides a macroscopic view for understanding biophysical mechanisms of voluntary drive, fatigue effect, and recovery in stimulating, limiting, and modulating the force output from muscles. The model is investigated under the condition in which brain effort is assumed to be constant. Experimental validation of the model is performed by <b>fitting</b> <b>force</b> data measured from healthy human subjects during a 3 -min sustained maximal voluntary handgrip contraction. The experimental results confirm a theoretical inference from the model regarding the possibility of maximal muscle force production, and suggest that only 97 % of the true maximal force can be reached under maximal voluntary effort, assuming that all motor units can be recruited voluntarily. The effects of different motor unit types, time-dependent brain effort, sources of artifacts, and other factors that could affect the model are discussed. The applications of the model are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Introduction: Recent {{reports in}} {{exercise}} related bone research have shown increased {{bone mineral content}} (BMC) at the femoral neck for prepubescent children participating in exercise programs consisting of repeated drop landings from a height of 61 cm. Increases in BMC from this type of exercise {{are believed to be}} the result of both high rate and magnitude of loading at the proximal femur. However, the dynamic characteristics associated with these landings in children have not been studied. Purpose: To describe the dynamic characteristics of children during landing and to quantify the forces associated with an activity associated with increases in bone mass. Methods: 13 prepubescent children (males= 8, females= 5, age 9. 3 ± 0. 7 years) who had previously completed drop landings over a 7 month period as part of an exercise intervention to increase bone mass participated in this research. Each subject performed 100 drop landings onto a force plate from a height of 61 cm. Ground reaction forces and two-dimensional kinematic data were recorded. Hip joint reaction forces were calculated using inverse dynamics based on a four segment rigid body model. Vertical ground reaction force and displacement data were fit to two single degree of freedom models, the Voigt and standard linear solid (SLS). The goodness of fit was quantified using the standard deviation of the error (SDE) between the experimental and the predicted data. Results: Peak vertical ground reaction forces were 8. 5 ± 2. 2 (mean ± SD) body weights (BW) while hip joint reactions were 6. 0 ± 1. 8 BW. Loading rates for ground reaction forces during initial impact were in excess of 470 BW/s. Across 100 jump trials, ground reaction forces changed significantly for 5 subjects (4 increase, 1 decrease, p< 0. 05) but were unchanged as a group. The SLS and Voigt models replicated the displacement traces well (SDE= 0. 003 m and 0. 001 m respectively). However, in <b>fitting</b> <b>force</b> data, the SLS outperformed the Voigt model (SDE= 580 N and 493 N respectively), but slightly under-predicted peak forces by 13...|$|E

40|$|Variational Level Set (LS) {{has been}} a widely used method in medical {{segmentation}}. However, it is limited when dealing with multi-instance objects in the real world. In addition, its segmentation results are quite sensitive to initial settings and highly depend {{on the number of}} iterations. To address these issues and boost the classic variational LS methods to a new level of the learnable deep learning approaches, we propose a novel definition of contour evolution named Recurrent Level Set (RLS) } to employ Gated Recurrent Unit under the energy minimization of a variational LS functional. The curve deformation process in RLS is formed as a hidden state evolution procedure and updated by minimizing an energy functional composed of <b>fitting</b> <b>forces</b> and contour length. By sharing the convolutional features in a fully end-to-end trainable framework, we extend RLS to Contextual RLS (CRLS) to address semantic segmentation in the wild. The experimental results have shown that our proposed RLS improves both computational time and segmentation accuracy against the classic variations LS-based method, whereas the fully end-to-end system CRLS achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation approaches.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} free energy {{calculations}} in materials science are either computationally expensive, as lambda-integration, or {{based on the}} harmonic approximation and thus only applicable to materials with stable lattices. Thus, a computationally cheap yet highly accurate method with broad applicability is sought after. The objective of this thesis {{is to establish a}} method for one-shot free energy calculations utilizing effective harmonic models, obtained by <b>fitting</b> <b>forces</b> from molecular dynamics simulations. This approach enables extraction of effective harmonic representations of fully anharmonic crystals at finite temperatures. In addition, residual corrections to the free energy are incorporated using free energy perturbation. Three systems are considered, titanium, iron and a dimer. The dimer is studied to highlight general features of harmonic models, whereas iron is considered as a robust test system for verification during method development. Finally, titanium is used as an example for a system with a rich temperature-pressure phase diagram featuring several entropically stabilized phases. lambda-integration and velocity auto-correlation functions serve as reference methods for comparison of the free energy and phonon properties, respectively. Excellent agreement with reference methods is reported for phonon dispersion and free energy in iron. For titanium the approach successfully reproduces the temperature dependence of soft modes. The resulting free energies exhibit larger deviations from the reference data than in iron. An improvement in this work compared to a similar approach recently published is the reduction of the number of parameters enabled by using symmetry properties directly during force matching and the application of free energy perturbation. The proposed model requires only one simulation whereas λ-integration requires typically on the order of ten simulations. Hence, the proposed method reduces the total simulation time with a factor of 10. The approach outlined in this thesis enables accurate free energy calculations for arbitrary crystalline materials at a greatly reduced cost. It is therefore ideally suited for simulations based on electronic structure methods such as density functional theory...|$|R

Eight-een subjects with LLDs ranging from 4. 8 to 22. 2 mm participated in this study. Subject age range was from 20 to 63 years. A force platform was used to obtain ground reaction force data for four conditions. Data were collected prior to fit-ting of the heel lift and after a three-week break-in period.

This work presents a 2 -D FE-analysis of the mechanical stresses due to shrink <b>fitting,</b> centrifugal <b>forces</b> and the magnetic forces in a 4 -pole, 3 -phase synchronous reluctance machine at rated frequency of 50 Hz. The stresses due to shrink <b>fitting</b> and centrifugal <b>forces</b> were computed by solid mechanics method, while the stresses due to magnetic forces were computed using both magnetic field method and solid mechanics method. The total mechanical stress distributions from all stress sources were obtained using a weakly coupled approach. It was found that shrink fitting causes a very large tensile stress at the rotor core and compressive stress in most part of the stator yoke, but have almost no effect at the stator teeth. The centrifugal forces also contribute to the total tensile stress of the rotor core. The magnetic forces have the least effect on the total stress distribution of the machine. The combined stresses obtained are mostly tensile at the rotor core and compressive at most part of the stator yoke, while the stator teeth were under low tensile stress due to the magnetic forces. The presence of flux barriers between flux paths at the rotor core causes large stresses to distribute at the bridge between flux barriers near the fit interface.
