2500|$|By 2010, {{reports in}} the {{orthopaedic}} literature increasingly cited the problem of early failure of metal on metal prostheses in {{a small percentage of}} patients.

Design deficits of some prothesis models, especially with heat-treated alloys and a lack of special surgical experience accounting for most of the failures. Surgeons at leading medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic have reported reducing their use of metal-on-metal implants by 80 percent over the last year in favor of those made from other materials, like combinations of metal and plastic. The cause of these failures remain controversial, and may include both design factors, technique factors, and factors related to patient immune responses (allergy type reactions).

Calcium entry through the CRAC channel is promoted by potassium efflux through the Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 potassium channels. Blockade of Kv1.3 channels in effector-memory T cells by ShK-186 suppresses calcium signaling, cytokine production (interferon-gamma, interleukin 2) and cell proliferation.

50|$|Hypersensitivity is {{an immune}} {{response}} that damages the body's own tissues. They {{are divided into}} four classes (Type I - IV) based on the mechanisms involved and {{the time course of}} the hypersensitive reaction. Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction, often associated with allergy. Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death. Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen.Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or <b>delayed</b> <b>type</b> <b>hypersensitivity)</b> usually takes between two and three days to develop.
