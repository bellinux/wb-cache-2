5|$|American policymakers, {{including}} Kennan and John Foster Dulles, {{acknowledged that}} the Cold War was in <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> a war of ideas. The United States, acting through the CIA, funded {{a long list of}} projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world. The CIA also covertly sponsored a domestic propaganda campaign called Crusade for Freedom.|$|E
5|$|The Welles Declaration {{established}} a five-decade non-recognition of the Baltic states' annexation. The document had major significance for overall U.S. policy toward Europe {{in the critical}} year of 1940. While the U.S. did not engage the Soviet Union militarily in the region, the Declaration enabled the Baltic states to maintain independent diplomatic missions, and Executive Order 8484 protected Baltic financial assets. <b>Its</b> <b>essence</b> was supported by all subsequent U.S. presidents and Congressional resolutions. The Baltic states re-established their independence in 1990–91.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E
60|$|What was {{the great}} world to Mrs. Yeobright? A {{multitude}} whose tendencies could be perceived, though not <b>its</b> <b>essences.</b> Communities were seen by her as from a distance; she saw them as we see the throngs which cover the canvases of Sallaert, Van Alsloot, and others of that school--vast masses of beings, jostling, zigzagging, and processioning in definite directions, but whose features are indistinguishable by the very comprehensiveness of the view.|$|R
50|$|Double steaming, {{sometimes}} called double boiling, is a Chinese cooking technique to prepare delicate food such as bird's nest soup and shark fin soup. The food {{is covered with}} water {{and put in a}} covered ceramic jar and the jar is then steamed for several hours. This technique ensures there is no loss of liquid or moisture (<b>its</b> <b>essences)</b> from the food being cooked, hence it is often used with expensive ingredients like Chinese herbal medicines.|$|R

5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to <b>its</b> <b>essence.</b> If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E

25|$|For Jourdain, the 'modern spirit' {{signified}} {{more than}} a preference for Cézanne over Gérome. Needed was {{a clear understanding of}} one's epoch, its needs, its beauty, its ambience, <b>its</b> <b>essence.</b>|$|E
25|$|A spiritual {{creature}} is wholly simple in <b>its</b> <b>essence.</b> Yet {{there is still}} a twofold composition in the spiritual creature, namely, that of the essence with being, and that of the substance with accidents.|$|E
25|$|Besides Oktar's {{writings}} on Creationism, Oktar also preaches {{a form of}} Idealism. According to Oktar, the existence of physical matter cannot be known, and the essence of matter cannot be touched. Oktar {{does not seem to}} posit the non-existence of matter, rather he posits {{that it is impossible to}} know, contact, or touch <b>its</b> <b>essence.</b> Therefore the outside world, according to Oktar, is unknowable, especially via the senses.|$|E

25|$|Numerous commentaries {{have been}} written on the Bhagavad Gita with widely differing views on the essentials. Vedanta {{commentators}} read varying relations between Self and Brahman in the text: Advaita Vedanta sees the non-dualism of Atman (soul) and Brahman as <b>its</b> <b>essence,</b> whereas Bhedabheda and Vishishtadvaita see Atman and Brahman as both different and non-different, and Dvaita sees them as different. The setting of the Gita in a battlefield has been interpreted as an allegory for the ethical and moral struggles of the human life.|$|E
25|$|Essence is {{a measure}} of a living being's lifeforce. All humans and metahumans start with a value of six (although critters may start with a higher or lower Essence). It powers magic, and as essence fades, so does magical aptitude. Cyberware, bioware, nanotech implants, extreme cases of {{substance}} addiction, and other major changes to a being's body can damage <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> as well. Generally, if a being's essence ever reaches zero, it dies. Cybermancy allows metahumans to survive with an essence rating of zero or less.|$|E

25|$|If {{desire is}} repressed, {{it is because}} every {{position}} of desire, no matter how small, is capable of calling into question the established order of a society: not that desire is asocial, on the contrary. But it is explosive; there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors. Despite what some revolutionaries think about this, desire is revolutionary in <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> — desire, not left-wing holidays! — and no society can tolerate a position of real desire without its structures of exploitation, servitude, and hierarchy being compromised.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita {{is part of}} the Prasthanatrayi, {{which also}} {{includes}} the Upanishads and Brahma sutras. These are the key texts for the Vedanta, which interprets these texts to give a unified meaning. Advaita Vedanta sees the non-dualism of Atman and Brahman as <b>its</b> <b>essence,</b> whereas Bhedabheda and Vishishtadvaita see Atman and Brahman as both different and non-different, and Dvaita sees them as different. In recent times the Advaita interpretation has gained worldwide popularity, due to the Neo-Vedanta of Vivekananda and Radhakrishnan, while the Achintya Bheda Abheda interpretation has gained worldwide popularity via the Hare Krishnas, a branch of Gaudiya Vaishnavism.|$|E

Although his style evolved somewhat {{in the following}} decades, <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> remained the same: his performing group always displayed true elegance. Fresedo {{was one of the}} innovators of tango in the early 1920s, along with such other young musicians of the time as Julio de Caro and Juan Carlos Cobián. All of them brought a high level of musicianship and were thus able to bring about the more refined musical style that characterized the what later became known as the tango of the Guardia Nueva ("New Guard").|$|E

25|$|Qian is {{the active}} ("creative") principle, essence, Yang, and Heaven; Kun is the passive ("receptive") principle, substance, Yin, and Earth. Being {{permanently}} joined {{to one another}} in the precosmic domain, Qian entrusts its creative power to Kun, and Kun brings creation to accomplishment. In the everlasting instant in which Qian and Kun give birth to the cosmos, the Yang of Qian moves into Kun, and, in response, the Yin of Kun moves into Qian. In the symbolic representation by the corresponding trigrams, Qian ☰ entrusts <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> to Kun and becomes Li ☲; Kun ☷ receives the essence of Qian and becomes Kan ☵.|$|E
25|$|Thus, by the {{criterion}} of harmony, Shaftesbury refutes Hobbes, and deduces the virtue of benevolence as indispensable to morality. So also he has drawn a close parallel between the moral and the aesthetic criteria. Just {{as there is a}} faculty which apprehends beauty in the sphere of art, so there is in the sphere of ethics a faculty which determines the value of actions. This faculty he described (for the first time in English thought) as the Moral Sense (see Hutcheson) or Conscience (cf. Butler). In <b>its</b> <b>essence,</b> it is primarily emotional and non-reflective; in process of development it becomes rationalized by education and use. The emotional and the rational elements in the moral sense Shaftesbury did not fully analyse (see Home).|$|E
25|$|In {{the canon}} {{law of the}} Roman Catholic Church, a {{dispensation}} is the exemption from the immediate obligation of law in certain cases. Its object is to modify the hardship often arising from the rigorous application of general laws to particular cases, and <b>its</b> <b>essence</b> is to preserve the law by suspending its operation in such cases. Since laws aimed at {{the good of the}} entire community may not be suitable for certain cases or persons, the legislator has the right (sometimes even the duty) to dispense from the law. Dispensation is not a permanent power or a special right as in privilege. If the reason for the dispensation ceases entirely, then the dispensation also ceases entirely. If the immediate basis for the right is withdrawn, then the right ceases.|$|E
