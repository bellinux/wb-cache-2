40|$|Peridinium acuminatum (Peridiniales, Dinophyceae) was {{described}} {{in the first half}} of the 19 th century, but the name has been rarely adopted since then. It was used as type of Goniodoma, Heteraulacus and Yesevius, providing various sources of nomenclatural and taxonomic confusion. Particularly, several early authors emphasised that the organisms investigated by C. G. Ehrenberg and S. F. N. R. von Stein were not conspecific, but did not perform the necessary taxonomic conclusions. The holotype of P. acuminatum is an illustration dating back to 1834, which makes the determination of the species ambiguous. We collected, isolated, and cultivated Scrippsiella acuminata, comb. nov.

40|$|Since {{the times}} of the Teutonic order until 1923, the Curonian Peninsula {{was a part of}} Prussia, and later – a part of <b>Germany.</b> <b>Baltic</b> tribes’ {{migration}} pro- cesses of different intensity occurred here. In the 16 th century the newcomers from Latvian speaking Courland started to dominate, moving to the spit in several waves up to the 18 th century; at the same time, people from the continental part (the majority of them were Germanized Prussians), colonizers from other German lands, and Lithuanians from the Klaipeda area settled in the region. The Kursenieku language, also known as New Curonian (German Nehrungskurisch) can be categorized as a mixture of Latvian Curonian dialects with Lithuanian, German, and elements of the now extinct Old Prussian. Since it had no written form, Kursenieku was roofed by Lithuanian and later by German, which had functioned as languages of religion and education for a long time. The community disintegrated at the end of World War II. After the Kursenieki community left their homeland and settled in different towns and villages of Germany, there was no practical use for the maintenance of Kursenieku. The chronological reconstruction of the Kursenieku is possible and useful for the Baltic studies; however, there is no motive for revitalization: nowadays, there is no community willing to use this language. This article briefly presents the development of the Kursenieku language in its ethnocultural context. Moreover, it raises the discussion around its status (variety or language), provides its sociolinguistic characteristics, describes the work that has been done with the language, and presents urgent goals and research perspectives.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} already {{happening}} and {{represents one of}} the greatest environmental, social and economic threats facing the planet. The main cause of climate change or global warming effects {{is believed to be the}} accumulation of manmade carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas in the atmosphere. Discharge of CO 2 into the ocean is considered as a possibility to reduce CO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. Creation of liquid CO 2 lakes on the sea bottom and disposal of liquid CO 2 in sediments of the deep ocean, including formation of hydrates are amongst the scenarios discussed for accurate, economically effective, and safe CO 2 storage. The rationale of this work is to characterize a natural analogue for proposed scenarios of CO 2 deposition in the ocean, which offers. Natural examples of carbon dioxide and water interactions, with its gaseous, liquid and solid hydrate phases. Hydrothermal vents, often associated with mid-ocean-ridge systems, often release CO 2 -rich fluids into the ocean and can be used to study CO 2 behavior and effects. One of the most unique areas for this kind of field studies is the Okinawa Trough, which hydrothermal sites, rich in carbon dioxide and emitting even condensed, liquid CO 2, might be ideally suited for the investigation of deliberate carbon dioxide ocean disposal and storage. The main scientific problem of this work is the investigation of complicated mechanisms controlling gas fractionation of hydro-thermally derived natural gas emissions and gas hydrate formation in the area of Okinawa Trough, driven by the observation of large differences of the composition of gas emissions immediate vicinity. This work is based on data gathered during a joint research expedition of the German Research Vessel SONNE in March 2008, with partners from the National Institute of Advanced Science and Technology Tsukuba (Japan), IFM-GEOMAR (Kiel, <b>Germany),</b> <b>Baltic</b> Sea Research Institute Warnemünde (Warnemünde, Germany), JAMSTEC Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (Japan) and others. The majority of calculations were produced using the INFOCHEM Software Multiflash, Version 3. 1. 27 (Infochem Computer Service Ltd.). Multiflash is an advanced software package for performing equilibrium calculations. Based on Multiflash calculations, an analysis of different compositions of hydrothermally derived natural gas emissions, from pure carbon dioxide to pure methane was performed. Gas fractionation calculations were performed for gas mixtures under high-temperature conditions, related to seismic activity, as well as under conditions related to extreme cooling on the contact boundary with ambient sea water. Another problem addressed in this work is the estimation of thermodynamic conditions of different phase transitions – including gaseous, aqueous, liquid, and solid hydrate phases – related to different initial ratio of CO 2 and CH 4 in the gas mixture. Data and information about phase behavior of carbon dioxide in seawater and gas fractionation processes calculated in this work can be an important base for the research of future scenarios for industrial carbon dioxide storage in the ocean environment...|$|E

50|$|Other than emotional, {{ethical and}} {{historical}} reasons, {{there are also}} strategic and economic interests in the return of Kaliningrad to Germany, as it would further strengthen <b>Germany's</b> <b>Baltic</b> economy.

The economical factor, such as the estimated cost of return, remains one of the main arguments against a return, as well as the potential price.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} the Baltic {{policy of}} united Germany from the 1990 s until today. The authors {{set out to}} identify the significance of German-Baltic relations {{and the role of}} the Eastern policy in Russian-German relations. The method of dynamic comparison between the political and economic narrative in intergovernmental relations makes it possible to identify distinctive features of <b>Germany’s</b> <b>Baltic</b> policy in the context of current international relations. In particular, it is noted that Germany was most active in the Baltic region in the 1990 s, when the country was establishing political, economic, and cultural ties with the new independent states. In the second half of the 1990 s, Germany’s foreign policy became less intense. After the accession of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia to the EU and NATO in 2004, certain disagreements started to arise between <b>Germany</b> and the <b>Baltics.</b> It explains the lukewarm relations between them. The Ukraine events brought about a change in Germany’s regional policy. Despite Russia remaining one of the key economic and political counteractors, Germany, being a partner of the Baltics in the EU and NATO, cannot adopt a neutral position in the conflict of interests between the Baltics and Russia. ...|$|R
