5000|$|The {{government}} {{is seeking to}} change the law to prevent 'third parties’ from bringing cases where they are not directly impacted by the proposal. Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the business community to get behind these changes, saying “if the Adani mine does not go ahead soon, we are crazy.” Radio broadcaster Alan Jones, on many issues a supporter of the Liberal Government, has launched a TV ad, stating [...] "I may live nowhere near the Liverpool Plains or the Great Barrier Reef.

5000|$|One early {{article on}} {{her was the}} October 1952 Saturday Evening Post Article, [...] "The Loneliest Woman in America" [...] by Andrew Hamilton.

As Molter once observed, [...] "If I had been the loneliest woman in America, by the time all of those writers and TV people came up here, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> heck wouldn't have been" [...] Through a combination of her remote location and BWCAW wilderness restrictions against motors and motorized travel, Molter's home was amongst the most isolated in the country. The nearest road required 15 miles of travel by water and five portages over land to reach. [...] It typically took approximately 1½ days of travel from her home to reach the nearest road, and her home was approximately 36 mi from the nearest (small) town.|$|E
5000|$|I {{took notes}} on every choir and {{every piece of}} music, and as I look back in my Symposium program booklet there’s only one page that has the word 'Wow!' written across the top.

But the San Miguel Master Chorale came onstage last night and blew the doors down. Thirty-eight voices with all the polish and sophistication of Dale Warland Singers, but with repertoire and vocal techniques that tap deep Filipino tribal roots. Fabulous odd rhythms, guttural chants, exotic prayer calls - all of this interwoven into the most beautiful bel canto singing a Western ear ever wanted to hear. They’re the nugget of gold I found here in Kyoto and that I’ve dropped in my pocket as I turn and head for home. Brian Newhouse ...|$|E

5000|$|During Asgard's siege, Moonstone is seen helping Osborn defeat Thor. She is seen {{being chased}} {{away from the}} scene by Maria Hill. Moonstone turns {{intangible}} to avoid the bullets. Moonstone is one of the on-lookers when Sentry tears Ares in half. Moonstone is standing besides Osborn when the New Avengers, Young Avengers, and Nick Fury led by Steve Rogers arrive to assist the Asgardians. Rogers hits Osborn with the shield as Karla retreats back, prompting her to say [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> @#$% saw this coming!". Karla engages in personal combat with Carol. Karla wins the exchange when Osborn interferes into the fight by blasting Danvers with an energy beam in the back. When Osborn is defeated by Rogers and Tony Stark, and reverts to the Green Goblin persona, Karla and Bullseye are seen in the distance. Both of them come to the realization {{that it would be a}} good time to leave the battle.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, the Bruins {{finished}} {{first in the}} League with Esposito and Orr shattering scoring records, but they lost {{in the first round}} to the Canadiens, who {{went on to win the}} Stanley Cup, in seven games. Late in the 1970-71 regular season, Montreal traded for veteran Frank Mahovlich and called up rookie goaltender Ken Dryden; the Bruins had not faced Dryden in the last two regular season meetings with the Habs and he would become a surprise playoff starter who made miraculous saves on the Bruins. Notably in Game 2, the Bruins blew a 5-1 lead and lost 7-5. Bobby Orr had a hat-trick at the Forum in Game 4 to even the series. The Bruins dominated 7-3 in Game 5, but the Habs responded with an 8-3 victory in Game 6 and a 4-2 win in Game 7 to knock out the heavily favoured Bruins. Sportswriter Cam Cole wrote of the series, [...] "Where the whole world stopped for the Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens in the spring of 1971, and my heart was crushed by the evil Habs. If I didn’t actually cry, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>as</b> hell felt like it. It seemed at least unfair, and possibly illegal, that anyone should be able to stop as magnificent a creature as Bobby Orr—let alone Phil Esposito and Johnny Bucyk and the rest—with some college-boy goalie Dryden." [...] Cole opioned [...] "there is no scale to measure the visceral abhorrence I harboured for the Canadiens, how badly I wanted Orr to win in '71."http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/hockey/calgary-flames/Bobby+Great/8128247/story.html This ended a potential Bruins dynasty, though the Bruins would win the Stanley Cup the following year against the New York Rangers, who had earlier knocked out the Canadiens in the opening round of the playoffs.|$|E
