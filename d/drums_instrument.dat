5000|$|There are two {{different}} kinds of drum instruments in GarageBand. The touch <b>drums</b> <b>instrument</b> includes seven acoustic drum kits (Bluebird, Classic Studio Kit, Live Rock Kit, Retro Rock, Roots, SoCal, and Vintage Kit) with a realistic set up, and three electronic drum kits (Hip Hop drums, House drums, and a drum kit with Roland TR-808 and 909 samples). These were set up like drum machines with customizable sounds that can be saved as separate drum kits. The other drum instrument is the [...] "Smart Drums" [...] instrument, in which the drum sounds are arrangable on a grid by complexity and volume. It contains the Classic Studio Kit, Live Rock Kit, Vintage Kit, Classic Drum Machine, Hip Hop Drum Machine, and House Drum Machine. The Chinese Kit was added to GarageBand, along with other Chinese instruments. The user could play genuine Chinese sounds like the gong.|$|E
40|$|Title: Playing-related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders in drummers Objectives: The {{aim of this}} study is to collect literature resources focusing on the field of performing arts medicine in musicians with a special focus on drummers. The main focus will be directed on the therapeutic, preventive, educational and ergonomic influence of musculoskeletal disabilities. Methods: This is a literature review, written mainly from foreign sources in English. Electronic databases like Pubmed, Pedro, Science Direct, Springer and Wiley were used. Special attention was given to studies that describe health problems of musicians associated with playing <b>drums.</b> <b>Instrument</b> ergonomics, prevention and education in this field is also described. Results: 128 studies corresponded to the entry criteria. 88 of these studies were devoted to health problems of playing a musical instrument in general, 5 studies were directly addressing particular health risks associated with playing drums. Another 11 studies were describing percussionists within a larger sample of musicians. Conclusion: There are not many studies dealing with health issues associated with playing the drums. Their authors are often speaking from personal experience. On the internet, there is a number of websites containing information about the most common ailments [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Audio source {{separation}} {{has potential}} for assisting {{the identification of}} individual instruments in a musical recording. To compare three current source separation algorithms, we used an online survey, in which participants judged their relative success by listening. The best performing algorithm was non-negative matrix factor 2 -d deconvolution (NNMF 2 d), which was ranked the highest 57 % of the time for mixtures consisting of two instruments. Average harmonic structure modelling (AHSM) was ranked highest 38 % of the time. However, projected gradient methods for non-negative matrix factorization (PNMF) performed poorly. The NNMF 2 d algorithm was then applied to a musical instrument pair classification problem by extracting features from the separated sources of excerpts from a commercial song collection, and compared with classification using features that don’t involve source separation. While using features from sources separated with the NNMF 2 d algorithm resulted in a minimum of 73 % for sensitivity and precision values for the bass and <b>drums</b> <b>instrument</b> category, the overall accuracy was close to half of that obtained when the sources were not separated. However, it is uncertain whether the algorithm labels sources consistently, so other classification methods may be more successful with the data. 1...|$|E

40|$|For the {{semantic}} analysis of polyphonic music, such as genre recognition, rhythmic pattern features (also called Beat Histogram) can be used. Feature extraction {{is based on}} the correlation of rhythmic information from <b>drum</b> <b>instruments</b> in the audio signal. In addition to <b>drum</b> <b>instruments,</b> the sounds of pitched instruments are usually also part of the music signal to analyze. This can have a significant influence on the correlation patterns. This paper describes the influence of pitched instruments for the extraction of rhythmic features, and evaluates two different pre-processing methods. One method computes a sinusoidal and noise model, where its residual signal is used for feature extraction. In the second method, a drum transcription based on spectral characteristics of drum sounds is performed, and the rhythm pattern feature is derived directly from the occurrences of the drum events. Finally, the results are explained and compared in detail...|$|R
