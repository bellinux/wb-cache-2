5|$|The {{positions}} {{specific to}} punt plays are the punter (P), long snapper, and gunner. The long snapper snaps the football {{directly to the}} punter, who then drops and kicks it before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the punt returner (PR) – the player that catches the punt.|$|E
5|$|The girl can {{stabilize}} wobbling dishes {{by pressing}} {{the button on}} the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ground, and a new one appears {{at the top of}} the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|Asylum {{digitally}} created {{weapons for}} various scenes. In {{the scene in}} which Nolan is killed suddenly by {{a shot in the}} head from Jason's arrow, Asylum created the arrow in post-production. Another scene involved Jason hurling a hatchet at Lawrence as he runs away, striking him in the back. The shot of a hatchet flying through the airin one instance appearing in the same frame as the actorwould be too difficult to achieve practically. Asylum rendered a complete 3D model of the hatchet then inserted the model into the frames leading up to the frame in which <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> character in the back. One of the final images added by Asylum was for Trent's death scene. Here, Asylum digitally created a metal spike that bursts through Trent's chest as Jason slams him onto the back of a tow truck.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} FFR attack, Poison Kiss, has her blow a large heart-shaped kiss at {{the opponent}} that travels in a sine wave path. If it connects, a quick peep show of Poison in several erotic poses is displayed, and afterwards the opponent is shown stunned with hearts dancing over their head. Defeating an opponent with this attack results in Poison doing a pole dance for her win pose, with her whip {{serving as the}} pole. Though not playable in the beta test of Capcom Fighting All Stars, promotional material released by Capcom for the title show that this move would have been retained for her gameplay. However, in Ultra Street Fighter IV, her Poison Kiss follows up with several slaps and a groin kick when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> opponent, similar to her Cross Art move from Street Fighter X Tekken.|$|E
5|$|Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer {{discuss the}} {{situation}} and Kramer urges Jerry {{to do something about}} it, but Elaine argues that Rava will no longer let her edit her book if Jerry does this. Jerry calls Ray and has lunch with him, while George sits in the next booth and eavesdrops on their conversation. Jerry and George asks him about the statue, but Ray gets offended and leaves when he hears their opinion. Elaine and Rava get into an argument about Jerry's accusation, and Elaine is no longer allowed to edit Rava's book. Without notifying anybody, Kramer dresses up in Irving's old clothes and goes to Ray's apartment, pretending to be a cop, and recovers the statue, despite Ray's protests. Kramer returns the statue to a grateful George. But while George is holding the statue, Kramer gives him a friendly pat on the back, causing George to drop the statue, which breaks when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> floor. The episode ends without ever revealing whether or not Ray had in fact stolen the statue from Jerry's apartment.|$|E
5|$|Mulder uses a {{government}} source {{to find a}} secret T3 line in Fairfax County, Virginia, one that the AI uses to access the Internet. He also finds the trailer that {{is connected to the}} T3 line. Meanwhile, Esther forces Scully to drive to David's house. However, they find that the house has been destroyed. Esther admits that she and David had been planning to transfer their consciousness into cyberspace to enter the AI. Gelman, however, thought the idea was too dangerous. Esther also admits that she and David were in love, and were having an affair behind Gelman's back. Meanwhile, Mulder finds much computer hardware inside the trailer. He also finds David’s dead body, with a virtual reality helmet on his head. Suddenly, Mulder is constrained by moving cables and wires, and experiences a strange vision in which he is in a hospital where nurses threaten to amputate his limbs unless he reveals Kill Switch's location. Meanwhile, the AI locates Scully and Esther driving near a swing bridge. They become trapped on the bridge after the AI manipulates its drawing mechanism, causing Scully to persuade Esther to throw the laptop into the water. Just as <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> water it is destroyed by the defense satellite's laser strike.|$|E

25|$|If {{the ball}} {{goes over the}} goal line or touchline, hits the ceiling, or the play is stopped by the referee, the ball is out of play.

25|$|Philadelphia (or corkscrew): A shot played diagonally upwards {{into the}} front corner hitting the front wall first and then the side wall. The ball then lobs over the court with {{significant}} spin. Ideally <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> opposite side wall at the back and travels parallel to the rear wall making a return very difficult. This shot is a favourite in exhibition squash but is susceptible to being volleyed.|$|E

25|$|For {{advanced}} users, {{many of the}} engine's limitations have workarounds. One can approximate gravity's {{effect on}} a monster by defining a heavy diagonal path; the monster will move horizontally until it reaches a ledge, at which point it will fall until <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> ground again. Similarly, although monsters lack hit counters, the user can create chains of identical (or successively injured-looking) monsters to approximate the same effect.|$|E
25|$|Skid boast: A shot played {{from the}} back corners of the court where the ball is hit high along the {{sidewall}} with a small angle so that <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> sidewall first, then hits high {{in the middle of}} the front wall continuing to cross the court while high in the air ideally hitting the opposite sidewall and landing close to the backwall to go past the opponent. As with the Philadelphia it is susceptible to being volleyed.|$|E
25|$|The modern {{shoreline}} {{is composed}} of basalt lava flows. In the south, near Duluth, other materials, such as slate, greywacke and sandstone, are found a short distance inland; however in the north, the entire bedrock made of basalt and gabbro is exposed in patches miles from shore. When the bedrock hits {{the surface of the}} lake at a shallow enough angle, the beach is covered with washed up rocks. When <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> lake at a steep angle, it breaks off and makes sharp cliffs ending at the lake.|$|E

25|$|Seam bowling is the act {{of using}} the seam of the ball to cause the ball to bounce in an {{unpredictable}} fashion when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> pitch. A good batsman {{will be able to}} predict where a ball is going to bounce and from that work out what height the ball will be when it reaches him or her. By generating variations in bounce, the bowler can make it more likely the batsman will make a mistake in his assessment of the ball and give away their wicket.|$|E
25|$|First, a ray {{is created}} at an {{eyepoint}} and traced through a pixel {{and into the}} scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on {{the colors of the}} first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.|$|E
25|$|A ball {{rotating}} {{around the}} seam will move either {{right or left}} when <b>it</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> pitch, depending on which way the ball is spinning. A ball bouncing to the right {{is said to be}} an off cutter as it is travelling from off stump to leg stump for a right-handed batsman. Conversely, a ball that bounces to the left is a leg cutter, travelling from leg to off stump for a right-handed batsman. Cutters are usually aimed so that they hit the pitch just outside the batsman's off stump and move away from the wicket. This will cause the ball to catch the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips.|$|E
