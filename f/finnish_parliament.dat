5|$|November 1917 saw {{the second}} {{turning point in}} the 1917–1918 rivalry for the {{leadership}} of Finland. After the dissolution of the <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament,</b> polarization between the Social Democrats and Conservatives increased dramatically, including political violence.

5|$|Environmental {{assessment}} of four sites occurred in 1997–98, Posiva chose the Olkiluoto site near two existing reactors, {{and the local}} government approved it in 2000. The <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament</b> approved a deep geologic repository there in igneous bedrock {{at a depth of}} about 500 meters in 2001. The repository concept is similar to the Swedish model, with containers to be clad in copper and buried below the water table beginning in 2020. An underground characterization facility, Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository, was under construction at the site in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The monarchists {{leaned on}} the Swedish regime's year 1772 monarchist constitution, belittled the Declaration of Independence 1917 and {{proposed}} a modernized monarchist constitution for Finland. The republicans argued that the 1772 law, accepted by Russia in 1809, lost validity in the February Revolution, the might of the Russian Czar was assumed by the <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament</b> on 15 November 1917 and Finnish republic was accepted on 6 December. The republicans were able to postpone processing of the monarchists' proposal in the parliament, {{and in the end}} a new monarchist constitution was not accepted in Finland. The monarchists responded by applying directly the 1772 law to select a new monarch for the country.|$|E

5|$|During German-Finnish {{negotiations}} Finland {{had demanded}} to remain neutral unless the Soviet Union attacked them first. Germany therefore sought to provoke the Soviet Union into {{an attack on}} Finland. After Germany launched Barbarossa on 22 June, German aircraft used Finnish air bases to attack Soviet positions. The same day the Germans launched Operation Rentier and occupied the Petsamo Province at the Finnish-Soviet border. Simultaneously Finland proceeded to remilitarize the neutral Åland Islands. Despite these actions the Finnish government insisted via diplomatic channels that they remained a neutral party, but the Soviet leadership already viewed Finland as an ally of Germany. Subsequently, the Soviets proceeded to launch a massive bombing attack on 25 June against all major Finnish cities and industrial centers including Helsinki, Turku and Lahti. During a night session {{on the same day}} the <b>Finnish</b> <b>parliament</b> decided to go to war against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The White Guards {{executed}} Red Guard {{and party}} leaders, common Red troopers, socialist {{members of the}} <b>Finnish</b> <b>parliament</b> and local Red administration, and those active in the Red terror. The level of killings varied over the months as they conquered southern Finland, and initially did not encounter marked resistance in White Finland. The comprehensive White terror started with the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918, increased constantly, culminated {{in the end of}} the war and ceased soon after the enemy had been sent to the prison camps. During the peak of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White terror hit strong against the Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the aftermath of the Battle for Viipuri.|$|E

25|$|Previously, {{in return}} for {{critically}} needed food and defense materiel from the Germans, President Ryti had personally committed, in writing, that no separate peace with the Soviets would be attempted. Accordingly, {{it became clear that}} he must resign, paving the way for a separate peace. Finland's military leader Mannerheim was appointed president in an extraordinary procedure by the <b>Finnish</b> <b>parliament.</b> In agreeing to take office, he accepted responsibility for ending the war.|$|E
25|$|In January 1944, Soviet forces {{raised the}} Siege of Leningrad {{and drove the}} German Army Group North to the Narva-Lake Ilmen-Pskov line.

25|$|Most modern Finnish historians {{deny that}} most communists wanted a violent coup, {{especially}} not without Soviet support. Later {{in the spring}} when the <b>Finnish</b> <b>parliament</b> passed a no-confidence motion against Communist Interior Minister Leino because of controversy over Leino's treatment of some mostly White Russian emigrant prisoners whom he had ordered deported to the Soviet Union, Paasikivi had to dismiss Leino when he refused to resign at once. After the 1948 parliamentary elections, when the communists dropped from the largest to the third largest party, Paasikivi refused to let them into the government; and the communists remained in opposition until 1966.|$|E
25|$|The Whites {{launched}} their decisive attack on 27 April at 12 noon. It {{was preceded by}} hours of artillery fire, which destroyed the Patterinmäki Fort and the working-class neighbourhood of Kolikkoinmäki. The conscripts were now mostly replaced by White Guards who had been fighting at the Karelian Front and White Army soldiers from the Savo Front. On the night of 27–28 April, a group of Reds entered the Vyborg Prison, where leading Whites had been kept for several weeks. After hours of heavy drinking, they shot more than 30 prisoners. Among the victims were {{two members of the}} <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament,</b> Leander Ikonen and Matti Pietinen.|$|E
25|$|According to the Moscow Armistice, {{signed by}} Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try {{those who were}} {{responsible}} for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The <b>Finnish</b> <b>parliament</b> had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|He was not {{a member}} of the {{cabinets}} during the Winter War or the Continuation War. In March 1940, in a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament,</b> he voted against the Moscow peace treaty. During the Continuation War, Kekkonen served as director of the Karelian Evacuees' Welfare Centre from 1940 to 1943 and as the Ministry of Finance's commissioner for coordination from 1943 to 1945, tasked with rationalising public administration. By that time, he had become one of the leading politicians within the so-called Peace opposition. In 1944, he again became Minister of Justice, serving until 1946, and had to deal with the war-responsibility trials. Kekkonen was a Deputy Speaker of the Parliament 1946–1947, and was Speaker from 1948 to 1950.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the February Revolution in Russia, Finland received a new Senate, and a coalition Cabinet with the same power distribution as the <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament.</b> Based on the general election in 1916, the Social Democrats had a small majority, and the Social Democrat Oskari Tokoi became prime minister. The new Senate was willing to cooperate with the Provisional government of Russia, but no agreement was reached. Finland considered the personal union with Russia to be over after the dethroning of the Tsar—although the Finns had de facto recognized the Provisional government as the Tsar's successor by accepting its authority to appoint a new Governor General and Senate. They expected the Tsar's authority to be transferred to Finland's Parliament, which the Provisional government refused, suggesting instead that the question should be settled by the Russian Constituent Assembly.|$|E
25|$|A {{nationalist}} at heart, Kekkonen's ideological roots lay in {{the student}} politics of newly independent Finland and in the radicalism of the right-wing. He joined the Academic Karelia Society (Akateeminen Karjala-Seura), an organisation favouring Finland's annexation of East Karelia, but resigned from it in 1932 along with over 100 other moderate members because of the organisation's support for the 1932 far-right Mäntsälä rebellion. According to Johannes Virolainen, a longtime Agrarian and Centrist politician, some Finnish right-wingers hated and mocked Kekkonen for the decision and cast him as a power-hungry opportunist. Kekkonen chaired Suomalaisuuden Liitto, another nationalist organisation, from 1930 to 1932. In 1933, Kekkonen joined the Agrarian League (later renamed the Centre Party) {{and in the same}} year also became a civil servant at the Ministry of Agriculture. During his time there Kekkonen made his first unsuccessful attempt at getting elected to the <b>Finnish</b> <b>Parliament.</b>|$|E
