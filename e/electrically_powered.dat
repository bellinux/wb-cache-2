5|$|On 9 February 2001, Space Shuttle Atlantis docked to the ISS, {{bringing}} the five American crew members of STS-98 temporarily to the station.

Astronauts Thomas D. Jones and Robert L. Curbeam helped with the installation during a spacewalk. The Destiny module had a cost of US$1.4billion, and would be used primarily for scientific research. During the spacewalk an ammonia coolant leak created a contamination scare, which happened when Curbeam was hooking up coolant lines to Destiny. The other two spacewalks went ahead without any problems.

We find that when measured <b>electrically,</b> <b>power</b> networks appear to have a scale-free network structure. Thus, unlike previous studies of the structure of power grids, we find that power networks have a number of highly-connected “hub” buses.

FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a radio altimeter.

For overcoming such miniaturization bottleneck {{in the case of}} implants for electrical stimulation, we recently proposed and demonstrated a method based on making the implants operate as rectifiers of bursts of high frequency current supplied by remote electrodes. In this way, low frequency current is generated locally around the implant and this low frequency current performs stimulation of excitable tissues whereas the high frequency current only causes innocuous heating. The present paper reports further progress in this technology. We first describe construction an...|$|R
