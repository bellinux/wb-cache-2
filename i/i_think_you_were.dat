6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Gascoyne. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> right, {{and again}} I am much obliged to you. Will {{you take me}} to Mrs. Hatherly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do; and {{you will}} pardon me if I say {{improperly}} so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> wrong in suffering Jane {{to go with him}} this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are right}} there, Mr. Graham. I must {{say you are}} right there. Under all the {{circumstances}} of the case <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> right to wish to leave us." ...|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. Gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> both forgetting yourselves.|$|R
60|$|Brain. What, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in a dream}} too, brother Limberham.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one knows}} what will happen but God. Our lives are in His hands. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to be His {{instrument}} in saving us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite safe, dear. She is not hurt, and won't {{even take}} cold, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> so {{sensible}} in covering and getting her home quickly," [...] replied her mother cheerfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "As for the scalps, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> right enough, my worthy friend; {{but as for}} the {{armament}} and the stores, {{they would}} have been condemned by any prize-court in Christendom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> rather unfairly {{treated by}} the PRESENT, I {{certainly}} do. Writing a heavy review like that upon an elegant trifle like the COURT OF KELLYON CASTLE was absurd.' ...|$|E
5000|$|By Jove, {{you have}} a sense of humour. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> worth saving.|$|R
60|$|PATRICIA. [Drawing back in awe.] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> growing taller as you speak.|$|R
60|$|Captain. If {{you will}} pardon the interruption, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{describing}} a pretty woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must speak}} of them. In former days, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> told that my father's will {{provided}} {{for my mother}} and for me. You {{know that we have}} enough to live on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No indeed; {{you used}} to be out there. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> the only one—and I hope you are still. That’s why I {{recognised}} you the other night—I might have cut you, you know.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, in a non-committal fashion, [...] "we {{certainly}} won the match, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{wrong to}} slip away. One would almost fancy {{that you are}} unduly sensitive now and then." ...|$|E
60|$|SYBIL [talking too much]. Mrs. Shand, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{very kind}} to take it so reasonably.|$|R
60|$|B.--Yes, sir, I believe <b>you</b> do, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in {{the right}} of it--am fully satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--a knave. No {{one who was}} not a knave would lend a hand towards {{separating}} {{a little}} child from its mother. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a knave, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> fool enough to suppose that the child will be given up to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I had not {{the least}} idea you were such an {{energetic}} person," [...] remarked Mrs. Easterfield, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> entirely too rash. But how about Mr. Lancaster? Do you {{know if he was}} listening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} you were quite right to make the observation. Facts are always valuable, and I am sure Lord Trowbridge was obliged to you. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a little wrong as to another statement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He'll be {{more popular}} now that he's {{the heir to}} Tretton. I don't know any fellow that I can get along better with than Scarborough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a little hard upon him about his father, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll see fast enough," [...] replied Hardwick. [...] "We {{have got}} you fast this time. Do <b>you</b> know what <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> the same fellow that I {{met in the}} lumber-yard." ...|$|R
60|$|Chr. Indeed, gentleman, my {{old lady}} is married already: Cry <b>you</b> mercy, forsooth, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a knight.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate <b>you!</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{the most}} pigheaded, obstinate, self-satisfied, ignorant {{creature}} who ever ruined a great cause." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Months! Mr. Sidney Wilton {{said you}} were the first runaway. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> quite right. Your new life now will be fresh to you. If you had remained, it would only have been {{associated}} with defeat and discomfiture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were harsh," [...] assented Gertrude. [...] "I {{have begun}} to realize it since we came to Canada--one sees things {{differently}} here. But, in a sense, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not to be blamed; you acted {{in the belief that}} you were right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll not quarrel about that, {{you may be}} sure, Colligan," [...] {{continued}} Barry; [...] "and as I said fifty {{acres at}} first--it was fifty acres <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> saying you wished for--I'll not baulk you, and go back from my own word." ...|$|E
60|$|GLORIA (no longer scornful). <b>You</b> {{need not}} <b>be</b> afraid. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sentimental, {{and a little}} foolish; but I like you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No! {{because he}} doesn't think of such {{nonsensical}} things. I declare, Miss Katie, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in love with}} Master Charley.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dearest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{in error}} there. The Grantlys {{have moved in}} a {{different}} sphere of life. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> must feel that they are--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{the bravest}} of the lot. I 'd {{like to have}} seen you flourishing round there with your hatchet," [...] added Tom, admiringly, and the old lady looked as much pleased with the {{compliment}} {{as if she had}} been a girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder. You {{declared}} {{you were}} logical {{as far as}} you knew, and when I thought about it I agreed. You imagined the channel wasn't safe and saw I was obstinate. In consequence, you resolved to ride the horse across. On the whole, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> nice!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, she doesn't," [...] {{spoke up}} the Story Girl undauntedly. [...] "She was all dressed {{and ready to}} come before she knew I was going to dress the same way. So she kept her bargain faithfully, Mr. Campbell, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> cruel to make her do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> wise. Fifty per cent, of truth--it's a large {{average in}} compliments. What <b>are</b> <b>you</b> going to wear?" ...|$|R
60|$|MISS SUSAN. Indeed, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> monstrous fine. (Innocently.) It quite awes me to {{remember}} {{that we used to}} whip him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> talking about,' said Katie, yawning, 'and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> all very stupid; so I'll go to bed.' ...|$|R
