40|$|Introduction and objectives: Tuberculosis (TB) {{still remains}} a major health concern both in {{developing}} and developed countries. The rate of the liver injury due to anti-TB drugs in developed countries has been reported up to 4 %. The goal {{of this study is}} to assess the rate and risk factors for anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Also, a model has been designed to predict DILI in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods: We conducted an observational study. The investigation was carried out in the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, Tehran, Iran. Anti-tuberculosis drug treatment course and patients’ demographic data, medical and drug history, and social habits were extracted from their medical records. DILI was defined as an increase in serum alanine aminotransfrase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransfrase (AST) greater than three times of the upper limit of normal (ULN), with symptoms of liver injury, or five times of the ULN without symptoms. Results: In this study, 87 patients (33 male, 54 female, mean age 54. 29 ± 21. 79 years) with tuberculosis diagnosis were followed. Anti-tuberculosis <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury</b> was detected in 14 (16. 1 %) patients. Concomitant use of hepatotoxic drugs (Isoniazid, Rifampin and Pyrazinamide) and the abnormal baseline serum liver enzyme levels before the initiation of therapy were found as risk factors for anti-tuberculosis <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury.</b> Conclusion: Anti-tuberculosis <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury</b> is a major problem in tuberculosis patients which lead to treatment interruption in 14 (16. 1 %) patients.

40|$|Background—Diagnosis of drug <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury</b> {{is usually}} {{based on a}} {{temporal}} relation between drug intake and clinical picture {{as well as on}} the exclusion of alternative causes. More precise diagnosis has been attempted by using in vitro specific T cell reactivity to drugs but the test has never reached general acceptability because of frequent negative results which could be explained, in part, by prostaglandin producing suppressor cells (PPSC).  Aim—To analyse the diagnostic value of a modified test where lymphocyte responses to drugs are detected in the presence of a prostaglandin inhibitor.  Patients—Ninety five patients with a clinical diagnosis of drug <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury,</b> 106 healthy controls, 35 individuals with recent exposure to the same drugs without adverse effects, and 15 patients with liver disease unrelated to drugs.  Methods—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured in the presence of drugs alone and in the presence of drugs and a prostaglandin inhibitor. Responses were assessed by 3 H-thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes. Results were expressed as counts per minute and as stimulation indexes (SI).  Results—When PBMC were stimulated with drugs alone, lymphocyte sensitisation to drugs (SI> 2) was detected in 26 % of the cases. This was noticeably increased (56 %) when a prostaglandin inhibitor was added to the cultures. No reactivity was found in controls. In patients with possible sensitivity to several drugs, lymphocyte reactivity was detected to only one drug. The severity of the lesions, as assessed by aminotransferase concentrations and disease duration, was lower in patients with evidence of PPSC.  Conclusions—This new approach is useful for the diagnosis of drug <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury,</b> particularly in patients exposed to more than one drug; furthermore, the presence of putative PPSC is associated with less severe forms of drug induced hepatitis. ...|$|E

40|$|Ethanol {{has been}} known to cause injury to the liver and other tissues; however the {{molecular}} factors responsible for alcohol <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury</b> has not been fully understood. Recent studies indicate that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may {{play an important role in}} alcohol <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury.</b> Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) -coactivator 1 α (PGC- 1 α) has been shown to be involved in defenses against ROS by inducing many ROS-detoxifying enzymes. However, the role of PGC- 1 α in alcohol <b>induced</b> <b>liver</b> <b>injury</b> has not been elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effect of alcohol on gene and protein expression of PGC- 1 α in H 4 -IIE cells (in vitro) and hepatic tissues (in vivo) by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Our results show that exposure to 500 mM ethanol in H 4 -IIE cells for 24 h significantly decreased both gene and protein expression of PGC- 1 α. PGC- 1 α gene expression was significantly decreased in cells exposed to 100 ng/ml LPS or 1 % hypoxia for 24 h. In addition, PGC- 1 α gene and protein expressions were slightly lower in hepatic tissues of rats exposed to ethanol for 15 h, at the level equivalent to the 500 mM used in culture cells, in comparison to sham rats. In contrast, serum LDH and AST levels in ethanol exposed rats were 1. 9 fold and 2. 8 fold higher than that of sham rats, respectively, which suggest significant organ injury in these rats following ethanol exposure. Likewise, catalase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes peroxide to water, is significantly increased in ethanol exposed H 4 -IIE cells which further confirms ROS generation due to ethanol exposure. Thus, our results show that oxidative stress conditions such as acute alcohol consumption, LPS or hypoxia suppresses PGC- 1 α expression in the liver, thereby presumably downregulates pertinent ROS-scavenging enzymes and enhances liver injury...|$|E

Our data showed that MaR 1 attenuated hepatic injury, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation induced by carbon tetrachloride, as evidenced by increased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and reactive oxygen species levels were inhibited by treatment of MaR 1. Furthermore, MaR 1 increased activities of antioxidative mediators in carbon tetrachloride-treated mice liver. MaR 1 decreased indices of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin- 6, interleukin- 1 β, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, myeloperoxidase, cyclooxygenase- 2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase.
