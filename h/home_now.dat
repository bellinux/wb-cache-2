25|$|In 1939 the British {{issued a}} White Paper {{in which they}} {{declared}} that a Jewish National <b>Home</b> <b>now</b> existed and that their obligations under the mandate were fulfilled. Further migration would be harmful to the Arab population. A further 10,000 Jews a year were to be admitted from 1939 to 1944 {{as well as a}} one-time allowance of 25,000 in view of the situation in Europe. After that Jewish migration would require (the extremely unlikely) agreement of the Arab majority (by this time Jews were about one-third of the population). The British promised the Arabs independence by 1949 and imposed restrictions on land purchases by Jews.|$|E

25|$|In December 1902, Bertholf {{reported}} for duty {{as an assistant}} inspector for the U.S. Life-Saving Service in Atlantic City. It was common practice for Revenue Cutter Service officers to perform this duty. This was helpful {{to him because he}} could manage to stay close to <b>home,</b> <b>now</b> that he was married. He was responsible as an assistant inspector to examine and drill the surfmen at the 42 life saving stations along the New Jersey shore each month. He also had to investigate any shipwrecks along the coast to see if the rescues had been conducted properly by the life saving stations. This tour of duty with the Life Saving Service would be of valuable experience later in his career when the USLSS merged with the Revenue Cutter Service to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

Florida State and Mike Long Track also hosted the Atlantic Coast Conference Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1992 and 2005. The USA Track and Field National Junior Championships returned ti Mike Long Track in the Summer of '94.

The Florida State track and field team has been calling Mike Long Track <b>home</b> <b>now</b> for 53 years. The 2003 season marked the unveiling of Mike Long Track's brand new track, complete with a new surface, wider lanes, faster turns and a larger infield area for hosting field events.

The improvements benefit not only the track and field/cross country programs, but also volleyball, soccer, softball and tennis student-athletes. The expanded center includes locker rooms, student-athlete lounges, medical preparation areas, coaches' offices and a conference room.|$|E

500|$|Following Michigan's season-ending {{loss in the}} 2011 Gator Bowl, {{head coach}} Rich Rodriguez was fired and {{replaced}} by Brady Hoke.
