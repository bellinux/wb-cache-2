TIALD equipped Jaguar GR1Bs were deployed to Italy in August to take part in Operation Deliberate Force against Bosnian Serb forces, being used to <b>designate</b> targets for RAF Harriers.

40|$|A strong <b>designated</b> {{verifier}} signature scheme {{makes it}} possible for a signer to convince a <b>designated</b> verifier that she has signed a message {{in such a way that}} the <b>designated</b> verifier cannot transfer the signature to a third party, and no third party can even verify the validity of a <b>designated</b> verifier signature. In 2005, Lipmaa, Wang, and Bao identified a new essential security property, non delegatability, of <b>designated</b> verifier signature schemes. Briefly, in a non delegatability <b>designated</b> verifier signature scheme, neither a signer nor a <b>designated</b> verifier can delegate the signing rights to any third party without revealing their secret keys. However, this paper shows that four recently proposed strong <b>designated</b> verifier signature schemes are delegatable. These schemes do not satisfy non delegatability secure requirement of strong <b>designated</b> verifier signature schemes...|$|R

40|$|A strong <b>designated</b> {{verifier}} signature scheme {{makes it}} possible for a signer to convince a <b>designated</b> verifier that she has signed a message {{in such a way that}} the <b>designated</b> verifier cannot transfer the signature to a third party, and no third party can even verify the validity of a <b>designated</b> verifier signature. We show that anyone who intercepts one signature can verify subsequent signatures in Zhang-Mao ID-based <b>designated</b> verifier signature scheme and Lal-Verma ID-based <b>designated</b> verifier proxy signature scheme. We propose a new and efficient ID-based <b>designated</b> verifier signature scheme that is strong and unforgeable. As a direct corollary, we also get a new efficient ID-based <b>designated</b> verifier proxy signature scheme...|$|R

5|$|It {{would be}} as great a farce of yesterday's {{election}} to <b>designate</b> it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E
5|$|Juan José Castelli was {{the main}} speaker for the revolutionaries. He based his speech on two key ideas: the government's lapsed legitimacy—he stated that the Supreme Central Junta was {{dissolved}} and had no rights to <b>designate</b> a Regency—and the principle of retroversion of sovereignty. He spoke after Riega, and replied that the American people should assume control of their government until FerdinandVII could return to the throne.|$|E

A second attempt at the city landmark nomination, led by Martin Selig Real Estate, began in 2016.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>designated</b> {{verifier}} signature is {{a signature}} scheme in which signatures {{can only be}} verified by a single, <b>designated</b> verifier, <b>designated</b> {{as part of the}} signature creation. <b>Designated</b> verifier signatures were first proposed in 1996 by Jakobsson Markus, Kazue Sako, and Russell Impagliazzo. [...] Proposed as a way to combine authentication and off-the-record messages, <b>designated</b> verifier signatures allow authenticated, private conversations to take place.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the 2015 {{wilderness}} designations, the White Cloud and Boulder mountains {{were part}} of the largest unprotected roadless area in the United States outside of Alaska. In the absence of Congressional action that would <b>designate</b> the Boulder-White Clouds region as wilderness, the area had been studied for possible protection as a national monument by presidential proclamation under the Antiquities Act. Former Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne initially studied the area for national monument status, but did not recommend it because Congressional action seemed likely. The 2015 bill passed after receiving increased attention when President Obama indicated he would <b>designate</b> a national monument in the area if the wilderness bill did not pass. Additionally, other large areas of the forest are parts of proposed wilderness areas, such as through the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act. These other proposals have gained no support among Idaho's congressional delegation because the bills could place undue public use and development restrictions on Idaho's public lands.|$|E
5|$|Since Apollo, like Mercury, {{used more}} than one launch vehicle for space missions, NASA used spacecraft-launch vehicle {{combination}} series numbers: AS-10x for Saturn I, AS-20x for Saturn IB, and AS-50x for Saturn V (compare Mercury-Redstone 3, Mercury-Atlas 6) to <b>designate</b> and plan all missions, rather than numbering them sequentially as in Project Gemini. This was changed by the time manned flights began.|$|E
