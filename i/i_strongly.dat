5|$|On Elizabeth's {{death in}} 1603 she was succeeded by James <b>I.</b> <b>Strongly</b> {{influenced}} by Scotland's {{separation from the}} Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced {{that he was being}} plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, Daemonologie, instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.|$|E

In 2011, Kajol participated in a fashion show organised by the Cancer Patients Aid Association, to generate funds for the organisation. Kajol is the international goodwill ambassador and patron of The Loomba Trust— a charity organisation devoted to supporting widows and their children around the world, particularly in India. Speaking about the issue, she said: [...] "It's sad to know that widows are still considered a blight in our society.

500|$|Following the {{approval}} of Sinclair's purchase of Allbritton, commissioner Ajit Pai further criticized the FCC's new policies and its endorsement of Sinclair's proposal to shut down stations to comply with them. Describing the three Allbritton stations as being [...] "victims" [...] of the [...] "crackdown" [...] against joint sales agreements, he stated regarding WCIV that [...] "apparently the Commission believes {{that it is better}} for that station to go out of business than for Howard Stirk Holdings to own the station and participate in a joint sales agreement with Sinclair. <b>I</b> <b>strongly</b> disagree. And so too, I'll bet, would consumers in Charleston." [...] In September 2014, Sinclair backtracked on its original plans, and reached deals to sell WCIV, WCFT and WJSU's license assets to Howard Stirk Holdings for $50,000 each and lease them studio space, pending FCC approval. Unlike Howard Stirk Holdings' other stations, they are operated and programmed independently, and Sinclair did not enter into any agreements to operate the stations on HSH's behalf.|$|E

"Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, <b>I</b> <b>strongly</b> felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong.

We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|It's Better If You Don't Understand is {{composed}} of four songs employing pop, pop rock, and hip hop genres. Mars explained that the EP is hard to classify since: [...] "I just write songs that <b>I</b> <b>strongly</b> believe in and that are coming from inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E
