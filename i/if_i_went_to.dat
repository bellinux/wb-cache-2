[...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I thought it might be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{would end}} up loathing Italia Conti saying, [...] "I hated the {{pressure}} {{that many of the}} children were under. Many of the kids were forced to grow up too fast, their careers were being decided for them before they were 13. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> an audition then they’d always choose the sweetest, prettiest kid. I wasn’t obviously beautiful so I used to miss out." [...] Ullman has also alleged that the owners taught their own children and that a certain level of favouritism seemed to exist. She also felt that the education she was receiving was of very little value. [...] "These stupid teachers would come in and go, 'Good morning, darlings, lets all be dustbins!' I'd go, 'Oh, shut up! I wanna be a banana!'" ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN. To {{make the}} speech at all, Maggie, is {{stronger}} than most would dare. They would do for me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a division.|$|E
6000|$|She put out {{her hand}} to rest it on the mantel-shelf, but her {{companion}} took it on the way {{and held it in}} both his own. [...] "You're delightful, Julia, when you speak in that tone--then I know why it is I love you. But I can't do anything <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Griffin, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Severals." ...|$|R
60|$|Ajax. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him, with my {{gauntlet}} clenched I'll pash him o'er the face.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Torquil," [...] he said, [...] "supposing {{this might}} avail us, the fatal day approaches, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the lists, <b>I</b> dread me {{we shall be}} shamed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, you're a lucky fellow!' said Big Klaus. 'Do {{you think}} I should also get some cattle <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{the bottom of}} the river?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't overdo it, dear; that's all. But, Frank, I {{could not}} rest <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> bed without {{speaking}} to you. You made me unhappy to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so, too. But I want to {{see those}} other fellows--in fact, I must see them. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the shore I might miss them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How cruel {{of you to}} send Ellie away!" [...] sobbed Tom. [...] "However, I {{will find}} her again, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the world's end to look for her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> {{and look}} at your old house, as <b>I</b> shall <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Florence, <b>I</b> shall bring you back another leaf from the same tree as I plucked the last from.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I can work," [...] {{answered}} the boy; [...] "and <b>I</b> 'm sure <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Squire {{up at the}} Hall he will give me something to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} there's any use in my staying on at Tercanbury? I {{should have thought}} it would be better <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Germany for a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Queen {{would let}} me kiss her hand <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Court," [...] Amelius {{reminded}} her, with a pleasant inner conviction of his wonderful readiness at finding an excuse.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} doctor after a moment's pause; [...] "I won't. Even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the Kaims I should not find you there. Why can you not come to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it now: upon my word then Lord Cashel {{knows how}} to play his cards! But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Grey Abbey <b>I</b> can't see her without seeing him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] Valentin answered, [...] "whenever you please. But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> America, <b>I</b> {{must not}} let this gentleman suppose {{that it is}} {{to run away from}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Adam thought--but did not say--"Then I'll go this afternoon; for <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> church, my {{thoughts}} 'ull {{be with her}} all the while. They must sing th' anthem without me to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because a man {{lives there}} who owes me fifteen cents, and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Butterfield {{and he saw}} me he'd want to pay me the money. I don't want money, my dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should simply}} break him {{up from the}} form he's got into, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the rehearsals. He must keep on doing {{it in his own}} way till he comes to New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no. You {{forced me}} into visiting him last year, and promised, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see him, he should marry {{one of my}} daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again." ...|$|E
6000|$|UNDERSHAFT. Well, I {{will make}} a bargain with you. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see you to-morrow in your Salvation Shelter, will you come the day after {{to see me in}} my cannon works? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] she asked, [...] "there {{is a girl}} {{there on}} that third seat, crying. Am <b>I</b> doing wrong <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> her and give her money for a night's lodging?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] {{said the}} elder, [...] "I don't propose sitting up all night, and you'll excuse me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed now. It's a little {{informal}} {{to leave a}} guest--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} Tom, {{shaking his}} head; [...] "no one {{will give me}} a penny for playing; but Farmer Bowser might give me a penny to stop playing, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> his house. He did last week, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, if I {{could find}} help," [...] Sydney said resignedly, [...] "I might emigrate. Pride wouldn't stand in my way; no honest {{employment}} would be beneath my notice. Besides, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> America, I might meet with my brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|The wild joy sprang {{into her}} face, {{as her father}} rose; a joy that it was terrible to him to see die out of it as he spoke: [...] "I tell you it's no use, Marcia! He wouldn't come <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> him--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pish! Now, uncle, don't cry, do {{what you}} will, lest I cry too. Help {{me to be a}} man while <b>I</b> live, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the black place when I die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{drawing of}} fiddlesticks, Mother! <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> see my father, I {{must have a}} reason for it; and instead of going with a sword in my hand, I shall take {{something}} else in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems strange," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{have had}} no message about her yet. Perhaps Luca has heard something. It may be well <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the studio at once to find out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but, Sam, what am I {{going to}} do if that money isn't gotten back? The Sandersons can't afford to lose it, and even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> work right away, it would take me a long, long time to earn four {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's not it, that's not it," [...] said Christian, quickly. [...] "Repentance is not enough. Why, man, do {{you think}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> England just now, and said ever so earnestly or so truly, `I repent,' that I'd escape {{swinging}} at the yard-arm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But as to Miss Effingham, {{it happens}} that our wishes jump together. I have asked her, {{and she has}} refused me. I don't even {{know where to find}} her to ask her again. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Lady Baldock's house the {{servants}} would not let me in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be dark {{soon after}} four. Let us stretch the hour or two. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I {{hear what you}} have done, either from our friend or from yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Father Brown {{started and}} spun half round like an absurd teetotum. [...] "What, what?" [...] he cried seeming {{galvanized}} into sudden life. [...] "Look here--I say--can I make your husband hear <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Mrs. Dean, {{it will be}} a {{charitable}} deed to tell me something of my neighbours: I feel I shall not rest <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed; so be good enough to sit and chat an hour.' ...|$|R
