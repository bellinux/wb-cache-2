5|$|RNAi {{has been}} used to genetically {{engineer}} plants to produce lower levels of natural plant toxins. Such techniques take advantage of the stable and heritable RNAi phenotype in plant stocks. Cotton seeds are rich in dietary protein but naturally contain the toxic terpenoid product gossypol, making them unsuitable for human consumption. RNAi {{has been used}} to produce cotton stocks whose seeds contain reduced levels of delta-cadinene synthase, a <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> in gossypol production, without affecting the enzyme's production {{in other parts of the}} plant, where gossypol is itself important in preventing damage from plant pests. Similar efforts have been directed toward the reduction of the cyanogenic natural product linamarin in cassava plants.|$|E
5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which is a <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. The {{second is the}} possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of RNAi was preceded first by observations of transcriptional inhibition by antisense RNA expressed in transgenic plants, and more directly by reports of unexpected outcomes in experiments performed by plant {{scientists in the}} United States and the Netherlands in the early 1990s. In an attempt to alter flower colors in petunias, researchers introduced additional copies of a gene encoding chalcone synthase, a <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> for flower pigmentation into petunia plants of normally pink or violet flower color. The overexpressed gene was expected to result in darker flowers, but instead produced less pigmented, fully or partially white flowers, indicating that the activity of chalcone synthase had been substantially decreased; in fact, both the endogenous genes and the transgenes were downregulated in the white flowers. Soon after, a related event termed quelling was noted in the fungus Neurospora crassa, {{although it was not}} immediately recognized as related. Further investigation of the phenomenon in plants indicated that the downregulation was due to post-transcriptional inhibition of gene expression via an increased rate of mRNA degradation. This phenomenon was called co-suppression of gene expression, but the molecular mechanism remained unknown.|$|E
40|$|The phylogenetic {{significance}} {{of the diversity of}} <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> of methylotrophic and autotrophic metabolism is discussed. Primers for these <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> were designed using gene sequences encoding methanol dehydrogenase (mxaF; using subsets from database sequences for 22 Bacteria), hydroxypyruvate reductase (hpr; 36 sequences), methylamine dehydrogenase (mauA; 12 sequences), methanesulfonate monooxygenase (msmA; four sequences), and the ccbL and cbbM genes of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (26 and 23 sequences). These were effective in amplifying the correct gene products for the target genes in reference organisms and in test organisms not previously shown to contain the genes, as well as in some methylotrophic Proteobacteria isolated from the human mouth. The availability of the new primers increases the probability of detecting diverse examples of the genes encoding these <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> both in natural populations and in isolated bacterial strains...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAmylopectin is {{the major}} glucose polymer in the plant starch granule. The {{amylopectin}} molecules have a highly ordered structure of alternating regions between the crystalline and amorphous lamellae, which is distinct from glycogen (the principle form of carbohydrate storage in bacteria and animals). Although several <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> involved in the amylopectin biosynthesis have been studied extensively, the underlying mechanism that {{gives rise to the}} unique structure of amylopectin remains largely unknown. In the present work, the Monte Carlo simulation technique is used to study the roles of the <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> and their relationship in the biosynthesis of amylopectin. We propose a mechanism of the amylopectin biosynthesis based on the activities of the <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> coupled with the crystallization process. The proposed mechanism can explain the characteristics of the molecular weight distributions of the molecules and how the amylopectin structure arises...|$|R

25|$|AMPK {{also plays}} an {{important}} role in lipid metabolism in the liver. It has long been known that hepatic ACC has been regulated in the liver by phosphorylation. AMPK also phosphorylates and inactivates 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> in cholesterol synthesis. HMGR converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, which is made from acetyl-CoA, into mevalonic acid, which then travels down several more metabolic steps to become cholesterol. AMPK, therefore, helps regulate fatty acid oxidation and cholesterol synthesis.|$|E

In Nazi Germany, research projects tried to use dandelions {{as a base for}} rubber production, but failed. In 2013, by inhibiting one <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. In collaboration with Continental Tires, IME began a pilot facility.|$|E
25|$|Carboxysomes are {{bacterial}} microcompartments {{found in}} many autotrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, Knallgasbacteria, Nitroso- and Nitrobacteria. They are proteinaceous structures resembling phage heads in their morphology and contain the enzymes of carbon dioxide fixation in these organisms (especially ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, RuBisCO, and carbonic anhydrase). It is thought that the high local concentration of the enzymes along with the fast conversion of bicarbonate to carbon dioxide by carbonic anhydrase allows faster and more efficient carbon dioxide fixation than possible inside the cytoplasm. Similar structures are known to harbor the coenzyme B12-containing glycerol dehydratase, the <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> of glycerol fermentation to 1,3-propanediol, in some Enterobacteriaceae (e. g.

40|$|Alterations of {{activity}} and expression in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> have been indicated in several malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). They {{play an important}} role in the progression of cancer. However, the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding these <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> on the recurrence of HCC has not been investigated. In this study, we genotyped 17 SNPs in genes encoding TCA cycle <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> and analyzed their association with recurrence-free survival (RFS) in a cohort of 492 Chinese HCC patients by Cox proportional hazard model and survival tree analysis. We identified 7 SNPs in SDHC, SDHD, FH, and IDH 2 genes to be significantly associated with the RFS of HCC patients. Moreover, all these SNPs were associated with the early recurrence (within 2 years after surgery) risk of diseases. Cumulative effect analysis showed that these SNPs exhibited a dose-dependent effect on the overall and early recurrence. Further stratified analysis suggested that number of risk genotypes modified the protective effect on HCC recurrence conferred by transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment. Finally, the survival tree analysis revealed that SNP rs 10789859 in SDHD gene was the primary factor contributing to HCC recurrence in our population. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time observed the association between SNPs in genes encoding TCA cycle <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> and HCC recurrence risk. Further observational and functional studies are needed to validate our findings and generalize its clinical usage...|$|R

25|$|Rennet is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used to {{coagulate}} milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the <b>key</b> <b>enzyme.</b> The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine rennet. The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} found to act as a {{reversible}} inhibitor of human 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (17β-HSD2), albeit with weak potency (Ki = 0.25–2.4μM; IC50 = 0.27–1.1μM). C7α thioalkyl derivatives of spironolactone like the 7α-thioethyl analogue were found to inhibit the enzyme with greater potency, suggesting that the actual active metabolites of spironolactone like 7α-TMS might be more potent inhibitors. 17β-HSD2 is a <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> responsible for inactivation of estradiol into estrone in various tissues, and inhibition of 17β-HSD2 by spironolactone may be involved in the gynecomastia and altered ratio of circulating testosterone to estradiol that the drug is associated with. Spironolactone has also been associated with positive effects on bone, and it is notable that 17β-HSD2 inhibitors are under investigation as potential novel treatments for osteoporosis due to their ability to prevent estradiol inactivation in this tissue.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has been}} able to show the {{function}} of niacin in the pathway lipid metabolism. It is seen that this vitamin can decrease the synthesis of apoB-containing lipoproteins such as VLDL, LDL, IDL and Lipoprotein (a) via several mechanisms: (1) Directly inhibiting the action of DGAT2, a <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> for triglyceride synthesis; (2) It has the ability to bind to the receptor HCAR2 thereby decreasing lipolysis and FFA flux to the liver for triglyceride synthesis; and (3) increased apoB catabolism. On the other hand, HDL cholesterol levels are increased by niacin through direct and indirect pathways. (4) Niacin decreases CETP mass and activity, and this synergistic effect with the decrease in triglyceride levels, can indirectly raise HDL cholesterol levels. The study has also been able to show direct effects on the beta chain of ATP synthase (5) and on production (6) and hepatic uptake (7) of apoA-I also increase HDL cholesterol levels. Thus by affecting the pathway reducing lipid levels help in reducing CVD.|$|E
40|$|Based on 16 S rRNA gene surveys, {{bacteria}} of the ɛ subdivision of proteobacteria {{have been}} identified to be important members of microbial communities {{in a variety of}} environments, and quite a few have been demonstrated to grow autotrophically. However, no information exists on what pathway of autotrophic carbon fixation these bacteria might use. In this study, Thiomicrospira denitrificans and Candidatus Arcobacter sulfidicus, two chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers of the ɛ subdivision of proteobacteria, were examined for activities of the <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> of the known autotrophic CO 2 fixation pathways. Both organisms contained activities of the <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle, ATP citrate lyase, 2 -oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase, and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase. Furthermore, no activities of <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> of other CO 2 fixation pathways, such as the Calvin cycle, the reductive acetyl coenzyme A pathway, and the 3 -hydroxypropionate cycle, could be detected. In addition to the <b>key</b> <b>enzymes,</b> the activities of the other enzymes involved in the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle could be measured. Sections of the genes encoding the α- and β-subunits of ATP citrate lyase could be amplified from both organisms. These findings represent the first direct evidence for the operation of the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle for autotrophic CO 2 fixation in ɛ-proteobacteria. Since ɛ-proteobacteria closely related to these two organisms are important in many habitats, such as hydrothermal vents, oxic-sulfidic interfaces, or oilfields, these results suggest that autotrophic CO 2 fixation via the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle might be more important than previously considered...|$|R

25|$|Melanophores contain eumelanin, {{a type of}} melanin, {{that appears}} black or dark-brown because of its light {{absorbing}} qualities. It is packaged in vesicles called melanosomes and distributed throughout the cell. Eumelanin is generated from tyrosine {{in a series of}} catalysed chemical reactions. It is a complex chemical containing units of dihydroxyindole and dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid with some pyrrole rings. The <b>key</b> <b>enzyme</b> in melanin synthesis is tyrosinase. When this protein is defective, no melanin can be generated resulting in certain types of albinism. In some amphibian species there are other pigments packaged alongside eumelanin. For example, a novel deep (wine) red-colour pigment was identified in the melanophores of phyllomedusine frogs. This was subsequently identified as pterorhodin, a pteridine dimer that accumulates around eumelanin core, and it is also present in a variety of tree frog species from Australia and Papua New Guinea. While it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex melanophore pigments, it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively.|$|E

40|$|In this review, we firstly {{focused on}} the {{regulation}} of high-density lipoprotein(HDL) metabolism in men by sex steroid hormones, especially androgen, and <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, such as cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase(LCAT), lipoprotein lipase(LPL), and hepatic triglyceride lipase(HTGL) activity. In some epidemiological studies, significant positive correlation was observed between plasma testosterone and serum HDL cholesterol(HDL-c) levels. However, cause and effect on this relationship are still remains unknown. Recently, it was proposed the passibility that insulin resistance and/or hyperinsulinemia are more impotant regulator (predictor) of HDL-level rather than sex hormones. We discussed the mechanism by which insulin resitance was associated with lower level of HDL-c. Seconderly, we summarized the effects of exercise and endurance training on lipids, lipoproteins, <b>key</b> <b>enzymes</b> in lipid metabolism and androgen. It was partly demonstrated that increases in the insulin sensitinity, and LCAT and LPL activity, and decreases in CETP, HTGL activity and androgen levels were found following endurance training.
