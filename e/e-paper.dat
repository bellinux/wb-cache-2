The metallic cathode in an OLED acts as a mirror, with reflectance approaching 80%, leading to poor readability in bright ambient light such as outdoors. However, with the proper application of a circular polarizer and antireflective coatings, the diffuse reflectance {{can be reduced to}} less than 0.1%.

40|$|Flexible field {{emission}} (FE) emitters, whose unique advantages are lightweight and conformable, promise to enable {{a wide range}} of technologies, such as roll-up flexible FE displays, <b>e-papers</b> and flexible light-emitting diodes. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time highly flexible SiC field emitters with low turn-on fields and excellent emission stabilities. n-Type SiC nanoneedles with ultra-sharp tips and tailored N-doping levels were synthesized via a catalyst-assisted pyrolysis process on carbon fabrics by controlling the gas mixture and cooling rate. The turn-on field, threshold field and current emission fluctuation of SiC nanoneedle emitters with an N-doping level of 7. 58 at. % are 1. 11 V μm- 1, 1. 55 V μm- 1 and 8. 1 %, respectively, suggesting the best overall performance for such flexible field emitters. Furthermore, characterization of the FE properties under repeated bending cycles and different bending states reveal that the SiC field emitters are mechanically and electrically robust with unprecedentedly high flexibility and stabilities. These findings underscore the importance of concurrent morphology and composition controls in nanomaterial synthesis and establish SiC nanoneedles as the most promising candidate for flexible FE applications. © 2015 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|Transparent {{conducting}} oxide [TCO] {{films have}} been widely used as transparent electrodes in the field of optoelectronic devices. Specifically, they have been used in applications such as liquid crystal displays, organic light-emitting diodes, <b>e-papers,</b> and thin-film solar cells [1 – 4]. It is well known that the performance of such devices is closely related to the physical properties (for example, the electrical and optical properties) of the TCO [5]. Indium tin oxide [ITO] is the most widely used TCO because of its excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, ITO requires high process temperatures (greater than 200 °C) in order to obtain these favorable characteristics. This is because an additional annealing treatment is needed to transform its structure from amorphous to poly-crystalline. Thus, it is difficult to apply ITO films onto flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate [PET], polyimide, polyethylene naphthalate, and polycarbonate because these polymer substrates have low glass transition temperatures [6]. In general, there are several disadvantages to fabricating ITO on plastic substrates as opposed to glass substrates, which can be fabricated with a relatively low treatment temperature. These disadvantages include low transmittance, low conductivity, and many defects. Therefore, the development of a low temperature process for depositing ITO onto plastic substrates is very important.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} Digital Infrastructure (DI) and the associated notion of Socio- Technical Dynamics to archaeology. DI conceptualization of technology goes beyond the ‘technology as tool’ notion prevalent in archaeology by acknowledging the process of digitalization and socio-technical dynamics in integrating technologies into expanding configurations. We propose DIs for analysing archaeology in the eScience era, and as an illustration we discuss the paradox of control and change that concretizes for example in information models and standards. Standards have {{a central role in}} enhancing interoperability and ensuring the future use of data. The socio-technical dynamics of DIs recognizes standards together with technologies and users as networked constituents of DIs. In cultural heritage and archaeology, standards are emerging as global infrastructure components. We discuss how technology and standards as controlling mechanisms have implications for archaeological research practices and scientific procedures. Research into these mechanisms can guide designers, managers, and policymakers.
