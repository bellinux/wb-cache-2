500|$|According to Michael Moorcock, [...] "He also, {{when faced}} with the Watts riots of the mid-sixties, seriously {{proposed}} and went on to proposing that there were 'natural' slaves who were unhappy if freed. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> panel with him in 1965, as he pointed out that the worker bee when unable to work dies of misery, that the moujiks when freed went to their masters and begged to be enslaved again, that the ideals of the anti-slavers who fought in the Civil War were merely expressions of self-interest and that the blacks were 'against' emancipation, which was fundamentally why they were indulging in 'leaderless' riots in the suburbs of Los Angeles." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tradition}} of singing Christmas carols {{in return for}} alms or charity began in England {{in the seventeenth century}} after the Restoration. Town musicians or 'waits' were licensed to collect money in the streets in the weeks preceding Christmas, the custom spread throughout the population by {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}} up to the present day. Also from the seventeenth century, there was the English custom, predominantly involving women, of taking a wassail bowl to their neighbours to solicit gifts, accompanied by carols. Despite this long history, many Christmas carols date only from the nineteenth century onwards, with the exception of songs such as the Wexford Carol, [...] "God Rest You Merry Gentlemen", [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>Sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Sunny Bank", [...] "The Holly and the Ivy," [...] the [...] "Coventry Carol" [...] and [...] "I Saw Three Ships".|$|E
6000|$|She {{sat down}} upon a boulder and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lower slab a yard or so away, {{and we looked}} at one another. [...] "It's still unreal," [...] she said.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chair, and Mr. Stillwell {{began to}} look over his letters. I {{wondered}} what would happen next, but I was not quite prepared for what did happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] {{she said}} and dropped into a chair against the light, looking away from me across the wide green space of {{afternoon}} sunshine. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> little sofa, at a loss also.|$|R
60|$|It was {{of small}} use {{to follow him}} further, so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{prostrate}} yellow birch to rest and listen awhile in the vast silence, and to watch anything that might be passing through the cold white woods.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had them," [...] she calculated, [...] "in the Strand; <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seat. Well, never mind," [...] she concluded, {{turning back}} into the room abruptly, [...] "I dare say some old {{creature}} is enjoying them by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pine log in a {{state of}} unadorned nature, {{oblivious}} to all around, intent only on the massacre of the things that had violated me. How much time flew I could not guess. Great loud [...] "Haw-haws!" [...] roused me to consternation. There behind me stood Jones and Emett shaking as if with the ague.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{bench in}} the waist of the ship, and at my feet lay {{the man who had}} been dragged from the sea with me. I thought that this man was dead till the first red rays of dawn lit upon his face, whereon he sat up, and I saw that he was Steinar.|$|E
60|$|That was interesting; so <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rock to watch. Whenever I took my {{eyes from}} him a moment, it was {{difficult}} to find him again, so perfectly did his plumage blend with the white ice upon which he stood motionless.|$|R
60|$|He muttered {{through his}} teeth, “Mal. Je ne dors plus.” He moved off {{to stand at}} the window {{with his back to the}} room. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sofa that was there and put my feet up, and silence took {{possession}} of the room.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and left me and I entered the house where I found my mother sitting, still in her festal robes, like one who waits. She looked at my face, then asked what troubled me. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stool at her feet and told her everything.|$|R
60|$|This {{struck me}} as being funny. After I had supped <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bench by {{the door of the}} inn and gossiped with two labourers about brickmaking, and motor cars, and the cricket of last year. And in the sky a faint new crescent, blue and vague as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun.|$|E
60|$|Although I {{had tried}} all along {{to hope that}} she would some day do so, that hope {{had been so long}} {{deferred}} that it had almost died away; and now at the sudden news, I felt all the blood rush to my heart, the room swam round with me, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chair quite overwhelmed by the sudden shock.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the moon}} went down, and left us {{floating}} on the waters, now only heaving like some troubled woman's breast, with leisure to reflect upon all that we had gone through and all that we had escaped. Job stationed himself at the bow, Mahomed kept his post at the tiller, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seat {{in the middle of}} the boat close to where Leo was lying.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{old wooden}} settle, carved all over like <b>a</b> bench <b>on</b> the Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning {{it with his}} jack-knife, stooping over and {{diligently}} working away at the space between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, I thought.|$|R
60|$|With such comfort {{as these}} words afforded I {{returned}} to the music-room, and, finding it empty, {{went out to the}} terrace, where the others were now strolling about in knots and couples, conversing and enjoying the lovely moonlight. Wandering a little distance away by myself, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bench under a tree, and presently Yoletta came to me there, and closely scrutinized my face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{come back}} to the old bunk, you see," [...] he continued, while <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chest which served for a chair. [...] "I likes the Home better an' better every time I comes to it, and I've brought all my crew with me; for you see, sir, the `Coffin's' a'most fallin' to pieces, and will have to go into dock for a riglar overhaul." ...|$|R
60|$|I needed exercise, so I {{employed}} {{my agent}} in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> boulder {{and watched them}} go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent. It was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle. When I had had enough exercise, I made the agent take some, by running a race {{with one of those}} logs. I made a trifle by betting on the log.|$|E
60|$|We walked about till I {{was ready}} to drop. Then we got to Victoria Park, and I 'ad no sooner got on to the grass than I laid down and went {{straight}} off to sleep. It was two o'clock when I woke, and, arter a couple o' pork-pies and a pint or two, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> seat in the Park smoking, while she kep' dabbing 'er eyes agin and asking me to come 'ome.|$|E
60|$|But {{in silent}} {{gratitude}} {{at the end}} of a voyage, almost equally uncongenial to both of us, and so bitter to one, Harry and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chest in the forecastle. And now, the ship that we had loathed, grew lovely in our eyes, which lingered over every familiar old timber; for the scene of suffering is a scene of joy when the suffering is past; and the silent reminiscence of hardships departed, is sweeter than the presence of delight.|$|E
60|$|Feeling much depressed, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wet stone, in my wet garments, and lunched off a moist biscuit, a {{piece of}} tongue, and a lump of cheese. This was consoling, {{as far as it}} went, but it did not go far. The misty clouds obliterated the mountains, the rain drizzled from the skies, percolated through the brim of my hat, trickled down my nose, and dropped upon my luncheon.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Northampton, Townley {{left school}} {{at the age of}} ten to work at an {{engineering}} firm, later moving to a boot-making company. [...] He joined the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives (NUBSO), and became president of his branch of the union. [...] During World War <b>I,</b> he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> military service tribunal, making decisions on exemptions. This created controversy when he came before the tribunal himself and was granted six months' exemption by his colleagues.|$|R
60|$|As soon as I {{saw that}} his eyes were shut <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> box to think. To tell the truth, I was not {{altogether}} happy in my mind. To begin with I {{did not know how}} the twenty bearers would behave under fire. They might be seized with panic and rush about, in which case I determined to let them out of the boma to take their chance, for panic is a catching thing.|$|R
6000|$|Arter {{everybody}} {{was in their}} beds asleep <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> clerk’s stool {{in the office and}} wrote ’im another letter from Dorothy. I called ’im [...] "Dear Bill," [...] and I said ’ow sorry I was that I ’adn’t had even a sight of ’im lately, having been laid up with a sprained ankle and ’ad only just got about agin. I asked ’im to meet me at Cleopatra’s Needle at eight o’clock, and said that I should wear the blue ’at with red roses.|$|E
60|$|The most {{extraordinary}} things {{used to run}} through my head in those days. I will confess that my mind ran persistently that evening upon revolutions after the best French pattern, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Committee of Safety and tried backsliders. Parload was there, among the prisoners, backsliderissimus, aware too late of the error of his ways. His hands were tied behind his back ready for the shambles; {{through the open door}} one heard the voice of justice, the rude justice of the people. I was sorry, but I had to do my duty.|$|E
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. One day, when I {{was tired}} of {{learning}} to walk forward with some of my feet and backwards with others and sideways with the rest all at once, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> rock with my four chins resting on four of my palms, and four or my elbows resting on four of my knees. And suddenly it came into my mind that this monstrous machinery of heads and limbs was no more me than my statues had been me, {{and that it was}} only an automaton that I had enslaved.|$|E
60|$|What {{was it in}} the air? What {{sense of}} fear brooded here and whispered in the alder leaves and tinkled in the brook? Simmo grew uneasy and hurried away. He was like the wood folk. But <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> great log that the spring floods had driven in through the alders to feel {{the meaning of the}} place, if possible, and to have the vast sweet {{solitude}} all to myself for a little while.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down limply <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{ledge and}} tried to look matters fairly in the face. I could not swim; calls for help could not reach anybody; my only hope lay in the chance of {{somebody}} passing down the shore or of some boat appearing.|$|R
60|$|I {{had asked}} {{leave to enter}} of course. Liz (the only name by which I knew her) rose to give me her own chair, but <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stool near the fire, and Mr. Bucket took {{a corner of the}} bedstead. Now that I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar, I became {{conscious}} of being hurried and giddy. It was very difficult to begin, and I could not help bursting into tears.|$|R
60|$|Next day, {{after a long}} lying-in-wait, I intercepted Adam Waggett and beckoned {{him into}} the shrubbery. First I {{questioned}} him. A bill of the circus, he told me, had already been left at the lodge. Its tents and booths and Aunt Sallies were even now being pitched in a meadow three or four miles distant and this side the neighbouring town. So far, so good. I told him my plan. He could do nothing but {{look at me like}} a fish, with his little black eyes, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tree stump and marshalled my instructions.|$|E
60|$|By {{eight o'clock}} we were riding up the colored slopes, through the still forest, with the sweet, fragrant, frosty air nipping at our noses. A mile from camp we reached a notch {{in the rim}} that led down to Dude Creek, and here Edd and Nielsen descended with the hounds. The rest of us rode out to a point there to await developments. The sun had already flooded the basin with golden light; the east slopes of canyon and rim were dark in shade. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mat of pine needles near the rim, and looked, and cared not for passage of time.|$|E
6000|$|We {{passed a}} wet and watchful night without food or sleep, and {{were glad to}} find the break of day {{unbroken}} by the musketry of a heavy attack. From our lofty position on the heights the whole country beyond the Tugela was spread like a map. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> great rock which overhung the valley, and searched the landscape inch by inch with field glasses. After an hour's study my feeling of insecurity departed. I learned {{the answer to the}} questions which had perplexed the mind. Before us lay the 'devilry' the Boers had prepared, and it was no longer difficult to understand why the Springfield bridge had been spared and the heights abandoned.[2] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> that porch <b>a</b> good while, {{but she did}} {{not come}} out again. Why should she? Nobody came out, and within I could hear no sound of voices. I might {{certainly}} recommend this inn as a quiet place. The Italian and the crickets continued singing and chirping, but they only seemed to make the scene more lonely.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stone, with a sigh, and by {{a natural}} impulse one of my hands sought my forehead, and the other {{the base of my}} stomach. I believe I never appreciated, till then, the poverty of the human machinery--for I still needed a hand or two to place elsewhere. Pen cannot {{describe}} how I was jolted up. Imagination cannot conceive how disjointed I was--how internally, externally and universally I was unsettled, mixed up and ruptured. There was a sympathetic crowd around me, though.|$|R
60|$|It was a sad, a solemn, and a most melancholy thought. The book {{on which}} I {{had so much}} relied; the book in the old morocco cover; the book with the cocked-hat corners; the book full of fine old family associations; the book with {{seventeen}} plates, executed in the highest style of art; this precious book was next to useless. Yes, the thing that had guided the father, could not guide the son. And <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shop step, and gave loose to meditation.|$|R
