We studied this combination in the Reykjavik Study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Reykjavik Study, a population-based cohort study during 1967 - 1997, recruited 19, 381 participants aged 33 - 84 years who were followed until 2002. Oral glucose tolerance tests and chest X-rays were obtained from all participants. Cases were defined in accordance with World Health Organization criteria for type 2 diabetes or AGR (impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose) and European Society of Cardiology guidelines for heart failure. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of type 2 diabetes and heart failure was 0. 5 % in men and 0. 4 % in women, while AGR and heart failure were found in 0. 7 % of men and 0. 6 % of women. Among participants with normal glucose regulation, <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 3. 2 % compared with 6. 0 and 11. 8 % among those with AGR and type 2 diabetes, respectively. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the age-group 45 - 65 years increased in both sexes during the period (P for trend = 0. 007). The odds ratio was 2. 8 (95 % CI 2. 2 - 3. 6) for the association between type 2 diabetes and heart failure and 1. 7 (1. 4 - 2. 1) between AGR and heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong association between any form of glucometabolic perturbation and heart failure.

Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction {{plays a major}} role in CHF and progression of most cardiac diseases. The current recommended goals can theoretically be accomplished via exercise and pharmacological therapy so the aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of cardiac rehabilitation program on diastolic dysfunction and health related quality of life and to determine the correlation between changes in left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Forty patients with chronic <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> as having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with systolic and diastolic dysfunction.

Circuit training improved both diastolic and systolic dysfunction in the training group. On the other hand, only a significant correlation was found between improvement in diastolic dysfunction and health related quality of life measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the occurrence, the aetiology and the management of congestive heart failure in the cardiac centre of the St. Elizabeth catholic general hospital Shisong in Cameroon. METHODS: Between November 2002 and November 2008, a population of 8121 patients was consulted in the referral cardiac centre of St. Elizabeth Catholic General Hospital. Of these patients, 462 were diagnosed with congestive heart failure according to the modified Framingham criteria for the diagnosis of heart failure. Complementary investigations used to confirm and establish the aetiology of the disease were the chest X-ray, electrocardiography, bi-dimensional Doppler echocardiography. RESULTS: The results showed that the occurrence of congestive heart failure in our centre was 5, 7 %. Congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in 198 females and 264 males, aged between 8 and 86 years old (42. 5, plus or minus 18 years old). Post rheumatic valvulopathies (14. 6 %) and congenital heart diseases (1. 9 %) were the first aetiologic factor of congestive heart failure in the young, meanwhile cardiomyopathies (8, 3 %) in elderly followed by hypertensive cardiomyopathy (4. 4 %). Congestive heart failure was also seen in adults with congenital heart diseases in 0. 01 %. In this zone of Cameroon, we discovered that HIV cardiomyopathy (1. 6 %) and Cor pulmonale (8 %) were represented, aetiological factors not mentioned in previous studies conducted in urban areas of Cameroon. The mean duration of hospital stay for the compensation treatment was thirteen days, ranging between 7 and 21 days), the mortality being 9. 2 %. All the medications recommended for the treatment of congestive heart failure are available in our centre but many patients are not compliant to the therapy or cannot afford them. Financial limitation is causing the exacerbation of the disease and premature death. CONCLUSION: Our data show a high incidence of congestive heart failure mainly due to post rheumatic valvulopathies in young patients in our centre. National program to fight against rheumatic fever and complications are of great urgency in our country. The compensation treatment of congestive heart failure is challenging in our milieu, characterized by poor compliance and financial limitation...|$|E
40|$|Background. Chronic {{heart failure}} {{is a serious}} {{condition}} with high morbidity and mortality. Prognosis can be improved with early diagnosis and adequate nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment. Aims of the study. Aim {{of the study was}} a comparison of diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients who were hospitalized in the University or Community hospital. Methods. The hospital records of patients, hospitalized for heart failure, from University hospital (UH, Internal clinic, Department of angiology, Department of hypertension) and Community hospital (CH, Department of Internal medicine) were reviewed retrospectively. We included all consecutive patients in the period from January 1, 1997 to June 30, 1997 (CH) and December 31, 1997 (UH) who were discharged or died with diagnosis of a heart failure. Results. Six hundred and twenty-five patients (307 from CH and 318 from UH), aged 76 ± 11 years, were included in the survey. In 308 (49 %) patients <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>was</b> <b>diagnosed</b> prior to index hospitalization. Rehospitalization rate was 42 %. Etiology of heart failure was ischemic heart disease (36 %), arterial hypertension (37 %), dilated cardiomyopathy (16 %) and valvular heart disease (15 %). The hospital stay was 14 ± 10 days in UH and 10 ± 6 days in CH (p < 0. 001). Overall in-hospital mortality reached 16 % (98 patients) and was 8 % in UH and 24 % in CH (< 0. 001). Echocardiography was performed in UH in 45 % and in CH in 13 % of all patients and in 50 % vs. 22 % of patients, hospitalized for the first time. At the discharge the following drugs were prescribed (UH vs. CH) : diuretics (82 % vs. 73 %), ACE inhibitors (61 % vs. 33 %), digoxin (54 % vs. 71 %) beta-adrenergic blockers (3 % vs. 0 %) and antiarrhytmics (7 % vs. 32 %). Among the patients with systolic dysfunction 69 % from UH and 32 % of patients from CH received ACE inhibitors. In patients with atrial fibrillation, warfarin was prescribed to 34 % and 5 % UH and CH patients, respectively. The advice regarding lifestyle changes in discharge records was found in only 21 % and 3 % from UH and CH patients. Conclusions. Our survey showed a considerable gap between guidelines and clinical practice in hospital management of patients with heart failure. This gap is more evident in CH. Most prominent features are underuse of echocardiography in diagnostic algorhytm, underuse of ACE inhibitors in treatment of systolic dysfunction, non-use of beta-adrenergic blockers and unsufficient nonpharmacologic advices in discharge records. <br /...|$|E

For 20 years the etiology of PVE has remained the same, the dominant pathogen remains Staphylococcus. The frequency of PVE caused by Streptococci has markedly reduced. In both the decades analyzed the etiology of native valve endocarditis (NVE) was similar. In the eighties Streptococcus was predominant. In successive years the number of infections caused by Staphylococci was the same as that caused by Streptococci. The incidence of early PVE decreased in the nineties. More patients were treated surgically with lesser peri-operative mortality. A lower incidence of infective endocarditis on prosthetic valves caused by streptococci may signify better prophylaxis against infective endocarditis.

40|$|Introduction. One of the {{characteristics}} of modern era is the explosion of diabetes in the world. Today more than 400, 000, 000 people suffer from diabetes in the entire world. During the last decade the number of women with the disorder of glucose homeostasis is six to seven times greater than in the previous period. Therefore, the re-evaluation of the impact of glucose intolerance on the course and outcome of pregnancy is very current. Objective. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the data on the influence of mothers’ glucose homeostasis disturbances on the occurrence of cardiorespiratory disorders in newborns, as well as their influence on the perinatal outcome. Methods. Prospective examination included 102 newborns in total - 31 infants of mothers with glucose homeostasis disorder (Group I) and 71 infants of healthy mothers (Group II). Average age, body height, body weight, body mass index, parity and illness duration of the pregnant women had been determined, as well as the delivery method. Every newborn was provided with physical examination, Apgar score was calculated, body weight and body length were measured. Also, electrocardiography and brain ultrasound, as well as the basic hematology biochemical and microbiological analysis, were performed within the examinations of the infants. Results. The average weight and obesity incidence with diabetic women was higher than in the control group and their infants were heavier and with lower gestational age. <b>Heart</b> <b>failures</b> <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> in five (16. 1 %) infants of diabetic mothers and in one (1. 4 %) infant of a healthy woman (p< 0. 01).

In the second group (after cardioversion) {{as well as in the}} third group (after ablation) the largest proportion of patients <b>was</b> also <b>diagnosed</b> with arterial hypertension – 62. 0 % and 40. 9 %, respectively. The mean total AFEQT score among the control group was 82. 3 ± 3. 1 points. Patients of the first group scored the minimum value among interviewed patients - 53. 4 ± 4. 6 - that was significantly less compared to the control group, р< 0. 05. The total average value of the third group was significantly higher than that in the first group, 69. 3 ± 4. 6 points against 53. 4 ± 4. 6 points, respectively, р< 0. 05.             Thus, it was found that the lowest life quality is typical for patients treated with medications only. The patients after ablation have the highest life quality. Left ventricle revascularization slightly improves life quality, but this trend is not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} to {{acute myocardial infarction}} {{can be divided into}} different phases: 1. Acute myocardial infarction induces a sudden decrease of cardiac output related to the size of infarcted area. 2. CompeasatoN phase: A decreased cardiac output evokes activation of compensatory mechanisms, such as the sympathetic nervous system and reninangiotensin- aldosterone sytem. If these mechanisms cannot bring cardiac output back to acceptable levels, structural changes in the heart called hypertrophy and remodeling will follow. 3. Compensated ohase: A relatively stabile phase with (partly) restored cardiac output but with decreased left ventricular function and ejection fraction has been established; a stage compensated <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> in which patients are often not recognized. 4. Decompensation ohase: When symptoms of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> become overt, decompensation develops driven by the same mechanisms as in the previous phases, but with a very poor prognosis. Therapy during the different phases require different strategies. During phase 1 the objective of therapy is to limit infarct size by establishing reperfusion as quick as possible. Then, theoretically, phase 2 requires stimulation, phase 3 stabilization and support, and phase 4 inhibition of the same ongoing processes. Although still patients at stage 4 are clinically the most important ones, inclination towards earlier intervention is growing. The problem that may arise, however, is that earlier treatment, especially at stage 2 is aimed at the opposite direction as the later therapy. This problem is substantiated by the results of the 2 CONSENSUS trials, where delayed ACE-inhibitor (enalapril) treatment had clearly beneficial effects (CONSENSUS I), whereas similar treatment during early phases had detrimental effects (CONSENSUS 11) 91 • Pharmacological research has mainly focused on stage 4 when congestive <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> and prognosis becomes very poor. Except for treatment with ACE-inhibitors, prognosis has not benefited substantially from all these research. During this stage, cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling have become a major target for therapy since they are associated with improved prognosis 112 • When treatment should be started earlier, that is with ventricular dysfunction but before signs of <b>heart</b> <b>failure,</b> it implies interference with cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, which during the early phase are regarded a pathophysiological {{response to}} compensate for the loss of contractile tissue. This indicates that treatment should therefore be selected carefully 81 • 91 • Thus, although the importance of treatment during the comoensatorv stage is now well acknowledged, a strategy is not established yet...|$|R
40|$|Woolly hair {{may occur}} as an {{isolated}} problem of cosmetic concern {{or can be}} a part of a systemic disease (woolly hair syndrome) with underlying fatal cardiomyopathy. Two characteristic associations of woolly hair syndrome are Naxos disease and Carvajal syndrome. Naxos disease is characterized by woolly hair, palmoplantar keratoderma, and arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. In this report we describe a case of a young girl who presented with <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> and <b>was</b> subsequently <b>diagnosed</b> as a case of generalized woolly hair with biventricular arrythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

40|$|Background: <b>Heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>is</b> dif®cult to <b>diagnose</b> in {{a primary}} care setting with a {{reported}} false positive diagnosis in up to 70 % of cases. Aims: To use echocardiography in a large rural practice to evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> in patients over 65 years of age. Methods: Sixty patients with a previous diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> <b>were</b> selected at random from the practice records and were invited to attend for an echocardiogram at the practice premises. Results: Fifty-eight patients. attended, the age was 81 " 7 years, 29 % had impaired left ventricular LV systolic function of whom 65 % were in atrial ®brillation. A further 7 % had isolated diastolic LV dysfunction. The prevalence of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> by clinical assessment was 29 per 1000 in this patient group and 9 per 1000 when echocardiography was used to con®rm the diagnosis.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} factors {{available to}} general practitioners (GPs) that are predictive of mortality within a general practice-based population of <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> patients, and {{to report the}} sensitivity and specificity of prognostic information from GPs. Methods: Five hundred and forty-two <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> patients aged > 60 years were recruited from 16 UK GP surgeries. Patients completed quality-of-life and services use questionnaires every 3 months for 24 months or until death. Factors with independent significant association with survival were identified using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: Women had a 58 % lower risk of death. Patients self-reporting New York Heart Association Classification III or IV had an 81 % higher risk of death. Patients aged 85 + years had over a five-fold risk of death as compared with those aged < 65 years. Patients with a co-morbidity of cancer had a 78 % higher risk of death. Of the 14 patients {{who died in a}} 12 -month period, the GPs identified 11 (sensitivity 79 %). They identified 133 of the 217 who did not die (specificity 61 %). Discussion: Predictors readily available to GPs, such as patient characteristics, are easy to adapt to use in general practice, where most <b>heart</b> <b>failure</b> patients <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> and treated. Identifying factors likely to influence death is useful in primary care, as this can initiate discussion about end-of-life care...|$|R
