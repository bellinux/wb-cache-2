25|$|Clare becomes {{interested}} in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) {{when he gets}} a lucrative property development job. They grow closer to him and she attempts to seduce him but he rebuffs her advances, due to recently separating from his wife, Stacey (Lacey Turner), but relents when Clare dresses up as Princess Leia to impress him. He propositions her but Clare refuses {{to have sex with}} him, breaking down and telling him about an affair she had with an aggressive, married man named Arnold. Arnold traces Clare to Walford, wanting to rekindle their affair but Clare only wanted Arnold to buy her expensive gifts and when he stopped, she fled. Clare knows that Arnold had bought his wife expensive jewellery and persuades Bradley to help her steal it by claiming that it belongs to her. Believing Arnold is a bully, Bradley agrees. The robbery goes off without a hitch, but Arnold sees Clare leaving and returns to Walford to confront her. Clare admits that she never loved Arnold and was only using him for his money. When he threatens to call the police, Clare threatens to ruin his marriage and Bradley throws him out after Clare lies that he was verbally abusing her. Satisfied with her pay off, Clare realises that Bradley <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> for her and tells him this, refusing to start a relationship, but is jealous, however, when Bradley reconciles with Stacey.|$|E

[...] Then, years later, while still believing {{that he had been}} hit by Kennedy's stick, Howe reiterated that there was no intent to injure on Kennedy's part and considered his injuries self-inflicted. However, the incident still continues at times to be described as a deliberate act by Kennedy. In 2001, The Sporting News ran an article on the 30 toughest players in the NHL. In referring to Howe's injury, the incident was described [...] "he was knocked heavily into the boards by Toronto's Teeder Kennedy".|$|E

Later in the day, Pelham Warner, one of the England managers, visited the Australian dressing room. He expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, this movie <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E
500|$|In the 1906 season, Flick {{played a}} league-leading 157 games. He {{led the league}} with 700 plate appearances, 624 at-bats, 98 runs scored, 22 triples, and 39 stolen bases (tied with John Anderson). However, Flick was [...] "said to be {{dissatisfied}} with the team", and the Naps considered trading him to the Detroit Tigers for Matty McIntyre. Before the 1907 season, the Naps turned down a trade with the Tigers which would have exchanged Flick for the 21-year-old Ty Cobb. Hughie Jennings, the Tigers' manager, was tired of dealing with Cobb's abrasive behavior. The Naps refused to part with Flick, even in exchange for Cobb. They countered with Bunk Congalton, but the Tigers declined. Flick had been holding out but he signed {{a few days after}} the proposed trade. After Cobb was nearly traded away, Jennings attempted to repair the difficult relationships between Cobb and the other Detroit players. [...] "Cobb <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> a hitter to let get away, when a little diplomacy will get the boys together", Jennings said. In the 1907 season, Flick again led the league with 18 triples.|$|E

Coach is shocked with disbelief and tells her that she's [...] "beautiful", but Lisa objects and begs him for one moment to analyze her physical appearance, which she is insecure about. Coach then realizes that Lisa resembles her mother, and says so. Lisa agrees and tries to continue on that her mother was not beautiful either, but finds herself unable to say it. Coach tells Lisa that she is more beautiful every day, regardless of her appearance, just as her mother was more beautiful every day. Finally, Lisa feels self-confident and thanks her father for his comments.|$|E

500|$|Undeterred, Bonniwell {{successfully}} negotiated his recording {{contract with}} Original Sound {{be transferred to}} Warner Bros. Records, in hopes of finding {{a greater degree of}} independence. The Music Machine's spell with Original Sound was drawing to a conclusion, though the company did release [...] "Hey Joe" [...] as a single in 1968 in an attempt to cash in on Hendrix's success with the song. There was also the Bonniwell solo project in association with producer Paul Buff that resulted in the rare [...] "Nothing <b>Is</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Good</b> for My Car" [...] single being put out under the name the Friendly Torpedoes. Writer Greg Russo, who composed the liner notes for the single's remastered release, explains the side-project was initiated during a confusing transitional phase for Bonniwell that also generated the tune [...] "Citizen Fear", which did not receive distribution until the Ignition album in 2000. Free from company pressure, Bonniwell formed a new band, rechristened The Bonniwell Music Machine, with session musicians Ed Jones on bass guitar, Harry Garfield on organ, Alan Wisdom on lead guitar, and Jerry Harris on drums.|$|E

After hearing the rough version of the song, on which they were still working on, he became interested in it, asking what project the song belonged to. Carey explained to him the concept and how the song {{would be used for}} the film Hero. Mottola immediately took an intense liking to the song, responding, [...] "Are you kidding me? You can't give this song to this movie. This <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>good.</b> Mariah, you have to take this song. You have to do it." [...] Initially, Carey was guided by the subject of the film, but Afanasieff acknowledged that she made it a very personal song after deciding to keep it, altering some of the lyrics, key and instrumentation.

[...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an hour about as fine as there is on the tube" [...] with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E

500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response.

500|$|A {{columnist}} {{from the}} British newspaper New! described [...] "Bye Bye" [...] as their [...] "favorite track" [...] and wrote, [...] "the delicious 'Bye Bye' {{is a classic}} slushy Mariah ballad, with a swoonsome chorus."

While ABC News writer, Steve Jones, described how [...] "Bye Bye" [...] packed the bum with [...] "an emotional wallop", The Washington Posts Freedom De Luc compared it heavily to [...] "Don't Forget About Us", Carey's 2005 single. De Luc wrote how both shared similar piano instrumentation, however different lyrical settings; [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] finds Carey playing a [...] "broken-hearted lover", while [...] "Bye Bye" [...] an [...] "inspirational song that comes with {{its own set of}} suggested demographics and instructions." [...] Some reviewers felt the song was a sub-par effort from an artist of Carey's stature, with many describing it as unoriginal and not a good follow-up single to [...] "Touch My Body". Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watsman felt [...] "Bye Bye" [...] was an [...] "odd choice" [...] for a second single, and called it [...] "somber edgy". Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as a [...] "shmaltzy ballad", while an anonymous VH1 critic wrote [...] "with the âWe Belong Togetherâ sonic template and lyrics tailored appeal to everyone on such a basic level seems like too easy of a combination for someone as established as Mimi.

Cosby is delightful, and his series is both funny and intelligent." [...] He also described the family as [...] "amazingly real". According to Associated Press syndicated writer Jerry Buck, in the episode, [...] "Cosby handles his son {{in a manner that is}} not only funny but intelligent." [...] Mike Boone of The Gazette described Cosby and Ayers-Allen as [...] "credible parents" [...] and Cosby's fatherly advice as a [...] "delightful confrontation". Boone also noted that [...] "understanding the special world of children" [...] has always been a part of Cosby's comedy, and that this was present in the comical scene where Cliff and Theo discuss serious matters using play money.

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>good</b> for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, he feels like he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E
