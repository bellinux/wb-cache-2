He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than the last time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E

The doctor, only <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Allen, taught the younger Allen {{a great deal about}} philosophy and political theory, while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist.

5|$|Harding {{first came}} to know Florence Kling, <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than he, as the {{daughter}} of a local banker and developer. Amos Kling was a man accustomed to getting his way, but Harding attacked him relentlessly in the paper. Amos involved Florence in all his affairs, taking her to work from the time she could walk. As hard-headed as her father, Florence came into conflict with him after returning from music college. After she eloped with Pete deWolfe, and returned to Marion without deWolfe, but with an infant called Marshall, Amos agreed to raise the boy, but would not support Florence, who made a living as a piano teacher. One of her students was Harding's sister Charity. By 1886, Florence Kling had obtained a divorce, and she and Warren Harding were courting, though who was pursuing whom is uncertain, depending on who later told the story of their romance.|$|E
5|$|Smythe's {{first home}} was 51 McMillan Street, {{now known as}} Mutual Street, {{not far from the}} future site of Maple Leaf Gardens. He was the second of two {{children}} born to Mary and Albert. Conn had a sister, Mary, <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>older,</b> who died due to illness in 1903. The family was poor and moved several times during Smythe's youth, the size of lodgings depending on Albert Smythe's wages at the time. At one point, Albert and Conn moved to a house in Scarborough while Mary and Polly stayed on North Street. Conn's mother Mary died in 1906, and Smythe attributes his mother's drinking with making him a lifelong abstainer from alcohol. At age eleven Conn was christened {{and that was the first}} time that he insisted on Conn instead of his given name of Constantine. Albert and Conn became estranged after Albert began a new relationship with Jane Henderson. The two married in 1913 and had a daughter Moira.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey had seen {{him while he was}} working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> than Morrissey, believed that he was too old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E

40|$|Diarrhea is a {{communicable}} disease that caused by virus, bacteria or protozoa. Diarrhea can cause malnutrition, dehidration, even mortality. Therefore diarrhea must be prevented especially for susceptible people like children under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>old.</b> One {{of the areas}} in Kota Medan, which have the incident of diarrhea among children under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> relatively high is Kelurahan Terjun. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the correlation between latrine sanitation and clean water resources and the incident of diarrhea among children under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> at Kelurahan Terjun.

The population is all of children under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> at three Lingkungan that has the most number of children under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> as many as 492 people. The samples of 30 children under <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> was taken by systematic random sampling technique.

The research results showed the correlation between latrine sanitation especially the USAge of latrine and water with incident of diarrhea among children under <b>five</b> <b>year</b> at Kelurahan Terjun. The correlation was proved by the probabilities number of USAge of latrine (p = 0, 015) and bacteriological quality of water (p = 0, 002) are less than 0, 05. The conclusion of this study is not eligible latrine sanitation causing water resources contaminated by feces.

Sarah Barnett suffered from neuralgia, but her health improved during their time in Florida, so the Barnetts returned to Kansas, liquidated their assets, and relocated to Jacksonville in March 1877. Bion, who was a college senior, withdrew from school to join his parents three months before graduation.|$|E
