25|$|In this study, {{participants}} {{were assigned to}} one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the {{participants were}} allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{further study}} might examine {{cultural}} contexts more fully, as culture and intercultural differences {{may play a}} role in the <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> <b>This</b> is especially important given that the majority <b>of</b> participants in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> reported India as their native country, yet does not mitigate the importance <b>of</b> the novel <b>findings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b>|$|R

50|$|Researchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal {{studied the}} socio-emotional {{development}} of the bonobo chimpanzee. They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It {{was found that the}} bonobos sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.|$|E
50|$|The varying vegetation, climates, {{rivers and}} landforms {{in the park}} have created an area rich in {{habitats}} for native animals. A {{study was conducted in}} 1996 on the fauna found at the Cathedral Range State Park. The <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was that the park is home to seventeen native mammals, eight reptiles, one amphibian, one fish and eighty-seven native birds. Common animals observed in the park include the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), the superb lyrebird (Menura novaehollandiae), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and satin bowerbird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus). Mountain galaxias (Galaxias olidus), a native freshwater fish, was observed in the Little River just before the Little River falls. It is thought that these falls act as a barrier to trout, one of the major predators of the Mountain Galaxias. There have also been occasional sightings of the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus) in the Little River.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study on}} the nature of mixed-orientation marriages was {{conducted}} in 2002 at Deakin University, Australia. This study was conducted on 26 men: of these 26 men, 50% thought they were gay before their mixed-orientation marriage and 85% identified as gay after their mixed-orientation marriage. An interesting <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is that, [...] "the two most common reasons cited (for engaging in mixed-orientation marriages) were that it 'seemed natural' (cited by65.4%), and that they 'wanted children and family life' (65.4%)." [...] This finding is later contrasted with an earlier study, [...] "These (two) reasons seem different from the most frequentones found by Ross (1983) which focused on social expectancy and concerns over homosexuality." [...] Though these and other findings are of great intrigue, there are limitations as to what can be extrapolated from the data {{and the author of the}} Deakin University study agrees, [...] "Further research with men, women and children of these 'mixed-orientation marriages' is needed to develop a theoretical understanding of the causes, processes and impactof marriage (and marriage-breakdown) in gay and bisexual men." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the same}} study, {{researchers}} {{were able to}} detect viral particles of MBCTV in beet leafhopper guts after as soon as an hour of feeding on infected plants. Furthermore, they found that insects that had fed on an infected plant for an hour were able to spread the disease to uninfected plants. These {{findings suggest that the}} insects become virulent very shortly after feeding on infected plants. The study also found that as time of feeding on infected plants increased, the numbers of viral particles in the gut, hemocoel and salivary glands of the insects also increased, even though there were individual differences in the amounts of BMCTV particles detected in the body. Another important <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was showing that individual insects can maintain MBCTV in their bodies for up to a 30 days after getting infected by it, even though the amount of virus detected does not increase in this period. The authors propose that this indicates that MBCTV is unable to replicate within its vector. It was also found that the virus is not transmitted between generations of beet leafhoppers from adults to nymphs, proposing that the virus does not use transovarial transmission.|$|E
5000|$|The major <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is {{that the}} human {{cognition}} contains three components, or three broad types of [...] "cultural rules of behavior", namely, Values, Expectations, and Ad Hoc Rules, {{each of which has}} a mutually conditioning relationship with behavior. The three cognitive components are different in terms of the scope and duration of their mutual shaping of behavior. Values are universal and enduring rules of behavior; Expectations, on the other hand, are context-specific behavioral rules; while Ad Hoc Rules are improvised rules of behavior that the human mind devises contingent upon a particular occasion. Furthermore, they need not be consistent, and frequently are not, among themselves. Metaphorically, they can be compared to a multi-carriage train, which allows for the relative lateral movements by individual carriages so as to accommodate bumps and turns in the tracks. In fact, they provide a [...] "shock-absorber mechanism", so to speak, which enables individuals in SW-ICCM contexts to cope with conflicts in cultural practices and values, and to accommodate and adapt themselves to cultural contexts where people from different national cultural backgrounds work together over extended time. It also provides a powerful framework which explains how interactions by individuals in SW-ICCM contexts give rise to emerging hybrid cultural practices characterized by both stability and change.|$|E
5000|$|Environmental variables, such as {{the amount}} of sunlight, {{occurrence}} of natural disasters, and the inability to protect and shelter oneself, can result in suicidal behaviors. For example, parasuicide, which is the strongest known indicator for a future completed suicide attempt, is known to have a strong association with weather patterns. As noted by Barker et al. in their 1994 article on seasonal and weather factors in parasuicide, “A major <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> was…the greatest mean daily number of parasuicide episodes in late spring/early summer and a trough in December/January”. Their approach involved developing a linear model to accurately separate any “seasonal effects and seasonally-related weather effects”. Climate factors affect parasuicide differently in women and men. The data indicated that the meteorological factors to account for large parasuicidal effects in women were maximum temperature, rainfall, and cloud cover. On the other hand, rain, cloud cover, poor visibility, and windy days were the most important meteorological factors in men. Additionally, “environmental temperature, wind and humidity together affect the rate of body cooling, with hot, humid, still days decreasing evaporative cooling”. These findings state that elevated levels of environmental heat have been known to “produce thermal stress causing physiological and behavioral change, which may predispose a person to parasuicidal behavior, or precipitate parasuicide in someone already considering it”.|$|E

5000|$|The START {{research}} center also completed a project titled Organizational Dimensions of Risk Communication during Homeland Security Crises. This project focuses on risk communication at the organizational level by “exploring how communications within and among organizations affect risk management and risk communication about bioterrorism." [...] This project aims to improve communication about bioterrorism between organizations and their public. For this study, researchers {{focused on the}} anthrax attacks of 2001. The researchers conducted over 50 interviews with local {{people who were in}} positions with agency such as law enforcement officers, elected officials, and health professionals. Researchers asked the participants to describe how decisions were made in their organizations and how information was communicated from their organizations. Forms of written communication such as electronic correspondence and reports were also analyzed. This study produced 5 major findings. The first is “Organizations faced both technical and social uncertainties." [...] These uncertainties included that the authorities in the situation were unclear, and these uncertainties negatively affected risk communication. The second major <b>finding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> is “Organizational networks were essential for risk communication to the public and workers." [...] This means that successful risk communication depends on how effective the communication process is between agencies. The third major finding is “Relationships among local professional first responders and public health agencies were often constructive." [...] Informal methods of communication between law enforcement officers and health professionals help facilitate communication to the public. The fourth major finding is, “Communication problems resulted from lack of communication triage." [...] This means that organizations did not prioritize their many audiences or their channels for reaching those audiences. The fifth and final major finding is, “The concept of elite panic needs further conceptualizing and research." [...] Researchers noticed the concept of elite panic during the interview analysis process. This concept needs to be better understood to improve crisis communication.|$|E
