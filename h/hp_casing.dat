50|$|The {{single shaft}} five {{cylinder}} impulse-reaction turbine has a double flow arrangement for the I.P. cylinders {{as well as}} for the L.P. cylinders. There are double casings on H.P., I.P., and L.P. cylinders, and the last stages of the L.P. are fitted with 914.4 mm (36 in) blades. Stop valves and governor valves are situated at the inlet to the H.P. strainers and I.P. turbine. There are four 228.6 mm (9 in) bore main steam pipes, and four 431.8 mm (17 in) bore pipes on both the hot and cold reheat circuits to the turbine. In view of the size and increased volume of pipework compared to earlier designs, special attention was paid to mounting the valve chests as close to the machine as possible to reduce the stored energy effect of overspeed. For the H.P. valves this is done without actually mounting the valves on the cylinder, thus avoiding complication of the <b>H.P.</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Case StudyA 1957 vintage {{multi-stage}} centrifugal compressor, {{critical in}} a refrigeration process, {{had a history}} of poor reliability and LP stage bearing failures. Around 1995 the <b>HP</b> <b>casing</b> had been replaced and upgraded. In early 2010, the compressor suffered a major failure, including rubbing internally due to a thrust bearing failure, and damages to the shaft and drive end coupling. A new rotor and new gear type coupling were installed, both matching the original design. Since the start up after this, the thrust and journal bearings had failed approximately once per month greatly reducing the reliability of the compressor and plant profitability. To eliminate this problem, it was decided to change the coupling and to redesign and replace the bearings from the LP compressor, within the very limited spacing of the original bearing assemblies...|$|E
40|$|One {{example of}} {{excessive}} vibration encountered during loading of a centrifugal compressor train (H type compressor with <b>HP</b> <b>casing)</b> is discussed. An investigation {{was made of}} the effects of the dynamic load on the bearing stiffness and the rotor-bearing system critical speed. The high vibration occurred at a "threshold load," but the machine didn't run smoothly due to rubs even when it had passed through the threshold load. The acquisition and discussion of the data taken in the field as well as a description of the case history which utilizes background information to identify the malfunction conditions is presented. The analysis shows that the failures, including full reverse precession rub and exact one half subharmonic vibration, were caused by the oversize bearings and displacement of the rotor center due to foundation deformation and misalignment between gear shafts, etc. The corrective actions taken to alleviate excessive vibration and the problems which remain to be solved are also presented...|$|E

40|$|Thick walled {{components}} such as {{high pressure}} (<b>HP)</b> steam turbine <b>casings</b> operating under high parameter conditions are subjected to a complex stress state. As {{a result of that}} stress state, some parts of <b>HP</b> turbine <b>casing</b> undergo to the creep fatigue caused by the combination of thermal fatigue resulted from repeated start/stop operation and the creep which occurs during long-term operation at high temperature and high-pressure. It is well known that domestic thermal power plants have been in use over 100000 h which means that significant cost is required not only for maintenance, but often for renewal of equipment. Based on comprehensive investigation, the results of residual life assessment of one high pressure steam turbine casing, which belongs to the older turbine generation, taking into account simultaneous action of thermal fatigue and creep, are presented in this paper. Also, the critical flaw crack size of <b>HP</b> turbine <b>casing</b> is determined because this parameter has a strong influence on casing integrity and residual life. The results of residual life assessment provide not only a basis for further maintenance, but also estimated time for reparation or renewal...|$|R
40|$|The first relief wells emerged out of necessity, {{and have}} since been shaped by several {{disastrous}} events throughout the 20 th and 21 th century. The modern relief well shows {{little resemblance to the}} first relief wells that were drilled in the early 20 th century. Today?s relief wells are drilled to directly intersect a blowing wellbore at depths of several thousand meters, and often with a diameter of less than one foot. At these depths, conventional positioning surveying tools can yield horizontal errors approaching 100 meters, and therefore cannot offer the accuracy required to facilitate direct intersection between the two wells. Because of this, special survey tools have been developed to home in on the steel tubular in the blowing wellbore. Ranging Tools Two types of tools generally exist. Passive magnetostatic tools use conventional magnetic survey tools integrated into the bottomhole assembly to measure the remanent magnetism present in steel, and have a range of 15 meters. Active electromagnetic tools apply an alternating (AC) current to the blowing tubular to inducing a magnetic field around the blowing wellbore. This current can either be applied directly to the casing of the blowing well at the surface, or be injected into the subsurface formations through an injector electrode integrated into the tool. Under ideal conditions, a downhole sensor package can detect the magnetic field at a distance of 60 meters. This survey method traditionally requires a specialized electromagnetic survey string to be run into the hole. Wellbore Positioning Surveys To be able to utilize magnetic ranging instruments to home in on the casing of the blowing well, conventional surveys must be able to safely position the relief well within the maximum ranging distance from the blowing well. Considering uncertainty in wellbore position of both wells, this can be a challenge. Typical relief well strategies involves drilling towards the blowing well, using conventional magnetic positioning surveys integrated into the measurements while drilling (MWD) package. Before the large uncertainty makes premature interception possible, a gyro-survey is performed to reduce the positioning uncertainty. Once the wells are within the ranging distance from each other, the homing in process can start. Trajectory Requirements Generally it is desired to intersect the blowing well at a relatively narrow angle of between 3 and 15 º. Because of the surface conditions at the blowing well site, the relief well is often spudded more than one kilometer away. Because of these two conditions, the relief well is drilled at a high angle to approach the blowing well, and is dropped down to near parallel before intersection is made. To increase the accuracy of the homing-in tools, a triangulation approach is often utilized. This is performed by drilling the relief well past the blowing well, at a relative distance of around 10 meters, before it drops down and is drilled parallel to the target well. This technique can reduces the uncertainty of the homing-in measurements to below one meter. Once the wells are at this distance from each other, the pressure drawdown will most likely cause the formation between the wells to collapse, creating a direct hydraulic communication between the wells. Depth of Intersection Because of the inherent nature of the surveying techniques utilized to home in on the target, steel must be present in the blowing wellbore. Most often this means that the last set casing shoe will be the deepest point possible to intersect. This means that if an openhole section exists below the casing shoe, this cannot be utilized during the bottom kill operation. Surface Seismic While Drilling Johansen et al. (2013) suggested using repeated Surface Seismic While Drilling (SSWD) to measure the relative distance between the two wells in real time, as the relief well is being drilled. This is performed by acquiring seismic reference data before drilling is initiated, then the seismic survey is repeated continuously as the bit propagates down into the earth. If the reference seismic data is subtracted from the newly acquired seismic data, this will yield only the changes in the subsurface. Hence, the true wellpath can be found. This method has the potential of facilitating a direct intersection, regardless of the presence of steel in the blowing wellbore. Simulation Results Simulations were performed to evaluate the benefits of a deeper intersection point. The results showed that a casing shoe intersection would require an injection rate of 290 l/s to dynamically kill the blowing well with seawater. If the well were intersected at the bottom, the dynamic killing rate was reduced to 151 l/s, or a reduction of 48 %. The pump power requirements are dependent on the injection method, but the minimum pump power was 19759 and 4942 <b>hp,</b> for <b>casing</b> shoe- and bottomhole intersection, respectively. This is a total reduction of 75 %. The casing shoe pressure during killing was reduced by 21 %. When circulating from the bottom, calculations showed that the well could be killed using a high-capacity drilling rig utilizing the mud circulation system and the cement pumps. A casing shoe intersection required several additional pumps. Depending on deck capacity, pumping vessels or an additional rig would have to be mobilized, increasing the cost of the operation and mobilization time...|$|R
