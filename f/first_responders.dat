5|$|The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the high-voltage batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no medical}} {{facilities}} on Herm and no resident doctor.

Medical evacuation to hospital in Guernsey, where necessary, is achieved by means of the ambulance launch 'Flying Christine III' operated by the Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service.|$|E
5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode draws {{comparisons}} {{to the plight of}} <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> to the September 11 attacks by showing firefighters (with guest star Vincent Laresca playing one) dying as a consequence of responding to the Battle of New York, as seen in Marvel's The Avengers. The episode also features a major skydiving sequence, realized by combining live footage with CGI, as part of the development of the characters Fitz and Simmons, who received their own musical theme for the episode.

Advanced care and transportation to local hospitals is provided by Urgences-santé. In 2008-2009, the Montreal Fire Department implemented an island-wide <b>first</b> <b>responder</b> system. It was set to replace the Côte-Saint-Luc EMS; however, the city fought to keep their system.

She subsequently took {{a leading role in}} investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 <b>first</b> <b>responders.</b> Clinton voted for the USA Patriot Act in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties, before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by <b>first</b> <b>responders.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2010, General Motors began a {{training}} program for <b>first</b> <b>responders</b> when performing rescue duties involving the Chevrolet Volt. The program began at the 2010 Fire-Rescue International in Chicago, using a pre-production Volt for a live extrication exercise. Chicago firefighters demonstrated the sequence of tasks required to safely disable the vehicle’s powertrain and its 12-volt electrical system, which controls its high-voltage components, and then proceed to extricate injured occupants. , additional training workshops {{had taken place in}} several other cities corresponding to the Volt's initial launch markets. An Emergency Response Guide for the 2011 Volt was made available at its Service Technical College for use by emergency responders. The guide also describes methods of disabling the high voltage system and identifies cut zone information.|$|E
