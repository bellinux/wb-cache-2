The crew encountered a minor problem when Atlantis's <b>General</b> <b>Purpose</b> <b>Computer</b> (GPC3) failed. However, this held no impacts for the rendezvous and docking operations as two GPCs proved sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Stability {{constants}} {{defined in}} this way, are association constants. This {{can lead to}} some confusion as pKa values are dissociation constants.

25|$|Logic cut to {{the heart}} of {{computer}} science as it emerged as a discipline: Alan Turing's work on the Entscheidungsproblem followed from Kurt Gödel's work on the incompleteness theorems. The notion of the <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computer</b> that came from this work was of fundamental importance to the designers of the computer machinery in the 1940s.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computer</b> software design environment, a primary characteristic of embedded environments is {{the sheer number of}} different platforms available to the developers (CPU architectures, vendors, operating systems and their variants). Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms.|$|E
500|$|MITS was now $300,000 in {{debt and}} Roberts {{was looking for a}} new hit product. He decided to return to the kit market with a low cost computer. The target {{customer}} would think that [...] "some assembly required" [...] was a desirable feature. Roberts had looked at the Intel 4004 for calculators and thought the Intel 8008 was limited and difficult to work with. Intel had just released the 8080, their first microprocessor that could be a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computer.</b> The target price of this complete computer kit had to be under $400. To meet this price, Roberts agreed to order 1000 microprocessors from Intel for $75 each. Roberts and his head engineer, Bill Yates, began designing the computer. The company was down to 20 employees and a bank loan for $60,000 financed the design and initial production of the new computer.|$|E

2500|$|Assigning a data type, termed typing, gives {{meaning to}} a {{sequence}} of bits such as a value in memory or some object such as a variable. The hardware of a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computer</b> is unable to discriminate between for example a memory address and an instruction code, or between a character, an integer, or a floating-point number, because it makes no intrinsic distinction between any of the possible values that {{a sequence of}} bits might mean. Associating a sequence of bits with a type conveys that [...] to the programmable hardware to form a symbolic system composed of that hardware and some program.|$|E

50|$|For {{problems}} that can be expressed as differential equations, a DDA can solve them much faster than a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computer</b> (using similar technology). However reprogramming a DDA to solve a different problem (or fix a bug) is much harder than reprogramming a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computer.</b> Many DDAs were hardwired for one problem only {{and could not be}} reprogrammed without redesigning them.|$|E

40|$|Integrating {{reconfigurable}} computing hardware into <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computers</b> offers {{promise of}} performance improvement. <b>General</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>computers</b> {{allows for a}} large amount of multitasking, as such, the reconfigurable hardware integrated intosuch a system should also support multitasking. This requires a low overhead reconfiguration method that supports preemption of tasks running on reconfigurablehardware. To investigate methods that can integrate reconfigurable hardware intoa multitasking machine an architecture for a reconfigurable device is proposed. In this work the proposed architecture is taken to prototype level. This includesa definition of the computational properties of the basic reconfigurable blocks, areconfiguration method that can fit within the requirements of multitasking, a configuration format that allows for backwards binary compatibility, and support forrudimentary control flow. The resulting prototype system has been tested andevaluated...|$|R
