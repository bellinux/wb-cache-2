50|$|By the 1930s, {{the name}} had changed to Hill Packing Company which {{included}} a milling division, Hill Milling company. At this time the company was producing farm animal <b>feed,</b> <b>dog</b> food and horse meat for human consumption, processing 500 head of horse per week. The meat was being shipped to markets in Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands. Much of the Horse meat was sold to the east coast as a product called Chopped and Cured and shipped to Europe as barreled horse loins.In 1948 Mark L. Morris contacted Hill Packing company to produce Canine k/d, Hill Packing company became the license producer of Canine k/d. In 1968, the food line was made available through veterinarians and pet professionals as Hill's Science Diet. The line has continued to expand, and today includes more than 60 Prescription Diet brand pet foods (prescription foods for cats and dogs with specific diseases, only available through a vet or pet pharmacy) and Science Diet brand pet foods (sold through veterinarians and pet specialty stores). In 1968, Hill Packing company was sold to Riviana Foods then in 1976 the Colgate-Palmolive Company merged with Riviana Foods. Today, Hill's pet food products are available in 86 {{countries around the world}} and company sales reached $1 billion in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{establishment}} of Scott Base in 1956, seals have been killed annually to <b>feed</b> <b>dog</b> teams at Scott Base (Stonehouse and Thomson, 1967). No {{attempt was made to}} determine the effect of killing on the stock. In 1961, the Canterbury University Antarctic Biology Unit under Dr Bernard Stonehouse began assessing population parameters of the Weddell seal in eastern McMurdo Sound. To this end the unit became responsible the annual kills and weighed, measured, and collected skeletal and anatomical material. For example, over 260 skulls were collected for the development of ageing techniques. A series of papers and theses have been completed by the Canterbury Unit. A general study of the parasites of the Weddell seal with special consideration of the bile duct cestode Glandiocephalus perfoliatus was done by Featherston (1965). M. S. R. Smith studied the Weddell seal in McMurdo Sound from 1961 to 1965. He described in detail; the physiology of the male and female reproductive cycles (Smith, 1966 a); made population counts and recorded daily and seasonal movements (Smith, 1965); studied the louse Antarotophthirius ogmorhini on the Weddell seal (Murray, et. al., 1965); and accumulated data on injuries to the Weddell seal (Smith, 1966 b) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{an interesting}} array of facts about Chinese common nouns in some detail. For example, Chinese common nouns, in their bare forms, often stand alone at argument positions, display {{a variety of}} context-sensitive interpretations, never combine with numerals without an intervening classifier, and combine with a plurality marker in a highly selective way. It is argued that this wide array of language-particular properties can best be explained by extending to Chinese the basic hypothesis that bare NPÕs are kind-denoting terms cross-linguistically (Carlson 1977, etc). 1 Introduction In Chinese, a non-inflectional language, common nouns very often appear in a bare form, without any modifier or determiner. The semantics {{of this type of}} NPÕs has remained a mystery, mainly {{due to the fact that}} they appear to have various interpretations when they occur in different linguistic contexts Ñ generic in some cases, definite or indefinite in others, as shown in (1) : (1) a. Gou shi burudongwu. b. Wo xihuan gou. dog be mammal I like dog ÔDogs are mammals. Õ ÔI like dogs. Õ c. Gou zai jiao. d. Wo wei gou qu-le. dog at bark I <b>feed</b> <b>dog</b> go-Asp i. ÔThe/A dog is barking. Õ ÔI went to feed some dogs. Õ ii. ÔDogs are barking. Õ The hypothesis IÕd like to explore, here, is that in all these sentences, the basic interpretation of the Chinese bare NP remains the same: a reference to kind, while the apparent variability in its quantificational force actually comes from the predicational context. The idea of treating bare NPÕs as kind-denoting terms is, of course, not novel. First suggested for English bare plurals by G. Carlson in his (1977) dissertation, it has since been supported cross-linguistically by many linguists (cf. Porterfield & Srivastav (1988), Chierchia (1982 a, 1982 b), Day [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} results of a study of {{problems}} associated with fabric sewing, such as seam pucker and sewing damage, in commercial garment manufacture. Part 1 continues previous work by the author on seam pucker in structurally jammed fabrics; in particular {{it has been shown that}} initial Young's modulus of a fabric is a measure of the ability of the fabric to accommodate compressive forces during sewing. This result provides an additional means of predicting the tendency of a fabric to exhibit seam pucker. The static mechanism of seam pucker proposed previously, based upon the relative magnitudes of bending stiffness of thread and fabric, has been revised by establishing that sewing machine dynamics and pucker are closely related. It has been shown that presser foot bouncing in particular induces pucker and that the sewing thread needs to be positively controlled during stitch formation. These results were verified by simple experimental methods, suggesting that modifications to the sewing machine are needed. Such modifications are beyond the scope of this work. Following the earlier static mechanism of seam pucker, it has been shown that seam pucker in fabrics is reduced significantly when the bending stiffness and extensibility of the sewing thread is reduced. In addition seam pucker can be eliminated by improving fabric stiffness locally along the seam area, by incorporating a stiffening material in the seam; this is based upon the technique of pucker elimination found in the author's previous work. In this study this technique is implemented with considerable success in other types of seams and commercially available stiffening materials have been selected. Part 2 investigates sewing damage to fabrics due to sewing needle penetration. Preliminary studies suggested the need for a reliable testing facility. This was made by instrumenting an industrial overlock sewing machine. The instrumentation was based on measuring the force which is exerted by the sewing needle when penetrating the fabric. The testing facility consists of the sewing machine with a strain gauged sewing needle and plate, and a shaft encoder for stitch marking, which with proper signal amplification and conditioning could be fed to a transient recorder and osciloscope for signal capturing and plotting. Investigations with fabrics revealed that the magnitude of the peak force of each stitch cycle can be related to the degree of sewing damage in the fabric. Based on these results the most important variables in sewing damage were fabric softening and its effective application during finishing, and sewing needle size. Studies of sewing damage under dynamic conditions have shown that sewing damage is a frictional problem between yarns in the fabric and between yarns and the metal of the sewing needle, foot, plate and <b>feed</b> <b>dog.</b> The size of the needle plate of the sewing machine seems to affect the degree of damage and fabric "flagging" during sewing damage has been experienced. Finally in the latter section of this study a prototype routine sewing damage tester has been developed and each stage of its development is described. This tester is based on an instrumented overlock sewing machine, which is interfaced with an IBM PC for computerised data capture and analysis in real time. ...|$|E

50|$|To begin any machine quilting, {{the three}} {{layers of the}} quilt, the quilt top, batting and backing fabric, are {{temporarily}} basted with safety pins. Stitching {{in a straight line}} is normally accomplished by replacing the normal presser foot with an even feed walking foot attachment. This gadget was designed to avoid puckering by advancing multiple layers {{at the same rate as}} the <b>feed</b> <b>dogs</b> of the machine. With the <b>feed</b> <b>dogs</b> up, the length of the stitch is controlled by the stitch length setting of the machine.|$|R
50|$|A {{manual feed}} is used {{primarily}} in freehand embroidery, quilting, and shoe repair. With manual feed, the stitch length and direction is controlled entirely by {{the motion of}} the material being sewn. Frequently some form of hoop or stabilizing material is used with fabric to keep the material under proper tension and aid in moving it around.

50|$|Stretch stitch {{geometry}} {{is specifically}} for stretchability.

As the double cam rotates, the first follower rides along one track to move the needle bar from side to side, while the second follower rides along a different track to move the <b>feed</b> <b>dogs</b> forward and reverse.|$|R

When the <b>feed</b> <b>dogs</b> are lowered they do not advance the fabric; and with the darning foot merely hovering over the layers, the operator controls the stitch length {{as well as the}} direction of the stitching line by moving the quilt with their hands. The stitching can be made in any direction and to for curvilinear lines or straight patterns. Each design, whether drawn on the quilt top or held in the imagination of the quilter, is formed with a line of stitching that is guided by the movement of the quilt under the machine needle. The length of each stitch is determined by the distance the quilt has been moved since the previous stitch.|$|R
