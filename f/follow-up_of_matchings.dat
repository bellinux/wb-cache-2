40|$|This {{dissertation}} answers {{several questions}} in extremal graph theory, each concerning the maximum or {{minimum number of}} certain substructures a graph can have, given that it must satisfy certain properties. In recent {{years there has been}} increased interest in such problems, which are extremal problems for “counting” parameters of graphs. The results in this dissertation focus on graphs that have n vertices and e edges and 3 -uniform hypergraphs that have n vertices and e edges. ^ We first observe in the preliminaries chapter that for graphs with a fixed number of vertices and edges there is a threshold graph attaining the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>matchings.</b> The first two major results develop this fact in two different directions. In Chapter 3 we consider the problem of maximizing the number <b>of</b> <b>matchings</b> in the class of threshold graphs. We solve the problem completely, concluding that a graph in this class has the maximum number <b>of</b> <b>matchings</b> if and only if it is almost alternating. The second and more fundamental question is the problem of which threshold graph, and hence which graph, has the minimum number <b>of</b> <b>matchings.</b> Ahlswede and Katona determined which graph has the fewest <b>matchings</b> <b>of</b> size 2. In Chapter 4 we extend this result to all sizes <b>of</b> <b>matchings</b> and to the total number <b>of</b> <b>matchings.</b> We prove that either the lex graph or the colex graph minimizes the number <b>of</b> <b>matchings.</b> We further prove that the lex bipartite graph has the fewest matchings among all bipartite graphs with parts of fixed sizes. ^ Finally, in Chapter 5, we answer an extremal question about independent sets in hypergraphs. In a graph G = (V,E), a set A ⊆ V is independent if 2 ̆ 6 par;A ∩ e 2 ̆ 6 par; 3 ̆c 2 for all e ∈ E. The graph with n vertices and e edges achieving the maximum number of independent sets is the colex graph. In a hypergraph H = (V,E), a set A is s-independent if 2 ̆ 6 par;A ∩ E 2 ̆ 6 par; 3 ̆c s for all E ∈ E. The final chapter discusses results about maximizing s-independent sets in r-uniform hypergraphs, the most significant result finds the 3 -uniform hypergraph maximizing the number of 2 -independent sets for certain numbers of vertices and edges. ^...|$|R
