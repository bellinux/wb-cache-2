Roth had {{introduced}} Tarantino to him, saying: [...] "I {{want to work with}} Amanda <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> films, but she has to have a really big gun." [...] Yolanda is Ringo's girlfriend and partner in crime.|$|E
2500|$|Hellman aggravated {{the matter}} by {{claiming}} {{the real reason}} she turned down the benefit was because when the Spanish government fell to Franco's fascists, Hellman and Shumlin requested that Bankhead put on {{a benefit for the}} Spanish loyalists fleeing to neighboring France, and the actress and company refused. Bankhead was further incensed by this. Hellman and Bankhead would not speak again for 25 years. Years later, drama critic Joseph Wood Krutch recounted how he and fellow critic George Jean Nathan had shared a cab with Hellman and Bankhead:Bankhead said: [...] "That's the last time I act <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> god-damned plays". Miss Hellman responded by slamming her purse against the actress's jaw. ... I decided that no self-respecting Gila monster would have behaved in that manner.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I'll tell you,' said Fledgeby. 'I like to {{hear you}} ask it, because it's looking alive. It's what I should expect to find <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> sagacious understanding. Now, candidly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see it!' {{suddenly}} exclaimed Mrs. Edmonstone; 'I {{see what}} you are like <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> looks, not by any means, in all--it is to the larger of those two angels.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know who}} you are," [...] he replied, without moving. [...] "You are Caroline, Duchess of Winchester. I keep my hat upon my head because I owe you no respect and I feel none.
