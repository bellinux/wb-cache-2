5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he {{made the}} Orion episode <b>half</b> <b>again</b> longer {{than it was in}} the Greek, adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea is one of the oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.|$|E
5|$|There are {{symmetrical}} {{differences between}} the left- and right-hand sides of the painting. This is most noticeable with the buttress, where the receding edges are over <b>half</b> <b>again</b> the size {{of those on the}} front sides. In addition, the breadth of the buttress contradicts the spatial depth of the much tighter space inhabited by the Virgin and Child. This is a technical issue with foreshortening Campin also struggled with, but which van der Weyden resolves in his mature work.|$|E
5|$|Once interested, Soichiro Honda began {{developing}} the Super Cub {{on his return}} to Japan. The following year Honda displayed a mockup to Fujisawa that finally matched {{what he had in}} mind, Fujisawa declaring the annual sales would be 30,000 per month, <b>half</b> <b>again</b> as many as the entire monthly two-wheeler market in Japan. His goal was to export motorcycles on a scale yet unseen in the economic disorder of postwar Japan, when most companies' halting trade efforts were handled through foreign trading companies. Honda would have to establish its own overseas subsidiary to provide the necessary service and spare parts distribution in a large country like the United States. To this end American Honda Motor Company was founded in 1959. In 1961 a sales network was established in Germany, then in Belgium and the UK in 1962, and then France in 1964.|$|E

25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right. Fold it in <b>half</b> <b>again</b> to the right. If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become a 90 degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in <b>half</b> <b>again</b> to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E

25|$|The {{unemployment}} problem {{ended with}} the mobilization for war. Out of a labor force of 54 million, unemployment fell in half from 7.7 million in spring 1940 (when the first accurate statistics were compiled) to 3.4 million in fall 1941 and fell in <b>half</b> <b>again</b> to 1.5 million in fall 1942, hitting an all-time low of 700,000 in fall 1944. There was a growing labor shortage in war centers, with sound trucks going street by street begging for people to apply for war jobs.|$|E
25|$|By May 1964, Operation Hardnose had 20 espionage teams surveilling {{roads and}} manning radios in the {{vicinity}} of Saravane, and southwards to the Cambodian border. By the turn of the year, there were calls for further expansion of Hardnose; additional Thai PARU trainers were brought in. By September, the Hardnose road watchers had reported 5,000 People's Army of Vietnam troops moving south along the Ho Chi Minh trail. This was <b>half</b> <b>again</b> as many infiltrators as had been reported for all of 1964. The quickly growing transportation network included a new road in progress, Route 911, which would trim a third of the distance between the Mụ Giạ Pass and Tchepone.|$|E
25|$|The half time of {{a tissue}} is {{the time it takes}} for the tissue to take up or release 50% of the {{difference}} in dissolved gas capacity at a changed partial pressure. For each consecutive half time the tissue will take up or release <b>half</b> <b>again</b> of the cumulative difference in the sequence ½, ¾, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, 63/64 etc. Tissue compartment half times range from 1 minute to at least 720 minutes. A specific tissue compartment will have different half times for gases with different solubilities and diffusion rates. Ingassing is generally modeled as following a simple inverse exponential equation where saturation is assumed after approximately four (93.75%) to six (98.44%) half-times depending on the decompression model.|$|E

25|$|If an {{exponential}} uptake of gas is assumed, {{which is}} a good approximation of experimental values for diffusion in non-living homogenous materials, half time of a tissue is the time it takes for the tissue to take up or release 50% of the difference in dissolved gas capacity at a changed partial pressure. For each consecutive half time the tissue will take up or release <b>half</b> <b>again</b> of the cumulative difference in the sequence ½, ¾, 7/8, 15/16, 31/32, 63/64 etc. The number of half times chosen to assume full saturation depends on the decompression model, and typically ranges from 4 (93.75%) to 6 (98.44%). Tissue compartment half times range from 1 minute to at least 720 minutes.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{original}} plans, Mound City would have been protected by a casemate of iron 2.5inches (63mm) thick. The armor would have been pierced for 20 guns of various calibers and weights. Pook did not give specific instructions for {{the placement of the}} armor, however, so that problem had to be settled by Commander Rodgers. He insisted on greater thickness on the forward face of the casemate, and also that the pilot house, wheelhouse, and main deck be given some cover. In all, his modifications increased the weight of the armor to 122 tons, <b>half</b> <b>again</b> as much as Pook had intended. To compensate for the extra weight, the number of guns had to be reduced from 20 to only 13: three firing forward, four on each side, and two facing astern.|$|E
25|$|The second <b>half</b> <b>again</b> saw no touchdowns for the Tulsa offense. Twice Tulsa {{attempted}} to convert on a fourth down, but failed both times. The closest Tulsa progressed to the Oklahoma end {{zone in the}} second half was the Sooner's 27-yard line. Oklahoma, however, added two touchdowns {{in the second half}}. Oklahoma quarterback Landry Jones, in his second start, set a school record with six touchdown passes in a game. The previous record of five touchdown passes in a game was held by three Sooners: Jones's quarterback coach and Heisman Trophy runner-up Josh Heupel and Heisman Trophy-winners Jason White and Sam Bradford. Jones was later named the AT ESPN All-American National Player of the Week. This game also marked the second straight shutout by the Sooners, the first time since 1987. Oklahoma also extended their school record of consecutive wins at home to 26. Oklahoma finished the game with 529 yards of total offense and Tulsa with 269.|$|E

25|$|Among these trench-built solid-walled {{buildings}} were three that lay some distance {{west of the}} great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor {{referred to as the}} assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what {{appears to have been a}} wattle fence between them, and an associated building that Hope-Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple. No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers and stacked against the wall above the pit after space ran out, and there were <b>half</b> <b>again</b> as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually clayey soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free-standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burialstretched out and without grave goodswould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.|$|E
