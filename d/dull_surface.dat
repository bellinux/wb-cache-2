60|$|The sun was sinking lower; it {{had already}} touched {{the edge of the}} horizon, and was level with his dazzled and {{straining}} eyes.

60|$|Observe, however, {{in drawing}} any stuffs, or {{bindings}} of books, or other finely textured substances, do not trouble yourself, as yet, {{much about the}} woolliness or gauziness of the thing; but get it right in shade and fold, and true in pattern. We shall see, {{in the course of}} after-practice, how the penned lines may be made indicative of texture; but at present attend only to the light, and shade, and pattern. You will be puzzled at first by lustrous surfaces, but a little attention will show you that the expression of these depends merely on the right drawing of their light, and shade, and reflections. Put a small black japanned tray {{on the table in front}} of some books; and you will see it reflects the objects beyond it as in a little black rippled pond; its own colour mingling always with that of the reflected objects. Draw these reflections of the books properly, making them dark and distorted, as you will see that they are, and you will find that this gives the lustre to your tray. It is not well, however, to draw polished objects in general practice; only you should do one or two in order to understand the aspect of any lustrous portion of other things, such as you cannot avoid; the gold, for instance, on the edges of books, or the shining of silk and damask, in which lies a great part of the expression of their folds. Observe, also, that there are very few things which are totally without lustre: you will frequently find a light which puzzles you, on some apparently <b>dull</b> <b>surface,</b> to be the dim image of another object.|$|E
60|$|Our inn is one {{of those}} inns and lodging houses which have a minimum tariff, inns which are partly regulated, and, in the default of private enterprise, {{maintained}} and controlled by the World State throughout the entire world. It {{is one of}} several such establishments in Lucerne. It possesses many hundreds of practically self-cleaning little bedrooms, equipped very much after the fashion of the rooms we occupied in the similar but much smaller inn at Hospenthal, differing only a little in the decoration. There is the same dressing-room recess with its bath, the same graceful proportion in the succinct simplicity of its furniture. This particular inn is a quadrangle after the fashion of an Oxford college; it is perhaps forty feet high, and with about five stories of bedrooms above its lower apartments; the windows of the rooms look either outward or inward to the quadrangle, and the doors give upon artificially-lit passages with staircases passing up and down. These passages are carpeted with a sort of cork carpet, but are otherwise bare. The lower story is occupied by the equivalent of a London club, kitchens and other offices, dining-room, writing-room, smoking and assembly rooms, a barber's shop, and a library. A colonnade with seats runs about the quadrangle, and in the middle is a grass-plot. In the centre of this a bronze figure, a sleeping child, reposes above a little basin and fountain, in which water lilies are growing. The place has been designed by an architect happily free from the hampering traditions of Greek temple building, and of Roman and Italian palaces; it is simple, unaffected, gracious. The material is some artificial stone with the <b>dull</b> <b>surface</b> and something of the tint of yellow ivory; the colour is a little irregular, and a partial confession of girders and pillars breaks this front of tender colour with lines and mouldings of greenish gray, that blend with the tones of the leaden gutters and rain pipes from the light red roof. At one point only does any explicit effort towards artistic effect appear, and that is in the great arched gateway opposite my window. Two or three abundant yellow roses climb over the face of the building, and when I look out of my window in the early morning--for the usual Utopian working day commences within an hour of sunrise--I see Pilatus above this outlook, rosy in the morning sky.|$|E

50|$|Microfibers in {{textiles}} {{refer to}} sub-denier fiber (such as polyester drawn to 0.5 denier). Denier and Dtex are two measurements of fiber yield based on weight and length. If the fiber density is known, {{you also have}} a fiber diameter, otherwise it is simpler to measure diameters in micrometers. Microfibers in technical fibers refer to ultra fine fibers (glass or meltblown thermoplastics) often used in filtration. Newer fiber designs include extruding fiber that splits into multiple finer fibers. Most synthetic fibers are round in cross-section, but special designs can be hollow, oval, star-shaped or trilobal. The latter design provides more optically reflective properties. Synthetic textile fibers are often crimped to provide bulk in a woven, non woven or knitted structure. Fiber surfaces can also be dull or bright. <b>Dull</b> <b>surfaces</b> reflect more light while bright tends to transmit light and make the fiber more transparent.|$|R

50|$|In general {{a good-looking}} {{soldered}} joint {{is a good}} joint. As mentioned, it should be smooth, bright, and shiny. If the joint has lumps or balls of otherwise shiny solder the metal has not 'wetted' properly. Not being bright and shiny suggests a weak 'dry' joint. However, technicians trying to apply this guideline when using lead-free solder formulations may experience frustration, because these types of solders readily cool to a <b>dull</b> <b>surface</b> even if the joint is good. The solder looks shiny while molten, and suddenly hazes over as it solidifies {{even though it has}} not been disturbed during cooling.|$|E

5000|$|As {{more and}} more of the surface of Mars has been imaged by the modern {{generation}} of orbiters, it has become gradually more apparent that there are probably many more patches of ice scattered across the Martian surface. Many of these putative patches of ice are concentrated in the Martian midlatitudes (≈30-60° N/S of the equator). For example, many scientists believe that the widespread features in those latitude bands variously described as [...] "latitude dependent mantle" [...] or [...] "pasted-on terrain" [...] consist of dust- or debris-covered ice patches, which are slowly degrading. A cover of debris is required both to explain the <b>dull</b> <b>surfaces</b> seen in the images that do not reflect like ice, and also to allow the patches to exist for an extended period of time without subliming away completely. These patches have been suggested as possible water sources for some of the enigmatic channelized flow features like gullies also seen in those latitudes.|$|R

5000|$|... (Original description) The small shell has a straw-color or is pale {{brown with}} {{occasional}} spiral bands of darker brown, or all brown. It contains 6 whorls, {{of which the}} first whorl and a half are white, polished, smooth and turgid. The subsequent whorls of the shell have a <b>dull</b> <b>surface.</b> The earlier whorls have the periphery nearer the anterior suture, the whorl behind the periphery somewhat flattened and compressed, crossed by low obscure riblets, about a dozen on the fourth whorl, which become obsolete later. The whorl {{in front of the}} periphery shows no axial sculpture. The whole whorl is spirally sculptured with narrow sharp incised lines, one dividing the space behind the periphery, and about five in front of the periphery on the penultimate whorl. On the body whorl between the periphery and the siphonal fasciole there are about twelve of these lines, though they probably vary in number with the individual, while the incremental lines are moderately conspicuous. The outer lip is thin and simple. The columellar lips show a small deposit of white callus. The lunate aperture is narrow,. The siphonal canal is very short, wide, with an inconspicuous fasciole.|$|E
50|$|Boiled oil is the raw {{oil heated}} with driers, such as {{litharge}} or red lead, to a temperature from 350° to 500 °F, {{at which it}} is maintained {{for three or four}} hours. It is thick and much darker in color than the raw oil, drying much more quickly, with a coat hard and glossy but less elastic than that produced by raw oil. Poppy-seed oil is expressed from the seeds of the poppy plant. It does not possess the tenacity and quick-drying powers of boiled linseed oil, but being of a very light color it is used for delicate colors. Turpentine is used as a solvent, diluent, or thinner, to bring the paint to a proper consistency so as to allow it to be spread in a thin even coat. When a flat <b>dull</b> <b>surface</b> is desired, turpentine alone is used with the base and the oil is omitted. The best turpentine comes from the pine forests of America. French turpentine is next in quality. Russian turpentine is the cheapest, and has usually a strong and unpleasant odor that renders it objectionable to work with. In consequence of the high price of turpentine of good quality, and the increasing difficulty of obtaining it, substitutes are coming into general use. Driers are substances usually added to paint to hasten the process of oxidation, i.e. the drying, of the oil. Some pigments possess this quality, as red lead and white lead.|$|E
5000|$|The Standard Color Reference of America {{was issued}} in 1915 {{for the purpose}} of {{simplifying}} color work by standardizing color for the U.S. The card offers a palette for color choice {{and at the same time}} help to facilitate the selection of colors.

There are 16 pages of 12 colors each in the 10th edition. Each page offers a series of harmonious color combinations whether by color pairing or by groups. The Standard Color reference is a supplemented by a special U.S. Army Color Card showing, in silk ribbon form, the key shades of the U.S. Armed Forces, which are approved and accepted by the Quartermaster general. Like previously published editions, the new 1981 Standard reference presents a comprehensive palette for color choice and is a help to facilitate the selection and coordination of shades. Primarily directed to the fashion, textile and environmental industries. Note that the standards name or standard number will always signify the color so designated in this card. The names which have been adopted are purely descriptive and to be used only in such manner. In order to facilitate choice and coordination of colors, the pure silk samples have been arranged to afford the user a medium to visualize both the highlights and low-lights of each color.
