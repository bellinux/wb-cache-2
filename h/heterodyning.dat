5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, <b>heterodyning</b> {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, a {{superheterodyne}} receiver uses frequency mixing or <b>heterodyning</b> to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency, {{which can be}} more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency. Virtually all modern radio and television receivers use the superheterodyne principle. The {{superheterodyne receiver}} was invented in 1918 by Edwin Armstrong. It {{was introduced to the}} market place in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the term}} {{aliasing}} evolved from radio engineering {{because of the}} action of superheterodyne receivers. When the receiver shifts multiple signals down to lower frequencies, from RF to IF by <b>heterodyning,</b> an unwanted signal, from an RF frequency equally far from the local oscillator (LO) frequency as the desired signal, but {{on the wrong side}} of the LO, can end up at the same IF frequency as the wanted one. If it is strong enough it can interfere with reception of the desired signal. This unwanted signal is known as an image or alias of the desired signal.|$|E
40|$|A novel frequency-swept ultrasound-modulated optical {{tomography}} {{technique was}} developed to image scattering media. A frequency-swept ultrasonic wave was used to modulate the laser light passing through a scattering medium. The modulated light was received by an optical detector and was <b>heterodyned</b> with a reference frequency sweep. The <b>heterodyned</b> signal was recorded in the time domain and was then analyzed in the frequency domain to yield a one-dimensional image along the ultrasonic axis. Multiple one-dimensional images obtained at various positions perpendicular to the ultrasonic axis were combined to yield a two-dimensional tomographic image of the medium...|$|R

2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual <b>heterodyning</b> that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF band-pass filter and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E
2500|$|Fessenden was a {{significant}} figure {{in the development of}} AM radio. [...] He {{was one of the first}} researchers to realize, from experiments like the above, that the existing technology for producing radio waves, the spark transmitter, was not usable for amplitude modulation, and that a new kind of transmitter, one that produced sinusoidal continuous waves, was needed. [...] This was a radical idea at the time, because experts believed the impulsive spark was necessary to produce radio frequency waves, and Fessenden was ridiculed. [...] He invented and helped develop one of the first continuous wave transmitters - the Alexanderson alternator, with which he made what is considered the first AM public entertainment broadcast on Christmas Eve, 1906. [...] He also discovered the principle on which AM is based, <b>heterodyning,</b> and invented one of the first detectors able to rectify and receive AM, the electrolytic detector or [...] "liquid baretter", in 1902. [...] Other radio detectors invented for wireless telegraphy, such as the Fleming valve (1904) and the crystal detector (1906) also proved able to rectify AM signals, so the technological hurdle was generating AM waves; receiving them was not a problem.|$|E

The improvement in spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) as compared to conventional links is experimentally demonstrated. The link consists of two <b>heterodyned</b> lasers with one optical carrier modulated by a LiNbO 3 Mach-Zehnder modulator biased at the null point. This results in strong optical sidebands, minimum even order distortion, and more than similar to 40 -dB suppression of the-optical carrier. The first carrier's two optical sidebands are <b>heterodyned</b> with the second unmodulated optical carrier. The modulated optical carrier is suppressed reducing noise power and enhancing SFDR.

5000|$|Above {{the range}} of {{frequency}} counters, frequencies of electromagnetic signals are often measured indirectly by means of <b>heterodyning</b> (frequency conversion). A reference signal of a known frequency near the unknown frequency is mixed with the unknown frequency in a nonlinear mixing device such as a diode. This creates a heterodyne or [...] "beat" [...] signal at {{the difference between the}} two frequencies. If the two signals are close together in frequency the heterodyne is low enough to be measured by a frequency counter. This process only measures the difference between the unknown frequency and the reference frequency. To reach higher frequencies, several stages of <b>heterodyning</b> can be used. Current research is extending this method to infrared and light frequencies (optical heterodyne detection).|$|E

40|$|Time-expanded and <b>heterodyned</b> {{echolocation}} {{calls of}} the New Zealand long-tailed Chalinolobus tuberculatus and lesser short-tailed bat Mystacina tuberculata were recorded and digitally analysed. Temporal and spectral parameters were measured from time-expanded calls and power spectra generated for both time-expanded and <b>heterodyned</b> calls. Artificial neural networks {{were trained to}} classify the calls of both species using temporal and spectral parameters and power spectra as input data. Networks were then tested using data not previously seen. Calls could be unambiguously identified using parameters and power spectra from time-expanded calls. A neural network, trained and tested using power spectra of calls from both species recorded using a heterodyne detector set to 40 kHz (the frequency with the most energy of the fundamental of C. tuberculatus call), could identify 99 % and 84 % of calls of C. tuberculatus and M. tuberculata, respectively. A second network, trained and tested using power spectra of calls from both species recorded using a heterodyne detector set to 27 kHz (the frequency with the most energy of the fundamental of M. tuberculata call), could identify 34 % and 100 % of calls of C. tuberculatus and M. tuberculata, respectively. This study represents the first use of neural networks for the identification of bats from their echolocation calls. It is also the first study to use power spectra of time-expanded and <b>heterodyned</b> calls for identification of chiropteran species.

5000|$|When {{it comes}} to home VCRs, all video {{standards}} use what is called [...] "color under" [...] format. Color is extracted from the high frequencies of the video spectrum, {{and moved to the}} lower part of the spectrum available from tape. Luminance then uses what remains of it, above the color frequency range. This is usually done by <b>heterodyning</b> for PAL (as well as NTSC). But the FM nature of color in SECAM allows for a cheaper trick: division by 4 of the subcarrier frequency (and multiplication on replay). This became the standard for SECAM VHS recording in France. Most other countries kept using the same <b>heterodyning</b> process as for PAL or NTSC and this is known as MESECAM recording (as it was more convenient for some Middle East countries that used both PAL and SECAM broadcasts).|$|E
50|$|In {{large scale}} {{telecommunication}} networks such as telephone network trunks, microwave relay networks, cable television systems, and communication satellite links, large bandwidth capacity links {{are shared by}} many individual communication channels by using <b>heterodyning</b> to move {{the frequency of the}} individual signals up to different frequencies, which share the channel.

5000|$|<b>Heterodyning</b> is {{a signal}} {{processing}} technique invented in 1901 by Canadian inventor-engineer Reginald Fessenden that creates new frequencies by combining or mixing two frequencies. <b>Heterodyning</b> {{is used to}} shift one frequency range into another, new one, and is also involved in the processes of modulation and demodulation. [...] The two frequencies are combined in a nonlinear signal-processing device such as a vacuum tube, transistor, or diode, usually called a mixer. [...] In the most common application, two signals at frequencies [...] and [...] are mixed, creating two new signals, one at the sum [...] of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference [...] [...] These new frequencies are called heterodynes.
