For example, by studying the genetic composition of Tritium aestivum, the world’s most commonly used bread wheat, great insight has been gained into the ways that domestication has impacted the evolution of the plant. Which loci are most susceptible to manipulation, and <b>how</b> <b>does</b> <b>this</b> play out in evolutionary terms? Genetic sequencing has allowed these questions to be addressed for the first time, as specific loci can be compared in wild and domesticated strains of the plant. This will allow for advances in genetic modification in the future which could yield healthier, more disease-resistant wheat crops.|$|E

The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to Ian Bent, [...] "analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method {{can be traced back to}} the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the Middle Ages onwards." [...] Adolf Bernhard Marx was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as Edgard Varèse's claim that, [...] "to explain by means of [...] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work".|$|E
