25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in <b>Just</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>What</b> You Want when Sidney gave the voice-over to Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E

It wasn't <b>just</b> them <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> to do - {{there were a lot}} ideas passed across the table. I didn't want to cover any songs by artists that are around at the moment or are current in the charts because I don't think that's right. I wanted to do songs that were inspirational to me back in the day and close to my heart, particularly with my dad..." [...] One of the songs, Supertramp's [...] "Lord Is It Mine", was chosen in memory of Sam's father, Ronnie, who died from cancer in 2008. [...] "It was played at my dad's funeral," [...] she said. [...] "It was his favourite song and I've always wanted to sing it.

Must be ashamed of himself. Ask the engineer. He can't do without an engineer--don't you see--and as no respectable man {{can be expected to}} put up with such a table, he allows them fifteen dollars a month extra mess money. I assure you it is so! You just ask Mr. Ferdinand da Costa. That's the engineer he has now. You may have seen him about my place, a delicate dark young man, with very fine eyes and a little moustache. He arrived here a year ago from Calcutta. Between you and me, I guess the money-lenders there must have been after him. He rushes here for a meal every chance he can get, for <b>just</b> please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> satisfaction is that for a well-educated young fellow to feed all alone in his cabin--like a wild beast? That's what Falk expects his engineers to put up with for fifteen dollars extra. And the rows on board every time a little smell of cooking gets about the deck! You wouldn't believe! The other day da Costa got the cook to fry a steak for him--a turtle steak it was too, not beef at all--and the fat caught or something. Young da Costa himself was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> of it here in this room. 'Mr. Schomberg'--says he-'if I had let a cylinder cover blow off through the skylight by my negligence Captain Falk couldn't have been more savage. He frightened the cook so that he won't put anything on the fire for me now.' Poor da Costa had tears in his eyes. Only try to put yourself in his place, captain: a sensitive, gentlemanly young fellow. Is he expected to eat his food raw? But that's your Falk all over. Ask any one you like. I suppose the fifteen dollars extra he has to give keep on rankling--in there." ...|$|R

I tell you, Watson, I've {{only known}} her these few weeks, {{but from the}} first I just {{felt that she was}} made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together, and it was only to-day {{for the first time that}} I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my {{feelings}} towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. <b>Just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>what</b> it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay." ...|$|E
