40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effect of book-tax {{differences}} to accrual <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> persistence for manufactured companies listed in Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI) from 2010 to 2013. This research refers to research conducted by Blaylock, et all., (2012) In this study, there are 2 (two) dependent variables and 1 (one) independent variable. The dependent variables are accrual <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> persistence, then the independent variable is book-tax differences. Earnings management and tax avoider are used as moderating variables. Method of statistical analysis used in this study is multiple regression analysis using SPSS 19 program. First, this study examine the association between book-tax differences with accrual <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> persistence. The result suggests that, book-tax differences significantly affect <b>earnings</b> persistence <b>and</b> also affect the earnings persistence through cash flows with negative directions.

5|$|Earnings {{management}} {{involves the}} manipulation of company earnings towards a pre-determined target. This target can be motivated by a preference for more stable earnings, in which case management {{is said to be}} carrying out income smoothing. Opportunistic income smoothing can in turn signal lower risk and increase a firm's market value. Other possible motivations for earnings management include the need to maintain the levels of certain accounting ratios due to debt covenants, and the pressure to maintain increasing <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> to beat analyst targets.|$|E

This paper selected 14 domestic commercial banks of year 2001 - 2009 as data sample, using Kanagaretnam et al. ’s (2003) research method, dividing the loan loss provision into two parts that is discretionary and nondiscretionary part, and empirically studied the relationship of discretionary part of loan loss provision <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> before taxes <b>and</b> provisions (EBTP) and capital adequacy ratio (CAR). Empirical results show that: there is significant positive correlation between the discretionary loan loss provisions <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> before taxes <b>and</b> provisions (EBTP), and there is significant negative correlation between the discretionary loan loss provisions and capital adequacy ratio (CAR).

5|$|Financial data of Lexus {{operations}} are not disclosed publicly. However, automotive analysts {{estimate that the}} Lexus division contributes {{a disproportionate share of}} Toyota's profits, relative to its limited production and sales volume. Interviews with retired division officials indicate that depending on sales volume, vehicle product development cycles, and exchange rates, Lexus sales have accounted for as much as half of Toyota's annual U.S. profit in certain years. Division executives have employed pricing strategies aimed at sustaining profit margins rather than sales volume, with historically fewer price incentives than rival brands. In 2006, Lexus entered Interbrand's list of the Top 100 Global Brands for the first time, with an estimated brand value of approximately $3 billion annually. In 2009, Interbrand ranked Lexus as Japan's seventh largest brand, between Panasonic and Nissan, based on revenue, <b>earnings,</b> <b>and</b> market value.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} how earnings management {{is associated with}} corporate social responsibility (CSR) and investor protection with 139 firms in ten Asian countries. In Asia, CSR is increasingly attracting attention but the legal system generally is perceived as being poor. We hypothesize {{that there is an}} inverse relationship between CSR <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> management, as well as between investor protection <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> management. Regarding earnings management, we investigate <b>earnings</b> smoothing <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> aggressiveness. We find that Asian firms with relatively good CSR are engaged significantly less with earnings management. Investor protection also is negatively associated with earnings management. We find that this is very case sensitive and depends on the ways in which <b>earnings</b> management <b>and</b> investor protection are actually measured. In addition, we establish that CSR shows positive interaction with investor protection. We conclude that in Asian countries CSR moderates firms' <b>earnings</b> management <b>and</b> that this is conditioned by the legal system.

He presented the plan to Lifemark, but the company was unable to act on it due to a company merger that was already underway with American Medical International. Scrushy left Lifemark in 1983 and founded Amcare, Inc within a year. The new company opened its first facility in Little Rock, Arkansas and had initial capital between $50,000-$70,000. With the assistance of four partners from Amcare Inc. and a one million dollar investment by Citicorp Venture Capital, Scrushy took the quickly growing company and founded HealthSouth in 1984. Two years after its founding, HealthSouth became a publicly traded company in 1986. The next year, HealthSouth expanded into two new fields, worker’s compensation and sports medicine, allowing the company to double its <b>earnings</b> <b>and</b> obtain assets close to $100 million.

The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009.

40|$|The {{passage of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) marks the {{beginning}} of the mandatory disclosure of audit-committee composition and other corporate governance information for cross-listed foreign firms. We posit that the provisions of SOX improve the effectiveness of an independent audit committee and other corporate-governance functions in monitoring the earnings quality of cross-listed foreign firms, and we use cross-listed firms' <b>earnings</b> informativeness <b>and</b> <b>earnings</b> management to measure earnings quality. Our findings show earnings informativeness is significantly associated with audit-committee independence as well as with board independence in the post-SOX period. In contrast, we do not find a significant association between <b>earnings</b> informativeness <b>and</b> audit-committee independence in the pre-SOX period. Our findings also show a consistently negative association between <b>earnings</b> management <b>and</b> audit-committee independence after SOX, an association that is not found in the pre-SOX period. Similarly, a negative association between <b>earnings</b> informativeness <b>and</b> the CEO duality as the chair of the board is only found in the post-SOX period. Furthermore, our results show a positive (negative) association between earnings informativeness (<b>earnings</b> management) <b>and</b> an aggregate corporate-governance score as a measure of overall corporate-governance functions in both the pre- and post-SOX periods. Our findings on the change of magnitude in the relationship between earnings informativeness (<b>earnings</b> management) <b>and</b> corporate governance suggest that the SOX provisions improve the effectiveness of cross-listed foreign firms' corporate-governance functions in monitoring the quality of accounting earnings.

5|$|These {{troubles}} {{were followed}} in 1347 by the Black Death, a pandemic that spread throughout Europe {{during the following}} three years. The death toll was probably about 35 million people in Europe, {{about one-third of the}} population. Towns were especially hard-hit because of their crowded conditions. Large areas of land were left sparsely inhabited, and in some places fields were left unworked. Wages rose as landlords sought to entice the reduced number of available workers to their fields. Further problems were lower rents and lower demand for food, both of which cut into agricultural income. Urban workers also felt that they had a right to greater <b>earnings,</b> <b>and</b> popular uprisings broke out across Europe. Among the uprisings were the jacquerie in France, the Peasants' Revolt in England, and revolts in the cities of Florence in Italy and Ghent and Bruges in Flanders. The trauma of the plague led to an increased piety throughout Europe, manifested by the foundation of new charities, the self-mortification of the flagellants, and the scapegoating of Jews. Conditions were further unsettled by the return of the plague {{throughout the rest of the}} 14th century; it continued to strike Europe periodically during the rest of the Middle Ages.|$|E
