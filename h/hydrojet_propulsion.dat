In addition to faster downstream travel times, the auxiliary engine also enabled steering corrections during chain operations and simplified turning manoeuvres. Water turbines were used on several chain boats on the Elbe {{and on the}} Bavarian chain boats on the Main.|$|E

It has {{a single}} 260-hp, V-8 turbocharged, water-cooled, diesel engine, an {{improvement}} over the twin gasoline engines installed in the BTR-60 and BTR-70 vehicles. The reconfigured rear portion of the hull accommodates the new, single engine. The Soviets removed the roof chamfers of the modified BTR-70, raised the rear, and squared off the rearward-sloping engine compartment. Standard equipment includes TNPO vision blocks, TNP-B and TKN-3 optical devices for the driver and commander, an OU-3GA2M infra-red search light, six 81 mm smoke grenade launchers 902V [...] "Tucha", a radioset (R-173 or R-163-50U), an intercom, and <b>hydrojets</b> for amphibious <b>propulsion.</b>|$|R
