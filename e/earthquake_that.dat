5|$|New Zealand in its entirety, {{particularly}} the North Island, is located along the seismically volatile Pacific Ring of Fire, {{and has a}} long history of earthquakes. Since the European settlement, the largest on record was a magnitude 8.2 ML major <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> occurred on 23 January 1855 near the Wairarapa plains of the North Island. Another destructive magnitude 7.8 ML earthquake struck the region near Hawke's Bay on 3 February 1931; it is the deadliest earthquake recorded on the island to date, greatly affecting much of Napier and Hastings.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} and moment tensor solution of this earthquake {{are consistent with}} it being a result of thrust faulting between the North American Plate and the subducting Pacific Plate.

5|$|Several {{strands of}} the SAF {{in the eastern}} region of the San Francisco Bay Area are the Hayward–Rodgers Creek and Calaveras Faults. The Hayward Fault {{exhibits}} fault creep, {{but it also has}} potential for large earthquakes, like the 1868 Hayward <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> occurred on its southern segment. The northern Calaveras Fault meets the Hayward Fault near the Calaveras Reservoir and can also produce large earthquakes. Except for a ~M6.5 shock that occurred in 1911, the central and southern segments might only produce smaller events and fault creep.|$|E
5|$|The 2004 Indian Ocean {{earthquake}} was an undersea, megathrust <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> {{occurred on}} 26 December 2004, with an epicentre off {{the west coast}} of Sumatra, Indonesia, triggering a series of devastating tsunamis along coastal fringes of the Indian Ocean. Nagapattinam district was the most affected part of Tamil Nadu, accounting for 6,064 off the 8,009 casualties in the state. Sirkazhi remained mostly unaffected by the tsunami, but the groundwater quality deteriorated where aquifers were close to the water bodies. There was heavy salt water intrusion inland.|$|E
5|$|The June 2011 Christchurch {{earthquake}} was {{a shallow}} magnitude 6.3 ML <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> occurred on 13 June 2011 at 14:20 NZST (02:20 UTC). It was centred {{at a depth}} of 6km (3.8mi), about 10km (6mi) from Christchurch, which had previously been devastated by another magnitude 6.3 ML earthquake in February 2011. The June quake was preceded by a magnitude 5.9 ML tremor that struck the region at a slightly deeper 8.9km (5.5mi). The United States Geological Survey reported a magnitude of 6.0 Mw {{at a depth of}} about 9km (5.6mi).|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} {{of natural gas}} is strongly increasing around the world. Long-run negative external effects of extraction are understudied and often ignored in (social) cost-benefit analyses. One important example is that natural gas extraction leads to soil subsidence and subsequent induced <b>earthquakes</b> <b>that</b> may occur only {{after a couple of}} decades. We show <b>that</b> induced <b>earthquakes</b> <b>that</b> are noticeable to residents generate substantial non-monetary economic effects, as measured by their effects on house prices, also when house owners are fully compensated for damage to their houses. To address the issue <b>that</b> <b>earthquakes</b> do not occur randomly over space, we use temporal variation in the occurrence of noticeable earthquakes while controlling for the occurrence of <b>earthquakes</b> <b>that</b> cannot be felt by house owners. We find <b>that</b> <b>earthquakes</b> <b>that</b> are noticeable with peak ground velocities of above half a cm/s lead to price decreases of 1. 9 percent. The total non-monetary costs of induced earthquakes for Groningen are about € 170 million (about € 600 per household). These results indicate that the non-monetary costs are in the same order of magnitude as the monetary damage costs...|$|R
5|$|The <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> {{struck the}} Azorean islands was a {{magnitude}} 7.2 on the Richter scale. It caused considerable damage on three separate islands (Terceira, São Jorge, and Graciosa), destroying several buildings. According to local reports, roughly 70% {{of the houses}} on Terceira were completely demolished, including the historic quarter of the island capital, Angra do Heroísmo. In general, public buildings such as churches remained intact, while several buildings caved in on themselves. Public utilities such as electricity and water, were reported cut in several areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{four main}} Japanese islands of Kyushu, Shikoku, Honshu, and Hokkaido {{lie in a}} convex {{arrangement}} pointing to the Pacific Ocean, while the oceanic trenches that form the western boundary of the Pacific Plate are convex in the opposite direction, toward Eurasia. The continental crust above the subduction zones had previously {{been associated with the}} Eurasian Plate, but northern Honshu and Hokkaido have more recently been treated as part of the North American Plate, due to a poorly defined plate boundary between Eastern Siberia and Alaska and a newly forming boundary at the eastern perimeter of the Sea of Japan. This portion of the crust has been known locally as the Okhotsk Plate. The southwestern border of the plate is called the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line. It is a region of faulting that traverses the width of central Honshu, but it has not generated any large earthquakes. Moving westward, though, the Atera, Miboro, Atotsugawa, and Nobi faults have all produced large events. Two of those events occurred beyond the terminus of the 1891 rupture: the 1945 Mikawa <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> hit near Nagoya on the Fukozu Fault and the 1948 Fukui <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> occurred near the Sea of Japan.|$|E
5|$|Tremors {{from the}} {{earthquake}} were also felt in eastern Canada, mostly in Southern Ontario, {{as well as}} in parts of southern Quebec and the Maritime provinces. In Ontario, a few buildings in Toronto were evacuated, and roads were closed as a precautionary measure in case of building collapse in Sudbury and Windsor. The year 2011 is the second consecutive year in which an earthquake was widely felt in Southern Ontario and Quebec, the previous being the June 2010 Central Canada <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> also affected that region.|$|E

It stands 56 meters and 13 floors, served by five elevators. Its steel frame was designed to withstand the strong <b>earthquakes</b> <b>that</b> regularly shake the city. Total building area is 15,000 m2. It survived the 1957 and 1985 <b>earthquakes</b> <b>that</b> took place in Mexico City, but was slightly damaged in the 2012 Oaxaca-Guerrero earthquake.|$|R

5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> hit Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico on 20August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch {{national}} {{he had met}} {{three years}} earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before Cyclone Tracy struck on Christmas Day, and in February 1976 {{when they decided to}} camp well away from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> left over 22,000 people dead. The couple eventually settled in Vancouver, where John Lerew died of cancer on 24February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine and the children of his first marriage.|$|E
5|$|Records of {{historical}} earthquakes and tsunami extend further {{back in time}} in Japan {{than any other country}} that lies along the Pacific Rim (the first documented event occurred in 416 AD). These historical documents supported the date verification of the 1700 Cascadia <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> occurred off the Pacific northwest coast of North America. The dilemma of earthquakes in Japan was made a priority following the 1854 Ansei-Nankai event that brought great destruction to the southwest portion of the country. With the onset of the Meiji period, the feudal government system was superseded by an empire that began to focus on advancing the Japanese society up to Western standards, especially in science.|$|E

5|$|The DWS has functioned {{successfully}} {{since its}} initial operation in 2007. The most powerful <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> THSRC has experienced measured 6.4 on the Richter Scale with an epicenter 17km from Jiaxian, Kaohsiung that shook southern Taiwan on 4 March 2010 (甲仙地震). One operating train was slightly derailed in Xinshi Tainan (台南新市) and six trains were {{stopped on the}} track. In spite of the temporary suspension of operations, there was no damage or casualties. All 2,500 affected passengers were evacuated in two hours without injury. Service resumed the next day. Such a record was well noted, and provided valuable experience in operational safety to the global railway industry.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 1931, Lexington, {{which had}} been near Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, was ordered to aid {{survivors}} of an <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> devastated Managua, Nicaragua. By the following day, the ship {{was close enough to}} launch aircraft carrying supplies and medical personnel to Managua. During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Lexington and Saratoga were able to launch a massive airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932 without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Lexington was assigned to Black Fleet, defending Hawaii and the West Coast against Blue Fleet and Saratoga. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently ruled sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers shortly afterward. Lexingtons aircraft were judged to have badly damaged two of Blue Fleet's battleships.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, {{all of which are}} barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> hit the region in the year 362. Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the presence of}} Thierry, Count of Flanders, and his army in the Holy Land and an <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> destroyed most towns of Northern Syria, BaldwinIII of Jerusalem invaded the Muslim territories in the valley of the Orontes River in the autumn of 1157. Raynald joined the royal army, and they laid siege to Shaizar. Shaizar was held by a band of Assassins, but it had been ruled by the Munqidhites who paid an annual tribute to Raynald. Before the capitulation of the garrison, Baldwin decided to grant the fortress to Thierry of Flanders, but Raynald demanded that the count should pay homage to him for the town. After Thierry sharply refused to swear fealty to an upstart, the crusaders abandoned the siege. They marched on Harenc (present-day Harem, Syria), which had been an Antiochene fortress before Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo, captured it in 1150. After the crusaders captured Harenc in February 1158, Raynald granted it to the Flemish Raynald of Saint-Valery.|$|E
5|$|When U.S. President Andrew Jackson {{allowed the}} charter of the Second Bank of the United States to expire in 1836, the U.S. was without any sort of central bank, and the money supply in New York City fluctuated with the country's annual {{agricultural}} cycle. Each autumn money flowed out of the city as harvests were purchased and—in an effort to attract money back—interest rates were raised. Foreign investors then sent their money to New York {{to take advantage of the}} higher rates. From the January 1906 Dow Jones Industrial Average high of 103, the market began a modest correction that would continue throughout the year. The April 1906 <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> devastated San Francisco contributed to the market instability, prompting an even greater flood of money from New York to San Francisco to aid reconstruction. A further stress on the money supply occurred in late 1906, when the Bank of England raised its interest rates, partly in response to UK insurance companies paying out so much to US policyholders, and more funds remained in London than expected. From their peak in January, stock prices declined 18% by July 1906. By late September, stocks had recovered about half of their losses.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually will come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large <b>earthquake</b> <b>that</b> seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E
