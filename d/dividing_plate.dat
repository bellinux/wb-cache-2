A glass vessel had a platina plate fixed perpendicularly across it, so as {{to divide}} it into two cells: a head of mica was fixed over it, {{so as to}} collect the gas it might evolve during experiments; then each cell, and the space beneath the mica, was filled with dilute sulphuric acid. Two poles were provided, {{consisting}} each of a platina wire terminated by a plate of the same metal; each was fixed into a tube passing through its upper end by an air-tight joint, {{that it might be}} moveable, and yet that the gas evolved at it might be collected. The tubes were filled with the acid, and one immersed in each cell. Each platina pole was equal in surface {{to one side of the}} <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> in the middle glass vessel, and the whole might be considered as an arrangement between the poles of the battery of a humid decomposable conductor divided in the middle by the interposed platina diaphragm. It was easy, when required, to draw one of the poles further up the tube, and then the platina diaphragm was no longer in the middle of the humid conductor. But whether it were thus arranged at the middle, or towards one side, it always evolved a quantity of oxygen and hydrogen equal to that evolved by both the extreme plates[A].|$|E
5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> (the piston) in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering piston and rod, on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's steering cylinder has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the rod side at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its [...] "head") is regulated.|$|E

For the divided channel configuration, an isothermal plate at the same temperature as the channel walls was located on the channel centre line. The study examined the effect of Rayleigh number, plate-to-channel length ratio, vertical plate position, and plate thickness on the heat transfer from the channel walls, the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> and the channel as a whole.;Solutions to both the full elliptic and parabolic forms of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations have been obtained for Prandtl number Pr = 0. 7 (air). Closed form expressions were derived for the limiting case of fully developed flow in the divided channel. Experimental measurements were made in air with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.;Positioning the plate {{at the bottom of}} the channel gave the highest average Nusselt numbers for the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> and the overall channel. At low Rayleigh number, when the plate is {{at the bottom of the}} channel, extending the channel walls above the plate increased the plate heat transfer by as much as a factor of four. At higher Rayleigh number, plate average Nusselt numbers as much as two times the isolated plate Nusselt number were predicted numerically.;In the fully developed regime, a short <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> located at the channel inlet reduces the wall average Nusselt number by about a factor of two, compared with the undivided channel.

40|$|Landing gears {{have been}} {{identified}} as major noise source contributors during the aircraft’s approach to landing phase. Techniques such as using fairings to alter the flow around the landing gear components have shown to reduce noise. This study investigates methods to further improve the fairing performance. A fundamental study has been performed to understand the influence of using a fairing on a simple cylindrical strut when a split plate is placed in the cavity between the fairing and the strut. Aerodynamic and acoustic tests are performed. Wind tunnel tests equipped with a phased microphone array as well as far field measurements have been conducted out on the fairing-cylindrical strut configuration. The results show that the splitter plate either reduces or eliminates the vortex shedding which in turn reduces noise. This is due to the <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> blocking the interaction between the two opposing shear layers aft of the fairing’s trailing edge and reducing their interaction with the downstream strut. Lower velocities around the shell and the strut are observed {{with the use of the}} splitter plate as well as reduction of recirculating flow within the shell strut cavity. This alteration in the flow characteristics results in a broadband noise reduction and hence reducing the self-noise generated by the fairing...|$|E
40|$|Within the European Fusion Technology Programme, the Helium-Cooled Lithium Lead (HCLL) {{breeding}} blanket concepì {{is one of}} the two EU {{lines to}} be developed for a long term fusion reactor, in particular with the aim of manufacturing a test blanket module (TBM) to be implemented in ITER. The HCLL-TBM is foreseen to be located in an ITER equatorial port, being housed inside a steel-supporting frame, actively cooled by pressurized water. This supporting frame has been designed to house two different TBMs providing two cavities separated by a <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> 20 cm thick. As the nuclear response of HCLL-TBM could vary with the supporting frame configuration and composition, a parametric study has been launched to investigate such an influence. Previous works dealt with the dependence of the nuclear response of HCLL-TBM on the configuration of an homogeneous frame while the present one has been focussed on the investigation of the influence of coolant distribution within the frame. A detailed parametric study of HCLL-TBM nuclear response has been performed by means of 3 D-Monte Carlo neutronic and photonic analyses, simulating the frame in a semi-heterogeneous way. Three-dimensional heterogeneous models of HCLL-TBM and of the supporting frame have been set-up considering both the usual poloidal lay-out and a toroidal one and taking into account 9 % Cr martensitic steel (EUROFER) as structural material. The models have been inserted into an existing 3 D semi-heterogeneous ITER-FEAT one, simulating realistically the reactor lay-out up to the cryostat and providing for a proper D-T neutron source. The analyses have been performed by means of the MCNP- 4 C code, running a large number of histories {{in such a way that}} results obtained are affected by statistical uncertainties lower than 1 %.

40|$|Summary The {{present report}} is a {{continuation}} of an interim report dated 8 th August, 1951. The latter- report dealt with the flow in a model casing whereas the present reports deals with a similar investigation on the ‘Reavell’ compressor inlet casing which is {{to be part of the}} 9 in x 9 in supersonic wind tunnel installation, In the basic condition the flow had a circumferential instability* caused by the splitting of the inlet flow around the central shaft fairing. In addition the main flow through the casing was under-turned by approximately 200, Consequently the flow at the exit annulas was unsteady and changes of 300 in the exit flow direction were found. It was also found that at least four guide vanes were stalled in any one flow configuration. The instability was prevented by a flat <b>dividing</b> <b>plate</b> placed behind the central shaft fairing, but smooth flow at exit, in the vicinity of the plate, was only possible when curved fairings were added to both sides of the plate. A gauze screen, of 30 wires per inch, placed at entry, partly reduced the unsteadiness at exit but it had little effect on the flow direction and did not unstall the guide vanes. A perforated plate, having 15. inch diameter holes and 50 per cent blockage, similarly placed, had little or no effect. The guide vanes were unstalled by adding curved extensions to their leading edges. The large changes in the flow direction across the annulus at exit were, however, only reduced by modifying the internal contour of the casing. With these modifications flow angle variations of between 5 ° and 10 ° were obtained at exit. The velocity at exit was not uniform over the exit passages between the guide vanes, but the variations, which were not unduly large, were caused by secondary flows and the wakes from the vanes. This investigation has clearly shown that in the basic condition the unsteady, non-uniform flow at the exit from the inlet casing, which is immediately upstream of the first stage of the compressor, will tend to cause periodic stalling of the rotating blades in that stage. Since the relative velocities are high the danger of running into stn 3 ling flutter cannot be overlooked, especially as the cascade effect may reduce the critical flutter speed of the isolated blade. Stalling flutter, which usually takes place in the fundamental torsional mode, may be aggravated by a high order resonance occuring at the given rotational speed of the compressor. The suggested' modifications to the design of the inlet casing should prevent stalling of the first stage blades 'of the compressor caused by upstream, unsteady, non-uniform flow...|$|E
