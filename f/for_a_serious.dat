5|$|The Allies' {{failure to}} secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden. While all other {{objectives}} had been achieved, the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in its ultimate objective. Field Marshal Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90% successful and the Allies did possess a deep salient into German occupied territory that was quickly reinforced. Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions, isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army {{on the eastern side}} of the bulge. This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble enough troops <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> counterattack to retake Antwerp. Chester Wilmot agreed with this, claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp. Kershaw views the situation differently, observing that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape. Dr. John Warren of the American Historical Division of the United States Air Force believed that the Allies now controlled a salient leading nowhere. John Waddy is of the belief that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the contributions of race and gender to {{the likelihood of a}} first post-run arrest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> and less <b>serious</b> offense in <b>a</b> sample of homeless and runaway youths from four Midwestern states. Event history analysis was used to test the hypothesis that race and gender would interact so that the likelihood of a first post-run arrest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> and less serious offense would be highest for non-white males and non-white females, respectively. Potentially confounding factors—deviant subsistence strategies, substance use, gang involvement and membership, prior arrests, age, prior physical abuse, age on own, and spending time on the street—were controlled in the analyses. The hypotheses regarding the interaction of race and gender were not supported by the data. Non-whites were more likely than whites, and males were more likely than females, to be arrested <b>for</b> <b>a</b> more <b>serious</b> offense, and white females were more likely than non-white females to be arrested <b>for</b> <b>a</b> less <b>serious</b> offense...|$|R

Kierkegaard graduated from university on 20 October 1841 with a Magister Artium.

Dum appears on the path and routs Rumpoey's attackers, for which he is expelled. Rumpoey finds Dum walking and insists on giving him a ride in her car. She orders her driver to take them to Bang Pu beach. Dum and Rumpoey confide their love for each other and are engaged, agreeing to meet a year later at Sala Awaiting the Maiden.|$|E
25|$|Numerous fady {{surround}} the Bara nobles. Among the Zafimanely royal clan, for example, it is forbidden to ever kill a relative, even as punishment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> crime. Historically it was taboo {{to speak to}} the wives of chiefs or enter their houses, and there were specific locations restricted to everyone but them for gathering firewood and collecting water. A particularly strong taboo forbade speaking the name of a chief after his death or any word that formed part of the name. The deceased leader was given a new name after death that all were required to use, and specific synonyms were selected to replace the words composing his name for use in regular conversation; anyone who spoke the forbidden words would harshly punished or in some instances executed.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Japanese had {{advanced}} south from their beachhead at Gona and Buna, and taken the strategic village of Kokoda. General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander of South West Pacific Area, {{was at this}} time planning a landing on Japanese-held Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Concerned that enemy troops would be withdrawn from Gona to reinforce Guadalcanal, MacArthur asked <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> commitment of Australian troops to New Guinea. The 21st Brigade was sent to Port Moresby, and the 25th Brigade to Milne Bay. Potts flew into Port Moresby on 8 August {{and set up a}} staging post at Koitaki, close {{to the start of the}} trail at Owers Corner.

25|$|Roberts {{then ran}} into a back storage corridor, where he {{encountered}} employee Rok Sang Kim, who had returned from recycling boxes and therefore hadn't heard the gunfire. Roberts pointed the rifle at him, but didn't shoot him, instead running {{down a flight of}} stairs onto a lower floor. There, he committed suicide at 3:50p.m. In the chaos of the first few minutes after the shooting, there were expectations of mass casualties. Police responded to the scene minutes later and spent the following hours searching the mall for hiding civilians, injured victims, and a possible second shooter, while dozens of ambulances arrived with the expectations of treating dozens of wounded victims, but treated only Kristina Shevchenko <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> gunshot wound. Roberts fired only seventeen rounds during the entire shooting, including the one to kill himself. An additional 128 rounds were found in the magazines he dropped and on his person.|$|E
25|$|On 13 July, al-'Azma {{declared}} {{emergency measures}} to the Syrian National Congress, including press censorship, {{the power to}} seize civilian vehicles for military use and a call for militias {{across the country to}} support the army. Inspired by Mustafa Kemal's successes against the French in Turkey, al-'Azma sought to follow in the latter's path against the French in Syria. Meanwhile, Yasin al-Hashimi had returned to Syria from Palestine and was tasked with inspecting al-'Azma's troops. He concluded that the Arab Army was woefully unprepared and under-equipped <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>serious</b> confrontation against the French Army. In a meeting of King Faisal's war cabinet, al-'Azma was visibly upset with al-Hashimi's conclusions. Regardless, he ultimately conceded that the army was in a precarious situation when informed that the lack of ammunition meant that each soldier would only be allotted 270 bullets for their rifle and each artillery piece could only be allotted eight shells. Despite this, all of the officers in the meeting declared their willingness to fight. On 14 July, France issued an ultimatum to the Syrian government to disband its army and submit to French control.|$|E
