5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, a {{campaign}} to rid New York City of gay bars was in full effect by order of Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr., who {{was concerned about the}} image of the city in preparation for the 1964 World's Fair. The city revoked the liquor licenses of the bars, and undercover police officers worked to entrap as many homosexual men as possible. Entrapment usually consisted of an undercover officer who found a man in a bar or public park, engaged him in conversation; if the conversation headed toward the possibility that they might leave together—or the officer bought the man a drink—he was arrested for solicitation. One story in the New York Post described an arrest in a gym locker room, where the officer grabbed <b>his</b> <b>crotch,</b> moaning, and a man who asked him if he was all right was arrested. Few lawyers would defend cases as undesirable as these, and some of those lawyers kicked back their fees to the arresting officer.|$|E

25|$|This {{season of}} Big Brother Australia {{proved to be}} highly controversial. Big Brother – Adults Only ended its run early after {{politicians}} warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms. An alleged sexual assault during which John (real name Michael Bric) held down Camilla Severi on her bed while Ashley (Michael Cox) pushed <b>his</b> <b>crotch</b> into {{her face in the}} house on 1 July 2006 resulted in the ejection of the pair from the show. The incident sparked calls for the series to be investigated for possible breaches of broadcasting laws, and calls for the cancellation of the series by several commentators and politicians, including then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and opposition leader Kim Beazley. The incident and in particular the Prime Minister's comments, were reported internationally, running on CNN and the BBC and in various other international publications.|$|E

Despite generating media attention for a provocative wardrobe, the performance was considered to be [...] "fairly tame considering the VMAs", where she touched recording artist Robin Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> On October 5, Cyrus served as the host and musical guest during an episode of Saturday Night Live, which gained favorable reviews from music critics. The following Monday, Cyrus performed the track on Today as part of their Toyota Concert Series. She also performed the song during appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and The Ellen DeGeneres Show later that month.|$|E

For [...] "Until the End of the World", Bono often played with a camera, kissing the lens and thrusting it into <b>his</b> <b>crotch,</b> a stark contrast from his more earnest stage behaviour of the past.

500|$|In the 19-minute {{music video}} for [...] "Bad"—directed by Martin Scorsese—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not {{previously}} {{seen in his}} work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed <b>his</b> <b>crotch,</b> he replied, [...] "I think it happens subliminally" [...] and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. [...] "Bad" [...] garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; Time magazine described it as [...] "infamous". The video also featured Wesley Snipes; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles. For the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] video, Jackson experimented with an anti-gravity lean where the performer leans forward at a 45 degree angle, beyond the performer's center of gravity. To accomplish this move live, Jackson and designers developed a special shoe that locks the performer's feet to the stage, allowing them to lean forward. They were granted [...] for the device.

She faced similar controversy following a performance of [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] (2010) on Britain's Got Talent, where she pretended to kiss one of her female dancers on stage. Cyrus defended the performance, feeling she did nothing wrong. Cyrus {{was the subject of}} public and media scrutiny following her performance of [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013) and [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] (2013) with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Clad in a skin colored latex two-piece, Cyrus touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> Shortly thereafter, the word [...] "twerk" [...] was added to the online version of the Oxford Dictionary of English. The performance resulted in a media frenzy; one reviewer likened the performance to a [...] "bad acid trip", while another described it as a [...] "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment".

Halfway through the act, Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece outfit as Thicke joined her on state to perform [...] "Blurred Lines". Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> An article published in The Hollywood Reporter described the performance as [...] "crass" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of a bad acid trip". Media attention of the performance largely overshadowed the attention that was given to other major events of the night, such as the reunion of 'N Sync and performances by Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. The performance was described by XXL critic B. J.

25|$|The {{structure}} of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs. Instead of a pitch, the films are connected {{by a group of}} three teenagers searching for the most banned film in the world, Movie 43, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an April Fool's prank from Calvin's younger brother Baxter (Devin Eash), who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters (Tim Chou and James Hsu) who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother (Beth Littleford) enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. He also has visions, and finds semen from <b>his</b> erect <b>crotch</b> on <b>his</b> hand causing him to stare at his hand in shock and horror. Afterward, a deadly earthquake rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections. He watches the last remaining skits on the laptop. This version of the film was released in the U.S. as part of the Blu-ray Disc of Movie 43 as an unrated alternate cut of the film.|$|R
50|$|On the January 27 {{episode of}} Impact!, TNA started a tournament to {{determine}} a new number one contender for X Division Champion Kazarian. In the first match of the tournament, Max defeated Amazing Red and Chris Sabin in a three-way match {{to advance to the}} finals at Against All Odds. The following week, Jeremy defeated Douglas Williams and Jay Lethal in another three-way match to also advance to the finals. However, both Max and Jeremy were forced to miss the finals of the tournament at Against All Odds, after failing to get to Florida due to travel issues. The following month at Victory Road, both Max and Jeremy received their shot at the X Division Championship, held by Kazarian, in an Ultimate X match, which also included Robbie E. Prior to the match, the brothers teased dissension, with Max claiming that their goal was to make him the X Division Champion. At the end of the match, Jeremy and Max finally started fighting between themselves, but in the end both of them failed in their attempt to win the X Division Championship, as Kazarian emerged victorious to successfully retain the title. At the March 15 tapings of Xplosion, the Bucks faced each other in a singles match {{for the first time in}} TNA, with Max picking up the win. Max and Jeremy faced each other in a rematch on the March 31 episode of Impact!, where Max was once again victorious. On the April 7 episode of Impact!, Generation Me teamed with Robbie E in a six-man tag team match, where they faced Brian Kendrick, Chris Sabin and Suicide. At the end of the match, Max, thinking Jeremy was trying to steal the spotlight from him, turned on <b>his</b> brother, <b>crotching</b> him at the top rope, before dropping him to the mat with a rope-hung DDT. After Kendrick had pinned Jeremy for the win, Max removed his Generation Me armband and threw it at his brother. On April 17 at Lockdown, Max defeated seven other men, including Jeremy, in an Xscape match to become the number one contender to Kazarian's X Division Championship. On the May 5 episode of Impact!, Generation Me, seemingly once again on the same page as faces, came together with Amazing Red and Brian Kendrick to fight for X Division's future, after the legitimate firing of Jay Lethal. On May 15 at Sacrifice, Max failed in his attempt to win the X Division Championship from Kazarian. At the all X Division pay-per-view Destination X on July 10, Generation Me was defeated by the team of Eric Young and Shark Boy. This was their last match in TNA as the following day Matt announced that he and his brother had requested their release from their contracts with the promotion. Matt and Nick later revealed that the request stemmed from monetary issues, while also venting their frustrations with TNA's booking, noting the storyline with Tara, which went nowhere, and the quickly aborted feud between the brothers. Matt has also stated that after leaving TNA he was ready to quit professional wrestling altogether, before he and his brother decided to instead reinvent themselves and their act.|$|R
5000|$|David Sharp was {{the author}} of a very great number of papers and larger works. Being {{connected}} with the Entomologist's Monthly Magazine and the Entomologist, in either an editorial or a reference capacity, many of his numerous shorter papers appear in these magazines, and others in similar ones. Yet others, {{as well as some of}} his more pretentious papers, will be found in the transactions of societies with which he was connected. Perhaps his earliest contribution to entomological literature was a paper on the British species of Agathidium (Coleoptera) read before the Entomological Society of London on 6 November 1865. An interesting discussion on heredity and kindred subjects between Sharp and Wallace, arising in connection with Westwood's introduction of the subject of [...] "mimicry" [...] at the Entom. Soc. of London in November 1866, was reported in the Athenaeum of 1, 8, and 15 December 1866, and gives Sharp's views at the time on this subject. A Revision of the British Species of Homalota (Coleoptera) was published by the Entom. Soc. of London soon after his graduation at Edinburgh. In November 1873 appeared a paper in Spanish - Especies nuevas de Coleópteros por Don David Sharp. This refers to insects collected by <b>his</b> friend G.E. <b>Crotch,</b> whose obituary notice Sharp contributed to volume xi of the Entom. Monthly Magazine. The Object and Method of Zoological Nomenclature appeared in November 1873. This is an important and well thought out paper on a debatable subject, the argument of which is perhaps summed up in the sentence, [...] "Nomina si nescis, perit et cognitio rerum," [...] which appears on the cover. A short paper on the Coleoptera of the Scotch Fir came out in the Scottish Naturalist about this time. The Dascillidae of New Zealand was published in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History in July 1878 while work on the water-beetles was taken in hand for publication by the Royal Society of Dublin. Sharp and Fowler's Catalogue of the British Coleoptera appeared in 1893 the Rhynchophorous Coleoptera of Japan in 1896 the articles Insecta and Termites in the Encyclopædia Britannica in 1902 and an article on the Orders of Insects, a subject in which Sharp was much interested, in the Entomologist for 1909. The Distribution of Plants and Animals on the Globe (a paper read before the Dumfries Nat. Hist. Society in 1883) Stridulation in Ants, 1893 an Account of the Phasmidae, 1898 and the Grouse-fly, 1907, are away from his special order - Coleoptera; while A Scheme for a Natioiial System of Rest-Funds (or Pensions) for Working People (1892) shows that Sharp could detach himself from entomology when he wished to do so.|$|R
500|$|Many {{scenes from}} the {{original}} episode were seen as vulgar and {{were removed from the}} television broadcast. [...] One of the scenes removed was {{from the beginning of the}} episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching Genital Hospital, a reference to the television show General Hospital. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno. Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on Adult Swim every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex). In this scene, Peter refers to the Grimace as Ronald McDonald's autistic friend, which was originally penned as [...] "retarded friend" [...] (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird tasting Smuckers jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> In a scene added later to the episode, Mel Gibson apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering Herbert's house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV. The original ending of this episode (with the [...] "choose your own ending" [...] text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.|$|E

Four days later, Lynch was fined $11,050 by the NFL for his celebration of the score; falling back while extending the ball behind his head and grabbing <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> The league considered his celebration an [...] "obscene gesture" [...] to constitute unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|E
50|$|Triple H {{entered the}} ring behind the DX Band, {{performing}} Break It Down live, finishing with Chris Warren on Triple H's shoulders {{and the band}} throwing the drums apart. The WWF Intercontinental Championship Ladder match began with Triple H clotheslining The Rock {{to the floor and}} striking him on the ground before a facebuster onto <b>his</b> knee and <b>crotch</b> chopping Rock. An early Rock Bottom was blocked with a strike, while Rock reversed the Pedigree by standing up and forcing Triple H over the top rop onto the mat. Rock's attempt to bring the ladder into the match saw him attacked from behind by Triple H and thrown from crowd barrier into crowd barrier. Inside the ring, Rock was allowed some time and used it to recover and take the fight to Triple H, throwing him through the ladder back outside the ring. As Rock secured the ladder inside the ring and began to climb it, Triple H slowly made his way back to ringside, climbing from the apron to the turnbuckle and jumping into Rock's back, forcing his head into the ladder and causing him to fall off however as the momentum shook Triple H to the side, the ladder fell on top of him. After Triple H drove the ladder into Rock's chest he began to climb it but four steps up, Rock pulled away at his leg, causing him to land on his previously injured knee. After continuing to work on Triple H's knee, Rock pushed the ladder onto his leg and then used it as a vice, trapping his knee in it and kicking the ladder on it, then using a chair similar to a hammer, reinforcing the ladder onto the knee. Rock then set up the ladder horizontally between the steps and the crowd barrier, picking his opponent up for a modified atomic drop, but with the knee taking the brunt of the drop onto the ladder. However, as The Rock took his time to take the ladder into the ring and set it up before climbing it, Triple H was able to desperately push his opponent off it and throw him out of the ring. The advantage did not remain though, as his own plans were used against him when Rock threw Triple H by his legs into the closed ladder, then falling face first onto the Spanish announce table. As Triple H crawled around, the fight moved to the walkway where both opponents threw each other into the barriers before Triple H tried to perform a Pedigree onto the ladder, but was tossed over his back onto it instead. Back inside the ring, Mark Henry threw a second ladder to Rock which he began to climb while Henry tried to subdue Triple H on the outside but was met with a forearm by Chyna. Triple H arrived just in time to push Rock off the ladder, crashing onto the mat and outside the ring. Triple H received similar treatment after recovering, then climbing the ladder only to have the ladder fall away from beneath him. After a DDT that left both men floored, both men eventually stood back up and then climbed either side of the same ladder, punching each other at the top with Triple H being thrown into the ladder in the turnbuckle and rebound to knock Rock off the ladder onto the ropes. Chyna had Triple H a chair which he hit Rock with, albeit with a ladder in the middle and continued a barage of chair shots onto Rock through the ladder. This would not keep Rock down though, as he soon scooped Triple H onto the ladder and performed the People's Elbow with Triple H lying on the ladder. Despite receiving a Rock Bottom, Triple H managed to stagger to his feet just in time to pull Rock off the top rung of the ladder by his trunks and flooring him with a Pedigree. Struggling back to his feet anyway, Henry threw flour into Triple H's eyes but he slowly managed to climb by feel alone; although Rock was able to climb up to the top and meet him, Chyna used her forearm to low blow Rock, buying Triple H enough time to take the belt from where it was hanging.|$|R
2500|$|Brando {{displayed}} his apathy for {{the production}} by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners. He [...] "tried {{everything in the world}} to ruin it for her," [...] Bankhead's stage manager claimed. [...] "He nearly drove her crazy: scratching <b>his</b> <b>crotch,</b> picking his nose, doing anything." [...] After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams's 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Elia Kazan. Bankhead had recommended him to Williams for the role of Stanley, thinking he was perfect for the part.|$|E
2500|$|The single's cover art was a still {{from the}} film Dunkirk (1958) {{featuring}} British actor Sean Barrett, praying but looking sufficiently {{as though he was}} holding <b>his</b> <b>crotch</b> to have the sleeve banned in the United States, where a photograph of the band backstage at the 1984 Glastonbury Festival, which had previously appeared on the gatefold inside the Hatful of Hollow compilation, was used instead. It is the only time a portrait of the band has appeared on the cover of one of their releases. Morrissey called it [...] "an abhorrent sleeve– and [...] the time and the dedication that we put into the sleeves and artwork, it was tearful when we finally saw the record..." ...|$|E
2500|$|... is Ryuko's enigmatic {{homeroom}} teacher. He secretly observes {{and aids}} Ryuko by leading her to Senketsu. Whilst generally having {{the appearance of}} a frail, shaggy teacher, he is actually a glamorous smooth-talker with a habit of slowly stripping his clothes and making moves on Ryuko whenever they are in private, much to Ryuko's embarrassment. Aikuro reveals to Ryuko the existence of Nudist Beach and his being one of its members (though she did not believe him due to the organization's ridiculous name). Whenever he strips, pink light radiates from his nipples and from <b>his</b> <b>crotch,</b> obscuring them. Mikisugi's character design is based on people such as TM Network's vocalist Takashi Utsunomiya and Kenji Sawada, people who appear smart and good-looking.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2016, Over The Top Wrestling {{marked the}} anniversary of Morgan's death with [...] "Ah Ted", an event held in Dublin's Tivoli Variety Theatre. During the main-event tag-team match between The Lads From the Flats and The Kings of the North, Patrick McDonnell, Joe Rooney and Michael Redmond reprised their roles as Eoin McLove, Father Damo Lennon and Father Paul Stone respectively. McLove entered the ring first, {{withstanding}} one wrestler's attack on <b>his</b> <b>crotch</b> because he has [...] "no willy", but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two. In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant's [...] "The Time I Met the Devil", which follows him {{on the way to}} give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{performance}} artist he enjoyed creating the costumes, and often shocking audiences. He first {{appeared at the}} Anthony D'Offay Gallery in London in 1988. In a signature performance, he would appear on stage in outlandish drag or other costume, looking very huge. He would sing and dance about. Then suddenly, much to the audience's surprise, he would drop onto his back and simulate giving birth to a petite and naked young woman, who was his friend and assistant Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden {{for the first part}} of the performance by being strapped to Leigh's belly with her face in <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> Then she would slip out of her harness, and appear to pop out of Bowery's belly along with a lot of stage blood and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed. [...] Bowery would then bite off the umbilical cord and the two would take a bow. Boy George said he saw it a number of times, and that it [...] "never ceased to impress or revolt".|$|E
2500|$|A pair of [...] long {{self-acting}} mules with 1320 spindles {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the hand away when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, <b>his</b> <b>crotch</b> was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{at least}} two occurrences of {{immediate}} censorship of the series. The original broadcast of the segment [...] "Road Rash" [...] featured {{a scene in which}} Rocko and Heffer stop at what is suggested to be a love hotel (the [...] "No-Tell Motel") advertising [...] "hourly rates" [...] and ask the horse desk clerk for a room, who infers the two will be engaging in intercourse: [...] "All night? [...] Wheeeooo! Okay." [...] The first airing of [...] "Hut Sut Raw" [...] included a scene in which Rocko is picking berries; upon picking one lower on the bush, a bear rushes out whimpering and grasping <b>his</b> <b>crotch.</b> This scene is untouched in Canada. Both scenes were edited by Nickelodeon after their first broadcasts and are the only instances of censorship on the season two DVD, released in 2012. On the season three DVD, the [...] "Wacky Delly" [...] segment was shortened by approximately ten seconds to remove footage of Sal Ami repeatedly whacking Betty Bologna over the head with a telephone receiver. In addition, the restaurant named [...] "Chokey Chicken" [...] (a term for masturbation) was renamed [...] "Chewy Chicken" [...] for the series' fourth season. As the series entered reruns after cancellation, more scenes were cut. The entire episode [...] "Leap Frogs", in which Bev Bighead attempts to seduce Rocko, was skipped.|$|E
2500|$|The Molson Centre in Montreal {{was sold}} out, {{with more than}} 20,000 fans in attendance. Rumors of Hart's {{imminent}} departure from WWF had leaked and consequently heightened the fan interest in the match. The mixed signals and a war of words between Hart, McMahon, Michaels and WCW further heightened anticipation. Emotions were also running high due to the Hart–Michaels rivalry and the [...] "U.S. vs. Canada" [...] storyline. While both men had been cordial with each other backstage, WWF officials ordered the deployment {{of a large number}} of company agents around the ring as a precaution if Hart decided to attack Michaels or McMahon in reaction to the double-cross. Highly unusual for any wrestling match, the deployment was explained on television as a necessary precaution in wake of the intense animosity between Hart's and Michaels' characters. There was also some legitimate concern that Michaels could be attacked during the planned in-crowd brawl, by fans angered at his actions of demeaning the Canadian flag. Michaels' entrance was greeted by loud booing and upon entering the ring, he proceeded to rub the Canadian flag against <b>his</b> <b>crotch,</b> picked his nose with it and later humped it—Michaels maintains that this flag desecration was actually suggested by Hart as an effective way to draw heat and emotion. The palpable anger of the fans was converted into raucous cheering as Hart entered the ring carrying the Canadian flag and wearing the championship belt. Hart, however, was visibly disturbed when segments of the crowd that were aware of his move to WCW jeered him with chants of [...] "You sold out!" [...] as the match progressed.|$|E
