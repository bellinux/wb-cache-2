6000|$|... § IX. The {{science of}} this {{arrangement}} {{has made it}} {{the subject of much}} enthusiastic declamation among the Gothic architects, almost as unreasonable, in some respects, as the declamation of the Renaissance architects respecting Greek structure. The fact is, that the whole northern buttress system is based on the grand requirement of tall windows and vast masses of {{light at the end of}} the apse. In order to gain this quantity of light, the piers between the windows are diminished in thickness until they are far too weak to bear the roof, and then sustained by external buttresses. In the <b>Italian</b> <b>method</b> the light is rather dreaded than desired, and the wall is made wide enough between the windows to bear the roof, and so left. In fact, the simplest expression of the difference in the systems is, that a northern apse is a southern one with its inter-fenestrial piers set edgeways. Thus, a, Fig. XLII., is the general idea of the southern apse; take it to pieces, and set all its piers edgeways, as at b, and you have the northern one. You gain much light for the interior, but you cut the exterior to pieces, and instead of a bold rounded or polygonal surface, ready for any kind of decoration, you have a series of dark and damp cells, which no device that I have yet seen has succeeded in decorating in a perfectly satisfactory manner. If the system be farther carried, and a second or third order of buttresses be added, the real fact is that we have a building standing on two or three rows of concentric piers, with the roof off the whole of it except the central circle, and only ribs left, to carry the weight of the bit of remaining roof in the middle; and after the eye has been accustomed to the bold and simple rounding of the Italian apse, the skeleton character of the disposition is painfully felt. After spending some months in Venice, I thought Bourges Cathedral looked exactly like a half-built ship on its shores. It is useless, however, to dispute respecting the merits of the two systems: both are noble in their place; the Northern decidedly the most scientific, or at least involving the greatest display of science, the Italian the calmest and purest, this having in it the sublimity of a calm heaven or a windless noon, the other that of a mountain flank tormented by the north wind, and withering into grisly furrows of alternate chasm and crag.|$|E
60|$|During {{the time}} of their struggles for {{enlarging}} this losing trade, which they considered as a national object,--what in one point of view it was, and, {{if it had not been}} grossly mismanaged, might have been in more than one,--in this part it is impossible to refuse to the Directors a very great share of merit. No degree of thought, of trouble, or of reasonable expense was spared by them for the improvement of the commodity. They framed with diligence, and apparently on very good information, a code of manufacturing regulations for that purpose; and several persons were sent out, conversant in the <b>Italian</b> <b>method</b> of preparing and winding silk, aided by proper machines for facilitating and perfecting the work. This, under proper care, and in course of time, might have produced a real improvement to Bengal; but in the first instance it naturally drew the business from native management, and it caused a revulsion from the trade and manufactures of India which led as naturally and inevitably to an European monopoly, in some hands or other, as any of the modes of coercion which were or could be employed. The evil was present and inherent in the act. The means of letting the natives into the benefit of the improved system of produce was likely to be counteracted by the general ill conduct of the Company's concerns abroad. For a while, at least, it had an effect still worse: for the Company purchasing the raw cocoon or silk-pod at a fixed rate, the first producer, who, whilst he could wind at his own house, employed his family in this labor, and could procure a reasonable livelihood by buying up the cocoons for the Italian filature, now incurred the enormous and ruinous loss of fifty per cent. This appears in a letter to the Presidency, written by Mr. Boughton Rouse, now a member of your Committee. But for a long time a considerable quantity of that in the old Bengal mode of winding was bought for the Company from contractors, and it continues to be so bought to the present time: but the Directors complain, in their letter of the 12th of May, 1780, that both species, and particularly the latter, had risen so extravagantly that it was become more than forty per cent dearer than it had been fifteen years ago. In that state of price, they condemn their servants, very justly, for entering into contracts for three years,--and that for several kinds of silk, of very different goodness, upon averages unfairly formed, where the commodities averaged at an equal price differed from twenty to thirty per cent on the sale. Soon after, they formed a regular scale of fixed prices, above which they found they could not trade without loss.|$|E

50|$|Botume did not, however, {{discount}} the “modern school” completely. Indeed, he praised it for bringing {{a level of}} “intellectualism” into singing, allowing a method of scientifically based techniques to be taught (“how to sing”), whereas in the “old Italian school” only the desired results were taught (“what one should sound like”). He also praised the “modern school” for dispelling the myth that voice teachers possess some mystical power for transforming common voices into magnificent ones:It cannot be too strongly insisted that the art of singing is not an occult thing. It {{is very much like}} the carpenter’s trade: one must have some aptitude for it to begin with; next he must learn how to use the tools of his craft; finally, he must acquire mechanical dexterity by practice.Botume’s Modern Singing Methods is a ground-breaking work that held influence over several later vocal pedagogical works. In his Psychology of Singing (MacMillan, 1917), David Taylor said:Probably the best summary of the old <b>Italian</b> <b>method</b> offered by any modern teacher is contained in a little booklet by J.

50|$|The Vaganova {{method is}} {{a style of}} {{technique}} that emerged from Russian ballet, and was created by Agrippina Vaganova. This method of dance emerged from the techniques taught at the Imperial Russian Ballet, especially while it was {{under the influence of}} Premier Maître de Ballet Marius Petipa in the later half of the 19th century. After retiring from professionally dancing in the Imperial Ballet in 1916, Vaganova turned to teaching at the school associated with it in 1921, now named the Leningrad Choreographic School. While here, she created what is now an internationally renown training technique and wrote a highly respected ballet textbook, The Fundamentals of Classical Dance(1934), outlining this style. This method is marked by the fusion of the classical French style, specifically elements from the Romantic era of classical ballet, with the athleticism of the <b>Italian</b> <b>method,</b> and the soulful passion of Russian ballet. She developed an extremely precise manner for the instruction of ballet in her book Basic Principles of Russian Classical dance (1948). This includes outlining when to teach technical components to students in their ballet careers, for how long to focus on it, and the right amount of focus at each stage of the student's career. These textbooks continue to be extremely important to the instruction of ballet today.|$|E

50|$|In 1875, he {{was sent}} (with his second wife) to California to recover from a cough, and having sung with success in opera and concert there, decided to settle in San Francisco, and to {{establish}} himself as a teacher. He retired from the stage in 1878, but continued to sing regularly in concert and public events. Some notices suggest that Formes became very poor, and was reduced to singing popular songs in cafés chantants for a living. After his second wife's death, in 1882-83 he went east for a season to sing again, and married Pauline, one of his students since 1876, in Philadelphia. In 1883 made a concert tour {{in various parts of}} the U.S. and Canada with the distinguished operatic singer Emma Thursby (1845-1931), travelling with Maurice Strakosch. Having returned to San Francisco to resume teaching with Pauline, in 1887 he published his 'Old <b>Italian</b> <b>Method</b> of Singing', the fruits of a lifetime's experience. In 1888 he sang at the first large Music Festival in Quebec with his pupil Carrie McLellan. He and Pauline visited England and France in 1888, and Formes gave concerts in England and met again with Charles Santley. He published his memoirs in German at Cologne in 1888 with the help of the editor Wilhelm Koch. His final appearance was on 10 December 1889 at the opening of the Bijou Theatre in San Francisco, to sing Don Basilio once more: he was received with great enthusiasm.

50|$|This {{operation}} for nasal reconstruction (rhinoplasty) {{was developed in}} Italy due to the popularity of duelling with rapier in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The invention of the method {{is believed to be}} about surgeons Gustavo Branca and his son Antonio, who lived in 1400 in Catania. Branca de Branca (the senior) used a skin flap from the cheek and years later, his son Antonio Branca used a flap raised from the arm. It has been suggested that reconstructive surgical methods described in the Sushruta Samhita, which was translated into Arabic in the 8th century, traveled further to Italy and was then incorporated into the methods described by Branca. The technique was then taken up in Calabria during the sixteenth century by the brothers surgeons Peter and Paul Boiano (also called Vianeo). This process was described by the great anatomist Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564) but, incredibly wrong, advised to use the muscle and the skin of the arm to adjust the nose. The <b>Italian</b> <b>method</b> was however criticized by Gabriele Fallopio (1523-1562) as such a procedure could force the patient to remain with the arm immobilized for many months, and the result was not guaranteed as the skin would often detach. Tagliacozzi probably knew the method of Boiano through the description of Leonardo Fioravanti. Tagliacozzi's method was practiced by Fortunio Liceti, who mentions it in his De monstruorum nature caussis et differentiis of 1616, by Henricus Moinichen in Observationes Medical chirurgicae of 1691, by Thomas Feyens surgeon to the University of Louvain, who had studied in Bologna with Tagliacozzi, in his work De praecipuis Artis Chirurgicae controversiis, published posthumously in 1669. But this operation declined during the seventeenth century throughout Europe and the method of Tagliacozzi was actually forgotten, until it was rediscovered and applied in 1800 by the German surgeon Karl Ferdinand von Graefe, whereupon it was used right up to the early twentieth century.|$|E
