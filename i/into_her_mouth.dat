5|$|A {{music video}} was filmed {{for the song}} and {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas. There are {{two versions of the}} video— one intercut with clips from the ABC series Dirty Sexy Money and created to promote the show, and another which is the official video. The video is set in a mansion, and starts with Gaga making her way down a hallway with several people who are either walking behind her, holding an umbrella over her, dancing in front of her, or tossing dollar bills around her. Gaga and company are then featured in many repeatedly-changing shots at various locations in the mansion. She is seen lying seductively on a table covered with money, crawling along a black grand piano and striking the keys with her leg several times, dancing around and later making out with a statue, and dancing in an elevator solo. There are also several close-up shots of her burning money and later stuffing it <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Over the course of the video, she undergoes numerous costume changes. Singer-songwriter Space Cowboy is also shown, most notably in scenes where he climbs a wall.|$|E

One {{year after}} Lady Zhen's death, Cao Pi instated Guo as the empress despite opposition from an official, Zhan Qian (棧潛). The historical text Han Jin Chunqiu (漢晉春秋) mentioned that Lady Zhen's body was desecrated after her death – her face was covered by her hair and rice husks were stuffed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Cao Rui was raised by Guo Nüwang after Lady Zhen's death.|$|E

25|$|On 12 October 2013 a then 26-year-old Polish art student, Jerzy Bohdan Szumczyk, {{erected a}} movable statue {{next to the}} Soviet World War II {{memorial}} in the Polish city of Gdańsk. The statue depicted a Soviet soldier attempting to rape a pregnant woman; pulling her hair with one hand whilst pushing a pistol <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Authorities removed the artwork {{because it had been}} erected without an official permit, but there was widespread interest in many online publications. The act promoted an angry reaction from the Russian ambassador in Poland.|$|E
25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places her mouth to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E
25|$|Zahau was gagged with a blue, long sleeve T-shirt {{wrapped around}} her head with the sleeves double knotted and stuffed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> There was also what {{appeared}} to be tape residue on her legs. Medics attempted to revive her, but pronounced her dead at the scene. The police initiated forensic and toxicology testing on her body as part of an autopsy to determine the cause of death. She was buried at St. Joseph's Memorial Park in St. Joseph, Missouri on July 23. Speculations of foul play began early on in the case; however, investigators were unable to find any other DNA at the scene besides Zahau's. On September 2, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department formally announced their finding that Zahau committed suicide.|$|E

50|$|The credulousness of {{the first}} set of watchers was {{revealed}} in her admission that during the whole sixteen days of her first observation she had been fed by her daughter while the watchers were in the room. The younger woman had soaked towels in milk and broth and wrung them <b>into</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>mouth</b> while washing <b>her</b> face. She had also conveyed food from <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> to <b>her</b> mother's while kissing her.|$|R
25|$|Genie's father fed Genie {{as little}} as {{possible}} and refused to give her solid food, feeding her only baby food, cereal, Pablum, an occasional soft-boiled egg, and liquids. Her father, or when coerced her brother, spooned food <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as quickly as possible, and if she choked or could not swallow fast enough the person feeding her rubbed her face in her food. These were normally the only times he allowed his wife to be with Genie, although she could not feed Genie herself. Genie's mother claimed her husband always fed Genie three times a day but also said that Genie sometimes risked a beating by making noise when hungry, leading researchers to believe he often refused to feed her. In early 1972 Genie's mother told researchers that at night, when possible, at around 11 PM she surreptitiously tried to give Genie additional food, causing Genie to develop an abnormal sleep pattern in which she slept from 7 to 11 PM, woke up for a few minutes, and fell back asleep for an additional 6 hours. This pattern continued for several months after removal from captivity.|$|E

50|$|In the game, each {{participant}} usually places a marshmallow into their mouth and says 'chubby bunny'. If {{they are able}} to state the whole phrase, usually in a comprehensible manner that the other participants wholly concur to, they pass that round. Each successful player then adds an additional marshmallow to the one already in his or <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and repeats the phrase. A player who fails to complete the phrase is eliminated from the game. The process continues until only one player remains. After the penultimate player loses the game, the winning player might have to place one more marshmallow <b>into</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and may have to state the phrase once more. The winner of the game is the player who fits the most marshmallows <b>into</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Some variants of the game require the winner to actually ingest the marshmallows.|$|R
