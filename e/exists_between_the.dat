5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of pigeye sharks across northern Australia {{suggest that the}} evolutionary history of this species was affected by coastline changes during the Pleistocene epoch (2.6 million to 12,000 years ago). The patterns of diversity found in its mitochondrial DNA {{are consistent with the}} repeated splitting and merging of its populations as geographical barriers were alternately formed and inundated. The most recent of these barriers was a land bridge across the Torres Strait that reopened only some 6,000 years ago; as a result, significant genetic separation <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sharks found off Western Australia and the Northern Territory and those found off Queensland.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering down of the equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the silky shark is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} of the Peak to major conurbations and urban areas (an estimated 20 million people live within an hour's drive) poses unique challenges for managing the area.

An inevitable tension <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> needs of the 38,000 residents of the Peak District National Park, {{the needs of the}} many millions of people who visit it annually, and the conservation requirements of the area.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
5|$|Some other {{anatomical}} distinction <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> larvae of the Nematocera and the Brachycera. Especially in the Brachycera, little demarcation is seen {{between the}} thorax and abdomen, though the demarcation may be visible in many Nematocera, such as mosquitoes; in the Brachycera, {{the head of}} the larva is not clearly distinguishable {{from the rest of the}} body, and few, if any, sclerites are present. Informally, such brachyceran larvae are called maggots, but the term is not technical and often applied indifferently to fly larvae or insect larvae in general. The eyes and antennae of brachyceran larvae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to food such as carrion, decaying detritus, or host tissues surrounding endoparasites. Nematoceran larvae generally have well-developed eyes and antennae, while those of Brachyceran larvae are reduced or modified.|$|E

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge <b>exists</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> first and second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; {{the tips of the}} second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as well) are black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
