5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes <b>image-based</b> thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes <b>image-based</b> thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using <b>image-based</b> lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
25|$|Digital {{pathology}} is an <b>image-based</b> information environment enabled {{by computer}} technology {{that allows for}} the management of information generated from a digital slide. Digital pathology is enabled in part by virtual microscopy, which is the practice of converting glass slides into digital slides that can be viewed, managed, and analyzed.|$|E
25|$|Value-based pricing: (also {{known as}} <b>image-based</b> pricing) occurs {{where the company}} uses prices to signal market value or {{associates}} price with the desired value position {{in the mind of}} the buyer. The aim of value-based pricing is to reinforce the overall positioning strategy e.g. premium pricing posture to pursue or maintain a luxury image.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{challenges}} {{associated with the}} accuracy and usefulness of gesture recognition software. For <b>image-based</b> gesture recognition there are limitations on the equipment used and image noise. Images or video may not be under consistent lighting, or in the same location. Items in the background or distinct features of the users may make recognition more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Single camera. A {{standard}} 2D camera can be {{used for}} gesture recognition where the resources/environment would not be convenient for other forms of <b>image-based</b> recognition. Earlier it was thought that single camera may not be as effective as stereo or depth aware cameras, but some companies are challenging this theory. Software-based gesture recognition technology using a standard 2D camera that can detect robust hand gestures.|$|E
25|$|Kinect V1 was a {{combination}} of Microsoft built software and hardware. Kinect V1 hardware included a range chipset technology by Israeli developer PrimeSense, which developed a system consisting of an infrared projector and camera and a special microchip that generates a grid from which the location of a nearby object in 3 dimensions can be ascertained. This 3D scanner system called Light Coding employs a variant of <b>image-based</b> 3D reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|One {{alternative}} method involves displaying {{to the user}} a simple mathematical equation and requiring the user to enter the solution as verification. Although these are much easier to defeat using software, they are suitable for scenarios where graphical imagery is not appropriate, and they provide a much higher level of accessibility for blind users than the <b>image-based</b> CAPTCHAs. These are {{sometimes referred to as}} MAPTCHAs (M = 'mathematical'). However, these may be difficult for users with a cognitive disorder.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{contains}} {{a range of}} new technologies and features that are intended to help network administrators and power users better manage their systems. Notable changes include a complete replacement for NTLDR based on the Windows Preinstallation Environment, completely rewritten <b>image-based</b> deployment mechanisms, a significantly improved Task Scheduler, a revamped event logging infrastructure, Windows Recovery Environment, support for per-application Remote Desktop sessions, new diagnostic, health monitoring and system administration tools, {{and a range of}} new Group Policy settings covering many of the new features.|$|E
25|$|Still another {{technique}} {{relies on}} a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic <b>image-based</b> authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and {{is very difficult for}} a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they were}} now being touted as the 'next big thing', several complex issues slowed their progress. Gilbertson's drug {{problems}} presented the band with {{no choice but to}} ask him to leave. Booth and Glennie had joined a sect named Lifewave that imposed many restrictions on their lifestyle and threatened the band's stability. The band's second EP, James II, was released over a year after the first and accompanied by a feature {{on the cover of the}} NME, Gilbertson having been replaced by the band's guitar tutor Larry Gott. The first two EPs would later be collected as Village Fire. Reviews were once again positive, and Factory were eager for James to record an album with it, but the band believed Factory were purely <b>image-based</b> and left the label, striking a deal with Sire Records.|$|E
25|$|By the 1990s, {{some of the}} {{previous}} research topics became more active than the others. Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration. With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized {{that a lot of}} the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry. This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images. Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques. At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation. This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface). Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision. This included <b>image-based</b> rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} issues degrade the quality of HPIV results. The first class of issues {{involves}} the reconstruction itself. In holography, the object wave of a particle is typically assumed to be spherical; however, due to Mie scattering theory, this wave is a complex shape which can distort the reconstructed particle. Another issue {{is the presence of}} substantial speckle noise which lowers the overall signal-to-noise ratio of particle images. This effect is of greater concern for in-line holographic systems because the reference beam is propagated through the volume along with the scattered object beam. Noise can also be introduced through impurities in the scattering medium, such as temperature variations and window blemishes. Because holography requires coherent imaging, these effects are much more severe than traditional imaging conditions. The combination of these factors increases the complexity of the correlation process. In particular, the speckle noise in an HPIV recording often prevents traditional <b>image-based</b> correlation methods from being used. Instead, single particle identification and correlation are implemented, which set limits on particle number density. A more comprehensive outline of these error sources is given in Meng et al.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, TVNZ held a telethon {{to raise}} funds for Teletext-encoding {{equipment}} used for the creation and editing of text-based broadcast services for the deaf. The service came into use in 1984 with caption creation and importing paid for as part of the public broadcasting fee until the creation of the NZ on Air taxpayer fund, which is used to provide captioning for NZ On Air content, TVNZ news shows and conversion of EIA-608 US captions to the preferred EBU STL format for only TVNZ 1, TV 2 and TV 3 with archived captions available to FOUR and select Sky programming. During the second half of 2012, TV3 and FOUR began providing non-Teletext DVB <b>image-based</b> captions on their HD service and used the same format on the satellite service, which has since caused major timing issues in relation to server load and the loss of captions from most SD DVB-S receivers, such as the ones Sky Television provides their customers. As of April 2, 2013, only the Teletext page 801 caption service will remain in use with the informational Teletext non-caption content being discontinued.|$|E

With the game's increased focus on the Forerunners, the artists invested heavily into {{the look and feel}} of Forerunner technology. [...] The game also features more diversity in Forerunner structures, including fully active Forerunner technology as opposed to the mostly inert and abandoned structures seen in the earlier games. The majority of the game is lit statically using lightmaps; this allowed the art team to achieve realistic lighting effects with full global illumination and ambient occlusion. <b>Image-based</b> lighting is also used to ground scenes and make everything fit together better.|$|E
500|$|The Million Dollar Homepage is {{a website}} {{conceived}} in 2005 by Alex Tew, {{a student from}} Wiltshire, England, {{to raise money for}} his university education. The home page consists of a million pixels arranged in a [...] pixel grid; the <b>image-based</b> links on it were sold for $1 per pixel in [...] blocks. The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them, a URL to which the images were linked, and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a cursor over the link. The aim of the website was to sell all of the pixels in the image, thus generating a million dollars of income for the creator. The Wall Street Journal has commented that the site inspired other websites that sell pixels.|$|E
500|$|While Vissi's {{popularity}} and commercial appeal {{had already begun}} declining by the early 2000s, as seen by the sales of albums such as Nylon which although successful had relatively low sales compared to her other albums [...] Eurovision was considered by {{a small number of}} reporters to have had a detrimental affect to her career. Vissi admitted that she viewed her participation as a mistake. Although this was partially due to hardships faced by the Greek music industry including piracy, the financial crisis, and changing musical tastes, leading to a general decline of the laïko-pop scene and <b>image-based</b> singers, her career choices, such as the pursuit of an international career at a relatively advanced age, leading to several long absences from Greece and attempting to use Eurovision as a gateway, were thought to be major components. In an article about the [...] "golden trio of Greek pop" [...] consisting of Vissi, Despina Vandi, and Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vlavianou of To Vima considered Vissi to have [...] "the most vociferous" [...] decline of the group.

500|$|Although Wipeout 2048 and Wipeout HD have {{a shared}} shader program {{and did not}} require {{retooling}} for the Vita's architecture, Roberts said that a [...] "great deal" [...] of time and attention was spent fine-tuning the game's shader effects for the Vita's GPU. Lovegrove thought that the method of working on a PlayStation 3 and its handheld counterpart was identical (a sentiment generally shared by the team), and Roberts said that the systems' similarities helped the team [...] "get moving quickly". Roberts added that the game's lighting system was identical to that of Wipeout HD; both games' ships shared <b>image-based</b> lighting, with blended diffuse and specular highlights effects and the vertex-based lighting system used for weaponry. According to Roberts, {{the main difference between}} the games was PlayStation Vita's utilisation of the effects via the GPU; PlayStation 3 relied on SPUs. The team decided to use anti-aliased colour buffers for real-time shadow rendering, instead of depth buffers. This gave the game greater transparency effects, since the memory cost of anti-aliasing was 8 bits per pixel; therefore, 4x MSAA (multisample anti-aliasing) buffers contained the same amount of memory as a 32-bit depth buffer. Another feature which Roberts considered an improvement was tone mapping (partly due to Vita's superior support of buffer formats), which gave Wipeout 2048 better exposure control and bloom effects.|$|E

2500|$|The {{variety of}} {{implementations}} for <b>image-based</b> gesture recognition may also cause issue for {{viability of the}} technology to general usage. For example, an algorithm calibrated for one camera may not work for a different camera. [...] The amount of background noise also causes tracking and recognition difficulties, especially when occlusions (partial and full) occur. [...] Furthermore, {{the distance from the}} camera, and the camera's resolution and quality, also cause variations in recognition accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|The photogrametric and <b>image-based</b> computer-generated {{background}} {{approaches in}} The Matrixs bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It {{also led to}} the development of [...] "Universal Capture", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.|$|E
2500|$|After {{several months}} of {{relatively}} little news or activity from Microsoft with Longhorn, Build 4008 (with a build date of February 19, 2003) made an appearance on the Internet around February 28, 2003. It was also privately handed out to {{a select group of}} software developers. As an evolutionary release over build 3683, it contained a number of small improvements, including a modified blue [...] "Plex" [...] theme and a new, simplified Windows <b>Image-based</b> installer that operates in graphical mode from the outset, and completed an install of the operating system in approximately one third the time of Windows XP on the same hardware.

2500|$|While the {{popularity}} of social networking consistently rises, new uses for the technology are frequently being observed. At the forefront of emerging trends in social networking sites {{is the concept of}} [...] "real-time web" [...] and [...] "location-based". Real-time allows users to contribute contents, which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded—the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcasts. Twitter set the trend for [...] "real-time" [...] services, wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing, or what is on their minds within a 140-character limit. Facebook followed suit with their [...] "Live Feed" [...] where users' activities are streamed as soon as it happens. While Twitter focuses on words, Clixtr, another real-time service, focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an event. Facebook, however, remains the largest photo sharing site—Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 2012. In April, 2012, the <b>image-based</b> social media network Pinterest had become the third largest social network in the United States.|$|E

[...] Many mapping techniques have a relatively low resolution, including hundreds of thousands of neurons in a single voxel. [...] Many functions also involve multiple parts of the brain, meaning that this type of claim is probably both unverifiable with the equipment used, and generally based on an incorrect assumption about how brain functions are divided. [...] It may be that most brain functions will only be described correctly after being measured with much more fine-grained measurements that look not at large regions but instead at {{a very large number of}} tiny individual brain circuits. [...] Many of these studies also have technical problems like small sample size or poor equipment calibration which means they cannot be reproduced - considerations which are sometimes ignored to produce a sensational journal article or news headline. [...] In some cases the brain mapping techniques are used for commercial purposes, lie detection, or medical diagnosis in ways which have not been scientifically validated.|$|E
2500|$|As it {{happened}} in many cases throughout Vissi's career, she was criticized by some journalists. Eleftheros Typos cited the album as a relative commercial failure and furthered the commercial decline Vissi had faced in the 2000s. Although this was partially due to hardships faced by the Greek music industry including piracy, the financial crisis, and changing musical tastes, leading to a general decline of the laiko-pop scene and <b>image-based</b> singers, in {{an article about the}} [...] "golden trio" [...] of Greek pop, consisting of Vissi, Despina Vandi, and Sakis Rouvas, Anna Vlavianou of To Vima noted Vissi as having [...] "the most vociferous" [...] decline of the group. She cited several reasons for this, such as Vissi's unsuccessful result at Eurovision and long absences from Greece in pursuit of a career abroad at a relatively advanced age, leading to her losing a portion of her established Greek fanbase. Additionally, while in previous years the supposed rivalry between Vissi and Vandi drew heavy media attention, with the public curious as to who would come out on top, she cited Elena Paparizou as replacing both artists as top contemporary female {{in the latter half of}} the decade. Haris Simvoulidis of Avopolis also alleged that on Apagorevmeno Vissi appeared to be attempting to catch up to her contemporaries, Paparizou and Peggy Zina. Despite these comments, Apagorevmeno became the biggest selling album by a female artist in Greece for the year 2009.|$|E
