40|$|In our always-evolving world, {{financial}} literacy and inclusion are crucial {{in the development}} of sustainable welfare and a more transparent and fairer society. We cannot forget that the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008 that has continued across the world to this day has financial illiteracy {{as one of the most}} aggravating factors. The main challenge for many consumers worldwide is that the requirements of adequate {{financial literacy}} skills have been steadily increasing over time. Individuals have to take a wide range of financial decisions and unfortunately, they sometimes overlook or simply do not know the risk attached with the decisions they are making until it is too late. The main challenges for financial literacy at the micro-level, meso-level, and macro-level are over deference to the financial industry, lack of financial <b>knowledge,</b> <b>overconfidence</b> about financial knowledge, lack of government initiatives, frameworks and regulations, lack of life-cycle planning and interesting and fascinating ways to teach financial literacy skills...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to find out whether Finnish mutual fund {{managers}} are prone to behavioral biases. Additionally, some opinions of the mutual fund managers are asked in relation to overconfidence and investing. The following behavioral biases are investigated in this paper: overconfidence, disposition effect, self-attribution bias, house money effect, status quo bias, and illusion of <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Overconfidence</b> is further divided into better-than-average effect and overconfidence on a general level. Three of these studied behavioral biases have been found from mutual fund managers, or similar, before and they are: overconfidence, disposition effect, and house money effect. Thus, better-than-average effect, self-attribution bias, status quo bias, and illusion of knowledge have not been studied on mutual fund managers before. Therefore, this study tries to fill this gap in behavioral finance literature and provide valuable information to asset management industry about behavior and decision making of the Finnish mutual fund managers. As the research method a quantitative questionnaire was selected. Target population for this survey was Finnish mutual fund managers working in Finland. Collecting the sample began in the beginning of December 2014 and the final answers were received on seventh of February 2015. Primary contact method was by phone. A total of 35 banks or asset management companies were contacted and 23 of these participated in the survey. There were in total of 57 mutual fund managers that completed the questionnaire. This gives a response rate of approximately 26 %. It can be stated that this unique sample is a good representation of the entire population of the Finnish mutual fund managers. When analyzing the sample statistical methods were used. Most important information provided is histograms that present the percentage distribution of answers for each question and claim. In order to investigate how the different answers are related a Pearson's correlation matrix was used. Based on my results it seems that Finnish mutual fund managers are prone to behavioral biases. On average it appears that the survey participants are subject to better-than-average effect, status quo bias and illusion of knowledge. Clearly more than half of the participants show quite strong signs of status quo bias and illusion of knowledge. There is also evidence that 44 % of the participants might be subject to disposition effect to some extent. Furthermore, 23 % of the Finnish mutual fund managers possibly exhibit, at least weakly, house money effect. Instead, the evidence is rather clear that the participants are not prone to overconfidence on a general level. Findings of the self-attribution bias are disregarded since it is possible that the respondents misunderstood how to answer questions related to it. The participants' opinions about overconfidence, on the other hand, suggest that overconfidence indeed is present in the work of the Finnish mutual fund managers...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the effect}} of IT <b>knowledge</b> on the <b>overconfidence</b> of venture capitalists (VCs) in their IT {{investments}} is examined. Our findings show that {{the effect of}} IT <b>knowledge</b> on <b>overconfidence</b> is nonlinear. VCs with moderate levels of IT knowledge are least overconfident. At the same time, VCs with moderate levels of IT knowledge are most resistant to the biasing effects of past successes. Past failures show a negative association with overconfidence independent of the level of the VCâ€™s IT knowledge. Finally, the negative association between stakes and VC overconfidence is stronger with greater levels of IT knowledge. These results shed light on the highly disputed role of IT knowledge in the domain of IT investments...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{how and why}} men {{and women}} are {{different}} in their confidence levels. Using the data of the PISA test in math, confidence is decomposed into two dimensions: confidence in correct math <b>knowledge</b> and <b>overconfidence</b> in over-claiming false knowledge. The findings highlight that female students are not less confident than male students, but they are rather less overconfident. Furthermore, mathematical abilities have different effects on male and female students. While ability alone increases confidence and decreases overconfidence, the interaction effect of feminine gender and ability is negative. This means that the negative effect of ability on overconfidence is larger for female students than male ones, while the positive effect of ability on confidence is smaller for females. That being said, the negative gender gap in overconfidence against girls is greater for students in the higher quartiles of math scores than those in the lower quartiles. Also, the positive gender gap in confidence for girls is smaller for well-performing students than underperforming ones. The empirical evidence further reveals that such gender-asymmetric effects of ability can be explained by gender socialization that limits women's roles and undermines their achievements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} equilibrium {{in games}} where the informed players may be overconfident. Motivated by specific moral-hazard, signalling and screening problems, we first {{assume that the}} "uninformed" players know that the "informed" players may be mistaken, but that the "informed" players are unaware of this. In standard bayesian games, we identify a conflict between self-perception and equilibrium conjectures. We thus turn to population games and assume that while each player believes that her own perception is correct, she also knows that the other players in the population are on average overconfident. It is shown that in any equilibrium of anu such game, players cannot be made better-off by being overconfident. Overconfidence may be beneficial only when comparing payoff across different games, or across different equilibria of the same game. The {{second part of the}} paper considers any description of high-order <b>knowledge</b> of <b>overconfidence.</b> We determine the descriptions that allow to construct an equilibrium concept immune to introspective conflicts. It is shown that overconfidence cannot make any player better off also in the case that she is aware that the opponents think that she might be overconfident. The paper is concluded by showing how to translate our knowledge-based analysis in the language of Mertens and Zamir (1985) universal types. ...|$|R
40|$|Two robust {{phenomena}} {{in research on}} confidence in one's general <b>knowledge</b> are the <b>overconfidence</b> phenomenon and the hard-easy effect. In this article, the authors propose that the hard-easy effect has been interpreted with insufficient attention to the scale-end effects, the linear dependency, and the regression effects in data and that the continued adherence {{to the idea of}} a "cognitive overconfidence bias " is mediated by selective attention to particular data sets. A quantitative review of studies with 2 -alternative general knowledge items demonstrates that, contrary to widespread belief, there is (a) very little support for a cognitive-processing bias in these data; (b) a difference between representative and selected item samples that is not reducible to the difference in difficulty; and (c) near elimination of the hard-easy effect when there is control for scale-end effects and linear dependency. Two well-known threats to scientific progress are naive empir-icism and dogmatism. When one tries to explain to an untutored mind that the earth is round, one might be objected to by reference to the fact that the horizon looks flat to the naked eye. This is an illustration of naive empiricism, the uncritical acceptance of em-pirical observation. The classic example of dogmatism, theologica...|$|R
3000|$|SMEs {{are viewed}} {{as a source of}} {{flexibility}} and innovation, and they make significant contributions to the economies of many countries, both {{in terms of the number}} of SMEs and the proportion of the labor force employed by them (Hoffman et al. [1998]; Ministry of Economic Development [2004]). However, SMEs are perceived as high-risk ventures, and the entry and exit rates support this perception (Zacharakis et al. [1999]). Previous research has indicated that there is little difference between small business failure rates in developed and developing economies, and it is estimated that 50 % of all start-ups fail in their first year, while 75 % to 80 % fail within the first 3 to 5 years in the USA (Anderson and Dunkelberg [1990]). It has also been shown that up to 50 % of the small businesses started in South Africa eventually failed (Watson and Vuuren [2002]). In New Zealand, 40 % to 50 % of small businesses failed within the first 10 years, and a negative correlation was found between a firmâ€™s total full-time employment and its failure rate (Ministry of Economic Development [2004]). Business failure is often caused by a lack of <b>knowledge,</b> misplaced <b>overconfidence,</b> lack of financial performance strategies, or a lack of internal management planning (Gibson and Cassar [2005]; Hartcher et al. [2003]). In spite of high failure rates, however, small businesses continue to be an essential component of the economy of many countries as they account for a significant percentage of all entities and collectively employ large numbers of the workforce. Generally, SMEs depend on financial factors such as profit or sales when considering business risks (Waring and Glendon [1998]). However, monetary factors alone may ignore many issues affecting the long-term reputation of the SME and its staff. A recent research study has suggested that risk management is less well developed within SMEs where the strong enterprise culture sometimes mitigates against managing risks in a professional structured way (Virdi [2005]). According to the study, the SMEs are reluctant to adopt a formal risk management strategy despite having the evidence that businesses that adopt risk management strategies are more likely to survive and grow. Zacharakis et al. ([1999]) identify some reasons for failures of small businesses that include both internal and external causes. The internal causes of failure include poor management, lack of risk management planning, and failure to adopt a risk limit threshold. The external causes included government policies, the vulnerability resulting from small size, competition from larger businesses, civil strife, natural disasters, and general economic downturns. It was also found that â€˜overconfidenceâ€™ could often drive small business operators to devalue the importance of fundamental risk assessment that ultimately caused their failure. Although there are some other causes for failure that are highlighted in this section, our research is not intended to investigate the reasons behind the absolute failures of SMEs. Rather, it deals with identifying the potential risks existing when operating SMEs within their current infrastructures so that they can avoid potential failures by implementing a strategic risk management approach. Because manufacturing involves a complicated mix of people, systems, processes, and equipment, an effective research strategy needs to be multidisciplinary in its approach to establishing a risk management framework (Islam [2008]). Because of some infrastructural, technological, financial, and human resource-related limitations, SMEs may keep themselves away from adopting a positive approach towards strategic risk management (Islam et al. [2006]; Islam [2008]; Hartcher et al. [2003]; Martie-Louise [2006]). Islam et al. ([2006]) state: [...]...|$|R
