500|$|Lady Grange's {{story is}} a {{remarkable}} one and various issues have been raised by Macaulay (2009) as requiring explanation. These include: what drove James Erskine to these extraordinary lengths?; why were so many individuals {{willing to participate in}} this illegal and dangerous kidnapping of his wife?; and [...] <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> held for so long without rescue? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to {{give him}} the purse? It was burning a hole in her pocket till she could do so; and yet <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to get it out of}} her {{possession}} into his, and make her little speech, here in the public garden? She could have done it easily enough at home in the drawing-room at Surbiton Cottage.|$|E
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to do this? An {{establishment}} in the Stumfold direction might be easier.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my aunt," [...] said Martin, anxiously; [...] "you {{have said}} nothing about Aunt Dorothy. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> where <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> well?" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{special kind}} of rhythm may be {{observed}} in the dirges, called by the Hebrews [...] "kinot". A whole book of these elegies is contained in the Hebrew Bible, the first of them beginning thus: [...] "How does the city sit solitary - that was full of people - <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> become as a widow - <b>she</b> that <b>was</b> great among the nations - and princess among the provinces - <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> become tributary!" [...] (Lamentations 1:1).|$|R
60|$|And sister Mat, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> getting along--I believe I {{will have}} {{to write a letter}} {{especially}} to her and Sis one of these times.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to forbid}} {{him to come}} before Susan and Jane! She could only be silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like your}} doughty policeman, Riach," [...] he said. [...] "Hie, obliging friend, let us hear how this gypsy struck you. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> dressed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When he was gone, it was {{possible}} to come to the examination upon Janet for which Mother Carey had been so anxious. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> looking? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{very glad}} you are come; I came to inquire at the door, {{and they told}} me that you <b>were</b> here. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> poor thing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not at all. She's a {{nice little}} girl enough, and he'll have nothing to trouble him. But <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she,</b> poor thing, to talk to royal blood?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I fail {{to follow}} your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to prove their authenticity?" ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to get {{herself out}} of the room? It would not do for such a Juliet to stay all the night looking into the eyes of her ancient Romeo. And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to behave herself to Lady Ball, when she should again find herself in the drawing-room, {{conscious}} as she was that Lady Ball knew all about it? And <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to conduct herself before all those young people whom she had left there? And her proposed father-in-law, whom she feared so much, and in truth disliked so greatly--would he know all about it, and thrust his ill-natured jokes at her? Her lover should have opened the door for her to pass through; but instead of doing so, as soon as she had withdrawn her hand from his, he placed himself on the rug, and leaned back in silence against the chimney-piece.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can feel}} quite safe on that point," [...] he assured me. [...] "I was her counsel--that is, {{if it is}} the same woman. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> dressed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> going to receive him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{think that}} I have found you at last, child. How puzzled you look. Did your mother never speak of me? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> Where <b>is</b> she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, Duke, {{you know}} you have no right to speak to me like this. Let us think of poor Constance. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to <b>be</b> told the truth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want {{to inquire}} after you all, but {{particularly}} your niece. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is." ...|$|R
6000|$|She looked {{surprised}} at my agitation, but she little guessed its cause. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to know anything}} of that little packet {{which seemed to be}} burning a hole in my heart? ...|$|E
60|$|But yet, {{now that}} the moment was coming, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to talk to him? <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to speak the words which would rob him of his hope, {{and tell him that}} he did not, could not, never could possess that one {{treasure}} which he desired more than houses and lands, or station and rank? Alas, alas! If it could have been otherwise! If it could have been otherwise! She also was in love with poverty;--but at any rate, no one could accuse her now of sacrificing a poor lover for a rich one. Herbert Fitzgerald would be poor enough.|$|E
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to {{tell him}} that it was to the tone of the note she objected--to the hint of a clandestine meeting? She turned the light of her eyes full upon him.|$|E
6000|$|Heaven above! Why {{did you not}} deep those cursed sugar-tongs out of [...] her sight? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{going to}} get through it if you frighten her [...] like this? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You said a {{woman should}} fly frae the like o' Grizel's father though it should be {{to the other end}} of the world, but <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to ken that he's that kind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems 's if {{it helped}} her, an' so--I guess I'll stay. She may call for me, an' if she does," [...] he said resolutely, [...] "I'm goin' in, doctor. <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western {{would have}} been a lady condescending to her inferiors. These people were to her, {{certainly}} clownish--in short, the working classes. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to adjust herself? ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{reached this}} conclusion, <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to shape her future course? What new means could she {{discover}} which would lead her secretly to her end, {{in defiance of}} Mrs. Lecount's malicious vigilance and Noel Vanstone's miserly distrust? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{knew more}} of it than my dear {{mistress}} did herself, sir—a thousand times more. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> who was as innocent as a child, {{to know what was}} the meaning of the covert addresses of a villain?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] I said, yawning, [...] "but perhaps, Zikali, {{you will}} come to the point of the spear. What of her? <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> named, and if she exists will she help me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was wondering," [...] cried Mary Phillips, [...] "what {{had become}} of you; I thought perhaps you had gone down to breakfast." [...] In answer I called to her to tell me where Miss Nugent <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> came to <b>be</b> in this {{surprising}} situation, {{and how many people}} there were on board the steamer.|$|R
6000|$|... "To-morrow!" [...] exclaimed Johanna; [...] "and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> to <b>be</b> meetly clad? Look at this widow-garb; and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> time to {{be found}} for {{procuring}} other raiment? House-father, a substantial man like you should better understand! The meal too! I must to gossip Sophie!" ...|$|R
60|$|When Osborne {{heard that}} his friend had found her, he made hot and anxious {{inquiries}} regarding the poor child. <b>How</b> <b>was</b> <b>she?</b> How did she look? What did she say? His comrade took his hand, and {{looked him in}} the face.|$|E
60|$|It then {{occurred}} to Lady Carbury {{that if this}} were true the marriage after all might be suitable. But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to find out whether}} it was true? 'I understand that your papa is opposed to it,' she said.|$|E
60|$|But <b>how</b> <b>was</b> <b>she</b> to tell Susan? She ran up stairs almost breathless with haste, to {{the bedroom}} door; but then she stopped; too much joy she had heard was as {{dangerous}} as too much sorrow; she must think it over for a while, and so she crept back again.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she</b> {{getting on}} without a baily?" [...] the {{maltster}} inquired. Henery shook his head, and smiled {{one of the}} bitter smiles, dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a corrugated heap in the centre.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> Why did she {{not come}} with you?" [...] sobbed Edith; while Dick Prince, seating {{himself on a}} rock, drew her on his knee and stroked her fair head as she wept upon his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{not exactly}} the object one desires in a governess," [...] said Marian. [...] "Well, poor thing! and <b>how</b> <b>is</b> Clara? <b>is</b> <b>she</b> very sorry?" ...|$|R
