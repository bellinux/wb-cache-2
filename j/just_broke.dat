I was feeling very dizzy, I had a lot of vertigo, I had pain but it's like fuck if I know what hurts the most because I'd been on tour for a year. But I didn't want to let them down and I just couldn't cancel because the thought of leaving 50,000 kids in the arena <b>just</b> <b>broke</b> my heart.

According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I <b>just</b> <b>broke</b> up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that {{has a lot to do}} with it."

500|$|Series {{producer}} Ryan Murphy first planned {{an episode}} entitled [...] "Original Song" [...] to air in early 2010, during the series' first season. Prior to this episode, most of Glees musical performances were cover versions, and by October 2009 {{he had received}} offers from multiple songwriters willing to devise original tracks. At the time, he stated that Diane Warren would write two ballads for the show, and if successful, Glee may continue to use original music in the future, {{but not all the}} time. These plans did not come to fruition, nor did a December 2009 claim by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder that he had been recruited by Glees music supervisor, Adam Anders, to write an original song for the series. Murphy later stated that he planned to showcase original music during the second season, aiming to find a way for this to occur organically, as: [...] "It wouldn’t work [...] if they <b>just</b> <b>broke</b> out and started singing their own songs. You wouldn't get it. I {{think it has to be}} an assignment." ...|$|E

Will tells Grace about his return visit to Psychic Sue and how he will end up with someone named [...] "Jack". Will is frightened of the idea that he and his friend Jack, also gay, will end up together. Will finally tells Jack what the psychic said, which horrifies Jack, but Will and Jack realize they are meant to stay together, just in the non-romantic relationship they have always had.|$|E

[...] Ólafur agreed to join the production, and his hiring was publicly announced in December 2012. Ólafur called working on Broadchurch series one [...] "an absolute pleasure.

[...] Sam Phillips indicated that for him it was a new sound, saying [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>broke</b> me up".

2500|$|Ólafur Arnalds won a British Academy Television (BAFTA) Craft Award for Original Television Music in April 2014. It was {{his first}} {{composition}} for television. Ólafur's music was widely praised. Mike Hale, writing in The New York Times, called it [...] "a tasty icing of gloom and foreboding", and noted that the show leaned very heavily on the mood that the music created. Cast members were equally as impressed with the music. Actress Jodie Whittaker has said that [...] "hearing the music by Ólafur Arnalds <b>just</b> <b>broke</b> me every time." [...] Actor Andrew Buchan was equally effusive. [...] "The power of music can draw people in more than they realise. I had never heard {{a piece of music}} like it. They deliberately went left-field with Ólafur Arnalds. I found it haunting, beautiful and desolate. It can make or break a show. If you think about your reasons for watching The Killing, the music that swells at the end draws you into watching another one. Same with Broadchurch— the music can't be ignored." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{dominating}} in the Qualifying Tournament, Lithuania had a {{tough time}} at the Olympics. The first game against Argentina turned into a fiasco, as the South Americans forced Lithuania into a double-digit deficit in the first half, and kept a comfortable lead in the second half to finish the game strong, 102–79. Luis Scola, who was held down to 13 points in the quarterfinal match against Lithuania two years ago at the World Championship, led Argentina with 32 points. Lithuania rebounded from the loss playing with Nigeria, which also served to avenge the only defeat in the Qualifying Tournament. Playing exemplary defense against the Nigerian bigs Al-Farouq Aminu and Ike Diogu, Lithuania handily won 72–53. Next was another defeat, as France rode Tony Parker and Boris Diaw to win the game 74–82. The following game was against USA, which had <b>just</b> <b>broke</b> recordswith their 156–73 blowout of Nigeria. Right from the beginning, Lithuania proved to be a tough opponent for Team USA, with Linas Kleiza scoring 25 points, and former Duke player Martynas Pocius having 7 rebounds and 6 assists. The Lithuania were down by only 4 points at the half and 6 {{at the end of the}} third quarter. In the final quarter, Lithuania momentarily took the lead 84–82, but lost it again as LeBron James scored 9 points in 4 minutes to achieve a 94–99 win. ESPN's Marc Stein reacted to the near-defeat remembering the other struggle the [...] "Dream Team" [...] had with Lithuania in 2000, and adding that even if it was [...] "the weakest Lithuanian team they've ever faced in Olympic basketball competition, a limited Lithuania is still Lithuania.
