5|$|A <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> best-known {{feature of}} the Mortal Kombat series is its {{finishing}} move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The only exception from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E

25|$|The Greeks of {{this period}} {{believed}} there were three major divisions of all Greek people—Dorians, Aeolians, and Ionians (including Athenians), each with their own <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> distinctive dialects.

25|$|Sikhs {{sought to}} revive Sikhism in late 19th century. Its first meeting {{was in the}} Golden Temple, Amritsar in 1873, and it was largely {{launched}} by the Sanatan Sikhs, Gianis, priests, and granthis. Shortly thereafter, Nihang Sikhs began influencing the movement, followed by a sustained campaign by Tat Khalsa. The movement became a struggle between Sanatan Sikhs and Tat Khalsa in <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> interpreting Sikhism.|$|E
25|$|Taking an {{interdisciplinary}} approach to engineering systems is inherently complex since {{the behavior of}} and interaction among system components is not always immediately well defined or understood. <b>Defining</b> <b>and</b> characterizing such systems and subsystems and the interactions among them {{is one of the}} goals of systems engineering.

25|$|Trams and railway lines shaped Auckland's rapid {{expansion}} in the early {{first half of the}} 20th century, but soon afterward the dominance of the motor vehicle emerged. This has not abated: arterial roads and motorways have become both <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> geographically dividing features of the urban landscape. They also allowed further massive expansion that resulted in the growth of urban areas such as the North Shore (especially after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in the late 1950s), and Manukau City in the south.|$|E

In 1982 Zachman had already concluded that these analyses could reach far beyond automating systems design and managing data into the realms of strategic business planning and management science in general. It may be employed in the (in that time considered more esoteric) areas of enterprise architecture, data-driven systems design, data classification criteria, and more.|$|E

25|$|IRI {{software}} {{is designed to}} transform, convert, report, and protect large data volumes rapidly in distributed, heterogeneous computing environments. These functions are built into the CoSort package or through spin-offs for data extraction, generation, security, and migration. Each tool uses the same graphical IDE built on Eclipse, and metadata format for <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> manipulating data. IRI's open data definition file format is also supported by AnalytiX DS and Meta Integration Technology (MITI) so that third-party ETL, BI, and data modeling tool users can convert or re-use their existing metadata in IRI product environments.|$|E
25|$|Methodologically, social {{complexity}} is theory-neutral, {{meaning that}} it accommodates both local and global approaches to sociological research. The very idea of social complexity arises out of the historical-comparative methods of early sociologists; obviously, this method is important in developing, <b>defining,</b> <b>and</b> refining the theoretical construct of social complexity. As complex social systems have many parts {{and there are many}} possible relationships between those parts, appropriate methodologies are typically determined to some degree by the research level of analysis differentiated by the researcher according to the level of description or explanation demanded by the research hypotheses.|$|E

In addition, it's very possible that in the example above of the changing interface that the calling code would need to be modified as well, since in some sense the exceptions a method may throw are part of the method's implicit interface anyway.|$|E
25|$|Usually the Cartesian {{coordinate}} system {{is applied to}} manipulate equations for planes, straight lines, and squares, often in two and sometimes in three dimensions. Geometrically, one studies the Euclidean plane (two dimensions) and Euclidean space (three dimensions). As taught in school books, analytic geometry can be explained more simply: it is concerned with <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> representing geometrical shapes in a numerical way and extracting numerical information from shapes' numerical definitions and representations. The numerical output, however, might also be a vector or a shape. That the algebra of the real numbers can be employed to yield results about the linear continuum of geometry relies on the Cantor–Dedekind axiom.|$|E
25|$|According to Twelvers, <b>defining</b> <b>and</b> {{interpretation}} of Islamic jurisprudence {{is the responsibility}} of Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, it is the duty of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as Ijtihad and the clerics are known as Marja, meaning reference. The labels Allamah and Ayatollah are in use for Twelver clerics.|$|E
