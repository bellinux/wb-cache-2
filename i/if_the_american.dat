5|$|When the Treaty of Paris, {{under which}} Spain was to cede the Philippines to the United States, {{was made public}} in December 1898, Luna quickly decided to take {{military}} action. He proposed a strategy {{that was designed to}} trap the Americans in Manila before more of their troops could land by executing surprise attacks (guerrilla warfare) while building up strength in the north. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> forces penetrated his lines, Luna determined that he would wage a series of delaying battles and prepare a fortress in northern Luzon, particularly the Cordillera. This, however, was turned down by the High Command, who still believed that the Americans would grant full independence.|$|E

A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly enough {{that she had to}} be scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, but some of the surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E

25|$|Due to US interest, work {{proceeded}} on {{the development}} of a less ambitious successor, a Harrier fitted with a larger wing and making use of composite materials in its construction. Two prototypes were built from existing aircraft and flew in 1978. The US government was content to continue if a major foreign buyer was found and Britain had a plan to improve the Harrier with a new, larger metal wing. In 1980, the UK considered <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> program would meet their requirements – their opinion was that it required modification, thus the MDD wing design was altered to incorporate the British-designed leading-edge root extensions. In 1982, the UK opted to become fully involved in the joint US–UK programme. The US and UK agreement to proceed included a British contribution of US$280million to cover development costs to meet their own requirements and to purchase at least 60 aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|As ambassador, Luce {{consistently}} overestimated {{the possibility}} that the Italian left would mount a governmental coup and turn the country communist unless the democratic center was buttressed with generous American aid.

Around the same time, she fell seriously ill with arsenic poisoning. Sensational rumors circulated that the ambassador was the target of extermination by agents of the Soviet Union. Medical analysis eventually determined that the poisoning was caused by arsenate of lead in paint dust falling from the stucco that decorated her bedroom ceiling.

2500|$|The Air Force's {{solution}} to this problem was the introduction of stand-off missiles. Since the Soviet air-defenses were static and easy to spot from aerial reconnaissance or satellite reconnaissance photos, the plan was to use a long-range cruise missile to attack these air-defense bases before the bombers got into range of them. The SA-2 Guideline missile had a maximum range of about 30kilometers at that time, but since the bombers would be approaching the sites, their own guided missiles would have to be launched well-before it entered this SAM range. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> missile was to be used to attack enemy air bases as well, an extended range of several hundred kilometers would be needed. A missile with these capabilities was called for in General Operational Requirement 148, which was released on March 15, 1956, known as WS-131B. GOR 148 called for a supersonic air-to-surface cruise missile with a weight of not more than [...] (fully fueled and armed) to be carried in pairs by the B-52 Stratofortress.

However, Brigadier General Marcus Miller—then in Iloilo City and unaware that the altered version had been published by Otis—passed a copy of the original proclamation to a Filipino official there. The original proclamation then found its way to Aguinaldo who, on January 5, issued a counter-proclamation: [...] "My government cannot remain indifferent in view of such a violent and aggressive seizure of a portion of its territory by a nation which arrogated to itself the title of champion of oppressed nations. Thus it is that my government is disposed to open hostilities <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> troops attempt to take forcible possession of the Visayan islands. I denounce these acts before the world, in order that the conscience of mankind may pronounce its infallible verdict as to who are true oppressors of nations and the tormentors of mankind. In a revised proclamation issued the same day, Aguinaldo protested [...] "most solemnly against this intrusion of the United States Government on the sovereignty of these islands". Otis regarded Aguinaldo's proclamations as tantamount to war, alerting his troops and strengthening observation posts. On the other hand, Aguinaldo's proclamations energized the masses with a vigorous determination to fight what was perceived as an ally turned enemy.|$|E
