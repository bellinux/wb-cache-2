50|$|Most {{animal manure}} {{consists}} of feces. Common forms of animal manure include farmyard manure (FYM) or farm slurry (liquid manure). FYM also contains plant material (often straw), {{which has been}} used as bedding for animals and has absorbed the feces and urine. Agricultural manure in liquid form, known as slurry, is produced by more <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>rearing</b> systems where concrete or slats are used, instead of straw bedding. Manure from different animals has different qualities and requires different application rates when used as fertilizer. For example horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens, turkeys, rabbits, and guano from seabirds and bats all have different properties. For instance, sheep manure is high in nitrogen and potash, while pig manure is relatively low in both. Horses mainly eat grass and a few weeds so horse manure can contain grass and weed seeds, as horses do not digest seeds the way that cattle do. Chicken litter, coming from a bird, is very concentrated in nitrogen and phosphate and is prized for both properties.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{water use}} and water {{resource}} issues in Beijing Municipality, {{the main trends}} in the agricultural production systems in and around the city with respect to land use, input use, production and economic role, and the impacts of agricultural activities on water quality. Rapid urbanization and strong intensification of agricultural production have meant that {{the quantity and quality of}} available water resources have become matters of concern. The agricultural sector still has a major role in supplying the municipality¿s population with food products, but it is also a major water user and has contributed to large gaps between water supply and demand and to high levels of water pollution. Among the main changes in agriculture in the last decade are the loss of arable land to urbanization, the rapid reduction in the area under grain, and the rapid increase in livestock numbers and in areas under vegetables and orchards. Intensive crop and vegetable production and <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>rearing</b> are major water polluters.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. The {{purpose of}} this project was to review {{possible}} inputs to UK headwater streams of steroid hormones originating from livestock, to investigate hormone contamination in some streams in which concentrations {{were expected to be}} maximal, and to draw conclusions about possible risks that these hormones may pose to aquatic organisms. 2. The review concluded that although livestock in the UK excretes more steroid sex hormones (oestradiol and testosterone) than the human population, almost all of the material deposited on soil by livestock and by manure/slurry spreading is likely to be adsorbed and/or degraded in soil before reaching surface waters. Concentrations of oestrogens in field drains are unlikely to exceed 1 ng/l (expressed as 17 β-oestradiol equivalents), a concentration that is probably harmless. However, it is possible that direct excretion by livestock into unfenced streams, and direct run-off to surface waters from slurry stores and hard-standing in livestock farms, may contribute higher concentrations. In other words, poor farming practice may lead to significant steroid hormone pollution. 3. The review also concluded that surface waters in some other countries are contaminated with oestrogens at potentially active concentrations, so it was considered that a survey of UK headwater streams for hormonal activity was justified. The literature search clearly showed that pregnant cattle are the single most important source of natural oestrogens on livestock farms. 4. The chosen sampling strategy was to focus on a limited number of predominantly dairy farms that were considered to represent worst-case conditions for hormone translocation to small headwater streams. Criteria that contributed towards the choice of field sites included stocking type and density, soil type and slope, access of livestock to the stream, application of manure or slurry to the land, possible direct drainage to the stream of waste from leaking slurry stores and hard-standing areas used by livestock, and access permission from the land-owner. Confounding factors such as upstream inputs of hormonally active material from sewage treatment works, septic tank soak-aways, and industrial discharges, were excluded as far as possible from the study. 5. In order to obtain semi-quantitative, time-integrated samples of hormones in water, locations up- and downstream of livestock activity were sampled on 10 farms using a passive, solid-phase device known as a Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS). These were deployed between November 2004 and January 2005 for 3 to 10 weeks (mean = 39 days). At an eleventh site, a field drain issuing from an experimental plot of cracking clay soil treated solely with dairy cow slurry was also sampled with POCIS. At one site, an automatic flow-driven water sampler was deployed alongside the POCIS to capture water soon after heavy rainfall. 6. POCIS and water extracts were assayed for estrogenic and androgenic activity using the in vitro yeast estrogen screen (YES) and yeast androgen screen (YAS), respectively. As part of a separate project, POCIS extracts were also analysed chemically for oestrone (E 1), 17 β-oestradiol (E 2) and 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) by the Environment Agency. 7. The flow from only one rainfall event was captured in its entirety by the autosampler, but this revealed a background concentration (E 2 equivalents) of 0 - 0. 3 ng/l, rising to a transient peak of 9. 4 ng/l. Average E 2 activity at this site as determined from the POCIS samplers was 1. 8 - 2. 7 ng E 2 equiv. /litre, which provides confidence that the POCIS results are reliable. 8. Estimated oestrogenic activity across all sites (with one exception) lay in the range zero- 26. 5 ng E 2 equiv. /litre (mean = 2. 0 ng/l; standard deviation = 5. 1), based on the POCIS samples. The outlier was 292 ng/l, but this could not be specifically linked with <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>rearing.</b> 92...|$|E
30|$|As part of {{the wider}} European Union (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Italian {{agriculture}} currently receives subsidies that aim to favour the sustainable management of rural areas and to limit further land abandonment, which typically affects marginal hilly and mountain areas. Abandonment is estimated to occur in 45 % to 75 % of the land area in Alpine areas where the abandonment is generalised, and 30 % to 70 % in the Apennines, where abandonment of certain areas is paralleled by over-use of others. Most <b>livestock</b> <b>rearing</b> using pastoral practices in marginal areas has been converted to more <b>intensive</b> systems with <b>livestock</b> mostly <b>reared</b> in barns, relying on specialised forage production from more fertile areas.|$|R

Livestock ownership remains a key determinant of the wealth and food security of households in the region. Statistics from the mid- 2000 s confirm that mobile <b>livestock</b> <b>rearing</b> is still the dominant system in eastern Mauritania (Ibid.). In the late 1990 s, 26  % of the population of Hodh El Gharbi was nomadic, having fallen from over 80  % in the 1960 s (ONS 1997). The trend towards increased sedentarisation continues today, due to social and environmental pressures, development interventions and national policy. Wetlands are ideal places to settle, as there is an ample supply of water, grazing, wild foods and construction materials. Unfortunately, no recent data is available on the trend towards sedentarisation as the 2013 census only contains results for the sedentary population, with results for the nomadic population still pending (Randall 2015).|$|R

A political economy model explaining the formation of environmental regulations {{in the presence of}} a special interest lobby group is developed. The theoretical model finds that the incumbent government sets policy in response to the marginal disutility from pollution, the intensity of pollution damages, and according to the weight the government places on rural economic development. 	The theoretical model is tested using a cross-sectional analysis of 1997 <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> industry environmental regulations across US states. Econometric results provide evidence that state governments implement more stringent regulations in response to the concerns of rural citizens and the intensity of pollution damages. The study finds that the pressure to pursue rural economic development has a positive relationship with the stringency of regulations...|$|R
