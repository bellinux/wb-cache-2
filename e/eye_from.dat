5|$|Kepler-10 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.2, {{which means that}} the star is invisible to the naked <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of an observer on Earth.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43 has one {{detected}} {{planet in}} its orbit, WASP-43b. The star has an apparent magnitude of 12.4, {{and thus is}} too faint {{to be seen with}} the unaided <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E

40|$|AIM:To {{study the}} {{incidence}} of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy(FEVR) and to discuss the necessity of the screening of ocular diseases for full-term infants. METHODS:A retrospective analysis was conducted on 772 full-term infants from January 2014 to August 2015. RESULTS:Among the 772 infants(1 544 eyes) who were enrolled the screening program, 8 cases(15 eyes, 0. 97 %) developed FEVR, including 2 cases(2 <b>eyes)</b> suffering <b>from</b> stage 1, 3 cases(5 <b>eyes)</b> <b>from</b> stage 2 in which 1 patient had an eye at stage 1, 2 cases(4 <b>eyes)</b> <b>from</b> stage 3, 1 case(2 <b>eyes)</b> <b>from</b> stage 4, 1 case(2 <b>eyes)</b> <b>from</b> stage 5. CONCLUSION:FEVR is not uncomon in clinical but severely affected patients suffer from blindness during infancy. Neonatal and infant stage is the key time for the screening of FEVR, early detection and early intervention {{is the key to}} get better visual function in patients with FEVR...|$|R
5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly {{visible to the naked}} <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|Bremner {{was well}} {{established}} in the Scotland set-up, winning three under-23 caps, before he made his debut for Scotland in a 0–0 draw with Spain at Hampden Park. He went on to feature in qualifying games for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but defeats to Poland and Italy left Scotland second in the Group, which {{was not enough to}} qualify. He also played in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal, and received a black <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> Pelé's elbow in a clash during a high ball; despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to Bremner how he had failed to intimidate Pelé as he had done to many other great players of the day.|$|E
5|$|Its {{size and}} unusually bright surface make Vesta the {{brightest}} asteroid, {{and it is}} occasionally {{visible to the naked}} <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> dark skies (without light pollution). In May and June 2007, Vesta reached a peak magnitude of +5.4, the brightest since 1989. At that time, opposition and perihelion were only a few weeks apart. It will be brighter still at its 22 June 2018 opposition, reaching a magnitude of +5.3.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 1917, Peeler {{participated in}} the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a Lewis Gun during the action, he was injured twice, {{suffering}} shrapnel wounds {{to his face and}} <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type {{star that}} is {{situated}} approximately 156 parsecs (509 light years) in the Lynx constellation. With an apparent magnitude of 10.42, the star cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of someone on Earth. The star's effective temperature, at 5826 K, is hotter {{than that of the}} Sun. However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron, or , is approximately 0. WASP-13's surface gravity is measured at 4.04 km/s2, while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4.9 km/s.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of +0.08, Capella is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star visible to the naked <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.|$|E

5|$|Ernest was {{the subject}} of more {{allegations}} in 1832, when two young women accused him of trying to ride them down as they walked near Hammersmith. The Duke had not left his grounds at Kew on the day in question, and was able to ascertain that the rider was one of his equerries, who professed not to have seen the women. Nevertheless, newspapers continued to print references to the incident, suggesting that Ernest had done what the women stated, and was cravenly trying to push blame on another. The same year, the Duke sued for libel after a book appeared accusing him of having his valet Neale kill Sellis, and the jury found against the author. Also in 1832, the Cumberlands suffered tragedy, as young Prince George went blind. The Prince had been blind in one <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> infancy; an accident at age thirteen took the sight of the other. Ernest had hoped his son might marry Princess Victoria and keep the British and Hanoverian Thrones united, but the handicap made it unlikely George could win Princess Victoria's hand, and raised questions about whether he should succeed in Hanover.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from the grass and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the diagonal lines of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.|$|E

5|$|Optic nerve sheath {{fenestration}} is {{an operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
5|$|Reed and Sue {{contemplate}} abandoning {{their lives}} as superheroes {{in order to have}} a normal life and raise a family, but are unaware Johnny is listening. With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in London. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the River Thames, but they manage to prevent the London <b>Eye</b> <b>from</b> collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend Victor Von Doom, freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> UV damage.|$|E

25|$|Eye {{neoplasms}} {{can affect}} {{all parts of}} the eye, and can be a benign tumor or a malignant tumor (cancer). Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the <b>eye</b> <b>from</b> another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow.|$|E
