40|$|We {{studied the}} {{interaction}} between a single hydrogen atom and a single graphene using classical molecular dynamics simulation with modified Brenner REBO potential. Three interactions, which are adsorption, reflection, penetration, were observed. Overhang structure appears and creates an adsorption site on the backside of the graphene. It is considered that backside adsorption occurs under the two conditions that an incident hydrogen atom should have incident energy which {{is larger than the}} potential barrier of a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole</b> of the graphene and that after the hydrogen atom passes through the graphene, it does not keep its kinetic energy to be trapped by the adsorption site. The conditions explained that as the incident energy increased, the incident point of the backside adsorption shifted to the periphery of a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole</b> of the graphene in the simulation. Moreover, when a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole</b> of the graphene was expanded by the hydrogen atom incidence to the periphery of the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole,</b> its potential barrier was reduced.

The most notable features of saponite were (1) {{except for the}} Mg-saturated specimen, all saponite samples rehydrated until the crystal structure was destroyed by heating; (2) the rehydration rate in air after heating decreased in the order: K +> Na §> Ca 2 +> Mg 2 +; (3) the interlayer cations apparently migrated into <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes</b> of the Sit 4 network on thermal dehydration; and (4) the b-parameter xpanded on thermal dehydration. The rehydration properties and behavior of interlayer cations of vermiculite were: (1) except for the K-saturated specimen, all vermiculite samples rehydrated until the crystal structure was destroyed by heating; (2) the rehydration rate in air after heating decreased in the order: Mg 2 +> Ca ~+> Na +> K+; (3) the interlayer cations apparently did not migrate into the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes,</b> but remained {{at the center of}} the interlayer space, even after thermal dehydration; and (4) except for the K-saturated specimen, the b-parameters of the samples contracted on thermal dehydration. The different rehydration properties of saponite and vermiculite were apparently due to the behavior of the interlayer cations during thermal dehydration. For rehydration to occur, the interlayer cations of saponite had to migrate out of the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes.</b> Consequently, saponite saturated with a large cation rehydrated rapidly, whereas aponite saturated with a small cation rehydrated slowly.

40|$|An electron-counting {{strategy}} {{starting from}} magnesium boride {{was used to}} show the inevitability of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes</b> in 2 D borophene. The number (hole density, HD) and distribution of the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes</b> determine the binding energy per boron atom in monolayer borophenes. The relationship between binding energy and HD changes dramatically when the borophene is placed on a Ag(111) surface. The distribution of holes in borophenes on Ag(111) surfaces depends on the temperature. DFT calculations show that aside from the previously reported S 1 and S 2 borophene phases, other polymorphs may also be competitive. Plots of the electron density distribution of the boron sheets suggest that the observed STM image of an S 2 phase corresponds to a sheet with a HDof 2 / 15 instead of a sheet witha HDof 1 / 5. The hole density and the hole distribution echo the distribution of vacancies and extra occupancies in complex beta-rhombohedral boron...|$|R
40|$|Theory has {{predicted}} {{rich and}} very distinct physics for graphene devices with boundaries that follow either the armchair or zigzag crystallographic directions. A prerequisite to disclose this physics in experiment {{is to be}} able to produce devices with boundaries of pure chirality. Exfoliated flakes frequently exhibit corners with an odd multiple of 30, which raised expectations that their boundaries follow pure zigzag and armchair directions. The predicted Raman behavior at such crystallographic edges however failed to confirm pure edge chirality. Here, we perform confocal Raman spectroscopy on <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes</b> obtained after the anisotropic etching of prepatterned pits using carbothermal decomposition of SiO 2. The boundaries of the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes</b> are aligned along the zigzag crystallographic direction and leave hardly any signature in the Raman map indicating unprecedented purity of the edge chirality.

40|$|Fan beam collimators {{can obtain}} a higher {{sensitivity}} without loss in resolution {{at the cost}} of a reduced field of view. The geometric response has been studied both analytically and with numerical and Monte Carlo simulations, but a fast and accurate Monte Carlo simulator for fan beam geometry is not available. The goal of this work is therefore to accelerate 99 mTc fan beam simulations in Gate, with full MC modeling of the collimator and detector in order to retain the characteristic <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole</b> pattern of the collimator. To this end, two problems need to be solved: the long calculation time of particle transport in fan beam collimator geometry and the lack of dedicated variance reduction techniques. The first problem is solved by a dedicated tracking algorithm for fan beam collimator. The second problem is solved by the introduction of fan beam forced detection with variable solid angles. Our methods were validated with both analog Gate simulations and measurements.

30|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{numerous}} 2 D boron nanostructures have been discovered [8 – 21]. Besides the hexagonal sheet and the triangular sheet [20, 21], {{as well as the}} buckled triangular sheets [8], other 2 D boron sheets with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes,</b> like the α-sheet [9, 18], β-sheet [9, 18], γ-sheet [19], and g 1 / 8 and g 2 / 15 sheets [15], were examined by the ab initio calculations. It was suggested that the triangular planar boron lattice with hexagonal vacancies is more stable [9]. And a variety of such triangular boron layer with different patterns of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>holes</b> were reported by both the computational and experimental research groups [11, 13 – 16]. However, all of these monoatomic-thin boron layers are higher in energy than boron’s three-dimensional (3 D) bulk state, which means that the 2 D structure of boron is disadvantaged thermodynamically. Thus, a sufficiently “sticky” substrate is necessary to suppress the 3 D nucleation barrier to entice the atoms into the 2 D route.|$|R

Transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) photonic band gaps (PBGs) are calculated under different lattice constants with different air filling fractions (AFFs) and ratios of pillar radius to lattice constant. The analysis of data indicates that the center wavelength of PBG increases with smaller AFF.

The silicon-on-insulator wafer {{was employed to}} fabricate the hexagonal photonic crystal infrared emitters using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) technology. The Al/SiO 2 /Si structure perforated with periodic <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole</b> arrays was resistively heated using direct-current voltage to active the boron-doped silicon membranes. The electrical characteristics and emission spectrum of infrared emitters under different excited voltage conditions were measured. Additionally, the reflection, transmission and absorption of light were also characterized to reveal the mechanism of narrowband-enhanced emission. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) caused by the diffraction of the thermal radiation impinge on the metal-dielectric grating and play an essential role in the extraordinary optical transmission and enhanced emission of subwavelength hole arrays. The constructive interference between the thermal radiation and the SPPs enriches the emission spectrum on the condition that the phase match relation is satisfied. It is demonstrated from the measured results of modulation performance and thermal imaging of emitters that the thickness of membranes and the thermal isolation between membranes and supporting frame structure have a significant influence on the modulation rate, emission intensity and the suppression of the background emission...|$|E

The width of ribbons is distributed in a narrow range around 10. 3 nm. High resolution STM images revealed four ordered surface structures in BNRs. Combined with DFT calculations, we found that all the four structures of boron nanoribbons consist of the boron chains with different width, separated by <b>hexagonal</b> <b>hole</b> arrays.

In the present work, classical molecular dynamics simulation is used with modified Brenner’s empirical bond order potential. The three reactions, that is, absorption reaction, reflection reaction and penetration reaction, are observed in our simulation. Reaction rates depend on the incident energy of the hydrogen atom and the graphene temperature.
