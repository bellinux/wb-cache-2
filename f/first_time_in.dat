40|$|We {{present a}} {{diffusion}} approximation of the <b>first</b> overflow <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the GI/G/m system with finite capacity.

We use the <b>first</b> passage <b>time</b> of diffusion process as the <b>first</b> overflow <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the GI/G/m system with finite capacity. To check on accuracy of this approximation, the analytical results for {{the mean of the}} <b>first</b> overflow <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the GI/G/m system with finite capacity is numerically compared with the diffusion approximation results. Numerical results show that the diffusion approximation is a good approximation for heavy traffic systems...|$|R
