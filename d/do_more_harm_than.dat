5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good. Mulder tries to take his case to Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck {{may result in a}} deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose their jobs and that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable {{of a set of}} very bad choices.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1850s, Paraná had seen both his main foes–Aureliano Coutinho and Feijó–and their {{political}} factions fall into oblivion, while {{he rose to}} power. Eusébio de Queirós, his main rival within the Conservative Party, had attempted to rally the saquaremas against his project, and failed. Eusébio de Queirós and Paraná carried on their power struggle during debates in the Senate, and in the end, Paraná emerged victorious. His success came {{at the expense of}} his weakened and deeply divided party. Just as serious were the consequences of the Law of the Circles. In theory, Paraná's initiatives for judicial and electoral reform would have ensured fairer elections, since they attempted to curtail the corrupting influence of political parties on elections. In practice, however, the opposite happened; tampering by parties was merely replaced by greater interference by the cabinet. Paraná probably knew that the reform, as enacted, had the potential to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good, as it gave him unprecedented control over national politics. According to Needell, [...] "Paraná might well have seen the cabinet and its victory as his personal vindication before the party rivals and his monarch, his political triumph after the dismissal of 1844 and the second-rank status and saquarema disrespect of 1850." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{accidental}} harm from screening mammography has been underestimated.

Shortly after Iohannis' request, Victor Ponta announced on Facebook that he doesn't resign, claiming that his term as prime minister depends on Parliament.

2500|$|Others disagree, {{saying that}} the {{inequality}} issue is a political distraction from what they consider real problems like chronic unemployment and sluggish growth. George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen has called inequality a [...] "red herring", saying that factors driving its increase within a nation can simultaneously be driving its reduction globally, and arguing that redistributive policies intended to reduce inequality can <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good regarding the real problem of stagnant wages. Robert Lucas Jr. {{has argued that the}} salient problem American living standards face is a government that has grown too much, and that recent policy shifts in the direction of European style taxation, welfare spending, and regulation may be indefinitely putting the US on a significantly lower, European level income trajectory. Some researchers have disputed the accuracy of the underlying data regarding claims about inequality trends, and economists Michael Bordo and Christopher M. Meissner have argued that inequality cannot be blamed for the 2008 financial crisis.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the term}} [...] "farrier" [...] implies a {{professional}} horseshoer with skill, education, and training. Some people who shoe horses are untrained or unskilled, {{and likely to}} <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good for the horse. People who {{do not understand the}} horse's foot will not trim the hoof correctly. This can cause serious problems for the animal, resulting in chronic lameness and damage to the hoof wall. Poor trimming will usually place the hoof at an incorrect angle, leave the foot laterally unbalanced and may cut too much off certain areas of the hoof wall, or trim too much of the frog or sole. Some horseshoers will rasp the hoof down to fit an improperly shaped or too-small size of shoe, which is damaging to the movement of the horse and can damage the hoof itself if trimmed or rasped too short. A poor horseshoer can also make mistakes in the shoeing process itself, not only quicking a horse, but also putting shoe on crooked, using the wrong type of shoe for the job at hand, shaping the shoe improperly, or setting it on too far forward or back.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, three IMF economists {{published}} {{new research}} findings and criticized {{some of the}} fundamental assumptions of the neoliberal doctrine. They warned that austerity policies could <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good because of their social costs – increased inequality, which [...] "in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth". Speaking of capital account liberalization, that is unrestricted movement of capital across international borders ("openness") and fiscal consolidation, meaning policies to reduce fiscal deficits and debt levels ("austerity"), they wrote: [...] "Since both openness and austerity are associated with increasing income inequality, this distributional effect sets up an adverse feedback loop. The increase in inequality engendered by financial openness and austerity might itself undercut growth, {{the very thing that}} the neoliberal agenda is intent on boosting. There is now strong evidence that inequality can significantly lower both the level and the durability of growth". [...] Additionally, they recommended actively combating inequality by redistributing wealth via taxes and government spending, noting [...] "the evidence of the economic damage from inequality suggests that policymakers should be more open to redistribution than they are" [...] and [...] "the fear that such policies will themselves necessarily hurt growth is unfounded".|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, {{development}} {{discourse and}} the categories it creates can have severe power implications, {{in the view}} of some scholars, who say such discourse is an extension of the [...] "coercive power of Western-dominated global institutions." [...] In his analysis of the American offer of technical aid to develop Egypt's largely agrarian economy after World War II, Timothy Mitchell analyzes USAID rhetoric, pointing to the [...] "model answers" [...] that supposedly objective experts bring to Egypt. What is often ignored in the discussion of a development scheme based on providing technical knowledge, Mitchell argues, is that an organization like USAID is hardly [...] "a rational consciousness standing outside the country" [...] as it imagines itself to be, but [...] "is in fact a central element in configurations of power within the country." [...] According to Mitchell, the projects USAID pursues are built on a discourse subservient to American political and economic interests and can potentially <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good for Egyptians. He maintains that democracy rhetoric is also employed according to American-defined categories such as promoting economic liberalization, citing a 1989 USAID report's calls for political decentralization and encouraging [...] "democracy and pluralism" [...] as a means of empowering rural landlords who would support free market economy at the expense of local peasants.|$|E

2500|$|She {{presented}} her {{plans for the}} extension of the work to some of the Church authorities before the General Conference of 1890 convened, but even her stanchest friends thought it an unwise plan, full of risks. Again and again she went to Dr. Morton and some of the bishops, trying to show the imperative needs in the Church for a connectional organization known distinctively as home missions; but the objection was presented that the Church was not ready for such an organization. She was told that the Parsonage Society had hardly gotten a sure footing in the Church at that time, and by moving too fast, and undertaking to enlarge the work to such an extent, she would find it impracticable and calculated to <b>do</b> <b>more</b> <b>harm</b> <b>than</b> good. She insisted that it would not interfere with the parsonage work. She had found in her efforts to establish parsonage societies that the women of the Church were organized into all types of other societies; such as, [...] "Ladies' Aids," [...] "Pastors' Aids," [...] "Dorcas's," [...] "Sewing Society," [...] "Social Society," [...] "Young Ladies' Aids," [...] all of which were doing home mission work in their own churches, and many were doing interdenominational work also. She wrote articles on the subject, and conducted a large correspondence, presenting the matter to the influential women {{as well as to the}} men of the Church. Her letters went to hundreds of representative women, but although some of them were largely in favor of her plans, there was little sympathy manifested by women as a whole. But in 1890, the plans were approved and Helm became the General Secretary. She retired in 1893.|$|E
