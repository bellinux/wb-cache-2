5|$|These birds forage on {{the ground}} or in vegetation; they also <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they {{frequently}} spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches. There is disagreement among ornithologists over the purpose of this behavior, with hypotheses ranging from deceleration to intimidation of predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} a tied game on July 1, 2004, against their rivals, the Boston Red Sox, Trot Nixon hit a pop <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> the left field line. Jeter ran from his {{position}} at shortstop and made an over-the-shoulder catch. He launched himself over the third-base side railing and two rows of seats, receiving a lacerated chin and bruised face. The Yankees {{went on to win}} the game in the bottom of the 13th inning. This was voted the Play of the Year in the This Year in Baseball Awards competition, as voted on by fans at MLB.com. Following the 2004 season, Jeter was presented with his first Gold Glove Award; his diving catch on July 1 was cited as a reason for the award. Though Jeter was fourth among shortstops in fielding percentage and errors, two traditional fielding statistics, critics pointed to his lower ratings in the more advanced sabermetric statistics, such as range factor and ultimate zone rating (UZR).|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated on the ground is at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.|$|E

25|$|After working {{briefly in}} {{commercial}} aviation, Mantz went to Hollywood, {{attracted by the}} {{large sums of money}} movie stunt pilots were making at the time. A main requirement was Associated Motion Picture Pilots (AMPP) membership but that was only gained after employment in the industry. In an effort to gain notoriety, on July 6, 1930 Mantz set a record in flying 46 consecutive outside loops {{as a part of the}} dedication ceremonies of the San Mateo airport. Although he gained recognition as an accomplished pilot, without the AMPP card, he still could not work in Hollywood. However, in 1931, Mantz performed the climactic stunt in The Galloping Ghost which required him to <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> a canyon and just miss a prominent sycamore. Misjudging his approach, Mantz crashed into the tree but the film crew got their shot and he got his AMPP card.|$|E

500|$|Despite having several {{well-known}} producers on his recording team, {{the majority}} of the production featured on [...] "Power" [...] was done by the lesser-known Symbolyc One.

According to Symbolyc One, West was an admirer of the composition, and asked him to <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> to Hawaii, where he discovered that West had already recorded some of his version of the song. A month later, the producer was asked to return to Hawaii and discovered that the beat had been further modified by West, who added [...] "polish" [...] to the track.

After getting in touch with Walden, Griffith frantically implored him to produce the song, describing how important the song would be for Houston's future album. After hearing the song's demo, Walden agreed to <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> to San Rafael, California to arrange it. He was not much impressed with the demo and requested permission to change some of the song's lyrics and chord progression. Flustered by his request, Merrill and Rubicam denied him the right to their song. After a lot of back-and-forth with Griffith, they compromised and allowed Walden to de-construct the song and change the key and tempo. After completing the song, Houston came into the studio to record her vocals. Cissy Houston, the singer's mother, joined her daughter to perform the song's background vocals.

500|$|Pursued by {{the priests}} {{in a car}} chase that leads them through a {{shopping}} mall, Lois and Peter escape from the priests and drive to a cornfield where Peter buries the film. While he is doing so, the priests <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> in a crop-duster and kidnap Lois. Peter is then given a message telling {{him that if he}} does not return the film to Gibson at his estate on top of Mount Rushmore, his wife will be killed. Peter arrives at the house and gives Gibson a film can. As Peter and Lois are about to leave, Gibson discovers that the film has been replaced with dog feces, leading to a chase {{on the face of the}} mountain. While being chased, Lois slips but hangs on to George Washington's lips. Peter grabs her and, while being held at gunpoint, he tells Gibson that the film [...] "is in President Rushmore's mouth" [...] and points to the other side of the monument. Gibson follows Peter's direction and falls off the edge as Peter pulls Lois to safety. Upon climbing back to the top of the mountain, the two have sexual intercourse there, improving their marriage.|$|E
500|$|Cott {{was well}} {{aware that he was}} {{publishing}} in wartime. There are, as Julian Huxley remarks in his 'Introduction', references throughout the book to the human analogues of animal camouflage and concealment. For example, in the section on 'Adaptive Silence', the kestrel is said to [...] "practise dive-bombing attacks", or [...] "after the fashion of a fighter 'plane" [...] to <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> other birds, while [...] "Owls have solved the problem of the silent air-raid"; Cott spends the rest of that paragraph on the [...] "method which has recently been rediscovered and put into practice" [...] of shutting off a bomber's engines and [...] "gliding noiselessly down towards their victims" [...] at Barcelona in the Spanish Civil War. In the concluding chapter, Cott explicitly states [...] "The innumerable visible devices used [...]. in peace-time and in war-time [...]. are merely rediscovered [...]. applications of colour that have already reached a high [...]. degree of specialization and perfection [...]. in the animal world", mentioning predator-prey relationships, sexual selection and signalling to rivals. He then compares the [...] "hunting disguises put on [...]. as a means of approaching, ambushing or alluring game, and the sniping suits, concealed machine-gun posts, and booby traps" [...] with the camouflage of animal predators; and similarly he compares [...] "protective disguises" [...] with the [...] "photographer's hide and the gunner's observation post." [...] In the same section, Cott compares intentionally visible signs with animal warning colours: [...] "The policeman's white gloves have their parallel in the white stripes or spots of nocturnal skunks and carabids. The Automobile Association has adopted a system of coloration [...] whose copyright belongs by priority to wasps and salamanders." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 12, 1942, Bong flew {{very low}} ("buzzed") over {{a house in}} nearby San Anselmo, {{the home of a}} pilot who had just been married. He was cited and {{temporarily}} grounded for breaking flying rules, along with three other P-38 pilots who had looped around the Golden Gate Bridge on the same day. For looping the Golden Gate Bridge, flying at a low level down Market Street in San Francisco, and blowing the clothes off of an Oakland woman's clothesline, Bong was reprimanded by General George C. Kenney, commanding officer of the Fourth Air Force, who told him, [...] "If you didn't want to <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> Market Street, I wouldn't have you in my Air Force, but you are not to do it any more and I mean what I say." [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "We needed kids like this lad." [...] In all subsequent accounts, Bong denied flying under the Golden Gate Bridge. Nevertheless, Bong was still grounded when the rest of his group was sent without him to England in July 1942. Bong then transferred to another Hamilton Field unit, 84th Fighter Squadron of the 78th Fighter Group. From there, Bong was sent to the Southwest Pacific Area.|$|E

2500|$|Trout tend {{mostly to}} feed underwater. When fishing deeper waters such as rivers or lakes, putting a <b>fly</b> <b>down</b> to the trout {{may be more}} {{successful}} than fishing on the surface, especially {{in the absence of}} any surface insect activity or hatch. The nymph itself can be weighted, as is the popular bead headed hare's ear nymph or bead headed pheasant tail nymph. Alternatively, the angler can use an attractor pattern such as a prince nymph. Weights can be added to the leader. Probably the best weight to use is twist on lead or other metal strips because it has a much less detrimental effect on the casting ability. A sinking tip fly line can also serve to sink the fly. A common nymphing and general overall fly fishing technique that even beginners can master is a [...] "dead drift" [...] or tight line fishing technique, casting directly across the river, letting the fly line drift downriver while keeping any slack out of the line. If the Nymph is drifting too fast, then you should perform an upstream mend. If the nymph is drifting too slowly, you should mend downstream. A beginner need simply to point the rod at the fly, lifting the rod in the event of a strike. This is a [...] "downstream technique" [...] where the angler moves in a downstream direction. More advanced techniques make use of a highly visible strike indicator attached to the leader above the sinking fly.|$|E
