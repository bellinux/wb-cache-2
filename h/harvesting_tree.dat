40|$|The fruit {{harvesting}} {{is a key}} factor involving both product quality and profitability. Particularly, mechanical harvesting of traditional oil olive orchards is hint by tree training system for manual <b>harvesting,</b> <b>tree</b> size and several and slanted trunks which makes difficult trunk shaker work. Therefore, canopy shaker technology could be a feasible alternative to develop an integral harvester able to work on irregular canopies. The aim {{of this research was}} to determine vibration parameters applied to the olive tree for efficient mechanical harvesting by canopy shaker measuring fruit removal efficiency and debris. In this work, a continuous lateral canopy shaker harvester has been developed and tested on large olive trees in order to analyse the operating harvester parameters and tree properties to improve mutual adaptation. Vibration amplitude and frequency, rod density and ground speed were assessed. Vibration amplitude and frequency beside ground speed were decisive factors on fruit removal efficiency. Increasing rod density has not influenced on removal efficiency although it increased significantly debris. Promising results has been reached with 77. 3 % of removal efficiency, applying a 28 s shaking duration, 0. 17 m amplitude vibration and 12 rod drum. This result was obtained reporting 0. 26 s of accumulative shaking time over 200 m/s 2 resultant acceleration. The canopy shaker mechanism enabled more than 65 % of detached fruits to fall vertically, facilitating catch fruit. In order to improve removal efficiency it is advisable to adapt trees, set high amplitude in the shaker mechanism, and enhance the contact time between rods and tree...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT / Available {{fuel and}} its dynamics, {{both of which}} affect fire {{behavior}} in forest ecosystems, are direct products of ecosystem production, decomposition, and disturbances. Using published ecosystem models and equations, we developed a simulation model to evaluate the effects of dynamics of aboveground net primary production (ANPP), carbon allocation, residual slash, decomposition, and disturbances (<b>harvesting,</b> <b>tree</b> mortality, and fire frequency) on available fuel (AF; megagrams per hectare). Both the magnitude {{and the time of}} maximum ANPP as well as the duration of high productivity condition had a large influence on AF. Productivity and d e composition were two dominant driving factors determining AF. The amount of AF in arid or cold regions would be affected more by climate change than that in other ecosystems. Frequent fire was an effective tool to control the AF, and medium frequency fire produced the most AF. Disturbances increased AF very rapidly in a short period. The results {{can be used as a}} basic knowledge to develop a fire management plan under various climate conditions. Fire is a common disturbance that greatly influences species composition, forest structure, carbon cycling, and nutrient cycling in many forest ecosystems (Dumonte and others 1996, Whittle and others 1997, Thompson and others 2000, Wang and others 2001). Fuel, climate, and topography have been proposed as the three major components to predict fire behavior and ignition (Whelan 1998). Under fire-favorable weather, the role of fuel is likely to be the most important factor determining fire behavior (Bessie and Johnson 1995). The amount of fuel is con trolled by vegetation type, decomposition rate, ecosystem productivity, and their interrelationships (Brown and others 1999...|$|E
40|$|The {{people of}} Pikoli in the Peddie {{district}} of the Eastern Cape are mostly unemployed and earn {{most of their}} income from old-age allowances. The place is remote and 'modern' amenities such as paraffin and petroleum gas are expensive. Electricity and transport are unavailable. There is heavy reliance on woody plants for fuel and for materials for construction and fencing {{and to some extent}} medicinal and ritual uses. Indigenous trees in this rural area are threatened by over-utilisation and the absence of clear government management policies. The over-utilisation of these resources is leading to deforestation. It was proposed {{at the beginning of this}} study that people who harvest trees cause similar results to the piosphere effect caused by the herbivores on the rangeland. Ecological-economic analysis was performed to find a common ground between the people's income and needs so that effective sustainable management strategies can be developed. A combination of semi-structured interviews, direct observations and ecological surveys were used to gather information about: Tree species used, and for what purpose in Pikoli; Individual tree species preference by inhabitants; Change in tree density in response to changes in utilisation intensity at varying distances away from the village; The local direct use benefits inhabitants derive from utilising indigenous tree resources. The study showed that the people of Pikoli use a variety of 23 indigenous trees and that they have marked preferences regarding the tree species they use for fuelwood and construction purposes. Although Ptaeroxylon obliquum is a highly preferred species for fuelwood and construction, its popularity can also be linked to its high relative abundance in this area. Other species such Maytenus undata and Pappea capensis are also highly preferred although they are harvested at much greater distances from thecentre of the village. Change in individual tree density in response to changes in utilisation intensity at varying distances away from the village showed clearly that a piosphere effect also applies to human harvesting. The average number of individual trees closer (1 200 m) to the village centre was 2 trees per 100 m², and their numbers increase to approximately 35 trees per 100 m² at a distance of about 3 000 m from the village centre. The study reports on the direct use benefits derived by the people of Pikoli from <b>harvesting</b> <b>tree</b> resources. The average total net value of trees harvested for fuelwood was R 4089. 09 (US$ 359. 01) per household per annum. The value of tree resources harvested represents a large percentage of average households' annual income. Therefore, the economic benefits households derive from utilising tree resources are high. Indigenous tree resource use in this rural village seems to be unsustainable and the inhabitants seem to be aware of it. However, they have few alternatives. Their economic conditions do not allow them to afford alternative resources available in the formal market...|$|E

30|$|One {{reason for}} the low carbon balance of <b>harvested</b> <b>trees</b> is the small {{proportion}} of sawn wood. When a large <b>tree</b> is <b>harvested,</b> only about 20 % of the total biomass of the tree is converted into sawn wood, {{which can be used}} to store carbon in buildings and other structures. The carbon balance of pulp and paper products is not high, since only a part of paper products replace fossil-based products, and pulp and paper industry consumes much energy. A way to improve the carbon balance of <b>harvested</b> <b>trees</b> is to increase the share of construction wood. This can be achieved for instance by developing and using new product types, such as engineered wood products, which can be manufactured from small-sized and lower-quality timber.|$|R
