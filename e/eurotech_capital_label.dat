The units of analysis are student-supervisor dyads. We use duocentred networks, a novel network structure appropriate for networks which are centred around a dyad. A cluster analysis reveals three typical clusters of research groups. Those which are large and belong to several institutions are labelled under a bridging social <b>capital</b> <b>label.</b> Those which are small, centred in a single institution but have high cohesion are labelled as bonding social capital. Those which are small and with low cohesion are called weak social capital groups. Academic performance of both PhD students and supervisors are highest in bridging groups and lowest in weak groups. Other variables are also found to differ according to the type of research group. At the end, some recommendations regarding academic and research policy are draw...|$|R

The same approach was imposed on their performances, with the band obliged to play pop ballads at their major concerts, while playing eccentric garage band covers and hard rock when appearing in small clubs.

We empirically examine for the equal-share relationship for alternative economic groups (i. e., US states, EU countries, Developing Countries and a World comprising 55 countries).

40|$|The {{relationship}} between ethnicity {{and the use}} of 'party drugs' (e. g., methamphetamine and ecstasy) has received little attention in Australia. This paper focuses on ethnicity and party drug use within the context of dance parties and clubs in Melbourne, Australia's second largest city. The young people who participated in our research, many of whom are long-time dance party attendees, or 'old skool ravers', frequently made claims to the possession of subcultural <b>capital</b> by <b>labelling</b> as 'muzzas' those they perceived to be outsiders to the dance scene. Muzzas are defined as heavily muscled young men, commonly of Southern European or Middle Eastern background, who use cocaine and steroids, have 'no class' and dance in an overly aggressive way. Although the old skool ravers were often from similar ethnic backgrounds to muzzas, they rarely drew on ethnicity in forming their own identities. They did, however, explicitly invoke ethnicity in the distinctions they created between themselves and muzzas. Their claims to subcultural capital are based on notions of nostalgia and an authentic involvement in the dance scene, and on their perceived distance from a mainstream culture consisting of 'normal people'...|$|R
50|$|Frustrated {{by a lack}} of {{commercial}} success and what he felt was an unacceptable level of commitment to the band, Zarriello dismissed all the band members except Schornikow, and the two continued as a duo.

The album, In The Morning, was recorded on a 4-track tape recorder. It was the rawest, most analog/DIY album The Shivers had made since CHARADES and featured a more experimental duo sound. Again it did very little commercially and was primarily used as something to sell while on tour. The Shivers bought out Hewitt and now solely own the record.|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{for decades}} {{have studied the}} {{achievement}} gap and attempted to explain it in regards to race and class. Throughout the existing literature regarding the achievement gap {{between black and white}} students, however, there is a dearth of research exploring why the gap exists for upper-class black students; this population is largely ignored. This research seeks to explain why an achievement gap exists between white and black students who come from households of similar incomes. Ten students (five white and five black gradates) of a private, non-parochial school in Washington DC are interviewed about high school and post-high school experiences. Using cultural <b>capital</b> and <b>labeling</b> theory frameworks, this study follows the work of Billings (2011), Pattillo-McCoy (2000), Lacy (2007), and Khan (2011) in their focus on black students, cultural capital, and embodied privilege, and builds on that of Lensmire (2012), Dixon-Roman 2014, Orr (2003) Adams (2010) and Tyson et al. (2005). Results uncover the uniquely complex configuration of class and race. Latent issues as a result of race can arise, and the research illustrates how they affect the achievement ideology and attainment of both black and white students. This study’s findings suggest that two mechanisms shape the achievement gap: academic support and social interactions and interpretations, with the former rooted largely in class differences and the latter rooted in racial differences. This study aims to improve our understanding of the distinct role race and class play in influencing educational and professional outcomes from upper-class backgrounds...|$|R

The roof of the nave is barrel-vaulted wood with painted bosses and dates from the 14th century. The chancel arch is wide and pointed. The east wall of chancel—rebuilt in 1847-48 by former vicar William Palmer—has three stepped lancets. The two south windows are Early English lancets and the oak stalls of the chancel are decorated with early 16th century arabesque and traceried panels. The transepts have Early English lancets but the north and south windows are three-light Perpendicular additions. The north transept has wall arcades with clustered respond shafts and leaf capitals. The south transept is plainer and houses the church's windpipe organ. The font is a Norman stone bowl decorated with overlapping arches.

5000|$|The above {{definition}} {{is the one}} most widely used in economic literature, in the financial press, by corporate and government analysts (except when they are reporting to the IMF), and by the World Bank. In contrast, {{what the rest of}} the world calls the <b>capital</b> account is <b>labelled</b> the [...] "financial account" [...] by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and by the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA). In the IMF's definition, the capital account represents a small subset of what the standard definition designates the capital account, largely comprising transfers. Transfers are one-way flows, such as gifts, as opposed to commercial exchanges (i.e., buying/selling and barter). The largest type of transfer between nations is typically foreign aid, but that is mostly recorded in the current account. An exception is debt forgiveness, which in a sense is the transfer of ownership of an asset. When a country receives significant debt forgiveness, that will typically comprise the bulk of its overall IMF capital account entry for that year.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{magnitude}} of unrecorded capital flows and the resulting unrecorded accumulation of foreign assets for Croatia, over the period between 2000 and 2007. The problem of unrecorded <b>capital</b> outflows, often <b>labeled</b> as <b>capital</b> flight, has gained significance in the present global financial and economic crises, because of increasing capital scarcity in many emerging markets and transition economies including Croatia. The findings reveal relatively large amounts of unrecorded foreign asset accumulation over the observed period. A large portion of this accumulation relates to cumulative amounts of net errors and omissions term, which is interpreted as unrecorded capital flow. There are reasons {{to believe that this}} net errors and omissions item in Croatia possibly partly represents the unrecorded accumulation of foreign cash from foreign tourist spending, and/or partly results from overstated tourism income in the official statistics. However, even after excluding this item from the calculation of capital flight, the remaining unrecorded accumulation of foreign assets over the period is still substantial. Consequently, if these unrecorded flows are taken into account, Croatia’s net international investment position is improved. capital flows, capital flight, euroization, Croatia...|$|R

40|$|Practitioners in the soundsinging {{tradition}} {{are frequently}} subjected to evaluations of their vocal music that refuse to label it as singing or song. While these evaluations {{might be considered}} justified based on certain commonplace definitions of singing and song, I argue here that these terms refer often to social institutions that exceed these definitions, institutions that mark certain vocal performances as signifiers of "fully-human" vocal expression and that deny this status to other human vocal sounds. Soundsingers commonly challenge these assertions, refusing even the term soundsinging {{on the basis that}} it divides their vocal practice from the privileges accorded to practices marked singing and song. To help make these refusals audible, I reject the invitation to imagine liminal spaces between speech and song and choose instead to examine liminal states between this institution—which I, drawing on the work of Suzanne Cusick, <b>label</b> <b>capital</b> S Song—and a new construct I label symsong. I derive the term symsong from the recent work of Donna Haraway and her notion that it is urgent that we begin to identify in sympoietic rather than autopoietic manners, that rather than imagining ourselves as belonging to a closed and exclusive category, we imagine ourselves as coming into existence in and through all other lifeforms with which we are "[n]either One nor Other. " When listeners look to the voice to affirm a symbolic order that denies "fully-human" status to some voices in order to reserve that status for others, they are often forced into a liminal state when exposed to sounds that fail to symbolize the "fully-human" emerging from bodies these listeners deem their categorical equivalent. The "less-than-human" sounds they hear become articulated with their bodies through this equivalency and a symbolic privilege they accorded themselves becomes disturbed. With the concept of symsong, I give name to the space {{on the other side of}} this liminality. Symsong is a space where no vocal sound is marked as Other and identity through exclusivity becomes unthinkable. Haraway argues that sympoietic forms of identification are necessary to lead us out of our current era of planetary crisis. I attempt to suggest one way we can help achieve this shift of consciousness in the musical realm and I try to bring to light symbolic processes that unfold quietly but regularly in and through encounters with the voice...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, I explore youth social capital. I am {{interested}} in identifying what youth social capital is, how it is fostered and reproduced and how this may differ from adult forms. I argue that current conceptualisations of social capital are inadequate to understand the social capital of young people and that these inadequacies have led some youth social <b>capital</b> theorists to <b>label</b> the social <b>capital</b> of young people as defective or incomplete; with some describing young people as possessing ‘bad’ or ‘dark’ social capital or being social capital deficient. I further maintain that the conceptualisation of social capital as existing beyond the processes of class, culture and gender is flawed, as social capital is not fostered and reproduced in isolation, but each of these processes influences the ability of an individual to foster and reproduce social capital by establishing or facilitating the individual’s key life circumstances. Consequently, I propose that {{it is essential to}} approach its measurement holistically. Finally, I argue that due to the differences between youth and adult social capital, the indicators and tools used to measure social capital are inadequate for use on a youth population. In light of this, I suggest the use of 12 indicators of youth social capital, which guide my analysis, and two purposely built generators with which to measure youth social capital. As a result, the main objective {{of this study was to}} find answers to three main questions: what is youth social capital? How do class, culture, and gender affect social capital formation and reproduction? What models and tools can be used to measure youth social capital? In order to do this, I have combined a review on current social capital literature, together with ethnographic research, using data collected from focus groups and more ‘typical’ social capital tools including a survey and two hybrid generators. This thesis, then, makes use of both qualitative and quantitative data in order to explore the stocks of social capital held by 50 young people of the Wollondilly Shire, south-west of Sydney. This study concludes that youth social capital does indeed vary from its adult form. I propose that the social capital of a young person is neither defective nor incomplete, but is instead simply ‘different’. This study has shown youth social capital to be vibrant and complex, beyond anything I could have possibly imagined...|$|R
