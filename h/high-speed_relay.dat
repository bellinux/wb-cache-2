40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{combinatorial}} scheme based on hidden Markov models (HMM) and wavelet transform (WT) to discriminate between magnetizing inrush currents and internal faults in power transformers. HMMs are powerful tools for transient classification which compute the max-imum likelihood probability between training and testing data signals for identification. The WT is employed to extract certain features which reduce the computation burden of HMMs and enhance detection accuracy. The newly extracted feature efficiently discriminates between faults by different trends. The k-means clustering technique is applied to reduce the training procedure time invest-ment. Since the discrimination method {{is based on the}} probabilistic characteristics of the signals without application of any deterministic index, more reliable and accurate classification is achieved. This method is independent of the selection thresholds. Based on the proposed algorithm a <b>high-speed</b> <b>relay</b> response (a quarter of a cycle) can be achieved. The suitable performance of this method is demonstrated by simulation of different faults and switching conditions on a power trans-former using PSCAD/EMTDC software...|$|E
40|$|Data Communications {{has always}} played an {{important}} role in the operation of the utility system from <b>high-speed</b> <b>relay</b> communications to the recent expansion in “intercontrol center ” data sharing. The increasing incorporation of digital devices throughout the utility enterprise as well as the forces of deregulation are driving utility communications into new realms with new requirements and paradigms. This paper examines the communication issues in the Independent System Operator (ISO) environment including inter ISO communication of status data, accounting issues, and power system control. Solutions to these issues from a system protection / Intelligent Electronic Device perspective are examined. In particular, this paper examines the next generation protection communications that will be available shortly and its effect on next generation SCADA. Communication in the realm of power system control will also be examined and the communication infrastructure required to achieve such is discussed. Deregulated Utility Communication Requirements The trend toward electric utility deregulation is moving full speed ahead throughout the world. As a result, the integration, consolidation, and dissemination of information both inter and intra utilities has become a critical piece of the deregulation picture. Information traditionally used only within a given utility now becomes desired by many players. The general trend in the industry has been toward the use of the Internet for the transfer of data such as...|$|E

StrataCom was founded in Cupertino, California, USA, in January 1986, by 26 former employees of the failing Packet Technologies, Inc.

40|$|Power system {{protective}} relaying {{systems are}} striving {{to meet the demands}} of systems which are ever increasing in complexity [...] <b>High-speed</b> digital <b>relays</b> must make decisions while the power system is still in transition. Understanding the operation and performance of microprocessor based relays requires new engineering tools. Current transformer (CT) and relay modeling are practical tools to evaluate protection equipment performance. Models for instrument transformers are especially important for studying ct saturation, ferroresonance phenomena, harmonics, and their effects on the performance of protective relaying. This paper presents some software tools (ATP-EMTP,MODEL-TACS, TOP and Mathcad) that are used to investigate and to understand the transient events to better understand and visualize the response of digital relay models during transient condition...|$|R
50|$|The Mark II was {{constructed}} with <b>high-speed</b> electromagnetic <b>relays</b> instead of electro-mechanical counters {{used in the}} Mark I, making it much faster than its predecessor. Its addition time was 0.125 seconds (8 Hz) and the multiplication time was 0.750 seconds. This was a factor of 2.6 faster for addition and a factor 8 faster for multiplication compared to the Mark I. It was the second machine (after the Bell Labs Relay Calculator) to have floating-point hardware. A unique feature of the Mark II is that it had built-in hardware for several functions such as the reciprocal, square root, logarithm, exponential, and some trigonometric functions. These took between five and twelve seconds to execute.|$|R

40|$|Linux {{has several}} {{mechanisms}} for relaying {{information about the}} system and applications to the user. Some examples include printk and other syslog events, evlog, ltt, oprofile, etc. Each subsystem has its own method for relaying information from the kernel to user space. Some of these mechanisms have difficulties, e. g. logging of printk messages is unreliable. In addition to selected difficulties, the replication of code and maintenance is undesirable. In this paper we describe a <b>high-speed</b> data <b>relay</b> filesystem that satisfies the buffering requirements of the above subsystems while providing a unified, efficient, and reliable relay mechanism. relayfs allows subsystems to log data efficiently and safely using lockless technology {{that is designed to}} scale well on multiprocessor systems. relayfs includes the flexibility to be expanded should other subsystems need additional services, but has a simple design intended {{to meet the needs of}} currently available subsystems. In this paper we discuss the architecture, implementation, and usage of relayfs. relayfs uses channels that allow data to be directed to a suitable buffer or buffers for the subsystems that allocated the channel. We describe the kernel API and file naming conventions, address init-time issues, and discuss performance trade-offs available using relayfs. Finally we demonstrate how existing subsystems use relayfs to log their data...|$|R
2500|$|In Visser's modification, the Acetone box was {{extended}} {{with a large}} flat board holding 12 printed circuit boards of approximately 4×4 inches, with the copper traces intertwining like forks. The copper traces formed the touch surfaces for the sounds generated by the Acetone box. Each touch pad was sensed by an electronic circuit driving <b>high-speed</b> Siemens computer <b>relays</b> he found in surplus shops. These were connected to the drum and percussion sounds of the rhythm box. [...] Although it was a crude way of playing electronic drum sounds by hand (like a percussionist playing bongos and congas), it worked and added a [...] "human feel". Visser's approach enabled drummers to have new type of virtuosity (e.g., rolls on electronic bass drums could be played with sticks). The unit was used in Frans Peters' studio in radio city Hilversum, Netherlands.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from December 31, 2015 - December 31, 2017 Impulse-radio ultra-wide-band (IR-UWB) signaling is a promising technique for <b>high-speed,</b> short-range <b>relay</b> communications networks. Depending on how the relay node retransmits the signal, {{there are two main}} relay schemes: conventional one-directional (one-way) relay model, and bi-directional (two-way) relay model. In bi-directional relay communications, wireless network coding (WNC), also called physical-layer network coding (PNC), could be applied to overcome the spectral efficiency limitation of the conventional one-way relay. In {{the first part of this}} work, we propose asynchronous, differential, and bidirectional decode and forward (ADBDF) and asynchronous, differential, and bidirectional denoise and forward (ADBDNF) UWB relay methods, where the relay node (RN) does not need to be synchronized with the end nodes (ENs). The proposed schemes are attractive for networks in which stringent/complicated synchronization between the RN and the ENs may not be feasible. The second part of this work focuses on UWB channel classification. We propose a 2 -dimensional (2 -D) LOS/NLOS classification scheme that uses skewness of the channel impulse/pulse response. The proposed channel classification decreases the complexity of existing channel classification methods and can be used in a variety of areas such as localization, relay communications, and cooperative communications. The final part of this work deals with compressive sensing (CS) algorithms that employ sub-Nyquist sampling for UWB communications. We develop coarse graining (CG) for the proposed CS sub-Nyquist sampling technique, which leads to: (1) reduced sampling rate at the receiver, and hence reduced use of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) resources; and (2) low-complexity channel estimation...|$|R
