25|$|The {{generally}} accepted methods of making CNT films {{involves the use}} of non-ionic surfactants, such as Triton X-100 and sodium lauryl sulfate, which improves their <b>dispersibility</b> in aqueous solution. These suspensions can then be membrane filtered under positive or negative pressure to yield uniform films. The van der Waals force's interaction between the nanotube surface and the surfactant can often be mechanically strong and quite stable and therefore there are no assurances that all the surfactant is removed from the CNT film after formation. Washing with methanol, an effective solvent in the removal of Triton X, was found to cause cracking and deformation of the film. It has also been found that Triton X can lead to cell lysis and in turn tissue inflammatory responses even at low concentrations.|$|E

50|$|MPC {{can make}} {{products}} more heat stable, {{and it can}} provide solubility and <b>dispersibility</b> when used. This solubility makes MPCs beneficial in dairy-based mixes. MPC is useful in foaming and whipping: “The proteins in MPC act at air/water interface to form a stable film of air bubbles. This stabilizes meringues, mousses, cakes, ice creams, whipped cream and soufflés.” “The proteins in MPC act at the oil/water interface to form and stabilize fat emulsions in sausages and other processed meats, dairy drinks, soups, vinaigerettes, sauces and bakery products.” Essential in many of its applications, an MPC can increase the viscosity of a food product due to its interior protein structure. “The lactose and proteins in MPC undergo Maillard browning, resulting in an appealing color for bakery products such as pastries, cakes and muffins.” Because MPC has virtually no taste, it allows the other flavors of a food to fully develop.|$|E
50|$|Microbial biogeographic {{patterns}} are often {{similar to those}} of macro-organisms. Microbes generally follow well-known patterns such as the distance decay relationship, the abundance-range relationship, and Rapoport's rule. This is surprising given the many disparities between microorganisms and macro-organisms, in particular their size (micrometers vs. meters), time between generations (minutes vs. years), and <b>dispersibility</b> (global vs. local). However, important differences between the biogeographical patterns of microorganism and macro-organism do exist, and likely result from differences in their underlying biogeographic processes (e.g., drift, dispersal, selection, and mutation). For example, dispersal is an important biogeographical process for both microbes and larger organisms, but small microbes can disperse across much greater ranges and at much greater speeds by traveling through the atmosphere (for larger animals dispersal is much more constrained due to their size). As a result, many microbial species can be found in both northern and southern hemispheres, while larger animals are typically found only at one pole rather than both.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{covalent}} bonds, {{the linkage}} between catalytic particles and pure CNTs can also be achieved by noncovalent interactions such as van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and electrostatic interactions. The surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) is widely used to attach diverse nanoparticles including Pt, EuF3, TbF3 and SiO2 to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In another approach which utilizes hydrophobic capping agents, for instance, octanethiols and dodecanethiols, both coverage and morphology of the hybrid materials can be well controlled by modifying the length and functional groups of the chains. A similar route is {{to make use of}} the delocalized π electrons of CNTs as well as those in aromatic organic compounds containing polar group terminated alkyl chains. The most distinguished advantage of this method is that pyrene compounds are absorpted on CNTs, which improves the solubility of CNTs, together with <b>dispersibility</b> and charge transfer ability of loaded nanoparticles. In another simple and facile approach where electrostatic interactions are utilized, ionic polyelectrolytes are deposited on CNTs so as to attract charged nanoparticles.|$|E
50|$|The {{biogeography}} {{of microorganisms}} (i.e., organisms that cannot {{be seen with}} the naked eye, such as fungi and bacteria) is an emerging field enabled by ongoing advancements in genetic technologies, in particular cheaper DNA sequencing with higher throughput that now allows analysis of global datasets on microbial biology at the molecular level. When scientists began studying microbial biogeography, they anticipated a lack of biogeographic patterns due to the high <b>dispersibility</b> and large population sizes of microbes, which were expected to ultimately render geographical distance irrelevant. Indeed, in microbial ecology the oft-repeated saying by Lourens Baas Becking that “everything is everywhere, but the environment selects” has come to mean {{that as long as}} the environment is ecologically appropriate, geological barriers are irrelevant. However, recent studies show clear evidence for biogeographical patterns in microbial life, which challenge this common interpretation: the existence of microbial biogeographic patterns disputes the idea that “everything is everywhere” while also supporting the idea that environmental selection includes geography as well as historical events that can leave lasting signatures on microbial communities.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{delivery}} is {{a rapidly growing}} area that is now taking advantage of nanotube technology. Systems being used currently for drug delivery include dendrimers, polymers, and liposomes, but carbon nanotubes present {{the opportunity to work}} with effective structures that have high drug loading capacities and good cell penetration qualities. These nanotubes function with a larger inner volume to be used as the drug container, large aspect ratios for numerous functionalization attachments, and the ability to be readily taken up by the cell. Because of their tube structure, carbon nanotubes can be made with or without end caps, meaning that without end caps the inside where the drug is held would be more accessible. Right now with carbon nanotube drug delivery systems, problems arise like the lack of solubility, clumping occurrences, and half-life. However, these are all issues that are currently being addressed and altered for further advancements in the carbon nanotube field. The advantages of carbon nanotubes as nanovectors for drug delivery remain where cell uptake of these structures was demonstrated efficiently where the effects were prominent, showing the particular nanotubes can be less harmful as nenovehicles for drugs. Also, drug encapsulation has been shown to enhance water <b>dispersibility,</b> better bioavailability, and reduced toxicity. Encapsulation of molecules also provides a material storage application as well as protection and controlled release of loaded molecules. All of these result in a good drug delivery basis where further research and understanding could improve upon numerous other advancements, like increased water solubility, decreased toxicity, sustained half-life, increased cell penetration and uptake, all of which are currently novel but undeveloped ideas.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{elucidate}} the factors affecting the <b>dispersibility</b> and morphology of soy powders.

The <b>dispersibility,</b> morphology, and particle sizes of powders produced using a wheel and those obtained using a nozzle differed. A moderate increase in particle size (from 15 to 24  μm) improved powder <b>dispersibility</b> in most cases. At a total protein content in the powder (w/w%) /total solids in the concentrate (w/w%) ratio of between 30 / 20 and 35 / 20, using the wheel significantly increased particle size (from 23 to 40  μm) in comparison to nozzle (from 14 to 20  μm); moreover, this increase in particle size was correlated to increase in <b>dispersibility</b> (r 2 [*]=[*] 0. 90). These results are in agreement with published findings showing that a surface area that is too large (small particles) can lead to poor <b>dispersibility</b> of a powder in the case of both whey protein and micellar casein. In addition, the wheel provided a smaller span of particle sizes than the nozzle. The powders obtained with the wheel were therefore more homogeneous than those produced with the nozzle, making them easier to characterize in terms of functional properties.

However, we have previously applied TEMPO-mediated oxidation as a preparation step for cellulose nanofibrils [13, 14] to achieve good dispersion in polymer matrices, such as poly(styrene) [15] and poly(l-lactic acid) [16, 17]. Because {{of the good}} <b>dispersibility</b> of TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCNs) in polymer matrices, the resultant nanocomposites exhibit improved mechanical properties.

The <b>dispersibility</b> and particle sizes of the powders produced using a wheel and those obtained using a nozzle differed. A moderate increase in particle size (from 15 µm to 24 µm) improved powder <b>dispersibility</b> in most cases. At a TS/TP ratio between 20 / 30 and 20 / 35, using the wheel slightly increased particle size (from 23 to 40 µm) compared to using the nozzle (from 14 to 20 µm). The increase in particle size was associated with an increase in <b>dispersibility</b> (r 2 = 0. 90). These results are in agreement with published findings showing that a surface area that is too large (small particles) can lead to poor <b>dispersibility</b> of a powder. In fact, powders with small particles with surface areas that are too large may enhance the repulsion phenomenon between solvent and powder molecules during the rehydration process. In addition, the wheel provided a smaller span of particle sizes than the nozzle.

40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (OC) {{influences}} clay <b>dispersibility,</b> which affects soil tilth {{conditions and the}} risk of vertical migration of clay colloids. No universal lower threshold of OC has been identified for satisfactory stabilization of soil structure. We tested the concept of clay saturation with OC as a predictor of clay <b>dispersibility</b> and soil friability. Soil was sampled three years in a field varying in clay content (~ 100 to ~ 220 g kg- 1 soil) and grown with different crop rotations. Clay <b>dispersibility</b> was measured after end-over-end shaking of field-moist soil and 1 - 2 mm sized aggregates either air-dried or rewetted to - 100 hPa matric potential. Tensile strength of 1 - 2, 2 - 4, 4 - 8 and 8 - 16 mm air-dried aggregates was calculated from their compressive strength, and soil friability estimated from the strength-volume relation. Crop rotation characteristics gave only minor effects on clay <b>dispersibility</b> and no detectable effects on soil friability. Dispersed clay correlated to soil content of clay but the correlation increased if subtracting a fraction assumed protected by OC. This trend was less convincing for soil tensile strength and friability. Increased clay <b>dispersibility</b> and reduced soil friability one year of measurements could be ascribed to wet conditions for potato harvest and tillage the preceding year. Literature data indicate soils’ content of clay and silt (Fines 20) to be a better predictor of specific surface area than clay. We conclude that a clay/OC ratio of 10 and a Fines 20 /OC ratio of 20 may serve as corresponding thresholds for clay <b>dispersibility,</b> the latter probably best reflecting organomineral interactions of importance to the soil physical properties...|$|E

Dispersive soils can be a problem for many geotechnical projects and structures. Water flowing in a crack of earth dam or infiltration of rainwater through the crack of slope surface with enough erosion energy can detach the soil particles into suspension and transport it along the movement that will lead to internal erosion process. Soil samples from sloping area within UiTM Shah Alam Campus were collected and a laboratory study was carried out to assess the soil <b>dispersibility</b> behaviour. A laboratory pinhole test and crumb test were conducted to identify soils which are easily dispersed hence susceptible to internal erosion. Indication of the removal of soil particles during testing is a factor in assessing the possibility of internal erosion. Finegrained soils are known to have low resistance to erosion however laboratory result shows that soils fraction with high coarse-grained percentage has high <b>dispersibility</b> grade that lead to lower internal soil erosion resistance whereas the high moisture content percentage would enhance the <b>dispersibility</b> characteristic of the soils performance...|$|E
