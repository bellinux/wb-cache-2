50|$|Doctor Double X's energy-duplicate {{shares the}} {{consciousness}} of Simon Ecks, but can also act alone. The <b>duplicate's</b> <b>powers</b> of flight, energy blasts, and super strength have at times required Batman to seek help in defeating the villain. Double X requires regular infusions of electrical energy to sustain itself or it will lie dormant in Ecks' body.|$|R
50|$|When Yelena Belova {{was given}} {{the power of the}} Super-Adaptoid, Spider-Man had the idea to {{overload}} her ability to <b>duplicate</b> <b>powers</b> by having Iron Man attack her with all of his armors at once, overloaded the Adaptoid's copying ability as she only had the 'space' to copy one Iron Man armor rather than all of them.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{her father}} drugged her to allow Arnim Zola {{to attempt to}} <b>duplicate</b> her <b>powers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hydra later planned {{an all-out}} {{attack on the}} United States by {{smuggling}} missiles into New York {{for use in a}} planned bio-weapon assault on the Ogallala Aquifer. They formed a distraction through using a team that had the <b>duplicated</b> <b>powers</b> of several Avengers (Iron Man, Captain America and former Avengers Thor and Hawkeye) but were inevitably foiled by Spider-Man and the other New Avengers.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{inhabitants}} of this reality, Monica Rambeau would periodically visit Earth-616 for vacations. Due {{to the nature}} of the interdimensional travel, she received <b>duplicate</b> <b>powers</b> to her counterpart and would masquerade as her. It is implied that the inexperienced Rambeau appearing around that time in Black Panther was, in fact, this alternate. Rambeau claimed that the main reason she visited Earth-616 was not because she would gain superpowers but because her parents were still alive in that reality.|$|R
5000|$|Meta Ulnoor is from Titan, {{the moon}} of Saturn, in the 30th century. Like other natives of Titan (including Legionnaire Saturn Girl), {{she is a}} natural telepath. After being {{rejected}} {{for membership in the}} Legion of Super-Heroes (due to a rule prohibiting members with <b>duplicate</b> <b>powers),</b> she joins a group of fellow rejects and demands membership. Calling themselves the [...] "Legion of Super-Rejects", they are initially victorious over their like-powered rivals. Esper Lass and the Super-Rejects are eventually defeated when the Legionnaires use teamwork to win.|$|R
500|$|The Victor had fully <b>duplicated</b> <b>powered</b> {{controls}}; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of artificial feel to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, nose-wheel steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|R

50|$|Hammond rapidly {{becomes a}} rich celebrity {{due to the}} wealth he has acquired. Green Lantern Hal Jordan asks his friend and mechanic, Thomas Kalmaku, {{to take on the}} role of the Green Lantern while Jordan investigates Hammond. Jordan creates a <b>duplicate</b> <b>power</b> ring and costume for Kalmaku to fool Hammond, and tells him to fly above Coast City so it would be thought Green Lantern was there. The {{scientists}} tried to use a device to bring this Green Lantern to them, but the ring was first pulled off his finger and fell on the island, where Hammond found it. Unaware of the impersonation, Hammond steals his ring and turns Kalmaku into a chimpanzee. Jordan confronts Hammond personally in a battle of power rings that ends only when the charge of Hammond's ring runs out, allowing Jordan to capture him and restore Kalmaku and the scientists. He removed the scientist's memory of their knowledge, and got rid of the inventions as well, feeling humanity should advance more steadily.|$|R
50|$|Will Everett III {{could cause}} {{his body to}} {{duplicate}} the properties of any inorganic material he touched from stone to glass. If he touched the pavement, for example, he became a sentient being made of living stone, with all its commensurate strengths and weaknesses. Will Everett III could also absorb and duplicate vast amounts of energy, as when he defeated the Overmaster by draining and <b>duplicating</b> its <b>powers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Australian legal {{definition}} {{of terrorism and}} {{a brief history of}} terrorism in Australia set the context for national security intelligence laws. Recent national reforms are surveyed and critically examined here.

Some provisions need to be clarified to delimit their scope and others could be hampered in operation by the uncertainty of constitutionally implied limits...|$|R
5000|$|His main {{limitation}} was his intelligence, as {{he often}} would [...] "forget to be invulnerable". For whatever reason he was never depicted as trying to <b>duplicate</b> intelligence <b>powers</b> (e.g., Brainiac 5) that might help him deduce what powers would be most effective, instead usually relying on Evolvo Lad's strategems or none at all. He once tried to take on Validus by duplicating the [...] "Validus Power", which caused him to fall unconscious.|$|R
5000|$|Donald McGuiggin, alias the Lamprey, was a {{professional}} criminal {{and member of the}} criminal group called the Institute of Evil on the Squadron's alternate Earth. He had the power to drain energy from other living beings and <b>duplicate</b> their superhuman <b>powers.</b>|$|R
25|$|A player {{may also}} use a Hero Point to ignore fatigue. This last is {{particularly}} useful since, by fatiguing himself, a character can gain any Feat temporarily, or use a Power he possesses to <b>duplicate</b> another <b>power</b> of the same cost. Normally, as stated, this fatigues the character meaning {{it can only be}} used once or twice, but with Hero Points to ignore the fatigue, it can be used as long as the Hero Points hold out.|$|R

50|$|While the Court {{was almost}} {{unanimous}} in holding {{that the president}} indeed {{had the authority to}} create the PTC and that it would not unduly <b>duplicate</b> the <b>powers</b> of the Ombudsman, nine (9) of the justices joined Associate Justice Jose Catral Mendoza in refusing to uphold the constitutionality of E.O. 1 in view of its apparent transgression of the equal protection clause enshrined in sec. 1, Art. III of the Constitution. Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio was joined by four (4) others in their strong dissent.|$|R

An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved. [...] To evade enemy detection and interception efforts, the Victor was outfitted with an extensive electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite which were operated by the air electronics officer (AEO), who had primary responsibility for the aircraft's electronics and communication systems. The ECM equipment could be employed to disrupt effective use of both active and passive radar {{in the vicinity of}} the aircraft, and to provide situational awareness for the crew. Enemy communications could also be jammed, and radar guided missiles of the era were also reportedly rendered ineffective. The Victor B.2 featured an extended area located around the base of the tail fin which contained cooling systems and some of the ECM equipment.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} {{in its various}} incarnations is an advanced android capable of <b>duplicating</b> the <b>powers</b> of metahumans and the abilities of non-powered individuals, including members of the Justice League (such as the strength of Superman or {{the speed of the}} Flash). The androids apparently retain the abilities of the original Justice League of America (Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and the Martian Manhunter) and were later written as being capable of simulating other characters' weapons, such as the power ring of Green Lantern and the Nth metal mace of Hawkgirl.|$|R
50|$|The Chief Examiner is an {{artificial}} computer facsimile programmed by Durgan the Philosopher {{into which he}} projected {{a portion of his}} own consciousness, causing the Chief Examiner to evolve its own individual intelligence and personality. The Chief Examiner has genius level intelligence and the powers of self-levitation and hovering, invisibility, intangibility, and the ability to reprogram computers by touch. It carries a hand-held analysis device, and a mobile rectangular portal into a small pocket dimension containing alien technology capable of analyzing, draining, and <b>duplicating</b> superhuman <b>powers</b> and of probing memories of superhuman beings; the portal absorbs most kinetic energy directed against it.|$|R
5000|$|The Supermobile {{does not}} just <b>duplicate</b> Superman's <b>powers,</b> {{it acts as}} a conduit for the Man of Steel's powers, {{allowing}} him to channel them through the vehicle itself. The Supermanium hull of the SMB shields Superman from red solar radiation that would rob him of his powers, making it so that he remains {{at the height of}} his abilities as long as he is within the vehicle. When Amazo remarks that no engine on Earth could react as quickly and easily as the Supermobile's, Superman responds, [...] "You're right about that, Amazo! But who said anything about an engine?", revealing that the vehicle is powered completely by Superman himself.|$|R
50|$|He also {{provided}} Superboy with the visor that <b>duplicated</b> Superman's vision <b>powers</b> (x-ray and heat vision). This helps Superboy get a start on a heroic career in Hawaii.

50|$|The Bat summons all {{available}} covert agents to attack Zod. Mercury (a.k.a. the Flash), the Hawk (a.k.a. Hawkman), the Huntress, the Atom, the Tornado (a.k.a. Red Tornado) and the Star (a.k.a. Starman) {{respond to the}} call. The Atom and the Hawk are killed, {{and the others are}} barely able to keep Zod contained. The Bat sends Mercury to bring Sloane, who has been working on a formula to <b>duplicate</b> Superman's <b>powers.</b> The Bat takes it and is able to defeat Zod. The Star binds Zod to the device in Chernobyl and sends him to the upper atmosphere. The formula almost kills the Bat, but he survives. He is reconciled with Sloane and they plan on reforming the Unholy Three when he recovers.|$|R
5000|$|After {{a tragic}} mission that claimed {{the life of}} several Avengers {{including}} Hank Pym and the Wasp, their children were furious to see A-Next, a team of heroes referred to by people as the [...] "next generation of Avengers". The children of Hank Pym and Wasp used their parents' technology to replicate their powers. The daughter Hope Pym <b>duplicated</b> her mother's <b>powers</b> as the Red Queen while her brother Henry Pym Jr. copied his father's powers as Big Man.|$|R
50|$|During {{the events}} that {{transpire}} on Earth, Ganthet duplicates Larfleeze's ring to bolster {{the ranks of the}} light-wielders against Nekron's forces. The <b>duplicate</b> orange <b>power</b> ring is able to choose someone to become a deputy Orange Lantern for a 24-hour period. Though Larfleeze protests against anyone else´s wielding of the orange light, the duplicate ring chooses Lex Luthor as its wearer. Despite the immense conflict going on around them, the two characters repeatedly clash due to their insatiable greed. In the final issue of Blackest Night, Luthor is stripped of his power. Larfleeze hands him over to the heroes of Earth in disgust, prompting Sinestro to point out {{that this is the first}} time Larfleeze has given anyone anything. As promised, Sayd agrees to become Larfleeze's personal Guardian when he demands payment for participating in their plan.|$|R
50|$|At {{the secret}} location, Guardian and Mon-El arrived to rescue Livewire but after {{taking out a}} pair of charged up individuals. The {{scientist}} is revealed that he is a metahuman himself; he himself was the first subject on <b>duplicating</b> Livewire's <b>powers.</b> Guardian and Mon-El are captured and become his new experimental subjects. Winn then tells Kara about James and Mon-El being captured; she races to rescue Guardian and Mon-El, but Livewire as well. However, Kara convinced Livewire that she wants to be a friend and she should go after the scientist, which suddenly goes to Livewire's head as she prepares to electrocute him, prompting Kara to stop her. Kara then gives Livewire a head start to leave before she changes her mind and Livewire agrees, for now until next time and advise her not to bring backup if they meet again.|$|R
5000|$|Amazo {{appears in}} the Justice League Action episode [...] "Boo-ray for Bizarro," [...] voiced by Thomas Lennon. He arrives at the Justice League Watchtower where he faces off against Batman, Flash, and Green Lantern. Amazo does make a {{reference}} to Professor Ivo who is dead. When Superman arrives, he joins the fight until Amazo <b>duplicates</b> their <b>powers</b> and defeats them. Wonder Woman arrives where she manages to use the Lasso of Truth on him where she is defeated. When Bizarro arrives, he goes to get the person who claims is the [...] "Smartest Man in the Galaxy" [...] {{which turns out to}} be Space Cabbie. As Space Cabbie struggles to free the captive Justice League members so that they can cancel the message that would draw other Justice League members into a trap, Bizarro fought against Amazo until Bizarro's backwards lifestyle overloads Amazo.|$|R
5000|$|Monica has {{the power}} of adoptive muscle memory, or {{photographic}} reflexes, which allows her to replicate any physical motion she witnesses without having to practice it. For example, in [...] "The Kindness of Strangers", she creates a tomato rose after glancing at a cooking show her grandmother was watching. Later on, she stops a robber with a wrestling move that she saw during a match on TV. In the following episode, Micah helps her hone her powers, and she learns piano, Double-Dutch, and martial arts from a movie. She learns gymnastics while with the Company during the episode [...] "The Line", and Bob gives her an iPod loaded with video demonstrations of any skill she wants to learn. Her powers only allow her to duplicate what she is physically capable of doing; she cannot <b>duplicate</b> the <b>powers</b> of other evolved humans.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Sinister {{was one of}} {{the main}} villains of [...] "X-Men: The End", blackmailing Gambit into {{kidnapping}} the children of Scott Summers and Emma Frost as well as his own children that he conceived with Rogue. During the storyline, Mister Sinister reveals that Gambit is a clone of himself and that his powers are a variation of Cyclops's, as Mr. Sinister implanted some of Cyclops's DNA into Gambit in hopes of <b>duplicating</b> Cyclops's <b>powers.</b> Mr Sinister shows himself to be capable of turning into an exact duplicate of Gambit, a power he uses to kill Rogue when the X-Men seek to rescue the kids. In the end, Mystique murders Mr. Sinister, avenging her adopted daughter's death. Gambit ultimately then takes it upon himself to impersonate Mr. Sinister in order to find out the identity of his accomplice, though he is quickly exposed.|$|R
