5|$|Don Calò Vizzini died on July 10, 1954, {{at the age}} of 76, while {{entering}} Villalba in {{an ambulance}} that was transporting him home from a clinic in Palermo. Thousands of peasants <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> and politicians and priests took part in his funeral, including Mussomeli boss Giuseppe Genco Russo and the powerful boss Don Francesco Paolo Bontade from Palermo (the father of future Mafia boss Stefano Bontade) – {{who was one of the}} pallbearers.

Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next to Pound.|$|E

An alternative cover featuring Moon <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> lingerie and a brown wig, holding a whip, was later used for the inside art for the 1995 and 2003 CD releases. Some of the photographs taken during these sessions were later used as part of Decca's United States promotion of the album.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rainy}} night of 2 January 1968, six men <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> uniforms were seen outside the {{defensive}} wire {{of the main}} base by members of a listening post. After failing {{to respond to a}} challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped. This event prompted Cushman to reinforce Lownds {{with the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. This marked the first time that all three battalions of the 26th Marine Regiment had operated together in combat since the invasion of Iwo Jima during the Second World War. To cover a defilade near the Rao Quan River, four companies from 2/26 were immediately sent out to occupy Hill 558, with another manning Hill 861A.|$|E
5|$|The video follows Ciara as {{she goes}} clubbing. The clip begins with the singer waking up at midnight, in a black, {{reflective}} apartment, as she is <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> and proceeds to leave through the building's fire escape. When she arrives outside, {{the windows of the}} building brighten and fade, and the moon, stars, and lamp posts create a strobe effect. White reflectors on the street sweep around Ciara and she is surrounded by dancers, many of whom are from the film, as they ascend a dark staircase and enter the club. When everyone arrives on the roof, Ciara meets up with Chamillionaire for his verse, and thereafter Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan, the stars of Step Up, make appearances in dance sequences. The lights of the cityscape begin to pulse to the music, and rain falls on the crowd. Unilux strobes are used to highlight the rain.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, {{walking through a}} field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top of the piano, smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with shots of Rihanna hooded, {{lying on the}} floor of a gas chamber. Three men, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> uniforms and wearing dark round glasses {{circulate}} around the singer, attempting to extort information from her. The scene then moves to a dimly lit room in which Rihanna sits at a table with her love interest (played by American actor Jesse Williams) opposite. On the table between them lies a silver revolver in which, throughout the video, they take it turns holding to their heads. Other scenes include Rihanna in a woodland at night standing in the middle of a highway before a car speeds towards her, quickly cutting to another scene, giving the impression she is run over. Elements of blood and tears and vehicular assault dominate the video. In the final scenes, Rihanna is shown underwater, floating whilst being fired at; one bullet is visually seen cutting her throat. The video ends with her lover apparently committing suicide with the revolver placed between them.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E

5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E

25|$|Soja is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} Baccara formula—consisting of breathy lyrics, lush backing, a disco beat and the striking image of two women (Mateos <b>dressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>black,</b> Mendiola in white) dancing. While drawing lightly on Spanish flamenco song and dance tradition, the formula was very much rooted in 1970s disco music. Soja's song arrangements generally used Mateos as the lead singer while Mendiola contributed backing and refrains.|$|E
