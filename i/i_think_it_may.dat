I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and {{to the establishment of}} a Yankee marine.|$|E

It's very, very serious and I think it will really divide the audience. It will really test them and their {{relationship}} to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison had {{intended}} to co-produce his long-awaited follow-up to All Things Must Pass with Phil Spector, a mainstay of his career since 1970. Spector's unreliability meant that Harrison was forced to produce Living in the Material World alone – an outcome that music critics Greg Kot and Zeth Lundy find regrettable, in light of how Spector's signature Wall of Sound treatment might have suited ballads such as [...] "Who Can See It" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round". Another regular Harrison collaborator, John Barham, provided orchestral arrangements as before, and noted an [...] "austere quality" [...] {{in some of the}} new songs. [...] "George was under stress during Living in the Material World," [...] Barham said later. [...] "I felt that he was going through some kind of a crisis. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been spiritual, but I cannot be sure." ...|$|E

500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have been a little bit too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E
2500|$|A eugenicist {{who applied}} his social Darwinism to entire nations, Pearson saw war against [...] "inferior races" [...] as a logical {{implication}} {{of the theory of}} evolution [...] "My view – and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be called the scientific view of a nation," [...] he wrote, [...] "is that of an organized whole, kept up to a high pitch of internal efficiency by insuring that its numbers are substantially recruited from the better stocks, and kept up to a high pitch of external efficiency by contest, chiefly by way of war with inferior races." [...] He reasoned that, if August Weismann's theory of germ plasm is correct, the nation is wasting money when it tries to improve people who come from poor stock.|$|E
2500|$|BYTE in 1989 listed Turbo C and Turbo Pascal {{as among}} the [...] "Distinction" [...] winners of the BYTE Awards. Citing their user {{interface}} and continued emphasis on speed, the magazine stated that [...] "for rapid prototyping there's not much better". In the same issue Pournelle again praised version 4.0 and 5.0 of Turbo Pascal. Citing Anacreon as [...] "a {{good example of how}} complex a program you can write in Pascal", and the many libraries available from Borland and other developers, he wrote [...] "I am more and more convinced that Turbo Pascal is the programming language of choice for people who are more interested in what they want the machine to do than in how to make that happen. Turbo Pascal may be neither as elegant nor as portable as C, but it's sure less obscure. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> well be the language for the rest of us".|$|E

60|$|The President: Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that that}} will do. The Court is {{necessarily}} adverse to allowing the presumption of death, except on evidence of the most satisfactory nature. Still, considering that nearly four months have now passed since the foundering of the Kangaroo under circumstances which make it exceedingly improbable that there were any other survivors, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> fairly presume that Mr. Meeson shared {{the fate of the}} other passengers.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this is a}} great mystery, Bourdon--a {{much greater}} mystery than our friend Peter, whom you have so often said was a man so unaccountable. By the way, he has given me a charge to perform an office between you and Margery, that I had almost forgotten. From what he said to me, <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> have some {{connection}} with our safety. We have enemies among these savages, I feel very certain; though I believe we have also warm friends." ...|$|R
2500|$|Collier's {{views on}} {{religion}} and ethics are interesting for their comparison with the views of Thomas and Julian Huxley, both of whom gave Romanes lectures on that subject. In The religion of an artist (1926) Collier explains [...] "It [...] is mostly concerned with ethics apart from religion... I {{am looking forward to}} a time when ethics will have taken the place of religion... My religion is really negative. [...] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain on upon the reasoning faculties." [...] On secular morality: [...] "My standard is frankly utilitarian. As far as morality is intuitive, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens." [...] His views on ethics, then, were very close to the agnosticism of T.H. Huxley and the humanism of Julian Huxley.|$|E

And [...] "An omnipotent Deity who sentences even the vilest of his creatures to eternal torture is infinitely more cruel than the cruellest man".

On this occasion, I experimented on Yoshida-sarcoma and experimentaly produced peritonitis treated with turpentine oil of rat, applying this same method, and have obtained completely similar results. In other words <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be possible to differentiate malignant tumor including cancer from inflammation by using this method both experimentally and clinically...|$|R

5000|$|In {{response}} to the albums sales in an interview, Tina Campbell stated: ...the business of music has changed drastically since the first record. There have been huge mergers, the advent of Napster the time a music piracy, and downsizing of labels. Our second record came {{in the midst of}} all of that. When we were performing, people asked when we'd release our second album, even though it had already been out for six weeks. So <b>I</b> definitely <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> not have gotten the push the first one got. Tina Campbell ...|$|R
60|$|This {{is not so}} {{properly}} {{called a}} tax upon the tradesmen; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> rather, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be called a plague upon them: for there is, first, the dearness of every necessary thing to make living expensive; and secondly, an unconquerable aversion to any restraint; so that the poor will be like the rich, and the rich like the great, and the great like the greatest--and thus the world runs on {{to a kind of}} distraction at this time: where it will end, time must discover.|$|R

6000|$|... 1. 9. Assume thy wingèd throne, thou Vesper of our throng! The wingèd throne is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> {{a synonym}} of the 'sphere' itself--not a throne within the sphere: 'wingèd,' because the sphere {{revolves}} in space. Yet the statement in stanza 45 that 'the inheritors of unfulfilled renown rose from their thrones' (which cannot {{be taken to}} represent distinct spheres or constellations) suggests the opposite interpretation. Keats is termed 'thou Vesper of our throng' {{because he is the}} latest member of this glorified band--or, reckoning the lapse of ages as if they were but a day, its 'evening star.' The exceptional brilliancy of the Vesper star is not, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> implied--though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be remotely suggested.|$|R
