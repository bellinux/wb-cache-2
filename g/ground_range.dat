The thin black curve indicates the optimum burst height for a given <b>ground</b> <b>range.</b> Military planners prefer to maximise the range at which 10 psi, or more, is extended over when attacking countervalue targets, thus a 220 m height of burst would be preferred for a 1 kiloton blast. To find the optimum height of burst for any weapon yield, the cubed root of the yield in kilotons is multiplied by the ideal H.O.B for a 1 kt blast, e.g. the optimum height of burst for a 500 kt weapon is ~ 1745 m.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional launch {{methods of}} {{satellites}} are too costly to put small payloads into orbit without a larger payload accompanying {{it to make}} the launch worth the expense. Current launches of sub-100-pound satellites are performed as [...] "piggyback payloads" [...] on launches of much larger spacecraft, usually headed for geostationary orbit, and are released at the altitude of the primary payload. In addition, range costs of operating from ground-based infrastructure have escalated as they have aged, accounting for up to 35 percent of the launch cost. This restricts the number of light satellite launches to 10-12 per year, which could be increased if small payloads could be launched into space affordably and without <b>ground</b> <b>range</b> constraints. Air-launching satellites was first seriously considered during the 1950s and 1960s, but small payloads in the 100-pound class at the time did not have effective capabilities, so the method was overlooked. The first air-launched rocket to put a satellite into orbit was the Orbital Sciences Corporation Pegasus, which did it on 13 June 1990; however, it is currently deployed from a heavily modified and expensive Lockheed L-1011 airliner. The ALASA program's objective is to use an unmodified aircraft platform (except for software) {{that does not have}} to be dedicated to the mission to place a 100 lb satellite into orbit that requires only 24 hours notice to integrate and launch the payload, with the ability to re-plan the launch in flight and relocate the aircraft to any civilian airport or military airfield in a crisis situation, while using onboard GPS/inertial position reporting rather than ground-based radar tracking.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a fast {{geometric}} rectification {{method for}} space-borne SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) digital image in slant range with no ground control point is introduced, {{which is based}} on the imaging principle of SAR and the law of geometric distortion in slant range image. The main idea is at first to resample a slant range SAR image to a <b>ground</b> <b>range</b> image with a definite ground spacing because the ground spacing corresponding to each pixel in slant is different caused by the different view angle. The coordinate system of the resampled image can be recognized as a plane rectangular coordinate system formed by the flight direction and the <b>ground</b> <b>range</b> direction. For the plain areas, the <b>ground</b> <b>range</b> image can be transformed into the image in a projected geographic coordinate system by four corner points whose ground coordinates can be calculated by the imaging equation. The rectified image is obtained with high accuracy; While for the areas with fluctuation topography, a higher precision rectification can be made based on the <b>ground</b> <b>range</b> image for it maintains the information of the original SAR slant range image(ground range and flight height) ...|$|E
