5000|$|In legislatures, <b>a</b> {{substitute}} amendment <b>kills</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> {{by replacing}} {{it if the}} amendment is passed.

5000|$|Although {{most states}} {{prohibit}} women from being topless, New Hampshire does not prohibit women from going topless if men are allowed the same privilege, {{which is why}} areas like the Hampton, Laconia, and Gilford beaches have become popular places for protest. In fact, on March 9, 2016, the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee of New Hampshire voted 18-0 to <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> that would prohibit topless sunbathing on state beaches. Their reason for denying the bill was, because passing the bill would guarantee the law would be challenged in federal court because it violated the equal protection rights under the Constitution. In other words, the bill was denied because of its illegal attempt at limiting only female bodies.|$|E

50|$|The {{conservative}} {{coalition is}} an unofficial coalition in the United States Congress bringing together a conservative {{majority of the}} Republican Party and the conservative, mostly Southern, wing of the Democratic Party. It was dominant in Congress from 1937 to 1963 and remained a political force until the mid-1980s, eventually dying out in the 1990s. In terms of Congressional roll call votes, it primarily appeared on votes affecting labor unions. The conservative coalition did not operate on civil rights bills, for the two wings had opposing viewpoints. However, the coalition did {{have the power to}} prevent unwanted bills from even coming to a vote. The coalition included many committee chairmen from the South who blocked bills by not reporting them from their committees. Furthermore, Howard W. Smith, chairman of the House Rules Committee, often could <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> simply by not reporting it out with a favorable rule; he lost some of that power in 1961. The conservative coalition was not concerned with foreign policy, as most of the southern Democrats were internationalists, a position opposed by most Republicans.|$|E

[...] In terms of Congressional roll call votes, it primarily appeared on votes affecting labor unions. The conservative coalition did not cooperate on civil rights bills in unison, requiring a partnership between member Everett Dirksen and President Johnson to unite sufficient numbers of northern Republicans to ally with northern liberal Democrats to push the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to cloture. However, the coalition did {{have the power to}} prevent unwanted bills from even coming to a vote.

The complaint alleged that Frosh had {{a conflict of interest}} because of his partnership in a law firm of which certain members handled medical malpractice cases, though Frosh does not handle those kinds of cases. In response, according to the Post, [...] "Frosh said his partnership arrangement with the firm does not let him share in earnings from cases in which he was not personally involved. And to his recollection, he said, he has handled only one Maryland malpractice case in recent years." [...] Frosh also stated that prior to his vote on the bill he had consulted with the General Assembly's ethics adviser, William G. Somerville, who stated that Frosh had no conflict of interest, was [...] "on solid ground," [...] and under the law, could vote on the bill. [...] "We've got lawyers, doctors and insurance agents in the legislature," [...] Frosh said, [...] "and, to some extent, all of us have an indirect financial interest in this legislation." [...] The Post further noted, [...] "Many lawmakers wind up voting on bills that could have a direct effect on their professions. Typically, legislators are asked to recuse themselves from debate only if a measure would enrich them personally, rather than simply benefit their profession." [...] In light of the facts, Frosh was not required to recuse himself and nothing came of the complaint.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the death}} of President pro tem John Raines {{near the end of}} the {{previous}} year, it became necessary for the Republican majority to elect a successor. The majority of the Republican state senators met in caucus on January 4, 1910, and chose Allds who was supported by the Republican party machine. Seven state senators, allied with reform governor Charles Evans Hughes and objecting to Allds, met separately at the Ten Eyck Hotel in Albany, New York. At this meeting, State Senator Benn Conger told his fellow senators that he had paid Allds a bribe of $1000 in 1901, when both had been assemblymen and Allds was the Majority Leader of the State Assembly, to <b>kill</b> <b>a</b> <b>bill</b> objected to by bridge construction companies in which Conger was interested. On January 5, Allds was chosen President pro tempore and Majority Leader of the State Senate. Shortly afterwards the Conger's statement about the bribe was leaked to the press, but Conger then denied having paid the bribe himself. On January 20, the State Senate appointed a Committee on Plan and Scope (three senators: Brackett, Grady and Meade) to decide on how to proceed. The committee decided to investigate only this one charge and hear testimony before the full senate. On January 30, Conger filed the accusation before the State Senate, stating that Allds had [...] "demanded, received and accepted $1,000 on or about April 23, 1901, in consideration for his failure to pass a certain bill then pending before the Assembly." [...] On February 3, Allds answered the accusation with a denial. Hiram G. Moe testified before the State Senate on February 8 and 9 that he had handed over the envelope containing the money. On February 23, Allds resigned the Presidency pro tempore, and on March 11 George H. Cobb was chosen to succeed. On March 29, the State Senate found Allds guilty by a vote of 40 to 9, but Allds had resigned just before the begin of the session to avoid expulsion. On April 4, Conger also resigned his seat, and retired from politics. Allds died of liver disease at Norwich Memorial Hospital in Norwich, N.Y., in 1923.|$|E
