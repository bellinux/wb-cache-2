5|$|The {{final version}} of the script was {{distributed}} to the cast, but Patrick Stewart did not receive a copy. Berman was concerned that <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> a problem with it, they would call Stewart to complain and it would appear as though Stewart was being left out because he had criticized the story. LeVar Burton called Stewart to praise the script. Stewart was sent a copy and requested a meeting to discuss changes. Piller feared the worst, but after a twenty-minute meeting with Stewart, who requested several dialogue changes, the script was finalized. During pre-production, the marketing department wanted to decide a title, preferring Star Trek: Revolution. Alan Spencera friend of Pillersuggested Insurrection, which was selected from a choice of Insurrection, Rebellion, High Treason and Act of Treason.|$|E

Hannegan, former Postmaster General James Farley, US Senator John W. Bricker, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, former federal judge Fred M. Vinson, Ohio Governor Frank Lausche, and Undersecretary of War Robert P. Patterson. After Cincinnati Reds owner Warren Giles and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley raised strong opposition to Frick, formerly the front runner, New York Yankees co-owner Larry MacPhail began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in Cleveland, Ohio on April 24, 1945 {{to vote for a}} new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the short list; the candidates were Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required two-thirds majority, and after lobbying by MacPhail and New York Giants owner Horace Stoneham, the owners took an informal vote to see <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority; a third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.|$|E

Only when he failed to appear for the opening of the courts on August 25 did his fellow justices become alarmed. They started a private search but failed to find any trace of him. The police were finally notified on September 3 and, after that, the missing judge was front-page news.|$|E

League presses began {{printing}} anti-royalist tracts under a variety of pseudonyms, while the Sorbonne proclaimed that it was just and necessary to depose Henry III. In July 1589, in the royal camp at Saint-Cloud, a monk named Jacques Clément gained an audience with the King and drove a long knife into his spleen. Clément was executed on the spot, taking with him the information of who, <b>if</b> <b>anyone,</b> <b>had</b> hired him. On his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre and begged him, in the name of Statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused.

Geroushi claimed the target; the compound of a Chinese construction company, had been being used by Ansar al-Sharia as an arms depot and a support base for its operations in Benghazi. In response to questions over reported deaths resulting from exploding arms in the depot, Geroushi claimed he did not know <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> been killed or injured in the raid. Geroushi claimed however that the assault would continue until Ansar al-Sharia was forced out of the town. Geroushi also claimed that Ansar al-Sharia had been taking their wounded from the fighting in Benghazi to the hospital in Ajdabiya, which he claimed had been taken over by Islamists. He also claimed the more severely wounded were being transported to Misrata, and then on to Turkey for treatment.|$|E

500|$|Boys Don't Cry {{garnered}} significant {{attention for}} its graphic rape scene. The film was initially assigned an NC-17 rating from the MPAA; the content was toned {{down for the}} U.S. release, where it was rated R. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled This Film Is Not Yet Rated, which discussed the film's problems with the MPAA, particularly the censoring of the sex scenes. The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA {{and had to be}} trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating. Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene. She also claimed that one objection from the MPAA was that one scene featured an orgasm that was [...] "too long", and rhetorically asked <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> every been hurt by an orgasm that was too long.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Chris Willman {{awarded the}} show an A- rating, and commended Knowles' ability {{to sing and}} dance simultaneously. Similarly, Shaheem Reid of MTV News commented, [...] "There are few (very few) ladies out there who can really sing, a lot who can dance, a lot more who look good — but really no other who can combine all three and add iconic star power like Miss Knowles, arguably the best {{all-around}} stage performer in the game right now." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post praised the concert's fast pace and called it a [...] "pure pop spectacle" [...] further describing it as [...] "brilliant... fiery". He noted that the opening, was with a [...] "dramatic, over-the-top entrance about which every aspiring diva dreams", but however he was disappointed in the show's ending. He further wrote, [...] "Though Beyoncé owned the spotlight, this being her 'Experience' and all, her band co-starred in the show, playing hard and tight behind the singer and vamping expertly for sustained periods whenever Beyoncé left the stage to change." [...] The Daily Mail John Aizleman {{was impressed with the}} high energy Knowles showed during the performance, and lauded the dance choreography, particularly that of [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills". However, Aizleman criticized the appearance of a dancer dressed as an angel at the end of [...] "Flaws and All" [...] as being awkward, and wrote that that moment was reminiscent of a [...] "misguided school nativity play". He further added, [...] "Big, brave and bold, the Beyoncé Experience is how pop music would work if it were choreographed by Busby Berkeley... <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>had</b> the temerity to doubt Beyoncé's star quality and her place in the diva pantheon, they would doubt no more after last night." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe wrote in her review that the tour title reminded her of a concert theme park rid and added [...] " [...] was an elaborate affair. It was part Vegas review, part hard-edged rock concert, part sweaty funk and soul revival, part diva concert hall performance, and almost all fun to watch as the singer threw herself into the various settings and costumes". Eamon Sweeney from the Irish Independent described Knowles' performance as [...] "the best pop show on the planet" [...] adding that the title of the tour [...] "does exactly what it says on the tin". David Schmeichel of Jam! wrote that the [...] "Splashy Beyonce 'experience' gives a lesson in diva-hood for pop princesses everywhere", further praising her [...] "goddess" [...] like entrance, vocals and performance which he desrcibed as [...] "tightly scripted as her film forays". Ashante Infantry of the Toronto Star noted that the concerts served as a testament to Knowles' talent and power and compared her with [...] Prince for the versatility and musicianship and Tina Turner for the sass and sheer power. Herald Sun Cameron Adams also compared Knowles' performing ability to that of Prince, and stated, [...] "Beyoncé is an old-fashioned, all- round entertainer." [...] Jim Harrington writing for San Jose Mercury News graded the tour as an A-plus affair. A writer of The StarPhoenix praised the show, writing that Knowles [...] "set the stage on fire" [...] for two hours. The writer also added that she had [...] "an honest, God-given talent she's not afraid to share. Her songs, ranging from sultry to soulful were performed with all her heart... With a clear passion for showmanship and a voice not easily matched, Beyonce simply bypassed the mediocrity of most concerts and took her performance to another level." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times heavily praised Knowles' performance, writing that [...] "B performed like her life depended on it; fresh to death choreography, flawless vocals, crazysexy wardrobe and her trademark lioness mane all in A+ form... Beyonce gave the crowd all that they expected, and multiplied that by 1000." [...] She concluded her review by writing that the concert was reminiscent of a Las Vegas show due to the elaborate costumes, sets, and [...] "over-the-topness of the whole thing" [...] further praising Knowles for acting, dancing and singing on stage.|$|E
