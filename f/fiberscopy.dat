40|$|Introduction. This study prospectively evaluates {{and compares}} the {{treatment}} efficacy of botulinum toxin injection under electromyography guidance (EMG group) and percutaneous botulinum toxin injection under flexible fiberscopic guidance (<b>fiberscopy</b> group). Methods. Thirty patients with adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD), {{who had never}} received treatment, were randomly allocated into EMG- or fiberscopy-guided botulinum toxin injections between March 2008 and February 2010. We assessed acoustic and aerodynamic voice parameters, and the voice handicap index (VHI) before injection and at 1, 3, and 6 months after injection. Results. The mean total dosage of botulinum toxin was similar for both groups: 1. 7 ± 0. 5 [*]U for the EMG group and 1. 8 ± 0. 4 [*]U for the <b>fiberscopy</b> group (P> 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences}} in outcomes between the two groups in either the duration of effectiveness or complications such as breathy voice and aspiration. Conclusion. Botulinum toxin injection under fiberscopic guidance is a viable alternative to EMG-guided botulinum toxin injection for the treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia when EMG equipment is unavailable...|$|E
40|$|Hemosuccus pancreaticus is {{an unusual}} cause of {{gastrointestinal}} bleeding that occurs as a complication of chronic or acute pancreatitis. We report a case of extremely acute-onset hemosuccus pancreaticus occurring in a patient with chronic pancreatitis over a long-term follow-up after a Puestow procedure (side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy). The patient was admitted to our hospital due to severe anemia and tarry stools indicative of gastrointestinal bleeding. Emergent endoscopy, including gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> and colon <b>fiberscopy,</b> showed no abnormal findings. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography and hemorrhagic scintigraphy did not detect a hemorrhagic lesion. Although interventional radiology was considered for diagnosis and treatment, conservative therapy seemed sufficient to affect hemostasis. Two weeks later, however, acute intestinal bleeding with hemodynamic shock occurred, and exploration was performed without delay. Intraoperative endoscopy through an incision of the reconstructed jejunal loop in the close proximal end revealed a site of active bleeding from the side-to-side anastomotic pancreatic duct. Following a longitudinal incision of the jejunal loop, a bleeding point was sutured and ligated on direct inspection. The patient showed a good postoperative course...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{two cases}} of adult-onset Schonlein-Henoch purpura with gastrointestinal manifestations. Case 1 : A 73 -year-old man {{was admitted to}} our hospital because of abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever. On physical examination, the abdomen was normal, {{and there were many}} palpable petechial hemorrhages on the lower extremities. Skin biopsy revealed infiltrations of lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils into the dermis. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen disclosed thickening of the intestinal wall in the duodenum and jejunum. Upper gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> revealed petechiation on the stomach and erosions on the duodenum. Case 2 : A 54 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of hematochezia. The patient had pharyngitis 4 days before admission, and his serum anti-streptolysion O level was increased. On physical examination, there were faint purpuras on the lower extremities. Skin biopsy revealed a histological image of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A CT scan of the abdomen disclosed thickening of the intestinal wall in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum.

A 45 -year-old man complained of severe back pain. Computed tomography of the chest showed a mediastinal mass. On the next day, a left pleural effusion was revealed, which was a hemothorax. Gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> suggested perforation of the esophagus; an esophagectomy was performed, and the patient was diagnosed with a pathologic perforation of the esophageal diverticulum. This is the only report of a hemothorax resulting from perforation of an esophageal diverticulum in the English literature to date...|$|E
30|$|In our case, a {{capnometer}} {{was useful}} for differentiating between bronchospasm and laryngospasm. Although a definitive diagnosis of laryngospasm {{is made by}} examination of the vocal cords with a bronchial fiberscope [20], there was insufficient time to perform bronchial <b>fiberscopy</b> {{in order to prevent}} progression to NPPE. No waveform appears in capnometer readings of laryngospasm, which causes complete occlusion of the upper respiratory tract; however, they reveal waveform patterns of occlusive respiratory disorders and provide EtCO 2 values in most cases of bronchospasm. In our case, laryngospasm was diagnosed because EtCO 2 waveforms were absent on the capnometer readings, and continuous positive airway pressure with 100 % oxygen was applied through a facemask, resulting in relief of symptoms.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the oral and glottal adjustments, {{as well as their}} coordination, during the production of singleton and geminate voiceless stops in Berber using <b>fiberscopy,</b> photoglottography and acoustic analyses. Acoustically, closure duration of geminates is longer than singletons. VOT, on the other hand, does not contribute to the distinction of length. At the glottal level, voiceless stops are realized with a glottal opening covering both the closure portion and the aspiration portion. Geminates and singletons differ in terms of timing and size of glottal opening. Geminates have a larger and longer glottal opening than singletons. The interval between peak glottal opening and oral release is significantly higher for geminates than for single stops...|$|E
40|$|A 48 -year-old {{married woman}} {{complaining}} of macroscopic hematuria and cystitis symptom {{was admitted to}} our institute. Flexible cystoscopy revealed many yellowish, nodular masses at the paries posterior of the urinary bladder, and cold-punch biopsy proved it to be amyloidosis. Serum amyloid protein A (SAA) was high, and suggested systemic amyloidosis. Renal biopsy and colon <b>fiberscopy</b> did not reveal any abnormalities. We therefore diagnosed a primary localized amyloidosis of the urinary bladder. Transurethral resection and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) infusion therapy are used to treat amyloidosis of the urinary bladder. However there is no definite cure for amyloidosis of the urinary bladder. Therefore we selected DMSO occlusive dressing technique therapy. After 5 years of therapy, {{there was no evidence}} of a recurrence of amyloidosis...|$|E
30|$|A 10 -day-old male infant {{presented}} with symptoms of airway obstruction and subclinical hypothyroidism. Imaging tests revealed an ectopic lingual thyroid {{and the absence}} of a normal pretracheal thyroid gland. We administered oral levothyroxine to lower his thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level and reduce the volume of the lingual mass; however, his airway symptoms did not improve. Subsequently, we performed a surgical intervention when he was 2  months old. We split the hyoid bone, and then suspended the lingual thyroid by suturing it to the hyoid bone to elevate the epiglottis. We confirmed the degree of suspension using intraoperative laryngo <b>fiberscopy.</b> After the surgery, the symptoms of airway obstruction were resolved and the patient was clinically euthyroid on low-dose oral levothyroxine.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{therapy for}} {{articulation}} disorder secondary to ve 10 pharyngeal incom-petence had generally been instituted after attaining sufficient ve 10 pharyngeal func-tion either by surgery or prosthetic treatment. This therapeutic policy. seems to require some amendment now. Recent advancement in fluorovideoscopy and <b>fiberscopy</b> permitted direct visualization {{of the dynamic}} velopharyngeal function. Through observation of these video-taped data, we found that some cases of slight velopharyngeal incompetence could be improved solely by speech therapy in terms of ve 10 pharyngeal function as well as articulation. 6) We also found that transient velopharyngeal closure could be elicited by tentat-ive articulation therapy even {{in some of the}} obvious velophG ryngeal incompetent cases.

40|$|A 64 -year-old man was {{transferred}} to our division with a suspicion of gastric cancer. Computed tomography showed widespread irregular thickening of the stomach walls close to the liver and pancreas. Gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> showed a type 5 tumor in the upper to lower stomach, histologically diagnosed as tubular adenocarcinoma. Gastric cancer with hepatic and pancreatic invasion was diagnosed. Distant metastasis was not proven and complete resection was planned. At laparotomy, the tumor showed general expanding growth and invasion through the lateral segment of the liver and pancreas. Total gastrectomy and combined resection of the distal pancreas, spleen and left segment of the liver were performed. Hepatic and pancreatic invasion and lymph node metastasis were microscopically proven. Pancreatic fistula occurred postoperatively. On postoperative days 40, he was discharged. He received two cycles of adjuvant tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil chemotherapy. He has had no sign of recurrence for 7 years and 8 months...|$|E
40|$|We {{described}} {{a patient with}} adenocarcinoma of the stomach combined with choriocarcinoma and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma. An 85 -year-old man visited our hospital because of appetite loss. Gastric <b>fiberscopy</b> revealed a large tumor occupying the cardial region and anterior wall of the gastric body. The patient underwent total gastrectomy with lymphnode dissection and partial resection of the liver. Choriocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma and tubular adenocarcinoma existed in the gastric tumor. The choriocarcinomatous foci contained cells positive for beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG) and human placental lactogen mainly in syncytiotrophoblastic cells. The small cell carcinomatous foci contained cells positive for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and chromogranin A. The prognosis for gastric adenocarcinoma with choriocarcinoma and neuroendocrine cell carcinoma is exceedingly poor. This patient died about 2 mo after the first complaint from hepatic failure. This is the first reported case of gastric cancer with these three pathological features...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of many persons viewing {{the same field}} together has been long desired in urological endoscopy, not only for objective diagnosis and proper treatment but also as an aid in teaching. Since 1978, the authors have been using the video-system consisting of an MK- 309 C as a video-camera with a television monitor, the connecting scope between the endoscope and the video-camera, and a CLX as a light source. This system {{has been used in}} cystourethroscopy, TUR and <b>fiberscopy</b> of the upper urinary tract by our pyeloureteroscope. The features of this system are to use the connecting scope which allows television monitoring of the findings without disturbing the handling of the endoscope by the operator, the three-tube video-camera which transmits the pictures in quite natural color and good resolution to the television monitor and the very bright light source which gives clear views of the lesions. The endoscopic field that could be viewed simultaneously by many persons using this system proved to be satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} case of prostatic {{malignant}} lymphoma causing bilateral hydronephrosis. A 73 -year-old man was referred to our department, suffering from urinary frequency and gross hematuria. The mild elevation of serum prostatic tumor markers made us suspect prostatic carcinoma. He was admitted to our hospital and needle biopsy of the prostate was performed. Unexpectedly histological findings revealed "malignant lymphoma, diffuse large cell type". CT scan showed bilateral hydronephrosis, and renal function was decreased. As the patient suddenly vomited blood, gastric <b>fiberscopy</b> and biopsy was performed. Histological diagnosis of stomach {{was the same as}} for the prostate. After systemic chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) regimen, renal function improved and the tumor of stomach reduced, but his respiratory condition rapidly worsened, and he died about 1 month after chemotherapy. Malignant lymphoma involving the prostate is very rare. Especially in Japan only 19 cases have been reported including our case. Four of the 19 men were in their twenties and so we remind the urologists of the possibility of "malignant lymphoma of the prostate" in young patients with dysuria or frequency...|$|E
40|$|Giant cell tumor (GCT) is {{a benign}} {{neoplasm}} arising most commonly {{in the long}} bones. GCTs of the larynx (GCTL) are relatively rare, and only individual case reports are documented in the literature. Patients with such tumors may present with hoarseness and anterior neck swelling. We present a 59 -year-old man with hoarseness and enlarging anterior neck mass for 3 months. A <b>fiberscopy</b> revealed a submucosal swelling of the left subglottic trachea. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the larynx demonstrated a large, well-defined, inhomogeneous enhancing mass at the left thyroid cartilage, which was obstructed entirely. The anterior neck mass was biopsied for histopathological analysis, which showed multinodularity with intervening vascularized connective tissues. The mass {{was made up of}} mononuclear cells and distributed multinucleated giant cells. The mitotic activity of the mononuclear cells was as high as 6 per 10 high-power fields. Pathologic consultation resulted in a diagnosis of giant cell tumor.

40|$|Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} plasma cell myeloma that affects soft tissues. The head and neck region are the most {{affected}} sites, although others have also been described. Herein we report an uncommon case of EMP of the larynx in a 65 -year-old male who presented {{with a history of}} progressive dysphonia and hoarseness. Laryngeal <b>fiberscopy</b> evidenced a reddish pedicled voluminous mass in the left false cords and ventricle. Microscopic suspension laryngoscopy was performed under general anaesthesia and a 4 [*]W Acublade CO 2 Laser was used for transoral resection of the lesion. This was followed by adjuvant radiotherapy, with the widely recommended doses on the supraglottic region, to achieve better local control. Diagnosis of EMP is based on immunohistochemistry and the exclusion of systemic plasma cell proliferative disorders. Diagnosis of solitary EMP can be made only if studies for disseminated disease and X-ray and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, pelvis, femurs, and humerus and bone marrow biopsy are negative. As there are no internationally established guidelines, treatment of EMP is mainly based on consensus of expert opinion...|$|E
40|$|Hepatoid {{adenocarcinoma}} of {{the stomach}} (HAS) is a rare form of gastric cancer that has unique clinicopathological features and an extremely poor prognosis. Here, we report on three patients with suspected gastric cancer who were referred to our hospital. Gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> on the three patients revealed two lesions in the antrum and a third lesion in the gastroesophageal junction. The alpha fetoprotein (AFP) serum levels were markedly elevated in all cases. At the time of diagnosis, two cases were advanced stages with lymph nodes and/or liver metastases. Two patients underwent exploratory laparotomy. A total gastrectomy {{was performed on the}} operable lesion, and an expanded gastrectomy was completed in the case with hepatic metastases. Histopathological analysis revealed that the tumors displayed two pathological changes: hepatoid-like foci and adenocarcinomatous. Furthermore, the tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for AFP, alpha- 1 antitrypsin, and alpha- 1 antichymotrypsin. All three patients received chemotherapy. The follow-up duration ranged from 8 - 36 mo. Our experience and previous published studies have suggested that HAS is an aggressive type of adenocarcinoma. However, radical surgery and chemotherapy may positively impact clinical outcomes...|$|E
40|$|This case of subglottic {{cancer was}} {{originally}} diagnosed as bronchial asthma. A 67 -year-old man {{was brought to}} a hospital because of extreme difficulty of breathing. He was examined by an internist and diagnosed as bronchial asthma. He was treated for asthma {{in the hospital for}} 10 days. Two months later he was referred to our hospital because of recurring symptoms. A <b>fiberscopy</b> and CT scan revealed a large tumor in the subglottic area. The tumor biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. After an emergency tracheotomy, he underwent a total laryngectomy including total thyroidectomy and resections of the paratracheal and paraesophageal lymph nodes According to statistics, the occurrence of laryngeal cancer is around 1 % of all cancers. Over 90 % of laryngeal cancers, however, occur in the supraglottic or glottic area, and subglottic cancers are rare. In addition, the clinical features of subglottic cancer, which often starts as stridor or dyspnea without hoarseness, are quite different from other laryngeal cancers.

40|$|A 67 -year-old man was {{referred}} to our hospital because of high-grade fever and acute renal failure on January 11, 1996. Gastroduodenal <b>fiberscopy</b> performed 17 days before admission revealed advanced gastric cancer in the pylorus. Intravenous hyper- alimentation was started on December 27, 1995. Because of the fever, the patient had been treated with 5 mg/day of indomethacin and 2 g/day of cefazolin since January 1, 1996. Serum creatinine was elevated to 8. 2 mg/dl. To rule out acute interstitial nephritis caused by these drugs, a renal biopsy {{was performed on the}} second hospital day. The biopsy specimen demonstrated multiple microabscesses containing yeast-like organisms in the medulla. Candida tropicalis was isolated from urine cultures, atrial blood and the catheter tip. The patient was diagnosed as having acute renal failure due to renal candidiasis. Under hemodialysis treatment, he received 400 mg/day of miconazole. Hemodialysis was stopped on the 13 th hospital day. On the 41 st hospital day, the patient was afebrile and serum creatinine had decreased to 1. 7 mg/dl.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was designed}} to compare two single-dilator percutaneous tracheotomy techniques, the Ciaglia BlueRhino and the Percutwist technique. One hundred and ninety adult patients were included, 166 with the BlueRhino, a conical shaped, flexible rubber dilator, and 24 with the Percutwist, a screw like dilating device. The procedure was performed under <b>fiberscopy</b> {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Age, body mass index (BMI), indication for tracheotomy, surgical landmarks, duration of the procedure and surgical complications were recorded. Median age and indications were similar for the two groups. Dilation was successful in all patients. The mean time for surgery was shorter with the Ciaglia technique: 8 +/- 3 versus 12 +/- 5 min with the Percutwist technique (P = 0. 004). There was no significant difference related to weight, BMI, duration of tracheotomy and complications between both groups. One posterior tracheal wall puncture was observed with the Ciaglia technique and four with the Percutwist technique. No serious complications were noted with either technique. The Percutwist technique represents an alternative to the more established Ciaglia BlueRhino technique. The Ciaglia technique is a safe and more rapid procedure for bedside tracheotomy...|$|E
30|$|A 57 -year-old {{woman was}} {{previously}} {{admitted to a}} hospital because of abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> showed hemobilia, whereas abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) performed at the time showed two tumors in the liver: one in the lateral segment measuring 4 [*]×[*] 3  cm in diameter {{and the other in}} the posterior segment measuring 10 [*]×[*] 5  cm in diameter. CT showed no clear differences between the two tumors; they were multiple capsulated lesions filled with cystic contents and highly enhanced mural nodules (data not shown). Additionally, the needle biopsy for both tumors did not reveal a malignant finding - a fragment of liver tissue with no malignancy. Despite the tumors being thought as benign, she underwent a diagnostic partial resection of the lateral segment. Histological examination indicated cavernous hemangioma. She then received transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) for hemostasis of the right lobe tumor. During the follow-up period thereafter, she experienced six episodes of hemobilia, and four other TAE sessions were performed. She was referred to our hospital 8  years after the diagnostic surgery owing to the growing tumor in the right lobe.|$|E
40|$|A 72 -year-old Japanese man had {{a history}} of {{proximal}} gastrectomy for early gastric cancer located in the upper third of the stomach in 2007. Our usual treatment strategy for early gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach in 2007 was open proximal gastrectomy reconstructing by jejunal interposition with a 10 [*]cm single loop. Upper gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> for annual follow-up revealed a type 0 -IIc-shaped tumor with ulcer scar, 4. 0 [*]cm in size, located in the gastric remnant near the jejunogastrostomy. A clinical diagnosis of cancer of the gastric remnant, clinical T 1 b(SM) N 0 M 0, Stage IA, following the proximal gastrectomy was made and a laparoscopic approach was selected because of the cancer’s early stage. Remnant total gastrectomy with D 1 plus lymphadenectomy was carried out with five ports by a pneumoperitoneal method. Complete resection of the reconstructed jejunum was undergone along with the jejunal mesentery. Reconstruction by the Roux-en-Y method via the antecolic route was selected. Total operative time was 395 [*]min and blood loss was 40 [*]mL. Our patient was the first successful case of resection for carcinoma of the gastric remnant following proximal gastrectomy reconstructed with jejunal interposition in a laparoscopic approach...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 834 cases of {{colorectal}} cancers {{were divided into}} two diagnostic groups and studied. The ratio of smaller, less advanced carcinomas to the total number of colorectal cancers diagnosed by electronic videoendoscopy has increased as compared to the ratio in cases diagnosed by <b>fiberscopy.</b> This seems to be largely influenced by concomittent developments such as the implementation of colorectal cancer screening assisted by the popularization of immunological fecal occult blood tests and the increase in number of examinees. On the other hand, the use of the electronic videoendoscopy has been accompanied by increases in the diagnosis of minute carcinomas measuring 5 mm or less and fiat carcinomas which were previously difficult to diagnose. Under these circumstances, endoscopic mucosal resection has gained popularity, widening the spectrum of therapeutic options. Nonetheless, endoscopic treatment also has been associated with increases in cases requiring laparotomy when carcinoma was found in the resected margin or those demonstrating invasion in the submucosa. This may be one result of the more aggressive application of endoscopic treatment, but the histologically recognized inability to detect carcinoma in the resected intestinal tract leaves room for improvement.

40|$|PURPOSE: Report {{a case of}} a patient, who {{benefitted from}} the I-gel, during an {{elective}} urological surgery and who presented severe laryngeal hemorrhage {{at the time of its}} withdrawal. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 71 -year-old male patient had been admitted in the operating room for the insertion of a ureteral stent. He had a history of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) requiring corticosteroids and oxygen therapy and a severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP). After intravenous induction of anesthesia, a size 5 I-gel (Intersurgical, Wokhingam, UK) was easily inserted in the first attempt. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane. As soon as the procedure ended, the I-Gel was removed. After two minutes, the patient presented a respiratory distress and started spitting significant quantity of blood. Oropharyngeal <b>fiberscopy</b> was performed in emergency and highlighted active bleeding of the left aryepiglottic fold. Hemostasis was obtained by local compression. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was extubated the following day without complications. No additional procedure was necessary to stop the bleeding.

Diagnosis of EMP is based on immunohistochemistry and the exclusion of systemic plasma cell proliferative disorders. Diagnosis of solitary EMP can be made only if studies for disseminated disease and X-ray and/or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, pelvis, femurs, and humerus and bone marrow biopsy are negative. As there are no internationally established guidelines, treatment of EMP is mainly based on consensus of expert opinion. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONBasaloid {{squamous}} cell carcinoma of the esophagus (BSCE) is a rare malignancy among esophageal cancers. We reported a case of 63 -year-old woman with metachronous pulmonary metastasis of BSCE, successfully treated by metastasectomy of the left lung. PRESENTATION OF CASEBiopsy specimens of upper gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> led to diagnosis of poorly differentiated {{squamous cell}} carcinoma of the esophagus. Computed tomography revealed metastatic lymph nodes surrounding the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve and no evidence of metastasis to distant organs. Curative esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection was performed through thoracoscopic approach. Pathological examination of the resected specimens led to diagnosis of BSCE with invasion into the submucosal layer of the esophageal wall. Two years later, a solitary oval-shaped pulmonary lesion of approximately 10 mm was detected in the left lung. Wedge resection of the left upper lobe was performed via thoracoscopic approach. The postoperative course was uneventful. Histologically, the pulmonary lesion was diagnosed as metastatic BSCE. Follow-up indicated no recurrence 9 years after the initial surgery. DISCUSSIONSurgical intervention was acceptable on this case of solitary pulmonary metastasis. However, data are lacking about the efficacy of pulmonary resection for metachronous pulmonary metastasis of BSCE because the postoperative outcome is usually poor. The efficacy of surgical intervention for metastatic lesions of BSCE is debatable and requires further examination. CONCLUSIONAlthough the usefulness of surgical intervention for metastatic lesions from BSCE is controversial, the patients with metachronous solitary metastasis to the lung and without extrapulmonary metastasis would be good candidate for pulmonary resection...|$|E
40|$|Superior {{mesenteric}} artery (SMA) {{syndrome is}} a relatively rare disease, which {{is caused by the}} obstruction of the third portion of the duodenum due to extrinsic compression by the SMA and the abdominal aorta. Although anatomical characteristics, such as the acute angle of the SMA to the abdominal aorta and proximity of the SMA to the abdominal aorta, are considered as underlying factors for causing SMA syndrome, most cases occur with predisposing factors such as rapid body weight loss and rapid growth. We recently experienced a case of SMA syndrome that had occurred without any considerable predisposing factors. The patient was a 17 -year-old female, who had neither lost weight nor experienced recent increase in height. ' She was also stable psychosomatically and had not been taking a slimming diet. She suddenly started vomiting shortly after meals and lost 4 kg in weight over 10 days. Although gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> did not show significant findings, upper gastrointestinal X-ray series revealed a sharp cut-off and obstruction to the passage of barium in the third portion of the duodenum. This obstruction was restored in a prone position. Subsequent magnetic resonance images did not show any tumorous lesions in the abdomen, resulting in the diagnosis of SMA syndrome. She recovered from the symptom by taking a prone position after meals. SMA syndrome caused without predispos- ing factors {{is considered to be a}} rare case and the related literature is reviewed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Report a new {{technique}} of laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) for snoring performed as a one-stage procedure. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-tree was used in a prospective study of 89 patients from April 1994 to May 1997. It included a <b>fiberscopy</b> and Muller's maneuver, rhinomanometry, pH monitoring, computed tomography scan to measure the pharyngeal lumen, pulse oximetry, and polysomnography in case of sleep apnea syndrome was suspected. METHODS: The authors performed their LAUP technique on 43 patients (48. 5 %) whose snoring was mainly caused by the velum. This technique consists of scarifying the velum by vaporizing the mucosa and the submucosa along a rectangle extending from the palatal dimple to the uvula and having a width of 1. 5 to 2 cm. Vaporization of the palatal arches follows without exceeding the junction of the anterior and posterior pillars in height. The uvula is cut if necessary, preserving a length of at least 0. 5 cm. The other patients underwent different procedures according {{to the cause of}} snoring. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference between}} LAUP and uvulopalatoplasty (UPPP) regarding pain. No permanent phonatory disorders and no regurgitation occurred. Satisfaction evaluated on a scale ranging from 0 to 10 was equivalent for the two techniques: mean value = 7. 68 (+/- 2. 18) for LAUP and 8. 60 (+/- 2. 27) for UPPP. The mean follow-up was 17 months (range, 1 - 37 mo). Satisfaction was also identical for all techniques. CONCLUSION: Our LAUP technique combined with other procedures according to a decision-tree is efficient and safe...|$|E
40|$|In this {{prospective}} study, {{a flexible}} fiberoptic nasolaryngoscope with color video camera {{was used to}} examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in 180 pediatric patients. The relative size of the adenoid tissue was judged by endoscopy, which lead to a classification into 3 types according to the distance from the vomer to the adenoid tissue. The condition of the nasopharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube was also described and differentiated into 3 types relating to the condition of adenoid tissue. Assessment was performed by correlating these measurements with the tympanogram, lateral X-ray and clinical complaints. The authors conclude that: (1) fiberoptic examination allows direct visualization of the size and condition of the adenoid tissue, {{as well as of the}} condition of the nasopharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube. (2) The size of the adenoid tissue correlates very well with the nasal obstruction complaints as well as with the type of tympanogram. (3) The condition of the nasopharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian tube significantly corresponds with the type of tympanogram. (4) For the indication of adenoidectomy, <b>fiberscopy</b> gives more accurate information than standard X-ray. (5) With a correct choice of premedication and local anesthesia, it is a minor invasive technique which is very well tolerated by children. It is possible in all cases, provided it is performed by a skilled endoscopist and preceded by careful explanation to the child. (6) Finally, thanks to the possibility of direct visualization of the fiberscopic image via a monitor, it allows a better explanation of the indication for adenoidectomy to the child's parents. © 1992.

40|$|Various {{methods of}} {{reconstruction}} after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) {{have been developed}} and published, whereas {{only a limited number}} of reports are available on the utility of the delta-shaped anastomosis (Delta). This study compared Delta and Roux-en-Y anastomoses (RY), with the aim to clarify the utility of Delta. Stage 1 gastric cancer patients who had undergone LDG with Delta (group D, n = 68) and those who had undergone LDG with RY (group RY, n = 60) were compared in terms of operative outcomes, postoperative clinical symptoms, gastrointestinal fiberscopic findings, and changes in body weight. Both the operative and anastomotic times were significantly shorter in group D (230 and 13 min, respectively) than in group RY (258 and 38 min, respectively) (p < 0. 001). Among the complications observed at the anastomotic site, obstruction was seen in one group D patient and two group RY patients but was relieved with conservative management. Postoperative clinical symptoms were reported for 26. 4 % of the group D patients but had decreased to 5. 9 % 1 year later. Group RY yielded similar results. Upper gastrointestinal <b>fiberscopy</b> performed 1 year postoperatively showed no intergroup differences in the incidence of gastritis or residual retention and a significantly more frequent occurrence of bile reflux in group D. Postoperative weight changes did not differ between the two groups. Delta reconstruction after LDG is a safe and effective procedure that is totally laparoscopic, less time consuming, and associated with a favorable postoperative course and a better quality of life...|$|E
