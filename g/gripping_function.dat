50|$|Another {{lineage of}} Mesozoic mammals, the eutriconodonts, have been {{suggested}} to be aquatic animals with mixed results. Astroconodon occurred abundantly in freshwater lacustrine deposits and its molars were originally interpreted as being {{similar to those of}} piscivorous mammals like cetaceans and pinnipeds; by extension some researchers considered the possibility that all eutriconodonts were aquatic piscivores. However, Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska and other researchers have latter found that the triconodont molars of eutriconodonts were more suited for a carnassial-like shearing action than the piercing and <b>gripping</b> <b>function</b> of piscivorous mammal molars, occluding instead of interlocking, and that Astroconodons aquatic occurrences may be of little significance when most terrestrial tetrapod fossils are found in lacustrine environments anyway.|$|E

30|$|Dynamic {{reconstruction}} of the RCL is more widely described than for the UCL which is attributable to the required outcomes of surgery.

40|$|Many {{aspects of}} both <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> and tactile {{perception}} depend on complex frictional interactions {{occurring in the}} contact zone of the finger pad, which {{is the subject of}} the current review. While it is well established that friction plays a crucial role in <b>grip</b> <b>function,</b> its exact contribution for discriminatory touch involving the sliding of a finger pad is more elusive. For texture discrimination, it is clear that vibrotaction {{plays an important role in}} the discriminatory mechanisms. Among other factors, friction impacts the nature of the vibrations generated by the relative movement of the fingertip skin against a probed object. Friction also has a major influence on the perceived tactile pleasantness of a surface. The contact mechanics of a finger pad is governed by the fingerprint ridges and the sweat that is exuded from pores located on these ridges. Counterintuitively, the coefficient of friction can increase by an order of magnitude in a period of tens of seconds when in contact with an impermeably smooth surface, such as glass. In contrast, the value will decrease for a porous surface, such as paper. The increase in friction is attributed to an occlusion mechanism and can be described by first-order kinetics. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of the coefficient of friction to the normal load and sliding velocity is comparatively of second order, yet these dependencies provide the main basis of theoretical models which, to-date, largely ignore the time evolution of the frictional dynamics. One well-known effect on taction is the possibility of inducing stick–slip if the friction decreases with increasing sliding velocity. Moreover, the initial slip of a finger pad occurs by the propagation of an annulus of failure from the perimeter of the contact zone and this phenomenon could be important in tactile perception and <b>grip</b> <b>function...</b>|$|R

In order to perform a general evaluation of the physical abilities, individuals were grouped in terms of the severity of the total musculoskeletal burden. A major malformation of an extremity was considered when considerable shortening or deformity existed, but limbs with malformation(s) of the fingers or toes only, were not considered as such.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The wrist {{arthrodesis}} {{has become}} a well-established procedure on the treatment of various diseases that affect the radiocarpal joint {{with the objective of}} pain relief and restoration of joint stability, allowing a recovery of <b>gripping</b> <b>function</b> and lifestyle. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the functional outcomes of wrist arthrodesis in patients with advanced symptomatic inflammatory or degenerative arthritis and evaluate the residual synovitis by ultrasonography. METHODS: Review the patients who underwent a total wrist arthrodesis in our Hospital between 1999 and 2009, by a comparative and functional study. The study population was divided into two groups: Inflammatory Rheumatic Disease (IRD group) and another that included the remaining cases (RC group). For functional evaluation we used the Buck-Gramcko&Lohman (BGL) Evaluation for Total Wrist Function and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score. Pain levels were measured pre- and postoperatively according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A General Electric P 5 Power Doppler Ultrasound with a high-resolution linear 7 - 12 MHz array was used to identify local synovitis. Mann-Whitney, Wilcoxon and Chi-Square tests were applied for statistical evaluation. p < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: According to the study criteria we selected 38 patients. From these, 7 were treated bilaterally, with a total of 45 total wrist arthrodesis evaluated (IRD group n= 25 vs RC group n= 20). The predominant gender was the female (78. 4 %), the average age at the time of surgery was 50. 0 ± 14. 2 years and the mean postoperative follow-up was 4. 8 ± 2. 6 years. Regarding to the most common surgical indication, on the RC group we had 40 % of post-traumatic arthritis and on the IRD group, 96 % had rheumatoid arthritis. The most frequent surgical technique used on the IRD group was Mannerfelt (52 %) vs AO/ASIF plate osteosynthesis (95 %) on the RC group, Darrach procedure was associated in 37. 8 % of all cases. IRD group presented a greater time for bone union (3. 6 vs 2. 9, p= 0. 228), fewer postoperative complications (12. 0 % vs 35. 0 %, p= 0. 069) and fewer cases of material extraction (20. 0 % vs 25. 0 %, p = 0. 481). There was a lower deficit of pronosupination on the RC group (76 % vs 60 %, p= 0. 204), and this group also presented a better assessment on the DASH score (13. 0 vs. 22. 4, p= 0. 153). 75. 0 % of the RC group had a BGL score with excellent to good results vs 32. 0 % on the IRD group, p = 0. 005. All patients improved their VAS between pre-and postoperatively (8. 0 vs 2. 0 on the IRD group and 6. 5 vs 1. 5 on the RC group, p = 0. 000). After surgery, most patients maintained the previous profession (90 % on the RC vs 56 % on the IRD group, p = 0. 013). The ultrasonographic wrist evaluation of the IRD group revealed local synovitis in 2 cases as also as extensor tenosynovitis of the fingers in other 2 cases. All of these 4 cases were of low intensity and without inflammatory activity identified by power-Doppler signal. CONCLUSION: Although being a retrospective study it allows us {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} wrist arthrodesis, on its various indications, with encouraging functional outcomes and pain relief levels on patients with and without inflammatory rheumatic disease...|$|E

40|$|Background: Mirror {{therapy is}} a {{relatively}} new therapeutic modality, where movement of the unaffected limb is used to facilitate performance of the affected limb. Literature review of clinical studies regarding the effectiveness of mirror therapy in different groups of patients was performed. The review focussed on randomised controlled trials and studies, which explore the underlying mechanisms of mirror therapy. Conclusions: The majority of randomised controlled trials were done in stroke patients. In these, mirror therapy improved the velocity and accuracy of the impaired upper limb movement and sensation. No significant effect was found on spasticity, gait and hand function. The effect of mirror therapy on active range of motion, hand <b>grip,</b> <b>function</b> of the upper limb and reduction of pain intensity was not fully conclusive. For complex regional pain syndrome type I, mirror therapy improved hand <b>grip</b> and <b>function,</b> and reduced pain intensity and hand oedema. There is also evidence that mirror therapy reduces pain in a phantom limb. Most of the reviewed studies included small sample size. Studies on the underlying mechanisms of mirror therapy suggested as more likely the effect of increased forced attention and motor imagery rather than increased activation of mirror neurons in healthy subjects. Probably, the underlying mechanisms of mirror therapy differ in patients with sensory-motor impairments compared to healthy subjects...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the bite}} and {{swallowing}} {{function of a}} snake’s mouth, a robot end‐effector grabbing mechanism was designed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the long-term functional results of microvascular toe-to-thumb reconstruction after trauma. Forty-one patients meeting the inclusion criteria were available for a clinical follow-up study.

According to the questionnaires, most activities were considered easy or quite easy and the majority of the patients (36 / 41) managed with no or minor complaints. Clinical tests showed good recovery of function. Patient satisfaction was high. There were superficial infections in five hands and in six donor feet. In total, 16 late corrective operations were done to eight patients. Microvascular toe transfer is a good option for grip reconstruction after thumb amputation.

40|$|Aims: Studies I & II: To {{describe}} and evaluate postoperative deltoid-triceps protection of tendon elongation and long-term clinical follow-up after tenodesis to the IP joint of the thumb. Study III: To examine {{and explore the}} applicability of the Klein-Bell ADL Scale (KB Scale) in patients with cervical spinal cord injury in terms of daily activities and the association between basic ADL and upper extremity function. Method: Studies I & II data were collected retrospectively. Eleven patients were included in study I. The patients were divided postoperatively into two groups; patients using their manual wheelchair without a special armrest and patients using an electric power driven wheelchair with a special armrest. Stainless steel sutures (markers) were placed proximally and distally of the tendon-to-tendon attachment sites. The distances between markers were measured via upper extremity x-ray to evaluate tendon elongations. Thirtythree patients were included in study II. Extension, flexion and range of motion were measured to evaluate how the tenodesis of the IP joint of the thumb influenced the different movement modalities of the IP joint of the thumb. Study III: Data were collected prospectively. Fifty-five patients were included in the study. Assessments of the patients’ independence were made according to the K-B Scale. Three more analyses were performed; the first analysis was made to examine whether assistive devices and car and house adaptations could influence the patient’s independence. The last two analyses included investigations of whether arm and different <b>grip</b> <b>functions</b> and different <b>grip</b> phases could be detected in the items’ operational criteria. Results: In study I the total distances between markers after reconstruction of deltoid to triceps were significantly lower in the patients using an electric power driven wheelchair with special armrest compared to those without the armrest. The largest difference in tendon elongation between the groups occurred in the proximal tendon transfer. Elbow extension deficit was decreased in the group using the electric power wheelchair with an armrest, although not significantly as compared to those without the armrest. In study II treatment with a thumb splint after tenodesis to the IP joint of the thumb gave a pliable and well balanced IP joint with comparable results in extension, flexion and ROM at six months and 12 months postoperatively. In study III only the raw sum score and not the weight scheme in the K-B scale discriminated the patient’s independence in daily activities (ADL). Assistive devices and car and house adaptations made the patients more independent. Lack of <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> decreased the patient’s ability to become independent. Conclusion: The use of an electric power driven chair with a special armrest and thumb splint has shown that relatively simple adjuncts can positively influence the effectiveness of operations performed. The cooperation between the hand surgeons and the therapist to develop these treatments has been important for improved results in these studies. The K-B Scale can be used to assess basic ADL and can discriminate between cervical SCI patients’ independence in ADL. To become a useful tool, the K-B Scale’s structural properties in conjunction with arm and <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> must be further investigated...|$|R

At present there is no pharmacological treatment that suc-cessfully reverses muscle wasting from catabolic conditions. We hypothesized that acupuncture plus low frequency electric stimulation (Acu-LFES) would mimic the impact of exercise and prevent diabetes-induced muscle loss. Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce diabetes in mice. The mice were then treated with Acu-LFES for 15 minutes daily for 14 days. Acupuncture points were selected according to the WHO Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature guide.

40|$|Benefits of {{exercise}} on nerve regeneration and functional recovery {{have been reported}} in both central and peripheral nervous system disease models. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of enhanced regeneration and improved functional outcomes are less understood. We used a peripheral nerve regeneration model that has a good correlation between functional outcomes and number of motor axons that regenerate to evaluate the impact of treadmill exercise. In this model, the median nerve was transected and repaired while the ulnar nerve was transected and prevented from regeneration. Daily treadmill exercise resulted in faster recovery of the forelimb <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> as evaluated by grip power and inverted holding test. Daily exercise also resulted in better regeneration as evaluated by recovery of compound motor action potentials, higher number of axons in the median nerve and larger myofiber size in target muscles. Furthermore, these observations correlated with higher levels of neurotrophic factors, glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), in serum, nerve and muscle suggesting that increase in muscle derived neurotrophic factors may be responsible for improved regeneration...|$|R
40|$|During Drosophila embryogenesis, {{developing}} muscles extend growth-cone–like {{structures to}} navigate toward specific epidermal attachment sites. Here, {{we show that}} the homolog of Glutamate Receptor–Interacting Proteins (DGrip) acts as {{a key component of}} proper muscle guidance. Mutations in dgrip impair patterning of ventral longitudinal muscles (VLMs), whereas lateral transverse muscles (LTMs) that attach to intrasegmental attachment sites develop normally. Myoblast fusion, stabilization of muscle contacts, and general muscle function are not impaired in the absence of DGrip. Instead, the proper formation of cellular extensions during guidance fails in dgrip mutant VLMs. DGrip protein concentrates at the ends of VLMs while these muscles guide toward segment border attachment sites. Conversely, LTMs overexpressing DGrip form ectopic cellular extensions that can cause attachment of these muscles to other muscles at segment borders. Our data suggest that DGrip participates in the reception of an attractive signal that emanates from the epidermal attachment sites to direct the motility of developing muscles. This dgrip phenotype should be valuable to study mechanistic principles of <b>Grip</b> <b>function...</b>|$|R

Results showed that, in physiological conditions, the <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> {{controlled by the}} median nerve in BALB-neuT mice was similar to wild-type (BALB/c). Stereological assessment of ErbB 2 -overexpressing intact nerves revealed no difference in number and size of myelinated fibers compared to wild-type mice. By contrast, after a nerve crush injury, the motor recovery was significantly faster in BALB-neuT compared to BALB/c mice. Moreover, stereological assessment revealed a significant higher number of regenerated myelinated fibers with a thinner axon and fiber diameter and myelin thickness in BALB-neuT mice. At day- 2 post-injury, {{the level of the}} mRNAs coding for all the ErbB receptors and for the transmembrane (type III) Neuregulin 1 (NRG 1) isoforms significantly decreased in both BALB/c and BALB-neuT mice, as shown by quantitative real time PCR. On the other hand, the level of the mRNAs coding for soluble NRG 1 isoforms (type I/II, alpha and beta) increased at the same post-traumatic time point though, intriguingly, this response was significantly higher in BALB-neuT mice with respect to BALB/c mice. Altogether, these results suggest that constitutive ErbB 2 receptor over-expression does not influence the physiological development of peripheral nerves, while it improve...|$|R
