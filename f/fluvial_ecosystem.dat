50|$|Dams and diversions {{alter the}} natural hydrologic regime of rivers, with {{widespread}} effects that alter the watershed ecosystem. Since alluvial river morphology and <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> processes are largely {{shaped by the}} complex interplay of hydrograph components such as the magnitude, frequency, duration, timing, and rate of change of flow, any change {{in one of these}} components can be associated with a tangible alteration of the ecosystem. Dams are often associated with reduced wet season flood magnitudes and altered (oftentimes reduced) dry season baseflow. This can negatively affect aquatic organisms that are specifically evolved to natural flow conditions. By altering the natural hydrograph components, particularly reducing flow magnitudes, dams and other diversions reduce the river’s ability to mobilize sediment, resulting in sediment-choked channels. Conversely, dams are a physical barrier to the naturally continuous movement of sediment from headwaters to the river mouth, and can create sediment deficient conditions and incision directly downstream.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the ability of}} ecohydraulics to improve {{the understanding of the}} <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> dynamics and the assessment of the aquatic habitat {{in the context of the}} conservation and restoration of lotic hydrosystems. The high-resolution analytical framework used in ecohydraulics to describe the conditions of the fluvial microhabitat, and its complementarity with ecohydrological techniques, suggests the justifiable recommendations that will be more completely scrutinized in the river restoration projects. The paper summarizes the procedure for the ecohydraulic evaluation of the fluvial microhabitat using temporal and spatial scales, whose results are interpreted in studies of instream flows, fluvial habitat enhancement, and river restoration. The described protocol for the multidimensional fluvial characterization permits the detailed modeling of the micro-hydraulic environment that is perceived by aquatic organisms and conditions heir behavior. This work summarizes the valuable potential of the scientific tools that ecohydraulics offers for the advanced analysis of the <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> and the design of measures for the conservation and rehabilitation of Colombian rivers. The ecohydraulic index that assesses the global quality of the aquatic microhabitat can efficiently incorporate the ecological considerations in water resource management and in the design of intervention in the rivers.

Biofilms and suspended aggregates represent major aquatic microbial lifestyles whose relative importance changes predictably through fluvial networks.

We traced 13 C and 15 N retention within biofilm and suspended aggregate biomass and its mineralization. Organomineral complexation restricted C and N retention within biofilms and aggregates and also their mineralization. This reduced the efficiency with which biofilms mineralize C and N by 30 % and 6 %. By contrast, organominerals reduced the C and N mineralization efficiency of suspended aggregates by 41 % and 93 %.

40|$|Streamflow {{variability}} {{is a major}} {{determinant of}} basin-scale distributions of benthic invertebrates. Here we present a novel procedure based on a probabilistic approach aiming at a spatially explicit quantitative assessment of benthic invertebrate abundance as derived from near-bed flow variability. Although the proposed approach neglects ecological determinants other than hydraulic ones, it is nevertheless relevant in view of its implications on the predictability of basin-scale patterns of organisms. In the present context, aquatic invertebrates are considered, given that they are widely employed as sensitive indicators of <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> health and human-induced perturbations. Moving from the analytical characterization of site-specific probability distribution functions of streamflow and bottom shear stress, we achieve a spatial extension to an entire stream network. Bottom shear stress distributions, coupled with habitat suitability curves derived from field studies, are used to produce maps of invertebrate suitability to shear stress conditions. Therefore, the proposed framework allows one to inspect the possible impacts on river ecology of human-induced perturbations of streamflow variability. We apply this framework to an Austrian river network for which rainfall and streamflow time series, river network hydraulic properties, and local information on invertebrate abundance for a limited number of sites are available. A comparison between observed species density versus modeled suitability to shear stress is also presented. Although the proposed strategy focuses on a single controlling factor and thus represents an ecological minimal model, it allows derivation of important implications for water resource management and <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> protection.

Impacts in water and habitat quality, flow regime and biotic interactions can be considered the main factors responsible {{for the lack of}} bio-tic integrity in Mediterranean rivers. Dams and impoundments alter drastically the physical habitat structure and the ecological functioning of running waters. But at the same time also modify the flow regime.

Approximately {{one half of}} terrestrial carbon runoff is processed by inland waters and released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO 2) prior to reaching the oceans, and bacterial consumption of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) comprises a dominant proportion of this carbon loss. Though peatlands export more DOC per area than most other ecosystems, the sources and biodegradability of peatland DOC and their effects on downstream DOC loads and fluxes are poorly understood. Moreover, photochemical degradation {{plays an important role}} in the loss of carbon from aquatic ecosystems, especially in peatlands with high DOC concentrations rich in photochemically reactive humic and phenolic compounds, but its contribution to global CO 2 evasion from inland waters has not been quantified. This dissertation focuses on predictors of biodegradable DOC (BDOC) in aquatic ecosystems, the sources and biodegradability of DOC in peatland watersheds, and the contribution of photochemical degradation of DOC to global CO 2 evasion from peatlands and <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Key findings from these studies were that SUVA, a measurement broadly used in ecology and environmental engineering and fairly simple to obtain, is an excellent predictor of the amount of long-term BDOC concentrations in Minnesota lake ecosystems. The peatland bog may be the most important source of BDOC exported from peatlands annually, rather than the upland.

40|$|Preface: Assessment of {{physical}} habitat characteristics in rivers, implications for river ecology and management Physical habitat characteristics are {{an extremely important}} factors determining the structure and composition of fluvial biological communities and <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem</b> functioning. Existing methods for characterising the physical realm of river habitats are increasingly important, not only for monitoring river ecosystem health {{and the success of}} river restoration projects but also for increasing the understanding of river ecosystem functioning and improving the efficiency of management actions. However, there is no scientific consensus on which methods to use for long-term monitoring and which river features to monitor because many fundamental questions relating hydrological, geomorphological and biological characteristics remain unanswered and because river habitats are monitored to cover a wide variety of objectives. Several initiatives worldwide have demonstrated the importance of analysing and discussing the application of different methods to assess river habitat characteristics for different objectives. It would be interesting to achieve a common approach for river habitat characterization for different objectives, especially for mid- to long- term monitoring programs and different river management issues (e. g., monitoring river restoration projects). More elusive but no less important is the contribution of these methods to understanding the interactions between river habitat architecture and river functioning.

In this study we assess the chronic effect of sediment yield on fish communities at 104 river sites located in two different sub-catchments ? the Bembézar and Guadajoz rivers ? both with different lithological composition and erosion rates. Sediment yield was estimated using a semi-quantitative Factorial Score Model (FSM), developed specifically for Spanish rivers. The fish populations of both basins were evaluated in composition and abundances by the study of Fernández-Delgado et al., 2014. The influence of sediment yield on the fish community was analyzed using General Additive Models. The sediment yield was higher in the Guadajoz basin (921 T/Km 2 per year) than in Bembézar (701 T/Km 2 per year). In the former, fish communities were poorer in both fish density and diversity, with Luciobarbus sclateri as the only substantially present species and {{a significant relationship between}} sediment yield and load, and fish density.

Improving {{the understanding of}} ecological responses to river management actions is a key issue for assuring sustainable water management. However, {{few studies have been}} published where ecological metrics have been quantified in response to various degrees of flow alteration. In this work, changes in natural distribution of trees and shrubs within the riparian corridor (as indicator of the ecological status of the <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem)</b> were quantified at multiple sites along a flow alteration gradient (as indicator of impact) along two regulated river reaches, one Boreal and the other Mediterranean, each downstream of a dam. Based on the obtained relationships we evaluated differences in response trends related to local physico-climatic factors of the two biomes and regarding to differing life-forms. Woody vegetation establishment patterns represented objective indicators of ecological responses to flow alteration. We found different responses between life-forms. Both trees and shrubs migrated downwards to the channel after dam closure, but shrubs were most impacted under higher degrees of flow alteration in terms of lateral movement. In addition, our results show clear longitudinal recovery trends of natural patterns of tree and shrub distribution corresponding to a decrease in intensity of hydrologic alteration in the Boreal river. However, vegetation encroachment persisted along the entire Mediterranean study reach. This may result from a relatively low gradient of decrease of hydrologic alteration with distance from the dam, coupled with other overlapping pressures and the mediating effect of physico-climatic characteristics on vegetation responses...|$|E

In the water, the transformation to methylmercury takes place mostly by {{the action of}} microorganisms. The formation of methylmercury increases the dispersion and bioavailability of the element in the aquatic environment. Methylmercury can be assimilated by plankton and enters the food chain. The concentration of mercury increases further up in the trophic levels of the chain and reaches the highest values in carnivorous fishes like tucunare. Therefore, mercury emissions cause the contamination of natural resources and increase risks to the health of regular fish consumers.

There is abundant evidence that these changes affect stream communities. Fewer studies, however, have examined the influence of WWTP inputs on the hydrologic and nutrient availability regimes. Yet, shifts in these regimes can have clear implications for the stream ecosystem function. This knowledge is of critical relevance for stream management as it provides insights on integrative properties of trophic state, energy transfer, and material cycling at the ecosystem level. WWTP effects on fluvial ecosystems are expected to become more exacerbated under water scarcity conditions, which are characteristic of arid and semiarid regions such as the Mediterranean region. Under these conditions, streams receiving point source inputs may turn into islands of permanent flow within a highly intermittent fluvial network. This has implications not only locally at the reach scale but also at the catchment scale. Within this context, both plant operation and fluvial management may be critical to preserve the ecological integrity of these aquatic ecosystems {{at the same time}} that a balance is met with societal demand for high quality water resources. This chapter aims to review current knowledge on this topic, with major emphasis on nutrient loads and in-stream nutrient retention, and to discuss its implications within the context of actual and future scenarios of water scarcity conditions.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the fish}} bypass at the Danubehydropower station Wien/Freudenau the {{functioning}} as migration facility has been classified as functional after construction in 1997. The importance of habitat {{support for the}} lifecycles of Danube fish species becomes clearly visible in times when degraded, impounded, current speed reduced section of the river are dominating the <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> Central parts of impounded areas are not supporting all the needs of riverine fish: Gravel-spawning grounds, suitable flow velocity and diverse 0 + fish habitats are missing. Upper most part of impoundments, tributaries and artificial rivers, like fish bypass systems, can function as essentially needed last habitats. The fish bypass system of Wien/Freudenau has a length of 1. 6 km and a discharge of at least 1. 5 m³. 2 / 3 of the system has been constructed as a near-natural circumvention stream and 1 / 3 as a nature-like pool pass. After 15 years of operation it becomes clearly visible that fish use the bypass system as spawning ground extensively and therefore it can make an important contribution {{for the maintenance of}} several endangered species, like the nase (Chondrostoma nasus) and the barbel (Barbus barbus). In the present study a monitoring was conducted throughout a year. Seasonal changes in abundances, species diversity and spawning events were observed. A total of 35 species colonize the bypass with temporary and spatial fluctuations. In early spring (February and March), the indicator species of the free flowing Danube, nase and barbel, migrated into the fish pass in very high quantities. After spawning in April and May the adults disappeared and a few weeks later thousands of young-of-theyear were observed. The present data show, that the chosen natural like solution of a bypass system serves in contrast to a hard technical construction, - additionally to its migration function - like a Danube tributary of the grayling zone. 23 species of young-of-theyear fish classes’ inhabited the system in 2014. Some of them have been proved in larval stages by barcoding...|$|E
40|$|River systems {{maintain}} unique {{biotic resources}} and provide essential renewable water supplies for humankind. Flood pulses {{are the key}} natural drivers of species richness and productivity of the large river-floodplain ecosystems, but traditional water management has sought to reduce the natural variability of river flows to achieve more stable water supplies for socio-economic water needs. The increasing human pressure on river systems directly threatens the biodiversity of <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystems</b> across the world. Ecologically sustainable river management is aimed at maintaining the ecological integrity of the affected ecosystems while meeting the intergenerational human needs and sustaining the full array of other goods and services provided by natural river ecosystems. Several criteria of ecologically sustainable water management are outlined, such as {{the assessment of the}} reference status, the documentation of the deficiencies of the baseline conditions, the identification of the causes of ecosystem degradation using the DPSIR framework, the analysis of the compatibility of water needs, the definition of the target vision, etc...|$|R
40|$|Groundwater {{recharge}} {{assessment of}} karst aquifers, at various {{spatial and temporal}} scales, is a major scientific topic of current importance, since these aquifers play an essential role for both socio-economic development and <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> In this study, groundwater recharge was estimated at local and episodic scales in a representative perched karst aquifer in a region of southern Italy with a Mediterranean climate. The research utilized measurements of precipitation, air temperature, soil water content, and water-table depth, obtained in 2008 at the Acqua della Madonna test area (Terminio Mount karst aquifer, Campania region). At this location the aquifer is overlain by ash-fall pyroclastic soils. The Episodic Master Recession (EMR) method, an improved version of the Water Table Fluctuation (WTF) method, was applied to estimate the amount of recharge generated episodically by individual rainfall events. The method also quantifies the amount of precipitation generating each recharge episode, thus permitting calculation of the Recharge to the Precipitation Ratio (RPR) on a storm-by-storm basis. Depending on the seasonally varying air temperature, evapotranspiration, and precipitation patterns, calculated values of RPR varied between 35...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date:Riparian {{areas are}} an {{integral}} component of <b>fluvial</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> The management of Oregon's riparian areas has come under greater scrutiny since that latest revision of the Oregon Forest Practices Act (1994). Many riparian areas lie within forested areas. Riparian management issues such as anadromous fish population decline and large woody debris insertion and removal have fueled the debate over proper management in recent decades. In New Zealand, conversely, {{there has been little}} concern about the influence of commercial timber plantations on riparian areas. The shift toward a global forest economy and increased competition of New Zealand's timber export market led the leading Radiata pine plantation companies to take the first step toward Environmental Management Systems, including voluntary best management practices in riparian areas. With this pro-active approach, New Zealand's forestry entered a new era of regulations supervised by the local authorities. To facilitate my understanding of the differences in riparian zone management between Oregon and New Zealand, I examined forest policies, management systems, and the history of management within riparian areas...|$|R
