Spacey's mother, Kathleen Fowler, died of brain cancer just before production started. [...] "I made the movie for all mothers, but especially for my mother. She introduced me to Bobby Darin. When she got very ill in 2002, I stopped everything {{and took care of}} her. We constantly played Bobby Darin records, and I'd let her listen to the tracks I was recording. I'm <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> passed knowing this was the movie I was going to make." [...] After his award-winning performances in The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, Spacey [...] "chose to move away from dark, sarcastic characters, and instead play damaged but good-hearted men" [...] in films like Pay It Forward, K-PAX and The Shipping News. The actor was criticized for his career move; Spacey acknowledged the similarities when Darin integrated into folk music and protest songs.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the films}} are presumed lost, the {{synopsis}} of both film survive in The Moving Picture World from December 10, 1910. The plot of The Girls He Left Behind Him follows Jack Redfern, a young bachelor, who is {{soon to be}} married. Jack receives a letter in feminine handwriting from an [...] "old sweetheart" [...] of his, stating how <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> is to hear of his approaching marriage. Jack goes through visions, remembering the various girls {{of his life and}} his interactions with each of them. Betty, Kate, Tootsie, Elizabeth, Clara, Jeanette, and Helen. According to the synopsis, the last vision he has is of all the old sweethearts of his waving good luck to him as he marries Mary. Though a review states that he awakes and is obliged to hurry to his wedding. Bowers believes the synopsis to be in error and that the film actually concluded with all the girls present at the wedding, rather than it being a [...] "vision".|$|E
500|$|Prior to Carey signing {{her record}} deal with Columbia, she and Margulies had written and {{produced}} fourteen songs {{over a three-year}} period, seven of which made the final track listing of her self-titled debut studio album (1990), including [...] "Someday". [...] "Someday" [...] {{was one of the}} four songs which were on the demo tape handed to Mottola prior to her signing the contract. Carey explained the process behind the song's conception, saying that Margulies would play different notes on an electric keyboard with Carey directing him on chord changes, and provided the lyrics, chorus and melody. Producer Ric Wake later recalled that [...] "Someday" [...] was his favorite song from the beginning of recording sessions for the album, saying [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> called me." ...|$|E

500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. When she read the script, she was <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko {{said she had to}} do [...] "training non-stop from the morning to the evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was easy for her because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard". When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she was <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When Carey {{worked with}} Walden on [...] "I Don't Wanna Cry", {{they worked on}} several other songs. Together, they decided to [...] "slow down the tempo" [...] and create a [...] "crying type of ballad," [...] one which {{according}} to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted {{how much of a}} perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct [...] "one line" [...] that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, [...] "Someday" [...] became Wake's favorite from the start, [...] "I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said 'I'd love to do it {{if you want to do}} it.' It was great, I'm <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> called me." [...] During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In [...] "All in Your Mind", Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice [...] "split" [...] while doing those ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song's recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.|$|E

2500|$|Mrs. Ann Bowles and Mrs. Clara Phelps are Mildred's {{friends and}} {{representative}} of the anti-intellectual, hedonistic society presented in the novel. During a social visit to Montag's house, they brag about ignoring the bad things {{in their lives and}} have a cavalier attitude towards the upcoming war, their husbands, their children, and politics. Mrs. Phelps' husband Pete was called in to fight in the upcoming war (and believes that he'll be back in a week because of how quick the war will be) and thinks having children serves no purpose other than to ruin lives. Mrs. Bowles is a thrice married, single mother. Her first husband divorced her, her second died in a jet accident, and her third committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. She has two children who do not like or respect her due to her permissive, often negligent and abusive parenting; Mrs. Bowles brags that her kids beat her up, and she's <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> can hit back. When Montag reads Dover Beach to them, he strikes a chord in Mrs. Phelps, who starts crying over how hollow her life is. Mrs. Bowles chastises Montag for reading [...] "silly awful hurting words".|$|E
2500|$|Britten and Bird {{go to see}} Sam at his home; {{he claims}} {{that he was trying}} to find out about his father, who had cancer. Britten asks how tall he was; outside, Bird asks for an {{explanation}} and Britten tries to spin a story about a small window at the clinic that someone could have crawled through to poison MacKenzie. His partner warns Britten that coming up with theories and looking for evidence to fit is not standard procedure. That night, Rex and Cole work on their motorbike. Later, in the [...] "red reality", Hannah tells Britten that she opened the package and was <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> did. She tells her husband about the motorcycle, and how the boys would claim they were going to the beach when they went off to work on it. At the station, Vega tells Britten that they have a new case; however, he insists on sticking with the MacKenzie shooting and checks photos of short criminals. The homeless man comes in and offers more information in return for lunch. The partners start arguing, and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) calls Britten into her office. Soon after, Britten asks Vega if he wants to lead a new case.|$|E
