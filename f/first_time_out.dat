25|$|In Europe, {{and back}} to full racing fitness in 1953, Fangio rejoined Maserati for the {{championship}} season, and against the dominant Ferraris led by Ascari he took a lucky win at Monza. Fangio qualified second with Bonetto seventh, and Fangio set fastest lap {{on his way to}} a 1.4-second victory over Nino Farina while Bonetto retired out of fuel. Along with that win, Fangio secured three second places to finish second in the Championship, and also came third <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>out</b> in the Targa Florio. He ended 1953 by winning the dauntingly dangerous and difficult 2,000mi (3,200km) Carrera Panamericana in Mexico driving a Lancia D24; Fangio was able to win this 5-day open public road rally that started at the Mexico-Guatemala border and ended at the Mexico-United States border in record time- about 18 and a half hours total driving time.|$|E
25|$|However, for the {{endurance}} races and the Australian Grand Prix support races, Perkins Engineering picked up significant sponsorship from Bob Jane T-Marts, {{and the car}} was painted yellow and blue, the colours of the T-Marts. Driving with Steve Harrington, Perkins proved there was life in the older model VL Commodore which won <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>out</b> in Bob Jane colours at the 1992 Don't Drink Drive Sandown 500 after a late race battle with the BMW M3 Evolution of Tony Longhurst and Paul Morris. Perkins then sensationally put the Commodore onto the front row for the 1992 Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst, but alternator and tyre problems in the rainstorms that marred the race (and eventually caused its early finish) saw them eventually finish in 9th place. While driving the older VL, Perkins also pointed out during the top ten runoff at Bathurst that the only 'old' thing about the car was its superseded body shape. The speed of the Perkins VL at Bathurst {{raised questions about the}} legality of the car, though {{it should be noted that}} Perkins' qualifying time of 2:14.08 was only 0.74 seconds faster than he had qualified in 1990. Also, in that same time period other cars such as the Sierra's and the 4WD, twin-turbo Nissan GTR had also improved their own lap times at Bathurst by around 2–3 seconds per lap.|$|E

He started 6/1 second favourite behind the Doncaster Cup winner Boreas with the other runners including Persian Punch, Bangalore and Hugs Dancer (Ebor Handicap). After racing in third place he took the lead approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by two and a half lengths and a neck from Pole Star and Kasthari. Dettori, who was contracted to ride Mamool in the season's major staying events said of the winner [...] "I like him a lot.

2500|$|In 1989 Barnard {{pioneered the}} {{electronic}} gear shift mechanism – {{now known as}} a semi-automatic gearbox – which was operated via two paddles on the steering wheel. This revolutionary system had proved fragile in testing since early in 1988 and many in F1 were expecting it to fail. However, new team recruit Nigel Mansell took the new V12 powered Ferrari 640 to victory <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>out</b> at the Brazilian Grand Prix in Rio de Janeiro. Barnard had instigated his second technical revolution, and by [...] every team was running {{a copy of the}} Ferrari gearbox. This would unfortunately be the only finish recorded by either Mansell or Berger until Round 7 when Mansell finished second in the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard. The new gearbox had been the cause of many DNF's for the team but {{by the time they got}} to France the problems had been solved (not enough power from the battery that powered the electronic gearbox) and the semi-automatic gearbox started to show its advantages.|$|E

[...] David Jeffries of AllMusic, who had also reviewed The New Classic, gave it three and a half out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, Reclassified is a better effort than The New Classic and offers more bang for the buck, but this [...] "release it until you get it right" [...] blueprint is concerning for consumers, who now have a choice between rebuying it all or seeking out the new numbers on their own." ...|$|E

60|$|A young man, named Giovanni Guasconti, came, {{very long}} ago, {{from the more}} {{southern}} region of Italy, to pursue his studies at the University of Padua. Giovanni, who had but a scanty supply of gold ducats in his pocket, took lodgings in a high and gloomy chamber of an old edifice which looked not unworthy {{to have been the}} palace of a Paduan noble, and which, in fact, exhibited over its entrance the armorial bearings of a family long since extinct. The young stranger, who was not unstudied in the great poem of his country, recollected that one of the ancestors of this family, and perhaps an occupant of this very mansion, had been pictured by Dante as a partaker of the immortal agonies of his Inferno. These reminiscences and associations, together with the tendency to heartbreak natural to a young man for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>out</b> of his native sphere, caused Giovanni to sigh heavily as he looked around the desolate and ill-furnished apartment.|$|E

60|$|I was {{too weak}} to move, to speak, to open my eyes, to exert in the {{smallest}} degree any one faculty, bodily or mental, that I possessed. The first sense of which I regained the use, was the sense of hearing; and the first sound that I recognised, was of a light footstep which mysteriously approached, paused, and then retired again gently outside my door. The hearing of this sound was my first pleasure, the waiting for its repetition my first source of happy expectation, since I had been ill. Once more the footsteps approached--paused a moment--then seemed to retire as before--then returned slowly. A sigh, very faint and trembling; a whisper of which I could not yet distinguish the import, caught my ear--and after that, there was silence. Still I waited (oh, how happily and calmly!) to hear the whisper soon repeated, and to hear it better when it next came. Ere long, for the third time, the footsteps advanced, and the whispering accents sounded again. I could now hear that they pronounced my name--once, twice, three times--very softly and imploringly, as if to beg the answer which I was still too weak to give. But I knew the voice: I knew it was Clara's. Long after it had ceased, the whisper lingered gently on my ear, like a lullaby that alternately soothed me to slumber, and welcomed me to wakefulness. It seemed to be thrilling through my frame with a tender, reviving influence--the same influence which the sunshine had, weeks afterwards, when I enjoyed it for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>out</b> of doors.|$|E
