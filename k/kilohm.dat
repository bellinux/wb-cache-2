25|$|The ohm (symbol: Ω) is the SI unit of {{electrical}} resistance, named after Georg Simon Ohm. An ohm {{is equivalent to}} a volt per ampere. Since resistors are specified and manufactured over a very large range of values, the derived units of milliohm (1 mΩ = 10−3 Ω), <b>kilohm</b> (1 kΩ = 103 Ω), and megohm (1 MΩ = 106 Ω) are also in common usage.|$|E

40|$|A {{detector}} {{which features}} a low-barrier Si Schottky diode is discussed. The unbiased diode has a sensitivity of - 60 dBm {{and a range of}} 50 dB at 95 GHz, and fixed tuning yields a sensitivity within 2 dB from 75 - 110 GHz. A limitation of the low-barrier diode is a reduction in the low-level sensitivity by 16 dB under a 100 <b>kilohms</b> load. Use of the diode with a video impedance of 120 <b>kilohms</b> enables the offset voltage to be nulled with an appropriate control. Operation of the diode in a waveguide mount for use as a mixer is described, along with detector rectification...|$|R

50|$|One {{remaining}} use for crystal earpieces is {{in crystal}} radios. Their very high sensitivity {{enables them to}} use the very weak signals produced by crystal radios, and their high impedance (on the order of 20 <b>kilohms)</b> is a good match for the typical crystal radio. They have also been used as microphones, with their high output requiring less amplification.|$|R
50|$|In a cathode {{follower}} or common-plate configuration, the output {{is taken from}} the cathode resistance. Because of negative feedback (the cathode-ground voltage cancels the grid-ground voltage) the voltage gain is close to unity and the output voltage follows the grid voltage. Although the cathode resistor can be many <b>kilohms</b> (depending on biasing requirements), the small-signal output impedance is very low (see operational amplifier).|$|R

50|$|The {{value of}} R1 {{would depend on}} the JFET or triode chosen, and perhaps be a 200 <b>kilohm</b> preset, {{adjusted}} to give lowest distortion in the output signal. The time constant of C2 with R1 would be chosen to fall somewhere between the highest audio (modulation) frequency but well below the lowest carrier (modulated) frequency encountered. The RF filter in the supply line, C4 and the RFC (RF Choke), is less essential than in the original plate detector, but can reduce inter-stage RF interference and instability.|$|E
50|$|Magnitudes. In typical applications, {{both the}} {{inductance}} and {{the resistance of}} the gyrator are much greater than that of a physical inductor. Gyrators can be used to create inductors from the microhenry range up to the megahenry range. Physical inductors are typically limited to tens of henries, and have parasitic series resistances from hundreds of microhms through the low <b>kilohm</b> range. The parasitic resistance of a gyrator depends on the topology, but with the topology shown, series resistances will typically range from tens of ohms through hundreds of kilohms.|$|E

[...] Resistors {{are not only}} specified with a maximum power dissipation, but also for a maximum voltage drop. [...] Exceeding this voltage causes the resistor to degrade slowly reducing in resistance. [...] The voltage dropped across large value resistors can be exceeded before the power dissipation reaches its limiting value.

50|$|The {{titanium}} O2 sensor {{was used}} throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s on a limited basis. This sensor’s semiconductor construction makes its operation {{different from that of}} the zirconia O2 sensor. Instead of generating its own voltage, the titanium O2 sensor’s electrical resistance changes according to the exhaust oxygen content. When the air/fuel ratio is rich, the resistance of the sensor is around 950 ohms and more than 21 <b>kilohms</b> when the mixture is lean. As with the zirconia sensor, the titanium O2 sensor is also considered a narrow-band O2 sensor.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} non-ideal {{current source}} {{consists of a}} voltage source in series with a resistor. The amount of current available from such a source is given by {{the ratio of the}} voltage across the voltage source to the resistance of the resistor (Ohm's law; I = V/R). This value of current will only be delivered to a load with zero voltage drop across its terminals (a short circuit, an uncharged capacitor, a charged inductor, a virtual ground circuit, etc.) The current delivered to a load with nonzero voltage (drop) across its terminals (a linear or nonlinear resistor with a finite resistance, a charged capacitor, an uncharged inductor, a voltage source, etc.) will always be different. It is given by the ratio of the voltage drop across the resistor (the difference between the exciting voltage and the voltage across the load) to its resistance. For a nearly ideal current source, the value of the resistor should be very large but this implies that, for a specified current, the voltage source must be very large (in the limit as the resistance and the voltage go to infinity, the current source will become ideal and the current will not depend at all on the voltage across the load). Thus, efficiency is low (due to power loss in the resistor) and it is usually impractical to construct a 'good' current source this way. Nonetheless, it is often the case that such a circuit will provide adequate performance when the specified current and load resistance are small. For example, a 5 V voltage source in series with a 4.7 <b>kilohm</b> resistor will provide an approximately constant current of 1 mA ± 5% to a load resistance in the range of 50 to 450 ohm.|$|E

40|$|Metal oxide gas sensors exhibit {{resistance}} values varying {{over a wide}} range, from tens of <b>kilohms</b> to tens of gigohms, {{depending on}} the chosen oxide and on the excitation parameters (voltage, temperature, gas exposure). Resistance-to-time converters (RTC) are widely used as electronic interfaces for such sensors, thanks to the low-cost, low-noise and high-range characteristics. RTC main limit is in the variable and long measuring time, ranging from microseconds (tens of <b>kilohms)</b> to several seconds (tens of gigohms), impeding a fine analysis of fast transients. This work proposes a new approach based on combination of the RTC method with a new technique based on the least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The implemented prototype allows the sensor resistance to be estimated with a fixed measuring time of 10 ms over the range 10 kOhm – 10 GOhm with relative estimation error below 10 % (below 1 % in the range 47 kOhm – 2 GOhm). It can furthermore estimate the parasitic capacitance of the sensor (in parallel with the resistive component), {{on the order of}} few picofarads with a linearity error less than 0. 5 % full scale (FS). Fast thermal transients of a SnO 2 nanowire sensor have been finely analyzed using the new interface system, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed method for accurate analysis of new experimental resistive sensors...|$|R

In addition, the parallel capacitance (up to 50 pF) can be estimated. The circuit, which does not need any initial calibration, is very simple and compact and is suitable to be integrated with a standard CMOS technology to obtain a low-cost and low-power device for a sensor array interface. Different kinds of postlayout simulations concerning the CMOS integrated implementation have been conducted.

The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by signal noise, and then a compensation of the 6 dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins of an NE592 video amplifier. A surprisingly flat characteristic is obtained. If the PIN diode is equipped with 3 kΩ working resistor to operate in flat band mode, the range is reduced to about 30% due to thermal noise from the 3 kΩ resistor.|$|R

40|$|Glass microelectrodes {{filled with}} 3 molar KCl {{are widely used}} to measure {{intracellular}} potentials and it is usual to try to minimize their electrolyte loss. In these experiments we have used the ionic leak of our microelectrodes, filled with various salt solutions, to introduce a given ion into the red beet vacuole. This allowed us to show that NO 3 − ions reduce {{the magnitude of the}} current spectral density while they do not change the resistance of the tonoplast. This is true when NO 3 − is either added to the external medium or used as the microelectrode filling solution. This can be interpreted by a NO 3 − effect on the vacuolar side of the tonoplast, resulting in an inhibition of the ion transporting ATPase. Replacing K+ by Na+ ions in the medium has no effect on tonoplast resistance (Rs). On the contrary, when ions leaking from the microelectrode are H+, Li+ or K+, Rs is close to 4 <b>kilohm</b> square centimeter, whereas Rs is of the order of 30 KΩ square centimeter when Na+ are the leaking ions. We also found a possible correlation between the presence of a Lorentzian in the current spectral density (cut-off frequency = 2 hertz) and a Cl− efflux from the vacuole. This could be explained by the existence of Cl− channels on the tonoplast...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for the {{fabrication}} of a thermoelectric generator using a rapid, lithography-less technique performed under ambient conditions and called laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT). LIFT is a laser-assisted method {{that has been}} employed for the transfer of materials such as metals, semiconductors, liquids and dielectrics. A part of a thin film (donor) previously coated onto a transparent carrier substrate is transferred onto a nearby receiver by the explosive expansion of {{a small part of}} the donor volume transformed on absorption of a laser pulse. Thereby donor and receiver do not necessarily need to match their lattice or thermal parameters. To demonstrate the capability of LIFT-printing, a thermoelectric generator consisting of staggered p- and n-type doped pads was fabricated by transferring layers of Bi 2 Te 3 and Bi 0. 5 Sb 1. 5 Te 3 consecutively onto a glass receiver pre-coated with a thin polydimethylsiloxane polymer film. For a single pair of the generator elements, the thermoelectric voltage per unit degree temperature difference was determined to be > 90 µV/K. The resistance of a thermoelectric leg pair was in the order of 10 <b>kilohm.</b> The performance was compared to that of thermoelectric generators fabricated both with conventional methods and with devices fabricated with different designs using LIFT.
