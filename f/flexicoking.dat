50|$|There {{are other}} {{petroleum}} refining processes for producing petroleum coke, namely the Fluid Coking and <b>Flexicoking</b> processes {{both of which}} were developed and are licensed by ExxonMobil Research and Engineering. The first commercial unit went into operation in 1955. Forty-three years later, as of 1998, there were 18 of these units operating worldwide of which 6 were in the United States.|$|E
40|$|The {{recently}} commercialized <b>FLEXICOKING</b> Process has {{a significant}} {{role to play in}} developing, known heavy oil reserves. The process upgrades virtually any pumpable feed including residual, pitch or total crude. Combined with HYDROFINING, it produces a clean product slate composed of low Btu gas, high Btu gas, LPG, naphtha, distillate and gas oil. The low Btu gas falls within the definition of an "Alternate Fuel" under current legislation (PL 95 - 620). Originally developed for refinery bottoms conversion, the <b>FLEXICOKING</b> process can also be used as the primary technology for Stand Alone Energy Centers upgrading low quality, high metals, heavy crudes. These efficient energy centers can be located either at a heavy oil production field or integrated with an energy-intensive industrial complex...|$|E
40|$|Refinery thermal {{processes}} are diffused {{all over the}} world, because of their relatively simple configuration and operating flexibility compared to catalytic processes. In particular Delayed Coking is coherent with the growing demand for transportation fuels, more stringent legislation and the opportunity for significant improvement in refinery profit margins. The coking capacity has in fact increased by about 50 million tons from 1999 to 2005 (Valyavin et al., 2007). The development of extended kinetic models can help to accurately describe these processes (characterised by liquid phase pyrolysis) and can be useful for their better description. Such modeling tools are also convenient supports for the production planning, the optimisation {{of the process and}} the operator training. This paper present a detailed, mechanistic model of Delayed Coking process and some results compared with experimental data. Moreover a first approach to fluid- and <b>flexicoking</b> modeling is presented...|$|E
