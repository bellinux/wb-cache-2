5|$|In late April 2013 Earl Cossey, {{the owner}} of the skydiving school that {{furnished}} the four parachutes given to Cooper, was found dead in his home in Woodinville, a suburb of Seattle. His death was ruled a homicide due to blunt-force trauma to the head. The perpetrator remains unknown. Conspiracy theorists immediately began pointing out possible links to the Cooper case, but authorities responded that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that any such link exists. Woodinville officials later announced that the most likely motive for the crime was burglary.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, FDR's son Elliott {{published}} An Untold Story: The Roosevelts of Hyde Park, {{in which}} he recalled seeing LeHand in his father's lap and alleged that she [...] "shared a familiar life in all its aspects with father". His eldest brother Jimmy disagreed, arguing that FDR's illness had made sexual function too {{difficult for him to}} have a physical affair. [...] "I suppose you could say they came to love one another", he wrote, [...] "but it was not a physical love." [...] Kathryn Smith, the author of the only biography of LeHand, could come to no conclusion, but wrote, [...] "As far as evidence goes, {{there is not a single}} written account of anyone seeing them in a compromising position, despite the hundreds of Secret Service agents, staff members, political cronies, family members and friends who traipsed through FDR's bedrooms—which he used as an auxiliary office—during their twenty-one years together." [...] She quotes LeHand's great-niece, Jane Scarbrough, who said, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they did , but we don't know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Plato, Aristotle discusses the Forms of Good in critical terms {{several times in}} both of his major surviving ethical works, the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics. Aristotle argues that Plato’s Form of the Good {{does not apply to}} the physical world, for Plato does not assign “goodness” to anything in the existing world. Because Plato’s Form of the Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the Form of the Good exists and the Form of the Good is thereby irrelevant to human ethics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe {{argument has}} also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, as it assumes no other forms of life, {{sometimes referred to as}} carbon chauvinism. Conceptually, alternative biochemistry or other forms of life are possible. Regarding this, Stenger argued: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that our kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, modern cosmology theorises that multiple universes may exist with different constants and laws of physics. So, {{it is not surprising that}} we live in the one suited for us. The Universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the Universe." ...|$|E

Afdhere Jama, an American-Muslim writer {{and editor of the}} Huriyah magazine, added, [...] "My main difference with the majority of Muslims is the belief that a Jewish homeland is an important progress for all of us, especially one in their ancestral land of Israel". He continued, [...] "Muslims in the United States must decide whether they see groups like Hamas and Hizbullah as legitimate resistance or the cause of Muslim troubles in the region".|$|E
2500|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, reversing the Seventh Circuit, holding that Dorsey should have been sentenced under the new 2010 guidelines. [...] "ot to apply the Fair Sentencing Act," [...] Breyer wrote, [...] "would do more than preserve a disproportionate status quo; it would make matters worse. It would create new anomalies, new sets of disproportionate sentences, not previously present." [...] This reading of the law would be [...] "at odds with Congress' basic efforts to achieve more uniform, more proportionate sentences." [...] Breyer concluded by arguing that [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> Congress {{would have wanted to}} impose an unforeseeable, potentially complex application date." ...|$|E

60|$|But the plague? My Lord Brouncker's {{observation}} would not, I fear, {{lead him}} to think that Englishmen {{of the nineteenth century}} are purer in life, or more fervent in religious faith, than the generation which could produce a Boyle, an Evelyn, and a Milton. He might find the mud of society at the bottom, instead of at the top, but I fear that the sum total would be a deserving of swift judgment as {{at the time of the}} Restoration. And it would be our duty to explain once more, and this time not without shame, that we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that it is the improvement of our faith, nor that of our morals, which keeps the plague from our city; but, again, that it is the improvement of our natural knowledge.|$|E
