50|$|Preliminary {{data has}} shown that <b>gemfibrozil,</b> an agent that {{inhibits}} production of proinflammatory cytokines {{in addition to its}} clinically useful lipid-lowering activity, increased survival in BALB/c mice that were already ill from infection by influenza virus A/Japan/305/57 (H2N2). <b>Gemfibrozil</b> was administered intraperitoneally once daily from days 4 to 10 after intranasal exposure to the virus. Survival increased from 26% in vehicle-treated mice (n = 50) to 52% in mice given <b>gemfibrozil</b> at 60 mg/kg/day (n = 46) (P = 0.0026).

50|$|During postmarketing surveillance, 52 {{deaths were}} {{reported}} in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant renal failure. Risks were higher in patients using fibrates, mainly <b>gemfibrozil</b> (Lopid), and in patients using the highest (0.8 mg/day) dose of cerivastatin. Bayer A.G. added a contraindication for the concomitant use of cerivastatin and <b>gemfibrozil</b> to the package 18 months after the drug interaction was found. The frequency of deadly cases of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins. Another 385 nonfatal cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 {{times that of the}} other statins. Cerivastatin also induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administered as monotherapy, but that was revealed only after Bayer was sued and unpublished company documents were opened.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of action of <b>gemfibrozil</b> is unknown, however, several theories exist regarding the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) effect; it can inhibit lipolysis and decrease subsequent hepatic fatty acid uptake as well as inhibit hepatic secretion of VLDL; together these actions decrease serum VLDL levels; increases HDL-cholesterol; the mechanism behind HDL elevation is currently unknown.|$|E

50|$|Jako took AZT for {{two weeks}} when first diagnosed, but became so ill that she stopped taking the drug. Afterward, she {{remained}} drug-naïve until 1997. After extensive research and pressured by a failing immune system, Jako began a regimen of Nevirapine, 3TC, and d4T. In 1998, she replaced d4T in her regimen with Abacavir because d4T caused severe side effects. Jako has permanent truncal adiposity (a collection of fat at the waist, back and neck, and wasting in the extremities.) She experiences dangerously elevated lipid levels, both cholesterol and triglycerides due to side effects from her medications. The elevated lipids required the addition of <b>Gemfibrozil</b> to control them.|$|E
50|$|Repaglinide {{is a major}} {{substrate}} of CYP3A4 {{and should}} not be administered concomitantly with <b>gemfibrozil,</b> clarithromycin or azole antifungals such as itraconazole or ketoconazole. Administration of both repaglinide and {{one or more of these}} drugs results in an increase in plasma concentration of repaglinide and may lead to hypoglycemia. Co-administration of repaglinide and clopidogrel (a CYP2C8 inhibitor) may lead to a significant decrease in blood glucose levels due to a drug-drug interaction. In fact, using these drugs together for even ONE DAY can cause repaglinide levels to increase over 5-fold...and may lead to significant hypoglycemia. Repaglinide should not be combined with sulfonylurea, because they have the same mechanism of action.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose Fibrates are a {{class of}} drugs widely used to treat dyslipidaemias. They {{regulate}} lipid metabolism and act as PPARα agonists. Clinical trials demonstrate that besides changes in lipid profiles, fibrates decrease the incidence of cardiovascular events, with <b>gemfibrozil</b> exhibiting the most pronounced benefit. This study aims to characterize the effect of <b>gemfibrozil</b> on the activity and function of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), the key mediator of NO signalling. Experimental Approach High-throughput screening of a drug library identified <b>gemfibrozil</b> as a direct sGC activator. Activation of sGC is unique to <b>gemfibrozil</b> and is not shared by other fibrates. Key Results <b>Gemfibrozil</b> activated purified sGC, induced endothelium-independent relaxation of aortic rings and inhibited platelet aggregation. Gemfibrozil-dependent activation was absent when the sGC haem domain was deleted, but was significantly enhanced when sGC haem was lacking or oxidized. Oxidation of sGC haem enhanced the vasoactive and anti-platelet effects of <b>gemfibrozil.</b> <b>Gemfibrozil</b> competed with the haem-independent sGC activators ataciguat and cinaciguat. Computational modelling predicted that <b>gemfibrozil</b> occupies {{the space of the}} haem group and interacts with residues crucial for haem stabilization. This is consistent with structure-activity data which revealed an absolute requirement for gemfibrozil's carboxyl group. Conclusions and Implications These data suggest that in addition to altered lipid and lipoprotein state, the cardiovascular preventive benefits of <b>gemfibrozil</b> may derive from direct activation and protection of sGC function. A sGC-directed action may explain the more pronounced cardiovascular benefit of <b>gemfibrozil</b> observed over other fibrates and some of the described side effects of <b>gemfibrozil.</b> </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} underlines the {{importance}} of <b>gemfibrozil,</b> a lipid-lowering drug and an activator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- (PPAR-), in inhibiting the disease pro-cess of adoptively transferred experimental allergic encephalo-myelitis (EAE), an animal model of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} pravastatin and <b>gemfibrozil</b> {{in the treatment of}} primary hypercholesterolemia. Three hundred eighty-five outpatients from 13 lipid clinics in Italy participated in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were assigned to receive either 40 mg once daily of pravastatin or 600 mg of <b>gemfibrozil</b> twice daily after an initial diet lead-in period. After 24 weeks, mean reductions from baseline values of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were, respectively, 23 % and 30 % with pravastatin and 14 % and 17 % with <b>gemfibrozil.</b> Significant lipid-lowering effects were noted within 4 weeks. Apolipoprotein B decrease was 21 % with pravastatin and 13 % with <b>gemfibrozil.</b> A statistically significant increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 5 % was achieved with pravastatin compared with a 13 % increase for <b>gemfibrozil.</b> Serum triglyceride values decreased 5 % with pravastatin and 37 % with <b>gemfibrozil.</b> Familial and polygenic hypercholesterolemic patients were also examined separately. Pravastatin effectiveness in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was greater by 6 % in polygenic than in familial hypercholesterolemic patients. Treatment for 25 patients (eight treated with pravastatin and 17 treated with <b>gemfibrozil)</b> was discontinued during the study.

40|$|Fibrates are a {{group of}} {{peroxisome}} proliferator-activated receptor � agonists used {{in the treatment of}} dyslipidemia; however, they have been reported to cause species-related hepatocarcinogenesis and clinical myotoxicity. <b>Gemfibrozil</b> {{is one of the most}} commonly used fibrates, and it shows the highest risk for myotoxicity among the fibrates.
