30|$|When {{the number}} of antennas <b>in</b> <b>relay</b> is less than {{the number of}} antennas in the {{transmitter}} and receiver, the capacity of MIMO relay system is lower than that of the original MIMO system. Moreover, when the number of antennas <b>in</b> <b>relay</b> equals that <b>in</b> the transmitter and receiver or more, the MIMO relay system can provide the same average capacity as an original MIMO system. In other words, although the number of antennas <b>in</b> <b>relay</b> is larger than that in transmitter and receiver, the capacity of MIMO relay system cannot exceed the capacity of original MIMO system [7 – 10].|$|R
