2500|$|A {{new device}} called [...] "StopGate" [...] has been {{installed}} at four locations, one in Madison, Wisconsin; another in Monroe, Wisconsin {{and two in}} Santa Clara, California (on a light rail system). This system resembles a fortified version of a standard crossing gate, with two larger arms blocking the entire width of the roadway and locking into a securing device {{on the side of}} the road opposite the <b>gate</b> <b>pivot</b> mechanism. The gate arms are reinforced with high-strength steel cable, which helps the gate absorb the impact of a vehicle attempting to crash through the gate. The manufacturer claims that the StopGate can stop a [...] truck within [...] Already the system has been tested at the Madison crossing, when the system stopped a truck while a Wisconsin and Southern Railroad train was in the crossing.|$|E
50|$|Transverse pitch may be {{achieved}} by rotating the pin on which the <b>gate</b> <b>pivots,</b> or by adding shaped wedges {{into the back of}} the gate for the oar to rest on.|$|R
50|$|The lock has two {{identical}} bathtub-like ship caissons {{in which}} vessels ascend and descend. Both caissons are enclosed {{at each end}} by <b>pivoting</b> <b>gates,</b> and there are <b>pivoting</b> <b>gates</b> at {{the upper and lower}} reaches of the canal at the junctions with the caissons. The gates on the caissons fit into slots on the gates on the reaches, so that they open in unison.|$|R
50|$|The arch {{was built}} {{from the same}} marble as the house, and stood at the {{beginning}} of a road which wound up and around the hill to the mansion. It originally had large iron <b>gates,</b> the <b>pivots</b> for which are still extant, and probably quarters inside for a gatekeeper. The arch has two niches intended for statues, which are now empty.|$|R
50|$|The churchyard {{is one of}} {{very few}} to have a Tapsel gate — a {{centrally}} <b>pivoted</b> <b>gate</b> unique to Sussex. An ancient crucifix {{was found in the}} churchyard in 1877, when it was moved into the church. The age of the brick and stone font is not known. It may be 19th century but other sources propose more ancient origins.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} 8 {{mutations}} that account for the disorder in 8 of 14 studied families. These mutations are clustered in four regions throughout the channel: the linker between domains 2 and 3 (D2-3), the intracellular segment linking segments 4 and 5 in domain 3 (D3S4-5), the linker between domains 3 and 4 (D3-4) and the intracellular segment linking segments 4 and 5 in domain 4 (D4S4-5). The mutations in the D3S4-5 region (I1461T, F1462V and T1461I) are located in or next to an IFM motif that is conserved across all voltage-gated sodium channels. Mutagenesis studies of this region have shown that it acts {{as part of the}} inactivation <b>gate,</b> <b>pivoting</b> to block the central pore. Not surprisingly then, the two of these mutations that have received further study show incomplete inactivation. When the IFM motif pivots to block the central pore it interacts with residues in the D3S4-5 region. There are three mutations in this region (V1298F, F1298D and V1299F) that are believed to alter the interaction with the inactivation gate. While this region has been studied by mutagenesis these specific mutations have not all received attention, though they are expected to produce changes similar to the aforementioned IFM region mutations. The M1627K mutation in the D4S4-5 region may also affect a residue involved in interacting with the IFM inactivation motif. This would explain the observed alteration of inactivation and the broadening of a window current. One of the affected families with the R996C mutation, pedigree 12, has a single individual who also has the V1298D mutation. The individual in this family with the compound mutation is the most severely affected, suggesting that the R996C mutation may cause a less severe phenotype. The less severe phenotype of the pedigree 4 family is in concordance with this theory. It is unclear how the R996C mutation affects channel function.|$|R
40|$|Potassium channel {{activation}} regulates cellular excitability {{in cells}} such as neurons and heart. Ion channel activity {{relies on a}} switching mechanism between two conformations, the open and closed states, known as gating. It {{has been suggested that}} potassium channels are <b>gated</b> via a <b>pivoted</b> mechanism of the pore-lining helix. Our analysis suggests that hinging occurs at the residue immediately preceding the central glycine of the inner helix. Furthermore, we show that the highly conserved central glycine is necessary to prevent constraining interactions with critical residues in its vicinity, including those located in the selectivity filter. We show that such interactions can impair channel function, and that upon their removal channel activity can be restored...|$|R
5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers the <b>gate,</b> and <b>pivots</b> it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195million in 2007.|$|R
40|$|The gating {{mechanism}} of the potassium channel KcsA was studied by normal mode analysis. The results provided an atomic description of {{the locations of the}} pivot points and the motional features of key structural elements in the <b>gating</b> process. Two <b>pivot</b> points were found in the motions of the inner TM 2 helical bundle that directly modulate the size of the central channel pore. One point is an intrasubunit hinge point that sharply divides the structural flexibility between the more rigid selectivity filter and the more mobile peripheral transmembrane helices. Such a division is vital for KcsA because it permits the large-scale motions of transmembrane helices required for the gating and, in the meantime, maintains the rigidity of the filter region essential for the selectivity. The other pivot point is an intersubunit one at which all four TM 2 helices are bundled together. During the gating process, each TM 2 helix undergoes a lever-like swinging motion pivoting on the intrasubunit hinge, and the entire TM 2 bundle undergoes a concerted rotational motion around the central channel axis constrained around the intersubunit bundle point. This series of motions leads to a dramatic enlargement of the intracellular gate without loosening up the structural integrity...|$|R
