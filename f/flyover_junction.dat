25|$|Traffic {{lights and}} {{junctions}} are permitted at grade on dual carriageways. For older sections of dual carriageway, this {{has resulted in}} fewer <b>flyover</b> <b>junctions.</b> Newer dual carriageway sections are usually near motorway standard, with grade-separated junctions, but may not be designated as motorways due {{to the need to}} preserve access to adjoining property or to the absence of a non-motorway alternative route. Also, dual carriageways that are not motorway classified {{do not need to be}} equipped with emergency phones.|$|R

5000|$|The {{junction}} is of {{the greatest}} importance to the local road infrastructure. On 29 October 2013, after the previous day's stormy winds, Transport for London inspectors discovered 'defects' and closed the flyover, declaring it [...] "unsafe". A statement from Garrett Emmerson mentioned engineers identified a degradation in the concrete road deck which forms part of the flyover's structure. Traffic was diverted onto the Hogarth roundabout below and reports suggested that slow moving westbound traffic on the A316 led to queues forming {{as far back as}} the Hammersmith <b>flyover</b> <b>junction.</b>|$|E
