5|$|In 1570, El Greco {{moved to}} Rome, where he {{executed}} {{a series of}} works strongly marked by his Venetian apprenticeship. It is unknown how long he remained in Rome, though he may have returned to Venice (c. 1575–76) {{before he left for}} Spain. In Rome, on the recommendation of Giulio Clovio, El Greco was received as a <b>guest</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Palazzo Farnese, which Cardinal Alessandro Farnese had made a center of the artistic and intellectual life of the city. There he came into contact with the intellectual elite of the city, including the Roman scholar Fulvio Orsini, whose collection would later include seven paintings by the artist (View of Mt. Sinai and a portrait of Clovio are among them).|$|E

5|$|After Emperor Mingzong died in 933, the Later Tang {{began to}} crumble {{from its own}} {{succession}} crisis. Mingzong's son and successor Li Conghou ruled for only five months {{before he was killed}} in 934 in a coup led by his adoptive brother Li Congke (Emperor Mo of Later Tang). Prince Bei, who was still an honored <b>guest</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Tang court at the time, wrote to his brother Emperor Taizong (Yelü Deguang), advising him to invade the Tang. Instead, Taizong lent military support to a rebellion led by Shi Jingtang, a Tang governor and son-in-law of the former Emperor Mingzong. With Khitan help, in 936 Shi Jingtang succeeded in replacing the Later Tang with his own Later Jin. After some negotiation with the more powerful Khitans, he ceded sixteen border prefectures stretching from modern-day Datong (Shanxi province) to the coast of the Bohai Sea east of what is now Beijing, to the Liao. Since the Sixteen Prefectures contained numerous strategic passes and fortifications, the Khitans now had unrestricted access to the plains of northern China. Shi Jingtang also agreed to treat Emperor Taizong of Liao as his own father, a move that symbolically elevated Taizong and the Liao to a superior position.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Schwarzkopf {{published}} a memoir, It Doesn't Take a Hero, about his life; {{it became a}} bestseller. Schwarzkopf sold the rights to his memoirs to Bantam Books for $5,000,000.

He led the Pegasus Parade at the Kentucky Derby and was an honorary <b>guest</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Indianapolis 500. He supported several children's charities and national philanthropic causes, and he was a spokesperson for prostate cancer awareness, recovery of the grizzly bear from endangered species status, and served on the Nature Conservancy board of governors.

5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} she is not good at {{business}} as she is not organised enough, and has never really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a <b>guest</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> city's Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday. Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
