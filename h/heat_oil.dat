500|$|In situ {{technologies}} <b>heat</b> <b>oil</b> shale underground by injecting hot fluids {{into the}} rock formation, or by using linear or planar heating sources followed by thermal conduction and convection to distribute heat through the target area. Shale oil is then recovered through vertical wells drilled into the formation. These technologies are potentially able to extract more shale oil from a given area of land than conventional ex situ processing technologies, as the wells can reach greater depths than surface mines. [...] They present an opportunity to recover shale oil from low-grade deposits that traditional mining techniques could not extract.|$|E
50|$|The Northeast Home <b>Heating</b> <b>Oil</b> Reserve {{was created}} in July 2000 to provide a reserve of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> for the {{approximately}} 5.3 million households in the Northeast region of the United States that use <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> for their homes.|$|R

50|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>oil</b> is {{used for}} home heating in England, Scotland and Wales, {{typically}} in premises away from mains gas. There are around 1.5 million people in Great Britain using <b>oil</b> for home <b>heating.</b> Great Britain has many suppliers of <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> ranging from large companies such as BP and Crown Oil to local oil suppliers covering very small areas. Many villages may use buying groups to order <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> at the same time, thereby accessing lower costs. Many <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> suppliers will choose to list their prices on independent <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> price comparison websites. These sites draw in home <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> users and compare various local supplier prices {{in order to provide}} the lowest price available. In the UK and Northern Ireland, it is possible to search for prices by town name, county and postcode prefix.|$|R
2500|$|Based {{on these}} {{descriptions}} and the Byzantine sources, John Haldon and Maurice Byrne designed a hypothetical apparatus as consisting of three main components: a bronze pump, {{which was used}} to pressurize the oil; a brazier, used to heat the oil (πρόπυρον, propyron, [...] "pre-heater"); and the nozzle, which was covered in bronze and mounted on a swivel (στρεπτόν, strepton). The brazier, burning a match of linen or flax that produced intense heat and the characteristic thick smoke, was used to <b>heat</b> <b>oil</b> and the other ingredients in an airtight tank above it, a process that also helped to dissolve the resins into a fluid mixture. The substance was pressurized by {{the heat and the}} usage of a force pump. After it had reached the proper pressure, a valve connecting the tank with the swivel was opened and the mixture was discharged from its end, being ignited at its mouth by some source of flame. The intense heat of the flame made necessary the presence of heat shields made of iron (βουκόλια, boukolia), which are attested in the fleet inventories.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>oil</b> {{is mostly}} {{used in the}} northeastern United States, with the {{majority}} of that <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> coming from Irving Oil's refinery in Saint John, New Brunswick, the largest oil refinery in Canada. Unlike other petroleum products, <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> is primarily distributed to consumers through family-owned small businesses, rather than the large oil companies. Although United States distributors provide the Department of Energy the average price per gallon for their users, they typically do not list their prices on comparison websites, instead preferring to provide quotes which best match the property.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the impact of {{temperature}} shock on both near-month and far-month natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns by extending the weather and storage models of the previous study. Several notable findings from the empirical studies are presented. First, the expected temperature shock significantly and positively affects both the near-month and far-month natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns. Next, significant temperature shock has effect on both the conditional mean and volatility of natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> prices. The results indicate that expected inventory surprises significantly and negatively affects the far-month natural gas futures returns. Moreover, volatility of natural gas futures returns is higher on Thursdays and that of near-month <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns is higher on Wednesdays than other days. Finally, it is found that storage announcement for natural gas significantly affects near-month and far-month natural gas futures returns. Furthermore, both natural gas and <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> futures returns are affected more by the weighted average temperature reported by multiple weather reporting stations than that reported by a single weather reporting station...|$|R
50|$|In {{convection}} heaters, {{heating elements}} either warm the air directly or <b>heat</b> <b>oil</b> or another filler, {{which in turn}} transfers heat to the air. The air then warms the objects {{and people in the}} space. Convective heaters are suitable for providing constant, diffuse heat in well-insulated rooms. Oil heaters warm up slowly but do not reach dangerous surface temperatures; wire-element heaters, which may be fan assisted, produce warm air more quickly but may pose a fire hazard. One particular type of convective heater is the fan heater.|$|E

5000|$|In February 2015, {{two former}} Laurel Bay {{residents}} expressed health concerns {{that their children}} are sick from leukemia cancer by living in the area on YouTube. The housing, in the past, had used <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> storage tanks for access to <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> and after the oil was replaced, the tanks were capped and filled with dirt while underground. Starting in 2007, all of the tanks were removed but some <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> was released. These former residents are worried that benzene vapor, a known carcinogen, from the leaked <b>heating</b> <b>oil</b> made their kids sick.

50|$|Hearts for Heat has {{recently}} become a notable aspect of Princeton life. Founded in 2006 by Princeton resident Cindy Shea, this non-governmental organization provides <b>heat</b> (<b>oil,</b> coal, wood, electric) to residents of Princeton. After meeting 100% of fuel assistance need in Princeton, the NGO {{expanded to include}} sections in surrounding towns Spencer, Massachusetts, North Brookfield, Massachusetts, and Leicester, Massachusetts. The up-and-coming NGO's unique attributes are its community-binding nature, {{as well as its}} promise to use every dollar donated for actual fuel distributions. Recently featured {{on the front page of}} the Worcester County newspaper, the Telegram and Gazette, Shea has also found herself the focus of articles in Worcester Living Magazine, and the Landmark, Wachusett Region's newspaper.|$|E
50|$|As a child Haggard was {{influenced}} by his father, a landscape architect who ran a Civilian Conservation Corps camp during the Depression. After his retirement, he concentrated on restoring a burned out peanut farm in south Texas to a mixed savannah grassland. Haggard grew up with Texas dust, <b>heat,</b> <b>oil</b> wells, rainwater harvesting, hot springs and cottonmouths. After a BS in chemical engineering and service in the Army he switched to architecture and design with a BA at NC State and then a Masters in Urban Design at the University of Pennsylvania. After stints as a planner and designer he became a teacher while maintaining a design practice. From 1967 to 1988 he taught at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. In the summer of 1970 he taught in Bangladesh, an experience that changed his approach to design and architecture, and led to his lifelong commitment to design for the real world.|$|E
