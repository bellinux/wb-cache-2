25|$|On 23 August 1995, {{after nine}} months into his third tenure, he was removed as Chief Minister {{and as the}} {{president}} of the TDP by his son-in-law, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, who engineered an internal party coup against him and took over the offices. Naidu claimed that the reason for overthrowing NTR was that the latter was planning to hand over the reins of the party to his second wife Lakshmi Parvathi and felt that the party was in danger of disintegrating under her rule. Most of the TDP MLA's sided with Naidu and camped at the Viceroy Hotel in Hyderabad, the centre of the revolt. NTR's sons Nandamuri Harikrishna, Nandamuri Balakrishna and his other son-in-law Daggubati Venkateswara Rao played a crucial role in the coup but all of them fell out with Naidu soon afterwards. The reason for this is that Naidu is said have promised to make Venkateswara Rao the Deputy Chief Minister and Harikrishna the party's general secretary, but he sidelined all of them soon after becoming the Chief Minister and Party President. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>emotional</b> interview after the coup, NTR called the coup a planned treachery and lambasted Naidu for being power-hungry and untrustworthy, likening him to Aurangzeb, the Mughal Emperor who jailed his father and killed his siblings to become the King of the Mughal Empire.|$|E

Those two games had poor performances: Harbaugh {{completed}} none of six passes and had one 3-yard rush in the Week 6 loss to Pittsburgh. Despite only 9 of 20 passes completed and two interceptions in the Week 7 28–10 {{loss to the}} Green Bay Packers, Harbaugh made his first passing touchdown as a Raven, a 46-yard pass to Jermaine Lewis in the fourth quarter. In the next game on Week 8 (November 1), Harbaugh improved in his first full game, with 27 of 34 passes completed over 243 yards for 3 touchdowns and 1 interception and 57 rushing yards in 10 carries. In Week 9 (November 8), with Baltimore winning 13–10 over the Oakland Raiders, Harbaugh got his first win in a full game started despite passing for only 102 yards, no touchdowns, and an interception. In the final two drives of the game, Harbaugh made crucial first-down conversion passes of a 28-yard pass to Jermaine Lewis and 10- and 11-yard passes to Michael Jackson. In Week 12 (November 29), a 38-31 win over the Indianapolis Colts, Harbaugh had his first interception-free full game, with 16-for-25 passing over 198 yards for 2 touchdowns.

The present study will examine this further by examining the influence of negative and positive emotional states on recall and recognition in child-normed lists within the Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm. The DRM paradigm is a cognitive task that relies on gist memory for remembrance of the critical lure in semantically associated word lists. It is expected that the eight year old children <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative <b>emotional</b> state will have greater occurrences of false memory than the five year old children in either emotional state and eight year old children <b>in</b> <b>a</b> positive <b>emotional</b> state. Implications for the results will indicate that child eye witnesses may attempt to accommodate during testimony by assenting to leading questions or elaborating the details of event to fill in the gaps of a traumatic memory...|$|R
