5|$|Aligned ZnO {{nanowires}} on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E
25|$|Although {{photolithographic}} {{technology is}} the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography,</b> are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes {{as small as a}} few nanometers). <b>Electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. <b>Electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> as it is usually practiced is a form of maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a resist-coated substrate. <b>Electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.|$|E
25|$|Various {{techniques}} of nanolithography such as optical lithography, X-ray lithography dip pen nanolithography, <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> or nanoimprint lithography were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication technique where a bulk material is reduced {{in size to}} nanoscale pattern.|$|E

This has been previously obtained by different <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithographies</b> [9, 11] or by femtosecond-laser machining [12]. FIB can compete with such techniques when SCM is employed to dramatically increase the milling rate. In the case of PS spheres (diameter 465 nm) the removal of one sphere takes 48 s with a circular pattern of 200 nm, at the current of 1 pA and the dose of 1.33 nC/μm 2.|$|R

25|$|To achieve {{high-resolution}} in electron microscopes {{and other}} electron beam instruments (such {{as those used}} for <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography),</b> {{it is helpful to}} start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first electron microscope (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970, using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an early field emission gun.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} nanotechnological {{techniques}} include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, {{those used in}} semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography,</b> focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers.

25|$|In {{semiconductor}} {{research and}} industry, PMMA aids as a resist in the <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> process. A solution {{consisting of the}} polymer in a solvent is used to spin coat silicon and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this {{can be made by}} an electron beam (using an electron microscope), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard photolithography process), or X-rays. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-cross-linking) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made. Smooth PMMA surface can be easily nanostructured by treatment in oxygen radio-frequency plasma and nanostructured PMMA surface can be easily smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) irradiation.|$|E

50|$|DPN evolved {{directly}} from AFM {{so it is}} not a surprise that people often assume that any commercial AFM can perform DPN experiments. In fact, DPN does not require an AFM, and an AFM does not necessarily have real DPN capabilities. There is an excellent analogy with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> (E-beam) <b>lithography.</b> E-beam evolved {{directly from}} SEM technology and both use a focused <b>electron</b> <b>beam,</b> but no one would ever suggest that one could perform modern E-beam lithography experiments on a SEM that lacks the proper lithography hardware and software requirements.|$|R
50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} is {{that current}} optical rectennas are produced using <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> (e-beam) <b>lithography.</b> This process {{is slow and}} relatively expensive because parallel processing is not possible with e-beam lithography. Typically, e-beam lithography is used only for research purposes when extremely fine resolutions are needed for minimum feature size (typically, {{on the order of}} nanometers). However, photolithographic techniques have advanced to where it is possible to have minimum feature sizes on the order of tens of nanometers, making it possible to produce rectennas by means of photolithography.|$|R
25|$|In <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithography</b> (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist {{is exposed}} to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} {{positive}} or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E

40|$|Silicon {{nanowire}} (SiNW) field-effect transistors {{have been}} fabricated by oxidation scanning probes and <b>electron</b> <b>beam</b> <b>lithographies.</b> The analysis and {{comparison of the}} electron mobility and subthreshold swing shows that the device performance is not affected by the top-down fabrication method. The two methods produce silicon nanowire transistors with similar electrical features, although oxidation scanning probe lithography generates nanowires with smaller channel widths. The values of the electron mobility and the subthreshold swing, 200 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 and 500 mV dec− 1, respectively, {{are similar to those}} obtained from bottom-up methods. The compatibility of top-down methods with CMOS (complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) procedures, the good electrical properties of the nanowire devices and the potential for making sub- 10 nanowires, in particular by using oxidation scanning probe lithography, make those methods attractive for device fabrication.

A new system based on Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT, with formula PbZr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48 O 3) was synthesized by solegel method.
