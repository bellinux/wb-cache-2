It was formally announced at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) annual conference in January 2011. Its ultimate target is to investigate and develop a thorium based molten salt nuclear system in about 20 years. An expected intermediate outcome of the TMSR research program {{is to build a}} 2 MW pebble bed fluoride salt cooled research reactor in 2015, and a 2 MW molten salt fueled research reactor in 2017. This would be followed by a 10 MW demonstrator reactor and a 100 MW pilot reactors. The project is spearheaded by Jiang Mianheng, with a start-up budget of $350 million, and has already recruited 140 PhD scientists, working full-time on thorium molten salt reactor research at the Shanghai <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Applied</b> <b>Physics.</b> An expansion of staffing has increased to 700 as of 2015. As of 2016, their plan is for a 10MW pilot LFTR is expected to be made operational in 2025, with a 100MW version set to follow in 2035.|$|E

For irradiation {{of the products}} was used the GU- 3 gamma irradiator (with Cs- 137) installed in the <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Applied</b> Nuclear <b>Physics</b> in Tirana, Albania. The applied rotation technique provided an absorbed dose uniformity 106 % and average dose rate 4. 68 Gy/min. Determination of health care products sterility {{was carried out in}} the <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> Public Health according to a specific method. Sterility examination was performed almost one year after irradiation. From the study of results was confirmed that the use of gamma irradiation, to ensure the sterility of the products, is an effective method...|$|R

40|$|We {{calculate}} inclusive dijet production {{cross section}} in high energy hadron collisions within the BFKL resummation formalism for the QCD Pomeron. We {{take into account}} the Pomerons which are adjacent to the hadrons. With these adjacent Pomerons we define a new object - the BFKL structure function of hadron - which enables one to calculate the inclusive dijet production for any rapidity intervals. We present predictions for the dijet K-factor and azimuthal angle decorrelation. Estimations for some NLO BFKL corrections are also given.

50|$|Tsaghkunk is {{an ancient}} {{historical}} place; one of the 40 oldest parts of Varazhnunik - Tsaghkuneats (Tsaghkunik) - Tsakhadzor (Darachichak - Zenjerlu) region. Even before 520 BC it had 45 households and was considered the administrative center of Varazhnunik region. Later, in 1828, based on Turkmencha contract Varazhnunik passed to Russia. This is the very date of official establishment of contemporary Tsaghkunk. At the same time 17 families (102 people) moved there from Maku city of Iran. The tendency of immigration to Tsaghkunk continued, i.e. in 1828-1829 many families moved from Khoy and Van cities. The population of Tsaghkunk was growing: while in 1831 there lived 512 people, in 1939 the population peaked to 1675. Based on 2008 data the population of Tsaghkunk was 1186. From 1849 to 1917 the village was part of Nor Bayazet marz of Yerevan region. After {{the establishment of the}} Soviet regime it was renamed and became part of Gavar, Sevan, Dilijan, Tshambarak and Hrazdan administrative districts. Currently, Tsaghkunk is in Sevan administrative district of Gegarkunik region.Tsaghkunk {{is an ancient}} settlement. In 1976 while tilling near the stables tractor drivers found woman jewellery, which has a 3.5 thousand-year history; it is currently located in the <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Applied</b> Problems <b>of</b> <b>Physics</b> in Yerevan.

40|$|In these lectures we hope {{to provide}} an {{elementary}} introduction to selected topics in light-front dynamics. Starting {{from the study of}} free field theories of scalar boson, fermion, and massless vector boson, the canonical field commutators and propagators in the instant and front forms are compared and contrasted. Poincare algebra is described next where the explicit expressions for the Poincare generators of free scalar theory in terms of the field operators and Fock space operators are also given. Next, to illustrate the idea of Fock space description of bound states and to analyze some of the simple relativistic features of bound systems without getting into the wilderness of light-front renormalization, Quantum Electrodynamics in one space - one time dimensions is discussed along with the consideration of anomaly in this model. Lastly, light-front power counting is discussed. One of the consequences of light-front power counting in the simple setting of one space - one time dimensions is illustrated using massive Thirring model. Next, motivation for light-front power counting is discussed and power assignments for dynamical variables in three plus one dimensions are given. Simple examples of tree level Hamiltonians constructed by power counting are provided and finally the idea of reducing the number of free parameters in the theory by appealing to symmetries is illustrated using a tree level example in Yukawa theory.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis relates to the {{realisation}} of a novel biochip for sensors based on optical principles. In particular, affinity biosensors for antigens (IgG/anti-IgG), for a transcription factor, and for mRNA were studied and developed. The interrogation of the biosensors implied {{the development of a}} novel and innovative optical platform based on fluorescence which was designed, implemented and thoroughly characterised. The biosensors developed were integrated within an optical biochip connected to an innovative platform. The optical biochip was fabricated from polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) formed by two pieces of PMMA complementary shaped in order to obtain four micro-channels. The lower part included the micro-channels and the inlet and outlet for the fluidic, while the sensing biolayer was immobilised on the upper part. The optical signal comprised the fluorescence emitted by the layer, which was anisotropically coupled to the cover and suitably guided by the chip. Several chemical treatments of the surface were investigated to obtain the most effective distribution of carboxylic groups for the covalent immobilisation of antibodies. Deposition of the polymers, in particular by Langmuir-Blodgett method, can enhance the performances of the chip going through lower detection limits. The potential of the optical chip as a biosensor was investigated in depth by means of a direct IgG/anti-IgG interaction carried out inside the flow channels. Following this, bioassays for the determination of the NF-kB transcription factor and for the mRNA that codifies for MGMT protein were implemented on the optical platform. The development and characterisation of the biosensors, the identification of the protocol for the bioassays and the design and characterisation of the optical platform were performed at the <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> <b>Physics</b> <b>Applied</b> Carrara <b>of</b> National Research Council (IFAC-CNR), Firenze, Italy. The research devoted to the development of biosensing surfaces for the realisation of affinity biosensors able to detect and quantify antigens, transcription factors and RNA sequences were carried out at the laboratories <b>of</b> the <b>Institute</b> <b>of</b> Clinical Physiology of National Research Council (IFC-CNR), in Pisa, Italy. Langmuir-Blodgett deposition of polymers, Atomic Force Microscopy imaging and further fluorescence measurements of proteins covalently bound on the surfaces were performed at Cranfield University in Silsoe, England. The overall project starts from a first characterisation of the optical system, and comprehend the enhanced optimisation of the biochip performances until the realisation of the biosensors previously mentioned.
