500|$|In early July, the {{security}} situation in South Ossetia aggravated, when a South Ossetian separatist militia official was killed by explosions on 3 July and several hours later an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Dmitry Sanakoyev, {{the leader of the}} Georgian-backed Ossetian government, injured three policemen. On 7 July, four Georgian soldiers were captured by South Ossetian separatists. The next day, the Georgian president ordered police to <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> liberate the soldiers. Four Russian Air Force jets flew over South Ossetia on 8 July. A scheduled visit of Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, to Georgia on the next day nearly coincided with the timing of the flight. Georgia recalled its ambassador to Russia after Russia admitted its planes had flown in Georgia's airspace to [...] "let hot heads in Tbilisi cool down".

500|$|Male giraffes {{use their}} necks as weapons in combat, a {{behaviour}} known as [...] "necking". Necking {{is used to}} establish dominance and males that win necking bouts have greater reproductive success. This behaviour occurs at low or high intensity. In low intensity necking, the combatants rub and lean against each other. The male that can hold itself more erect wins the bout. In high intensity necking, the combatants will spread their front legs and swing their necks at each other, attempting to land blows with their ossicones. The contestants will try to dodge each other's blows and then <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> counter. The power of a blow depends on {{the weight of the}} skull and the arc of the swing. A necking duel can last more than half an hour, depending on how well matched the combatants are. Although most fights do not lead to serious injury, there have been records of broken jaws, broken necks, and even deaths.|$|E
500|$|Michael Buffer, {{the boxing}} ring {{announcer}} {{best known for}} his catchphrase, [...] "Let's <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> rumble!", made a guest appearance as himself in [...] "Damien". Parker and Stone originally planned to use the catchphrase without Buffer, but when they learned that Buffer had legally trademarked the phrase, they included him in the episode since getting the rights for the catchphrase cost nearly as much as hiring Buffer for a guest appearance. Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him. Voice actor Mike Judge, star of Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill, had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character, and even recorded several lines for the part. However, since Judge lives in Austin, Texas, it proved too difficult to for him to come back and rerecord lines as the script and episode changed, so Stone instead provided the character's voice. Judge later provided Kenny's un-muffled line when he removed his parka in [...]|$|E

500|$|PT-32, {{which had}} only two good engines, had straggled behind the others. Around dawn, Schumacher spotted what {{appeared}} to be a Japanese destroyer heading towards him.

Schumacher was ordered to recover the drums he had jettisoned, but this proved to be a time-consuming task, and a dangerous one in broad daylight, and it had to be abandoned after only a few drums were recovered. Bulkeley had his gunners sink the rest. The two boats then hid for the day in a nearby cove.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Go to the Top" [...] {{was directed by}} Tomoe Nakano. This is Kumi's first animated music video, and her only collaboration with Nakano. The video opens with people inside a late-night cafe. In the distance, a television screen reads [...] "The next single is a winter ballad single in December"; this is a reference to Kumi's December single Koishikute. The music video features an animated Kumi inside a giant robot, ready to race an opponent.

500|$|In a {{detailed}} review, Jason Lipshutz from Billboard wrote, [...] demonstrates an originality in sound {{that was necessary}} for the revitalization of the boy band movement. The electropop currently dominating Top 40 radio is seamlessly weaved into the pop harmonies made standards by 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys and 98 Degrees -- for instance, the title track sounds like a hybrid of Backstreet Boys' [...] "Larger than Life" [...] and an LMFAO song, and even includes a Katy Perry name-check. Up All Night has its ups and downs, but One Direction complete two important tasks on their debut album: the boy band notches a long-lasting hit with [...] "What Makes You Beautiful," [...] and they look forward instead of back. <b>Get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> hear {{a lot more of}} One Direction. Matthew Horton of Virgin Media opined that the album brims with [...] "punchy pop rock", and considered the dance-orientated [...] "Stole My Heart": [...] "the only misstep, which only reinforces their decision to go pop rock." [...] MSN Musics Ben Chalk called the album: [...] "manufactured, calculated and commercial", assessing that the resulting album [...] "is a corking pop album". In his review, he also complimented the album for its collection of singles: [...] "' is a collection of highly polished pop gems, which knows its market and gives it what it wants".|$|E

500|$|After WrestleMania, Michaels {{was forced}} into {{temporary}} retirement due to a legitimate back injury sustained at the Royal Rumble, with Triple H taking over the leadership position in DX, claiming that his now-former associate had [...] "dropped the ball". He introduced the returning X-Pac the night after WrestleMania and joined forces with The New Age Outlaws. As 1998 went along, DX became more popular, turning the group from villains to fan favorites. During this time, he adopted an entrance gimmick of asking the crowd [...] "Are you ready? I said, are you ready?", followed by a parody of rival promotion WCW's ring announcer Michael Buffer's famous catch-phrase, [...] "Let's <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> rumble", substituting the word [...] "rumble" [...] with the DX slogan, [...] "suck it". Also during this time, Triple H began a feud with {{the leader of the}} Nation of Domination and rising WWF villain, The Rock. This storyline rivalry eventually led to a feud over the Intercontinental Championship, which Triple H won in a ladder match at SummerSlam. He did not hold the title long, however, as he was sidelined with a legitimate knee injury. When The Rock won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series, the rivalry between the two continued, as DX fought The Corporation stable of which The Rock was the main star and Triple H received a shot at the WWF Championship on the January 25, 1999 Raw Is War in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match, but the match ended when Triple H was forced to quit or see his aide Chyna chokeslammed by Kane. This began a new angle for Triple H, as Chyna betrayed him by attacking him after the match and joining The Corporation.|$|E
500|$|After Penn State's quadruple {{overtime}} {{win against}} Michigan, {{they tried to}} get healthy, with veterans being held out of a scrimmage that occurred during the week of practice, instead working on conditioning. One ESPN writer opined that defensive coordinator John Butler needed to emphasize reworking the secondary, similar to how he had focused on reworking the defensive line, which was successful during the prior week's game. Also, Penn State needed to find additional [...] "playmakers" [...] to supplement Allen Robinson in the receiving game, as well as determine who would lead the running game, as Zach Zwinak had fumbled against Michigan and was taken out, and Bill Belton took over and performed well. Halfway through the season, ESPN.com rated Robinson as the team's offensive MVP, and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones as the team's defensive MVP. The midseason report noted that Penn State had a grueling schedule {{in the second half of}} the season that would test the depth of its defense, limited by lack of scholarship players. Lancaster Newspapers concurred with ESPN, awarding their first half offensive and defensive MVPs to Robinson and Jones respectively as well, adding Sam Ficken as special teams MVP. The column also called sophomore defensive end Deion Barnes the biggest disappointment of the first half, noting that he had even been relegated out of the starting lineup. Quarterback Christian Hackenberg, who had started the first six games and had a [...] "halftime" [...] in the bye week, as there were still six games to play, viewed the bye week as a bonus: [...] "We have a couple more days to prepare, get a good game plan and <b>get</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> go to a hostile environment and play a really good football team.
