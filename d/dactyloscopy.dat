25|$|Fingerprint identification, {{known as}} <b>dactyloscopy,</b> or hand print identification, {{is the process}} of {{comparing}} two instances of friction ridge skin impressions (see Minutiae), from human fingers or toes, or even the palm of the hand or sole of the foot, to determine whether these impressions could have come from the same individual. The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike in every detail; even two impressions recorded immediately after each other from the same hand may be slightly different.

50|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the Cisleithanian k.k.

The control over the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and the Principality of Transylavania did not pass to the Hungarian forces until 1876. In 1881 the Royal Hungarian (k.u.) Gendarmerie (Csendőrség) was established. With {{the implementation of the}} Austrian Gendarmerie Law on 2 February 1876, it was finally separated from the Austro-Hungarian Army, though the newly established agency was still answerable to the Austrian Minister of Defence and its service members were officially part of the Cisleithanian Landwehr armed forces. Before World War I, fingerprint analysis (<b>dactyloscopy)</b> and police dogs had been introduced. A special Alpine branch was formed in 1906, mainly to protect the part of Tyrol that bordered the Kingdom of Italy. Since then, alpine rescue operations and border patrols have remained an important Gendarmerie function. During the First World War, the Gendarmerie was used in a number of roles including maintaining public order in the hinterland areas as military police (Feldgendarmerie), fighting espionage and partisans, and arresting deserters. In addition, they also provided scout, courier and orderly assistance to the General Staff.|$|E

50|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of Hvar Island were Neolithic people who probably established trade links between Hvar {{and the eastern}} shores of the Mediterranean. The Hvar Culture lasted from 3500 to 2500 B.C. Beginning in the 4th century BC, the Greeks colonized the island. In 384 BC the Greek colonisers of Pharos defeated Iadasinoi warriors and their allies, invited by the Hvar indigenes in their resistance to the Greek colonization. Their victory over much larger forces was immortalized {{in one of the}} oldest known inscriptions of Croatia. Following Roman victory in the Second Illyrian War against Demetrius of Pharos, the island became a part of the Roman Empire in 219 BC and the Greek name Pharos was changed to Pharia. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the west, the island was {{under the control of the}} Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. The population increased in the Late Antiquity with an abundance of archeological finds. A large number of new villa rustica in Stari Grad Plain and also on the previously vacant eastern shores was built.In the early Middle Ages, Slavic tribes occupied the island. In the first half of the 7th century the Narentines took over the island. Venetian sailors saw the island while sailing towards the south and were threatened by the Narentine pirates from the island. In the 11th century the island joined the Kingdom of Croatia. In the 12th century the rise of the Republic of Venice brought vines and wine cultivation which blossomed into a major industry for the island in the Middle Ages. The island eventually again fell under Byzantine rule, and then under Kingdom of Croatia and Hungary. In 1331 the Venetians put the island under protection from threats of piracy. According to the 1358 Treaty of Zadar, the island was handed over to the Kingdom of Hungary. For short time in the summer of 1390 it was held by the Bosnian king Stephen Tvrtko I. In 1409, the Republic of Venice finally again became its long-term owner. In the 16th century, an uprising occurred between the plebeians and aristocracy, the most serious of the uprising occurred between 1510 and 1514 with the Venetians ruthlessly crushing the locals and sending twenty of their leaders to the hangman. The island became prosperous from fishing, the cultivation of rosemary, lavender and olives.Hvar is important to the history of Croatia as it was one of the centers of Croatian literature during the Renaissance, with writers such as Petar Hektorović and Hanibal Lucić. In Stari Grad, tourists can see the Petar Hektorović fortress/villa called Tvrdalj Castle, architectonically designed by the poet himself. Churches on the island contain many important paintings and artworks by famous Venetian artists, including Tintoretto, Veronese, Bellini and others. In 1797 Hvar was annexed with the fall of the Venetian Republic by the Habsburg Monarchy as per the Treaty of Campo Formio. But forces of the French Empire seized it in 1806 during the Napoleonic wars before finally being taken by British marines and sailors in 1812. The Austrians regained control of the island in 1815 with the Treaty of Vienna. The beginning of the 20th century brought a period of relative prosperity. The Italian army occupied the island from 1918 until 1921, when Hvar with the rest of Croatia joined the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. In 1939, an autonomous Croatian Banate was formed that included the island. During WWII, it was under the control of Independent State of Croatia, but under military occupation of Fascist Italy until 1943. After 1945, it became a part of People's Republic of Croatia, a constituent republic of Communist Yugoslavia. Ivan Vučetić, the man who perfected <b>dactyloscopy</b> at the turn of the 20th century, came from Hvar island. In the 21st-century, Hvar's most famous citizens are football player Igor Tudor and politician Tonči Tadić.|$|E

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on criminalistic <b>dactyloscopy,</b> one of many methods of {{personal}} identification by fingerprints used in criminalistic praxis. However, this activity involves interventions and restrictions of human rights of persons being dactyloscoped. The areas affected are mainly personal data protection, human dignity and freedom and personal security rights. Thus this procedure has to be legal, reasonable and legitimate. The aim of this diploma thesis {{is to provide a}} complete description of historical development, possible uses and legal framework of criminalistic <b>dactyloscopy.</b> Closely connected to this topic are definitions of several conceptions. The basis of this work lies in an evaluation and comparison of the state of dactyloscopic identification prior to 1990. It also notes the changes occurring after this date and changes connected with the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union. The aim of this work is to provide the reader or any person interested in this topic with basics of procedures of dactyloscopic analysis and a list of related books for additional information. Resulting from these aims of this work and from the study of professional literature, following hypotheses were established: There was insufficient legal protection of dactyloscoped subjects prior to 1990. After 1990, a gradual development of legal system created conditions of adequate human rights protection of dactyloscoped subjects. Both hypotheses were confirmed by professional literature and legal regulations, mainly Law No. 40 / 1974 (on the former police functioning), International Pact of Civil and Political Rights as stated in the Law No. 120 / 1976 Coll., Law No. 283 / 1991 Coll. (on the Police of Czech Republic) within the meaning of later regulations, Law No. 101 / 2000 (on personal data protection) and further legal norms. The concept of this diploma thesis is to provide a complete overview of criminalistic <b>dactyloscopy</b> and a basic sketch of the development of human rights protection of dactyloscoped subjects. Its readers can compare current situation with historical development.

40|$|Abstract:In {{modern times}} the {{establishment}} of personal identity has widened its scope considerably by encompassing various morphological traits e. g. face, iris, retina, hand etc. apart from traditional <b>dactyloscopy.</b> For any trait {{to be used for}} identification purposes it is essential that its uniqueness is proved in all individuals. The external ear being a new entrant in this field has not yet been investigated in this aspect. In the present study an investigation into its uniqueness was undertaken on a large database (1404 adult male and 1257 female subjects) from Central India. Every ear pattern was paired and compared with every other ear present in the sample. Each ear was represented as a feature point in 17 dimensional feature space. The dissimilarity in the ear pattern was measured by Euclidean distance between members of the pair. More than 99. 9 % of ears were found to occupy a distinct position in the multi-dimensional feature space. Few pairs which could not be distinguished by the above method were successfully differentiated by subjecting their images to direct superimposition. When the left and right ears of the same individual were compared by the above methods, none of the pairs were left undistinguished. A validation test conducted in North India (on 132 adult males and 168 adult females) supported the above findings. Hence, the individuality of every ear has been confirmed which may find use in personal identification studies. The study is a step towards providing scientific support for admitting ear evidence in the Court of Law...|$|E
