And he watched the moonlight on the rippling river, and the black heads of the firs, and the silver-frosted lawns, and listened to the owl's hoot, and the snipe's bleat, and the fox's bark, and the otter's laugh; and smelt the soft perfume of the birches, and the wafts of <b>heather</b> <b>honey</b> off the grouse moor far above; and felt very happy, though he could not well tell why.

40|$|The colour {{of honey}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} quality criteria for consumers. The colour depends mainly on the content of plant pigments but the honey consistency, shape, and size of the crystals may also influence the honey colour parameters. It is related to the crystallisation and decrystallisation processes of honey during storage. In the present study, directions of colour changes of honey during storage were evaluated using a tristimulus colorimeter and the CIE 1976 L*a*b* and CIE L*C*ho systems. The effect of time (3 and 9 months) and storage conditions (cold storage, room temperature storage with access to light, and room temperature storage without access to light) on the colour of nectar honeys was investigated. The results obtained showed that both the type of honey and the storage conditions influenced the honey colour parameters. Significant differences in direction and intensity of the colour changes of honey during storage were observed. These differences make it difficult to indicate which storage conditions are optimal to preserve the colour of the honey. It was found that acacia and <b>heather</b> <b>honeys</b> were the most susceptible to colour changes during long-term storage in all of the study’s applied conditions, whereas rape and buckwheat honeys were the most stable in colour parameters...|$|R
60|$|The next {{place in}} which Hereward {{appeared}} was far away on the southwest, upon the Cornish shore. How he came there, or after how long, the chronicles do not say. All that shall be told is, that he went into port on board a merchant ship carrying wine, and intending to bring back tin. The merchants had told him of one Alef, a valiant regulus or kinglet of those parts, who was indeed a distant connection of Hereward himself, having married, as did {{so many of the}} Celtic princes, the daughter of a Danish sea-rover, of Siward's blood. They told him also that the kinglet increased his wealth, not only by the sale of tin and of red cattle, but by a certain amount of autumnal piracy in company with his Danish brothers-in-law from Dublin and Waterford; and Hereward, who believed, with most Englishmen of the East Country, that Cornwall still produced a fair crop of giants, some of them with two and even three heads, had hopes that Alef might show him some adventure worthy of his sword. He sailed in, therefore, over a rolling bar, between jagged points of black rock, and up a tide river which wandered away inland, like a land-locked lake, between high green walls of oak and ash, till they saw {{at the head of the}} tide Alef's town, nestling in a glen which sloped towards the southern sun. They discovered, besides, two ships drawn up upon the beach, whose long lines and snake-heads, beside the stoat carved on the beak-head of one and the adder on that of the other, bore witness to the piratical habits of their owner. The merchants, it seemed, were well known to the Cornishmen on shore, and Hereward went up with them unopposed; past the ugly dikes and muddy leats, where Alef's slaves were streaming the gravel for tin ore; through rich alluvial pastures spotted with red cattle, and up to Alef's town. Earthworks and stockades surrounded a little church of ancient stone, and a cluster of granite cabins thatched with turf, in which the slaves abode, and in the centre of all a vast stone barn, with low walls and high sloping roof, which contained Alef's family, treasures, fighting tail, horses, cattle, and pigs. They entered at one end between the pigsties, passed on through the cow-stalls, then through the stables, and saw before them, dim through the reek of thick peat-smoke, a long oaken table, at which sat huge dark-haired Cornishmen, with here and there among them the yellow head of a Norseman, who were Alef's following or fighting men. Boiled meat was there in plenty, barley cakes, and ale. At the head of the table, on a high-backed settle, was Alef himself, a jolly giant, who was just setting to work to drink himself stupid with mead made from narcotic <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b> By his side sat a lovely dark-haired girl, with great gold torcs upon her throat and wrists, and a great gold brooch fastening a shawl which had plainly come from the looms of Spain or of the East, and next to her again, feeding her with titbits cut off with his own dagger, and laid on barley cake instead of a plate, sat a more gigantic personage even than Alef, the biggest man that Hereward had ever seen, with high cheek bones, and small ferret eyes, looking out from a greasy mass of bright red hair and beard.|$|E

Although Buzz was originally one the Sun People, she is now afraid of them because they had tried to sacrifice her. While Heather is high in the tree, Buzz stops humming, allowing the bees to sting Heather. Heather asks Buzz why she stopped humming, and she replies that she can hear a sound.

50|$|For centuries, the {{historical}} basket or heath beehive produced honey and beeswax on the Lüneburg Heath. In the Middle Ages <b>heather</b> <b>honey</b> was a sought-aftern commodity. Beekeeping was {{common in the}} core areas of the former heath, so that almost every farmstead had a Bienenzaun. The farmers employed special beekeeping hands for this purpose. The town of Celle on the Südheide was a major trading centre for <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b> As early as the 16th century there was a professional apiculture centre. It declined {{during the second half}} of the 19th century for a number of reasons, which led to the retreat of the areas of heathland. As a result of land consolidation there were no areas of common land with their wide range of nectar-producing plants. The introduction of artificial fertiliser enabled better harvest yields from heath soils and so areas of heath were turned into arable land. Marshland soils with buckwheat cultivation were turned into meadows for cattle. In addition, large areas of heath were reforested with fast-growing pines. Today there are only a very few apiaries left on the Lüneburg Heath which keep bees in {{the historical}} way. These also produce comb honey which is a speciality today due to its rarity. Comb honey is a honeycomb filled with <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b>|$|E

50|$|Heath {{beekeeping}} is {{a special}} form of beekeeping used to obtain <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b> It involves a transportable, swarming hive in which the beekeeper only allows {{a small number of}} colonies to overwinter.

Over the centuries, by selecting bees that swarm early and often, beekeepers on the heathlands developed an extremely swarm-loving and robust species known as the European dark bee.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{inventing the}} Manley frame system (still in common use today), R. O. B.

This advice is not found in earlier publications (A. Pettigrew 1870, Rev Thomas WM Cowan 1881). Manley adds that while <b>heather</b> <b>honey</b> was not suitable as winter food during periods of confinement, he 'knew of nothing better to encourage a rapid spring build-up'.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other parts}} of the Lüneburg Heath the Südheide Nature Park is a {{traditional}} region for heath beekeeping to produce <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b> During the period when heather is in bloom, beekeepers bring their beehives from regions a long way off to the heath areas. Some of the hives are set up in fixed so-called bee enclosures (Bienenständen). Very rarely the Lüneburg Skep (Lüneburger Stülper) may be found, a basket {{in the shape of a}} bell, or the rectangular Kanitz basket (Kanitzkorb), both made of straw which is sealed with a mixture of cow dung and peat. These enclosures are still used today by beekeepers to harvest comb honey. In the mid-1920s the so-called Kanitz baskets appeared, named after the beekeeper and teacher, Kanitz (1815-1899). He discovered that the bell-shaped baskets commonly used at the time were less effective for colony management.|$|E

50|$|Like many Irish distilleries, {{the company}} {{suffered}} {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, due to the advent of competition from blended Scotch whisky, and the curtailment of exports to the British Empire and the United States during Prohibition and the Anglo-Irish Trade War. In fact, the distillery closed in 1925 to cut costs, staying closed for thirteen years, before reopening again in 1937. Faced with struggling sales in the 1940s, Desmond E. Williams, a descendant of the original D.E. Williams, began into alternative products, such as heather wine, a drink reputedly enjoyed by old Irish chieftains, which was made from a combination of whiskey, <b>heather</b> <b>honey</b> and other herbs. Unable to find an extant original recipe in Ireland, Williams wondered if Irish emigrants, such as those that left Ireland in the Flight of the Wild Geese in 1691, or after the Great Famine had carried the recipe overseas with them, and sent out word that he was interested in finding such a recipe. As luck would have it, an Austrian War refugee appeared in Tullamore in 1948 with a family recipe of Irish origin. Better than Williams' own reconstructed recipe, the result was Irish Mist, the first modern whiskey liqueur to be launched in Ireland.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the assumption that}} combining scientific and traditional knowledge is a promising means to elaborate alternative ways of adapting to ongoing changes that are compatible with local values and priorities. To do this, we analyze {{a case study of}} the production of <b>heather</b> <b>honey</b> in southern France.

Thixotropy of the honeys was estimated by comparing viscosities of the sol (stirred) and gel (unstirred) forms of the honey, extrapolated to zero shear;All of the honeys studied showed some degree of anomalous viscosity and thixotropy. These findings are at variance with the published statements of previous investigators who found the above phenomena only in <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b> This disagreement lies in the fact that the very low thixotropy of non-heather honeys had not been detected by previous methods;Other investigators found a general correlation between thixotropy and the colloidal content of the honey. The <b>heather</b> <b>honey,</b> for which thixotropy had been reported, contained up to 6 % of such materials. The colloidal content of the honeys studied in this thesis was less than 1 % and the observed thixotropy was as low as one-one hundredth that of <b>heather</b> <b>honey.</b> It is not surprising, therefore, that no definite relationship was found between the colloidal content and thixotropy.

40|$|ABSTRACT Monofloral heather (Erica sp.) honey samples (n = 89), {{harvested}} in Portugal according to European organic beekeeping rules, were analyzed {{to test their}} antifungal effect against Candida albicans, Candida krusei, and Cryptococcus neoformans. A synthetic honey solution was also tested to determine antifungal activity attributable to sugars. The specific growth rate (l) values showed that growth of all the yeasts was reduced {{in the presence of}} honey. The honey concentration (% wt/vol) that inhibited 10 % of the yeast growth (Xmin) was 13. 5 % for C. albicans, 20. 5 % for C. krusei, and 17. 1 % for C. neoformans. The respective concentrations of <b>heather</b> <b>honey</b> and synthetic honey in the C. krusei culture medium above 60 % (wt/vol) that inhibited 90 % of the yeast growth (Xmax) and Xmin, respectively, were established, whereas C. albicans and C. neoformans were more resistant because Xmax values were not reached over the range tested (10 – 60 %, wt/vol). <b>Heather</b> <b>honey</b> might be tapped as a natural resource to look for new medicines for the treatment of mycotic infections.
