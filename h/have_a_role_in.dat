5|$|The role of LTP in {{disease is}} less clear than its role in basic {{mechanisms}} of synaptic plasticity.

5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines may also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation {{is a general}} marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|In May, Toby Jones entered final {{negotiations}} to play Arnim Zola. Iron Man director Jon Favreau said a younger Howard Stark {{would appear in}} the film, played by Dominic Cooper.

Four days later, he confirmed he was taking the part. The same day, Stanley Tucci joined the cast as Dr. Abraham Erskine, the scientist who created the super-soldier serum. In November 2013, McDonough revealed that he is signed to appear in multiple projects for Marvel, not limited to films.|$|E
5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 {{showed a}} significant correlation with clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs were reported {{to be associated with}} AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E

5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear if they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The inner moons {{are closely}} {{associated}} with Neptune's rings. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the Galle and LeVerrier rings. Despina may be a shepherd moon of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring. The next moon, Galatea, orbits just inside {{the most prominent of}} Neptune's rings, the Adams ring. This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50km, and has five embedded bright arcs. The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various resonances between the ring particles and Galatea may also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> maintaining the arcs.|$|E
5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile Virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E

5|$|The {{ubiquitin}} protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated, resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> proteasome targeting, while other types of chains {{may be involved in}} other processes.|$|E
5|$|Trees are an {{important}} part of the terrestrial ecosystem, providing essential habitats including many kinds of forest for communities of organisms. Epiphytic plants such as ferns, some mosses, liverworts, orchids and some species of parasitic plants (e.g., mistletoe) hang from branches; these along with arboreal lichens, algae, and fungi provide micro-habitats for themselves and for other organisms, including animals. Leaves, flowers and fruits are seasonally available. On the ground underneath trees there is shade, and often there is undergrowth, leaf litter, fallen branches and/or decaying wood that provide other habitat. Trees stabilise the soil, prevent rapid run-off of rain water, help prevent desertification, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> climate control and help in the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem balance.|$|E
5|$|After the lackluster {{critical}} and commercial {{response to the}} first film, series creator Gene Roddenberry was {{forced out of the}} sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed its final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and this theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy had not intended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the sequel, but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production team used various cost-cutting techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniature models from past projects and reusing sets, effects footage, and costumes from the first film. Among the film's technical achievements is being the first feature film to contain a sequence created entirely with computer-generated graphics.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes have {{prominent}} horn-like structures called ossicones, {{which are}} formed from ossified cartilage, covered in skin and fused to the skull at the parietal bones. Being vascularized, the ossicones may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> thermoregulation, {{and are also}} used in combat between males. Appearance is a reliable guide to the sex or age of a giraffe: the ossicones of females and young are thin and display tufts of hair on top, whereas those of adult males end in knobs and tend to be bald on top. Also, a median lump, which is more prominent in males, emerges {{at the front of}} the skull. Males develop calcium deposits that form bumps on their skulls as they age. A giraffe's skull is lightened by multiple sinuses. However, as males age, their skulls become heavier and more club-like, helping them become more dominant in combat. The upper jaw has a grooved palate and lacks front teeth. The giraffe's molars have a rough surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{pharyngeal}} jaws of teleosts, {{a second}} set of jaws contained within the throat, are composed of five branchial arches, loops of bone which support the gills. The first three arches include a single basibranchial surrounded by two hypobranchials, ceratobranchials, epibranchials and pharyngobranchials. The median basibranchial is covered by a toothplate. The fourth arch is composed of pairs of ceratobranchials and epibranchials, and sometimes additionally, some pharyngobranchials and a basibranchial. The base of the lower pharyngeal jaws is formed by the fifth ceratobranchials while the second, third and fourth pharyngobranchials create the base of the upper. In the more basal teleosts the pharyngeal jaws consist of well-separated thin parts that attach to the neurocranium, pectoral girdle, and hyoid bar. Their function is limited to merely transporting food, and they rely mostly on lower pharyngeal jaw activity. In more derived teleosts the jaws are more powerful, with left and right ceratobranchials fusing to become one lower jaw; the pharyngobranchials fuse to create a large upper jaw that articulates with the neurocranium. They have also developed a muscle that allows the pharyngeal jaws to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> grinding food in addition to transporting it.|$|E
