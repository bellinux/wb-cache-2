5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> shot {{and the best}} in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E

25|$|The Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Ponce <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> {{example of}} Antonin Nechodoma's {{religious}} architecture. This Czech architect {{was one of}} the first non-Hispanic designers to work in Puerto Rico. A colleague of Frank Lloyd Wright under Louis Sullivan in Chicago, Nechodoma developed the Puerto Rican Bungalow style for residential housing, which spread rapidly throughout the Island during the 1920s and 1930s. Nechodoma was the architect of at least three Protestant churches and many magnificent prairie-style upper-class residences. Most of Nechodoma's buildings have been demolished because of later developments. Most of his surviving structures are now considered landmarks.|$|E

25|$|The {{models are}} based on a {{database}} of all non-shortened One Day International (ODI) matches and Twenty20 games played between top-eight countries since late 2006 (slightly further back for Twenty20 games). The batting-first model estimates the additional runs likely to be scored {{as a function of the}} number of balls and wickets remaining. The batting-second model estimates the probability of winning as a function of balls and wickets remaining, runs scored to date, and the target score. Projected score or required run-rate will not qualitatively show the real picture as they fail to take into the account the quality of the batting team and the quality of the bowling attack. WASP <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> quantitative parameter.|$|E
25|$|This {{one story}} {{building}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> example of Neoclassic style in Ponce {{and the only}} one single-story building in the area. It preserves its simple lines typical of the 19th century institutional or military construction in the Island. Contributing elements to the style are its massive and sober exterior elements consisting of wide walls and pilasters crowned with tuscan order capitols, planar window surrounds, and a set of steps giving access to the main portico which projects form the main facade. A simple cornice crowns the building in all facades. Series of arched windows originally closed by wood louvers and glass panel transomes, complete the facade (these windows were replaced with metal blinds in the mid-1960s and have been vandalized in recent years).|$|E

25|$|The Endowed School was {{inspected}} by OFSTED in 2003 and 2008. In 2003 the inspectors' overall evaluation was that 'this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> school.' In 2008 the inspectors {{agreed with the}} School's own self-evaluation that the School is providing 'a satisfactory standard of education' and that 'many elements are good'. The 2003 OFSTED inspection had identified modern foreign languages as unsatisfactory. However, in 2008 the inspectors noted {{that there had been}} a 'great improvement in the leadership of modern foreign languages since the last inspection.' An OFSTED inspection has recently taken place, the school received a 'satisfactory' in most areas, pupil's behavior being one of the best, rated as 'good', while the maths department was the least achievable. OFSTED stated that the improvement in maths and English was a minor improvement and more work should be done to improve. From parents, they noted that many teachers have been on leave, saying that it disrupts their child's learning capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Up to half {{of those}} {{infected}} display no symptoms, and diagnosis is difficult because the worm eggs are often missed in fecal examination. The methods of detection are through fecal examination, parasite-specific antibody detection, or radiological diagnosis, as well as laparotomy. In case of a suspected outbreak {{it may be useful}} to keep track of dietary history, which is also useful for exclusion of differential diagnoses. Fecal examination is generally not helpful because the worm eggs can seldom be detected in the chronic phase of the infection. Eggs appear in the feces first between 9–11 weeks post-infection. The cause of this is unknown, and it is also difficult to distinguish between the different species of fasciola as well distinguishing them from echinostomes and Fasciolopsis. Most immunodiagnostic tests detect infection with very high sensitivity, and as concentration drops after treatment, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> diagnostic method. Clinically {{it is not possible to}} differentiate from other liver and bile diseases. Radiological methods can detect lesions in both acute and chronic infection, while laparotomy will detect lesions and also occasionally eggs and live worms.|$|E
