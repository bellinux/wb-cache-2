I am sure his terrible death will be a warning to all the traitors that in Russia the treason is not to be forgiven. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> to citizen Berezovsky to avoid any food at the commemoration for his crime accomplice Litvinenko ...|$|E
500|$|This Tour would {{comprehend}} but a {{small part}} of the great [...] "Far West"; but it will furnish to the traveller a fair sample, and being apart of it which is now made so easily accessible to the world, and the only part of it to which ladies can have access, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> to all who have time and inclination to devote to the enjoyment of so splendid a Tour, to wait not, but make it while the subject is new, and capable of producing the greatest degree of pleasure.|$|E
500|$|An {{investigator}} of the Russian apartment bombings, Mikhail Trepashkin, {{wrote in}} a letter from prison that an FSB team had organised in 2002 to kill Litvinenko. He also reported FSB plans to kill relatives of Litvinenko in Moscow in 2002, although these have not been carried out. State Duma member Sergei Abeltsev commented on 24 November 2006: [...] "The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am confident that this terrible death will be a serious warning to traitors of all colors, wherever they are located: In Russia, they do not pardon treachery. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> citizen Berezovsky to avoid any food at the commemoration for his accomplice Litvinenko." ...|$|E

500|$|Rangel {{endorsed}} Koch {{for re-election}} in 1981, but by 1983 his relations with the mayor had broken down: [...] "I don't know anybody in politics that I dislike enough that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> that he {{sit down with the}} mayor." [...] By 1984, Rangel was the most influential black politician in New York State. [...] His position on Ways and Means allowed him to bring federal monies to the state and city for transit projects, industrial development, Medicare needs, low-income housing, and shelters for the homeless. [...] Rangel was one of the city's most recognizable politicians, and there was speculation that he would run for mayor in 1985, but Rangel preferred to remain in the House, with the goal of eventually becoming Ways and Means chairman and in the best possible case even House Speaker. [...] Indeed, Rangel never showed any interest in a different political job other than being the Congressman from Harlem.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} between December 1996–January 1997 at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas, California. The song was written just outside Hoppus' vocal range, requiring him to strain {{to sing it}} (the song has a noticeably rougher and scratchier vocal track {{than the rest of}} the album). Hoppus was having vocal problems during the recording of the album regardless, due to lack of vocal warm-ups and constant smoking. These factors, combined with the stress of recording [...] "Dammit", led Hoppus to strain his vocal cords significantly, forcing the band to cancel the final week of recording the album in December 1996. [...] "I actually like my voice a lot on 'Dammit'. It sounds really raw and cool," [...] said Hoppus in 2001. [...] "But it's not a technique <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> for getting a good vocal sound. You know, smoking, yelling, all that." [...] As a result of this incident, the chorus has always been sung by Tom DeLonge in live performances. Guitarist/vocalist Matt Skiba would also take the lead on the chorus after replacing DeLonge in 2015.|$|E

[...] "I opted initially for David Holford but I didn't {{think he would be}} accepted as my nomination because he was my relative. I offered Clive Lloyd as an alternative choice but Clive had not even been invited to join the squad, so my third choice would be Rohan Kanhai." ...|$|E

50|$|This is an {{intelligent}} and extremely well-realised album that belies its simplistic origins. For {{those of you}} who are genuinely moved by soaring harmonised vocals (courtesy of The Christians), ironic folk rendition, rolling Spanish guitars and tongue-in-cheek meanderings, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> seriously <b>recommend</b> this to you.|$|R

2500|$|Conversely, Tunnell's {{judgment}} whilst under Carter's command was {{the subject}} of criticism. A formal US Army review of the conduct of Tunnell's brigade in Afghanistan pointed to its [...] "lack of discipline" [...] and [...] "contempt for the normal Army rules". The report's author concluded: [...] "Colonel Tunnell is no longer in command... If still in command, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> that Colonel Tunnell be relieved of his responsibilities as a brigade commander." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the November 2006 {{death by}} {{poisoning}} of Russian defector Alexander Litvinenko in London, Zhirinovsky said: [...] "Any traitor must be eliminated using any methods. If you {{have joined the}} special services to work, then you should work, but to betray, to run away abroad, {{to give up the}} secrets you learned while working – all of this looks bad." [...] Sergei Abeltsev, Zhirinovsky's former bodyguard and State Duma member from the LDPR, added: [...] "The deserved punishment reached the traitor. I am sure his terrible death will be a warning to all the traitors that in Russia the treason is not to be forgiven. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> to citizen Berezovsky to avoid any food at the commemoration for his crime accomplice Litvinenko." [...] In the 2007 election, political patronage from Zhirinovsky enabled Litvinenko murder suspect Andrei Lugovoi to win election to the Russian parliament and thus obtain formal parliamentary immunity. He also accused Great Britain (according to him, [...] "the most barbaric country on the planet") of fomenting World War I, the October Revolution, World War II, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary {{reviews of}} the book were mixed. Notably {{positive}} reviews came from Geoffrey Gorer in Time and Tide, and from Philip Mairet in the New English Weekly. Geoffrey Gorer concluded, [...] "Politically and as literature it {{is a work of}} first-class importance." [...] Philip Mairet observed, [...] "It shows us the heart of innocence that lies in revolution; also the miasma of lying that, far more than the cruelty, takes the heart out of it." [...] Hostile notices came from the Tablet, where a Catholic critic wondered why Orwell had not troubled to get to know Fascist fighters and enquire about their motivations, and from the Times Literary Supplement and The Listener, [...] "the first misrepresenting what Orwell had said and the latter attacking the POUM, but never mentioning the book." [...] John Langdon-Davies wrote in the Communist Party's Daily Worker that [...] "the value of the book is that it gives an honest picture of the sort of mentality that toys with revolutionary romanticism but shies violently at revolutionary discipline. It should be read as a warning." [...] Some Conservative and Catholic opponents of the Spanish Republic felt vindicated by Orwell's attack {{on the role of the}} Communists in Spain; The Spectators review concluded that this [...] "dismal record of intrigue, injustice, incompetence, quarrelling, lying communist propaganda, police spying, illegal imprisonment, filth and disorder," [...] was evidence that the Republic deserved to fall. A mixed review was supplied by V.S. Pritchett who called Orwell naïve about Spain but added that [...] "no one excels him in bringing to the eyes, ears and nostrils the nasty ingredients of fevered situations; and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>recommend</b> him warmly to all who are concerned about the realities of personal experience in a muddled cause." [...] Franz Borkenau, in a letter to Orwell of June 1938, called the book, together with his own The Spanish Cockpit, a complete [...] "picture of the revolutionary phase of the Spanish War." ...|$|E
60|$|The guide book prescribes, I think, no {{less than}} half a dozen churches in Cologne as a dose for the faithful; but we were {{satisfied}} with these three, and went back to our hotel.
