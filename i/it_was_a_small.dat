5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and a relationship to the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E
5|$|Afrasia {{is known}} from four {{isolated}} teeth: a first upper molar (M1), with {{a length of}} 2.13mm and width of 3.06mm; a second upper molar (M2), the holotype, of 2.27mm by 3.35mm; a second lower molar (m2) of 2.09mm by 1.41mm; and a third lower molar (m3) of 2.05mm by 1.27mm. Like other eosimiiforms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> primate that weighed around , which is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1, respectively. It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular; some distinguishing features are the well-developed small cusps (conules) on the upper molars, the variable development of the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) of the upper molars, and the unreduced talonid (posterior portion) on the m3. Its teeth are smaller {{than those of the}} eosimiids Phenacopithecus, Bahinia, and Phileosimias.|$|E
5|$|Ji and Ji (1996) {{identified}} many {{features that}} set Sinosauropteryx {{apart from other}} birds and dinosaurs. They found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> primitive bird with a relatively high skull, blunt rostrum and a slightly high premaxilla; that the antorbital fenestra was elliptical but not enlarged, the dentary was robust, the surangular was narrow and elongated, and the dentition is extremely well developed and acute; that there are over 50 extremely elongated caudals, constituting 60% of the body length, and the forelimb is extremely short with a short and thick humerus; the pubis was elongated and extremely inflated at its distal end and the ischium is broad; the hind limb was long and robust, the tibia is only slightly longer than the femur, the tarsals are separated, and the metatarsals are relatively robust with unfused proximal ends; the feathers are short, small, and uniform; many ornament {{the top of the}} skull, cervical, and dorsal regions, in addition to the dorsal and ventral caudal region.|$|E

5|$|Nakano {{organised}} {{the withdrawal}} of his force. He chose two routes, one following the coast and the other running along the ridge lines of {{the foothills of the}} Finisterres. Initially, the 20th Division was to take the coastal route while the 51st and some naval units took the inland one, but this was changed at the last minute and both divisions took the inland route. Additional rations and supplies were to be delivered by submarine. However, the 51st Division elected to move out rather than wait for the submarines and risk exhausting its rations through waiting. The 51st Division had experience crossing the mountains before, and Nakano was confident of its ability to negotiate them. In the event, one submarine was discovered by Allied aircraft and failed to reach its objective, while a second was discovered and sunk. A third got through but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> type that was only able to carry five tons of supplies, which were distributed among units of the 20th Division.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} by Lucius Reynolds and his brother-in-law, James Gardner, in June 1866 in Dayton, Ohio. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{printing}} shop founded with $500 in capital and originally named Reynolds and Gardner. It made standardized business documents using carbon copy paper. A year after Reynolds was founded, James sold {{his interest in the}} company to co-founder Lucius' father, Ira Reynolds, and the company was renamed to its current namesake, Reynolds and Reynolds. Co-owners Ira and Lucius died in 1880 and 1913 respectively. The youngest of the Reynolds family, Edwin Stanton Reynolds, took over.|$|E
5|$|When Gifu {{was founded}} in 1889, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> city that {{experienced}} moderate growth as Japan industrialized {{at the beginning of}} the century. During Japan's military buildup in the 1930s, the city became an industrial center and experienced exponential growth. Gifu remained prosperous in the post-war years, until its population started to decline like many Japanese cities in the 1980s and '90s. Though the city has shown a large increase in population in recent years, this trend results largely from the inclusion, for the first time, of the population of Yanaizu, which added about 13,000 people to Gifu's numbers. Foreign residents of the city, who number over 9,000, also factor into this growth. Shortly after this change, however, the city's economic revival strengthened and the population began to show a true increase.|$|E

5|$|On July16, Fengshen turned sharply westward {{due to a}} {{subtropical}} ridge to its northwest, and it maintained that movement {{for the next four}} days. By late on July18, the JMA estimated that Fengshen attained maximum sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute), around the same time the JTWC upgraded the storm to a super typhoon. After maintaining its peak intensity for 24hours, Fengshen weakened slightly and began a turn to the northwest. The weakening was possibly due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and although previously <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> storm, the typhoon gradually increased in size. Around that time of its weakening, Fengshen began undergoing the Fujiwhara effect with Typhoon Fung-wong; the latter looped to the south of Fengshen and dissipated on July29. On July21, Fengshen began re-intensifying, and the JMA reported that the typhoon again reached winds of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute). At around the same time, the JTWC estimated winds of 270km/h (165mph 1‑minute). Fengshen retained much of its intensity until July22, being a super typhoon for five days. This set the record for greatest duration at the intensity, surpassing the previous record of 114hours set by Typhoon Joan in 1997; Fengshen's record was later tied by Typhoon Ioke in 2006.|$|E
