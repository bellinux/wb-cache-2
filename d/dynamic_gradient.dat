40|$|Gradients are {{systems in}} which the {{physicochemical}} properties of a solution and/or surface change gradually in space and/or time. They are used for a myriad of technological and biological applications, for example for high-throughput screening, or for the investigation of biological systems. The development of methods for the fabrication of solution and surface gradients with desired characteristics, such as length and time scales, is still a fundamental challenge. The work described in this thesis aims at the development and application of electrochemical methods for the fabrication of covalent and non-covalent surface gradients on the micron scale. In {{the first part of}} this thesis (Chapter 3 - 5), an electrochemical system to generate solution and surface gradients on the micron scale has been developed. Via electrochemical reactions, solution gradients in pH or a catalyst (Cu(I)) have been generated. These gradients have been used to study the chemical reactivity of two surface reactions in a highly parallel manner. By optimization of the reaction parameters, the click reaction has been used to tune the density and steepness of surface chemical gradients fabricated on the micron scale. Furthermore, pH gradients have been characterized in real-time at the solid/liquid interface using a pH-sensitive fluorescent platform. In the second part of this thesis (Chapter 6 - 8), several non-covalent surface gradients have been fabricated on the micron scale. An electrochemical method has been demonstrated that resulted in non-covalent gradients of a charged dye-modified lipid using unprecedentedly low potentials. Furthermore, non-covalent, supramolecular surface gradients of a multivalent guest (Ad 2 -rhodamine) on the micron scale have been fabricated. Dynamic self-assembly has been shown, under control by a dissipative electrochemical process using (electrical) fuel.

The fusion is formulated as a convex optimization problem which minimizes a linear combination of a least-squares fitting term and a <b>dynamic</b> <b>gradient</b> sparsity regularizer. The former is to preserve accurate spectral information of the multispectral image, while the latter is to keep sharp edges of the high-resolution panchromatic image. We further propose to simultaneously register the two images during the fusing process, which is naturally achieved {{by virtue of the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>gradient</b> sparsity property. An efficient algorithm is then devised to solve the optimization problem, accomplishing a linear computational complexity {{in the size of the}} output image in each iteration.

40|$|International audienceWe propose in this {{contribution}} {{to investigate the}} link between the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gradient</b> damage model and the classical Griffith's theory of dynamic fracture during the crack propagation phase. To achieve this main objective, we first rigorously reformulate two-dimensional linear elastic dynamic fracture problems using variational methods and shape derivative techniques.

We then give a variationally consistent framework of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>gradient</b> damage model. Owing to the analogies between the variational ingredients of these two models and under some basic assumptions concerning the damage band structuration, one obtains a generalized Griffith criterion which governs the crack tip evolution within the non-local damage model.

40|$|Thermal {{effects are}} {{becoming}} a limiting factor in high performance circuit design due to the strong temperature dependence of leakage power, circuit performance, IC package cost and reliability. While many interconnect reliability models assume a constant temperature, this paper analyzes the effects of temporal and spatial thermal gradients on interconnect lifetime in terms of electromigration. For temporal thermal variations, we present a physics-based dynamic model for estimating interconnect lifetime for any time-varying temperature/current profile, and this model returns reliability equivalent temperature and current density {{that can be used}} in traditional reliability analysis tools. For spatial temperature gradients, we give close bounds in terms of uniformly distributed temperatures to estimate the lifetime of interconnects subject to non-uniform temperature distribution. Our results are verified with numerical simulations and reveal that blindly using the maximum temperature leads to very inaccurate or too pessimistic lifetime estimation. In fact, our dynamic model reveals that when the temporal temperature variation is small, average temperature (instead of worst-case temperature) can be used to accurately predict interconnect lifetime. Therefore, our results not only increase the accuracy of reliability estimates, but they also enable designers to reclaim design margin in reliability-aware design. In addition, our dynamic reliability model is useful for improving the performance of temperature-aware dynamic runtime management by modeling reliability as a resource to be consumed at a stress-dependent rate.

A novel aspect of this approach is the inclusion of two cell types. The model is shown not only to simulate normal wound contraction (in good agreement with experimental data), but also to yield valuable insight into the fundamental mechanisms involved and the pathogenesis of fibrocontractive diseases, and makes experimentally testable predictions of the effects of varying biological parameters.

Although {{the average}} of this dynamic support must be zero, a net deflection of the ocean basins can change their volume and induce sea-level change. By calculating dynamic topography using a global mantle flow model, we find that continents preferentially conceal depressed topography associated with mantle downwelling, leading to net seafl oor uplift and ~ 90 ± 20 m of positive sea-level offset. Upwelling mantle fl ow is currently amplifying positive dynamic topography and causing up to 1. 0 m/Ma of sea-level rise, depending on mantle viscosity. Continental motions across <b>dynamic</b> topography <b>gradients</b> also affect sea level, but uncertainty over the plate motion reference frame permits sea-level rise or fall by ± 0. 3 m/Ma, depending on net lithosphere rotation.

How has this large-scale removal of large herbivores affected landscape structure and ecosystem functioning? In this review, we combine paleo-data with information from modern exclosure experiments {{to assess the impact of}} large herbivores (and their disappearance) on woody species, landscape structure, and ecosystem functions. In modern landscapes characterized by intense herbivory, woody plants can persist by defending themselves or by association with defended species, can persist by growing in places that are physically inaccessible to herbivores, or can persist where high predator activity limits foraging by herbivores. At the landscape scale, different herbivore densities and assemblages may result in <b>dynamic</b> <b>gradients</b> in woody cover. The late-Quaternary extinctions were natural experiments in large-herbivore removal; the paleoecological record shows evidence of widespread changes in community composition and ecosystem structure and function, consistent with modern exclosure experiments.
