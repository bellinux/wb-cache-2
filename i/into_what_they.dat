5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going off to do this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E

500|$|The {{predecessor}} to Burger King, Insta-Burger King, began deploying {{the original}} broiling device in 1952 when its owners, Matthew Burns and Kieth Kramer, acquired {{the rights to}} George Read's Inst-Shake and Insta-Broiler machines. The Insta-Broiler cooked the burgers in a wire basket between two broilers, allowing the burgers to be cooked on both sides simultaneously. The machine was capable of cooking over 400 patties per hour, which allowed the company to grow rapidly. When McLamore and Edgarton opened their first Insta-Burger King location in Miami, they revamped the unit <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> called a [...] "flame broiler" [...] – the forerunner of the modern unit used by Burger King today. After the acquisition of Insta-Burger King in 1954, the pair contracted {{the construction of the}} newly designed flame broilers to the SaniServ company of Indianapolis, Indiana, for the initial run of broilers. Eventually, the company moved the manufacturing contract for the broiler units to Nieco Automatic Broilers of Windsor, California, who manufactured all subsequent units until the start of the 2000s.|$|E
500|$|At von Kármán's suggestion, Malina {{approached}} the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on Army Air Corps Research to request funding for research <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> {{referred to as}} [...] "jet propulsion", a term chosen to avoid the stigma attached to rocketry. The military were interested in jet propulsion {{as a means of}} getting aircraft quickly airborne where there was insufficient room for a full-length runway, and gave the Rocket Research Group $1,000 to put together a proposal on the feasibility of Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) by June 1939, making Parsons et al. the first U.S. government-sanctioned rocket research group. Since their formation in 1934, they had also performed experiments involving model, black powder motor-propelled multistage rockets. In a research paper submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), Parsons reported these rockets reaching velocities of 4,875 miles per hour, thereby demonstrating the potential of solid fuels to be more effective than the liquid types primarily preferred by researchers such as Goddard. In light of this progress, Caltech and the GALCIT Group received an additional $10,000 rocketry research grant from the AIAA.|$|E
500|$|Executives {{suggested}} to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to [...] "acclimate" [...] {{them to the}} industry. [...] "They wanted us to act 'like a rock band' and we just told them to fuck themselves," [...] remembered Trucks. For their part, {{the members of the}} band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. [...] "Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there," [...] said Gregg Allman, but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records [...] "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, wild and crazy place filled with bikers and rockers". The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin. Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> dubbed [...] "the Big House" [...] in March 1970.|$|E

When {{the album was}} {{considered}} to be finished, they were persuaded by LaBarbera Whites to work on a new track. Winnberg commented that it had always been [...] "an unwritten rule" [...] to not write songs about Spears' personal life, since [...] "Sweet Dreams My LA Ex", an answer song to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", was rejected by her record label. However, the duo wrote [...] "Piece of Me" [...] with Klas Åhlund anyway as an answer to Spears' critics, and sent it to the singer who [...] "loved it". Winnberg stated, [...] "We knew that the song broke all the rules we had, [...] When she came to the studio, she was extremely psyched, had learned the lyrics by heart in the car, and recorded the song on half an hour." [...] Before the album's release, LaBarbera Whites told MTV News that the album [...] "shows a lot of growth as a performer. [...] She was very involved in the songs and how they turned out. It's her magic that turns these songs <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are." [...] Among the producers who worked on Blackout but didn't make the album were Scott Storch, Dr. Luke and Ne-Yo.|$|E

I would love to have their input anytime, because they're obviously doing something right." [...] The band also contributed backing vocals and played the guitar to the song. It was produced by the Jonas Brothers and John Fields, with the latter also playing the bass, guitars and keyboards. The song also features Devin Bronson, who provided a guitar solo, and Dorian Crozier, who played the drums. In an interview, Lovato explained that the song is about being yourself when you are surrounded by [...] "the pressures of fame".

500|$|According to lead vocalist Bart Millard, MercyMe {{had started}} as a rock band and had {{wanted to make a}} rock record. Following the success of their {{breakthrough}} single [...] "I Can Only Imagine", a ballad, they were advised to [...] "duplicate [...] on the next two records". Millard says they felt that they were at a point where [...] "we are known more for ballads than the rock band we wanted to be". With the consent of their label, which felt there was a trend towards heavier music, MercyMe decided to make an [...] "edgier" [...] record. In particular the band focused on up-tempo songs, trying to put more edge <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were making. Millard noted that while the songs are still pop rock songs, the band tried to put a bit more edge into them. Additionally, the band decided to work with producer Brown Bannister, who had produced the group's Christmas record and Millard's solo album Hymned No. 1, as opposed to Pete Kipley, who had produced the band's previous three albums. Bannister's producing style was different from Kipley's; while Kipley was a hands-on producer, [...] "involved in every part of the song", Bannister would wait until the band had [...] "run down all [...] avenues" [...] before giving input. The band felt Bannsiter was an [...] "amazing encourager" [...] and were satisfied with the Christmas album Bannister had produced with him; although they felt Kipley did a great job on their previous records, improving themselves as a band and as songwriters, they felt it was [...] "time for a change". Another factor in the decision to use Bannister was his previous recording experience; Bannister had produced one of Millard's favorite albums, White Heart's 1989 album Freedom. The different approach the band took with Bannister resulted in a sometimes [...] "radical" [...] approach, with the band [...] "taking songs apart, putting them back together and, at times, totally reinventing them". One song, [...] "Something About You", shifted from [...] "an aggressive rock song to a soaring anthem".|$|E

2500|$|Early in {{his career}} Skinner became {{interested}} in [...] "latent speech" [...] and experimented with a device he called the [...] "verbal summator."

Many U.S. police departments responded to the study, adopting a mandatory arrest policy for spousal violence cases with probable cause. New York City Police Department Commissioner Benjamin Ward quickly issued a new mandate for officers to make arrests, after reading the {{results of the}} study in a Police Foundation report. Ward stated his belief that [...] "arresting violent members of a household would be more effective in protecting other family members and help safeguard police officers called in to stop the highly charged quarrels. I thought it was about time to put policemen out of the counseling business and <b>into</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really are best at, which is making arrests, then let the judge decide." [...] With this mandate, Ward also included cohabitants and same-sex couples in the police definition of family. The Houston and Dallas Police Departments were also quick to change their approach to domestic disturbance calls, and make more arrests. Within a year, the number of police departments using arrest as a strategy in domestic violence cases jumped from 10 to 31%, and to 46% by 1986. Numerous other police departments had partially changed their approach to domestic violence cases.|$|E
