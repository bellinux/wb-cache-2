40|$|The {{document}} {{discusses the}} effects of frustration on the aggressive behaviors of emotionally disturbed and normal children with high or low self concepts. Predicts: were that greater amounts of verbal and behavioral aggression would be shown by: (1) emotionally disturbed subjects in special education classes than for normal subjects; (2) subjects under conditions of frustration than for subjects in non-frustration conditions; and (3) subjects with measured low self concept than for subjects with high measured self concept. Subjects were 32 emotionally disturbed and 32 normal male children, ages nine or ten. Results show that: (1) a) verbal aggression depends upon an <b>individual's</b> <b>adjustment</b> status, b) direct behavioral expression of aggression is unrelated to an <b>individual's</b> <b>adjustment</b> status; (2) a) verbal aggression shows an inverse association with the experimental treatment conditions, b...|$|R

This article reports the results of a critical review of the literature, using an interac-tional psychology framework. In the past, re-searchers have focused on the limited themes of stress and attitudes. The indicators of in-dividual adjustment emphasized in past research are strain sYmptoms and general job satisfaction. The proposed interactional framework represents a more comprehensive approach incorporating organizational, work group, and job factors that affect <b>individual</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The range of in-dividual adjustment indicators should be broadened to include facets of satisfaction, organizational commitment, job involvemnt, and performance.

40|$|Abstract—A model-based inverse {{filtering}} {{scheme is}} proposed for an accurate, non-invasive {{estimation of the}} aerodynamic source of voiced sounds at the glottis. The approach, referred to as subglottal impedance-based inverse filtering (IBIF), takes as input the signal from a lightweight accelerometer placed on the skin over the extrathoracic trachea and yields estimates of glottal airflow and its time derivative, offering important advan-tages over traditional methods that deal with the supraglottal vocal tract. The proposed scheme is based on mechano-acoustic impedance representations from a physiologically-based trans-mission line model and a lumped skin surface representation. A subject-specific calibration protocol is used to account for <b>individual</b> <b>adjustments</b> of subglottal impedance parameters and mechanical properties of the skin.

A key question is whether SCD signifies specialization or, rather, indicates fragmentation and psychological maladjustment.
