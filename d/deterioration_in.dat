40|$|Objective: Weight {{change may}} be {{considered}} an effect of depression. In turn, depression may follow weight change. <b>Deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> health may mediate these associations. The objective was to examine reciprocal associations between depressed mood and weight change, and the potentially mediating role of <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> health (interim hospitalizations and incident mobility imitation) in these associations. Methods: Data were from 2406 black and white men and women, aged 70 - 79 from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee participating in the Health, Aging and Body composition (Health ABC) study. Depressed mood at baseline (T 1) and 3 -year follow-up (T 4) was measured with the CES-D scale. Three weight change groups (T 1 -T 4) were created: loss (≥ 5 % loss), stable (within ± 5 % loss or gain), and weight gain (≥ 5 % gain). Results: At T 1 and T 4, respectively 4. 4 % and 9. 5 % of the analysis sample had depressed mood. T 1 depressed mood was associated with weight gain over the 3 -year period (OR: 1. 91; 95 %CI: 1. 13 - 3. 22). Weight loss over the 3 -year period was associated with T 4 depressed mood (OR: 1. 51; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 2. 16). Accounting for <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> health in the reciprocal associations between weight change and depressed mood reduced effect sizes between 16 - 27 %. Conclusions: In this study, depressed mood predicted weight gain over three years, while weight loss over three years predicted depressed mood. These associations were partly mediated through <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> health. Implications for clinical practice and prevention include increased awareness that depressed mood can cause weight change, but can also be preceded by <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> health and weight change. © 2010 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry...|$|R

5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a <b>deterioration</b> <b>in</b> sleep quality.|$|E
40|$|Objective. Patients with {{schizophrenia}} residing at institutions often {{suffer from}} negative symptoms, motor, and functional impairments {{more severe than}} their noninstitutionalized counterparts. Tai-chi emphasizes body relaxation, alertness, and movement coordination with benefits to balance, focus, and stress relief. This pilot study explored the efficacy of Tai-chi on movement coordination, negative symptoms, and functioning disabilities towards schizophrenia. Methods. A randomized waitlist control design was adopted, where participants were randomized to receive either the 6 -week Tai-chi program and standard residential care or only the latter. 30 Chinese patients with schizophrenia were recruited from a rehabilitation residency. All were assessed on movement coordination, negative symptoms, and functional disabilities at baseline, following intervention and 6 weeks after intervention. Results. Tai-chi buffered from <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> movement coordination and interpersonal functioning, the latter with sustained effectiveness 6 weeks after the class was ended. Controls showed marked <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> those areas. The Tai-chi group also experienced fewer disruptions to life activities at the 6 -week maintenance. There was no significant improvement in negative symptoms after Tai-chi. Conclusions. This study demonstrated encouraging benefits of Tai-chi <b>in</b> preventing <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> movement coordination and interpersonal functioning for residential patients with schizophrenia.

40|$|As {{regard the}} thesis that the terms of trade between primary {{commodities}} and manufactured goods tended to deteriorate during the twentieth century, econometric analysis based on the Grilli-Yang series have not produced decisive results. Many of these have, however, one point in common: the phenomenon, when present, is not continuous over time, but is concentrated in short periods of structural change, a fact which makes it extremely difficult to forecast <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> the future. Work carried out more recently has highlighted the important role volatility {{in the terms of}} trade of primary commodities plays in conditioning any trend deteriorations. Leaving aside empirical results regarding <b>deteriorations</b> <b>in</b> the relation between the prices of primary commodities and manufactures, we believe that the policy insights provided by Prebisch and Singer remain substantially valid today: specialization in the agricultural sector or mining industry have so far not led to external economies able to drive other manufacturing sectors...|$|R
