5|$|After this {{demonstration}} of power, AJ is promoted by his manager. A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows. Soon, AJ is promoted to a rank {{with a private}} office. Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further, finding him corrupt with power. AJ throws them out, and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer—a decrepit man within a robotic business suit. AJ floats {{to the top of}} the suit, from which he spots a beach ball-destroying machine to the side. He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny, who say that he <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> the spirit of summer. Realizing his mistake, AJ rejects the promotion. He returns to his friends outside, and together they plan the rest of their summer.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{environment}} of Poole is characterised by lowland heathland {{to the north}} and wooded chines and coastline to the south. The heathland habitat supports the six native British reptile species and provides a home for a range of dragonflies and rare birds. Development <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> much of the heath but scattered fragments remain to the north of Poole and have been designated Special Protection Areas. The town lies on unresistant beds of Eocene clays (mainly London Clay and Gault Clay), sands and gravels. The River Frome runs through this weak rock, and its many tributaries have carved out a wide estuary. At the mouth of the estuary sand spits have been deposited, enclosing the estuary to create Poole Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North America. As part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of America as a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} events of Baldur's Gate, the hero and companions are {{overcome}} and taken captive. When the game opens, the hero awakens in a cage and is shortly thereafter experimented upon by a wizard named Jon Irenicus. Irenicus is distracted as his complex is attacked by thieves, and disappears to fight them. The hero uses this opportunity {{to escape from the}} complex with a few other companions, including Imoen and emerges into the city of Athkatla. As soon as the hero and his party have entered the city proper, they see Irenicus fighting off some of his attackers. After he <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> his attackers, he notices the hero and his companions. An argument ensues, during which Imoen angrily attacks Irenicus using magic. Immediately Cowled Wizards appear, after a fight arrest both Irenicus and Imoen for the unsanctioned use of magic, and teleport both of them away.|$|E
5|$|Steph {{sleeps with}} Niall. Niall then kills Tina Reilly (Leah Hackett) in an {{explosion}} and reveals {{that he was in}} fact Myra McQueen's (Nicole Barber-Lane) son. Fearing Niall's attentions are on herself, she goes to Scotland to stay with Craig. Niall follows her and holds her, Tom and Craig hostage. He tries to make her run away with him. Steph tricks Niall into believing she will run away with him but is later caught by Niall when she tries to call the police. Steph manages to get away and this results in Steph, Craig and Niall having a brawl {{on the edge of a}} cliff. When Steph reveals to Niall she will never love him he jumps off the cliff. Steph is left devastated by another loss in her life. When she returns home she finds that Niall <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> her wedding photos, the only piece of Max she had left. The sheer amount of trauma Steph has faced made her extremely shaken and she decided to leave for a break once more.|$|E
5|$|Travelling to Hukow {{with the}} ransom money for Fang, Tintin comes across a flood that <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> a village and rescues a young Chinese orphan, Chang Chong-Chen. Chang accompanies Tintin to Hukow, {{where one of}} Mitsuhirato's spies ambushes them; they realise {{that it was a}} trap and that Fang was not there. Meanwhile, the detectives Thomson and Thompson are {{employed}} by Dawson to arrest Tintin, but fail on multiple occasions. Returning to Shanghai, Tintin intends to confront Mitsuhirato, and allows himself to be captured by him. Being held prisoner at The Blue Lotus, it is revealed that Mitsuhirato is working with the film director Rastapopoulos, who {{is the head of the}} international opium smuggling organisation that Tintin had previously battled in Cigars of the Pharaoh. However, Tintin formulates a plan, with Chang and the Sons of the Dragon appearing to rescue Tintin and Fang; Rastapopoulos is arrested while Mitsuhirato commits seppuku. Fang develops a cure for Rajaijah, while Wang adopts Chang as his son.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone <b>has</b> <b>destroyed</b> Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E
