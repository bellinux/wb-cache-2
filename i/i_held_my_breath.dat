500|$|The 1992 Hooters 500, {{the final}} {{race of the}} 1992 season, is {{considered}} one of the most eventful races in NASCAR history. It was the final race for Richard Petty and the first for Jeff Gordon. Sixdrivers were close enough in the points standings to win the championship that day. Allison led second-place Kulwicki by 30 points, Bill Elliott by 40, Harry Gant by 97, and Kyle Petty by 98 and needed to finish sixth or better to clinch the championship. Kulwicki received approval from NASCAR and Ford to change the [...] "Thunderbird" [...] lettering on his bumper for the race to [...] "underbird" [...] because he felt like the underdog in the contention for the championship. During Kulwicki's first pit stop, the first gear in the car's transmission broke. Andrews said, [...] "We had to leave pit road in fourth gear, because we had broken metal parts in there, and only by leaving it in fourth are you not going to move metal around as much. We could only hope that the loose piece of metal didn't get in there and break the gears in half. We had three or fourpit stops after it broke. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> all day long." [...] Allison was racing in sixthplace, closely behind Ernie Irvan, when Irvan's tire blew with 73 (of 328) laps left in the event. As a result, Allison ran into the side of Irvan's spinning car and his car was too damaged to continue. Kulwicki and Elliott were left to duel for the title. While leading late in the race, Andrews calculated the exact lap for his final pit stop so that Kulwicki would be guaranteed to lead the most laps and would gain fivebonus points. Kulwicki made his final pit stop only after leading enough laps to guarantee the bonus points. To save time, the pit crew did a fuel-only pit stop. Not changing tires allowed them to be available to push the car to prevent it from stalling, since the car had to start moving in a higher gear. Because the team's fuel man hurried to add the gasoline during the quick stop, he did not add the desired amount into the tank. As a result, Kulwicki had to conserve fuel to ensure that his car was still running at the end of the race. Elliott won the race and Kulwicki stretched his fuel to finish second. Kulwicki won the 1992 Winston Cup Championship by maintaining his 10-point lead over Elliott. He celebrated the championship with his second Polish victory lap. Always conscious of his appearance for potential sponsors, Kulwicki combed his hair, making a national television audience wait for him to emerge from his car.|$|E
60|$|His Excellency looked blank. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> {{wondering}} what coup Madame was meditating.|$|E
60|$|The {{recollection}} {{seemed to}} have amused her so much that for the moment <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and ignored her question.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>'eld</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b> Five sailormen {{out of ten}} {{have been}} tattooed with mermaids, and I was one of 'em. When she spoke agin I thought I should ha' dropped.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> fairly <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> a minute, {{and even}} from my glimmering taper there was light enough to show how he smiled up at me from his pillow. [...] "What {{do you mean by}} all the rest?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was near}} to crying aloud with joy when I {{realized}} {{that once he}} set out as Darius predicted, nothing could save him from our clutches, therefore <b>I</b> literally <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as he took his seat in the canoe and pushed off.|$|R
60|$|Her {{beginning}} was so bold that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> {{knowing full well}} as I did that she had chosen the very note.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> for my grandfather's reply. The rector, however, {{had read}} him, and well {{knew that a}} show of {{reluctance}} would but inflame him the more.|$|E
6000|$|And still, {{the central}} {{mystery of the}} murder was no nearer solution. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> in terror. Had I really any sort of {{justification}} in killing him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do? Why, <b>I</b> jist <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and looked, and in {{a minute}} it kind o' faded away, and I {{got up and went}} to the bed, but the man was gone. He lay there with the pleasantest smile on his face that ever you see; and I woke up Ruey, and told her about it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> almost <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as <b>I</b> gazed upon it and {{the terrace}} lawns, sloping away below, smooth-shaven, velvetty, the very {{perfection}} of English turf. Not that I had much time to look about me. On the contrary, my conductor never once slackened his pace, and when I involuntarily paused for a moment, with eyes riveted upon the magnificent pile before me, he looked round sharply and beckoned me impatiently to proceed.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>I</b> paused, <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> in such silence, {{and listened}} apart; And the tent shook, for mighty Saul shuddered: and sparkles 'gan dart From the jewels that woke in his turban, at once with a start, All its lordly male-sapphires, and rubies courageous at heart. So the head: but the body still moved not, still hung there erect. And I bent {{once again to}} my playing, pursued it unchecked, As I sang,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just {{pretending to}} be dead. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> for I saw {{he had come to}} the {{conclusion}} that he could not be overlooked much longer, and was going to make a move.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> {{and gazed}} at Ray. For the moment {{it seemed as though}} the tables were turned. No signs of emotion were present in his face, but he seemed to have no words. He simply looked at her.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> I think, as I {{stood in}} ravished contemplation of that white vision. If this were Lavedan, {{and that the}} cold Roxalanne who had sent my bold Chatellerault back to Paris empty-handed then were my task a very welcome one.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>I</b> paused, <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> in such silence, {{and listened}} apart; [...] And the tent shook, for mighty Saul shuddered; and sparkles 'gan dart [...] From the jewels that woke in his turban, at once with a start, [...] All its lordly male-sapphires, and rubies courageous at [...] 65 [...] heart. [...] So the head; but the body still moved not, still hung there erect. [...] And I bent {{once again to}} my playing, pursued it unchecked, [...] As I sang: ...|$|R
60|$|The cab {{pulled up}} with a jerk {{underneath}} a long row of brightly burning lights. We dismounted, and I followed Mr. Marx up a broad flight of thickly carpeted stairs into a semi-circular corridor draped with crimson hangings and dimly lit with rose-coloured lights. A faint perfume hung about the place, and from below came the soft melody of a rhythmical German waltz which the orchestra was playing. <b>I</b> almost <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> with a curious mixture of expectation and excitement, as I followed Mr. Marx and an attendant down the corridor.|$|R
60|$|Of {{a sudden}} the roaring ceased, and I felt myself {{buffeting}} the water fiercely in my efforts to reach the surface. I know not how I got free, but I suppose {{the turn of the}} line must have slackened off somehow. All this happened within the space of a few brief moments; but oh! they seemed fearfully long to me. I do not think <b>I</b> could have <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> a second longer.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> for to {{me there}} is nothing more awe-inspiring than when a man discovers to you the nakedness of his soul. Then you see that no one is so trivial or debased but that in him is a spark of {{something}} to excite compassion.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> for {{a moment}} in amazement. Since when had {{thoughts}} like this come to her? I knew then that the days of her childhood were numbered indeed, that, underneath the fresh joyous grace of her delightful youth, the woman's instincts were stirring. And I was afraid! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand. No, I should say, not one; though {{here and}} there one nearly had it--so nearly that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> from not being quite sure. But, on the other hand, I should {{say that there was}} a good deal of excellence, if you know what that means." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It'll be {{the worse}} {{for you if you}} make me do all this work,' Mr. Fox said, {{breathing}} loud, for he didn't like to dig so hard for one small rabbit, and <b>I</b> just really <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>I</b> was so afraid Sonny Bunny would think he could make matters any easier by trusting to that treacherous fox. But the little fellow had good sense and lay still as a mouse, so the miserable villain began digging again.|$|R
60|$|My dulled faculties dragged {{themselves}} partly back to {{life and}} took a receptive attitude. Now out of an immense, a limitless distance, came a something which grew and grew, and approached, and presently was recognizable as a sound--it had rather {{seemed to be a}} feeling, before. This sound was a mile away, now--perhaps it was the murmur of a storm; and now it was nearer--not {{a quarter of a mile}} away; was it the muffled rasping and grinding of distant machinery? No, it came still nearer; was it the measured tramp of a marching troop? But it came nearer still, and still nearer--and at last it was right in the room: it was merely a mouse gnawing the woodwork. So <b>I</b> had <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> all that time for such a trifle.|$|R
6000|$|... “Something in {{this sort}} of style,” he replied; and at the same moment, to my horror, he slipped {{sideways}} off the rock, and, as I then thought, by good fortune merely, alighted among the spreading branches of a species of palm tree, that shooting its hardy roots along a ledge below, curved its trunk upwards into the air, and presented a thick mass of foliage about twenty feet below the spot where we had thus suddenly been brought to a stand-still. <b>I</b> voluntarily <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> expecting to see the form of my companion, after being sustained for a moment by the branches of the tree, sink through their frail support, and fall headlong to the bottom. To my surprise and joy, however, he recovered himself, and disentangling his limbs from the fractured branches, he peered out from his leafy bed, and shouted lustily, “Come on, my hearty, there is no other alternative!” and with this he ducked beneath the foliage, and slipping down the trunk, stood in a moment at least fifty feet beneath me, upon the broad shelf of rock from which sprung the tree he had descended.|$|R
60|$|My {{description}} {{can give}} {{no idea how}} suddenly the fountain was thus tenanted and how soon it was left desolate. I breathed, {{and there was the}} face; <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and it was gone. Had it passed away or faded into nothing? I doubted whether it had ever been.|$|E
60|$|He turned round again, and {{remained}} gazing with fixed eyes into the darkness. Then <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and stooping forward, with the penknife in my hand, commenced steadily sawing {{at the bottom}} knot which bound the sail to the mast. Directly it parted I cut a great slit in the sail itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cicely! Cicely! Cicely!" [...] I called, and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> [...] And [...] "Cicely!" [...] {{came from}} the canyon,--and all was as still as death. [...] And [...] "Cicely! Cicely! Cicely!" [...] {{came from the}} rocks below, [...] And jest but a whisper of [...] "Cicely!" [...] down from them peaks of snow.|$|E
60|$|I was frankly, {{at the end}} {{of three}} days, a very prejudiced critic, so that one morning when, in the garden, my great man had offered to read me {{something}} <b>I</b> quite <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> as <b>I</b> listened. It was the written scheme of another book—something put aside long ago, before his illness, but that he had lately taken out again to reconsider. He had been turning it round when I came down on him, and it had grown magnificently under this second hand. Loose liberal confident, it might have passed for a great gossiping eloquent letter—the overflow into talk of an artist’s amorous plan. The theme I thought singularly rich, quite the strongest he had yet treated; and this familiar statement of it, full too of fine maturities, was really, in summarised splendour, a mine of gold, a precious independent work. I remember rather profanely wondering whether the ultimate production could possibly keep at the pitch. His reading of the fond epistle, at any rate, made me feel as if I were, for the advantage of posterity, in close correspondence with him—were the distinguished person to whom it had been affectionately addressed. It was a high distinction simply to be told such things. The idea he now communicated had all the freshness, the flushed fairness, of the conception untouched and untried: it was Venus rising from the sea and before the airs had blown upon her. I had never been so throbbingly present at such an unveiling. But when he had tossed the last bright word after the others, as I had seen cashiers in banks, weighing mounds of coin, drop a final sovereign into the tray, I knew a sudden prudent alarm.|$|R
6000|$|I hopped {{onto the}} carpet and <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and shut <b>my</b> eyes and wished I was in the booking-office of my own section. The very next instant a voice I knew sung out in a {{business}} kind of a way-- ...|$|R
60|$|At {{a quarter}} to twelve one morning, soon after this, I was sitting with Mrs Monnerie on a stool beneath Chakka's cage, and Susan {{was just about to}} leave us--was {{actually}} smoothing on the thumb of her glove; when Marvell announced that a Miss Bowater had called. I turned cold all over and <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> {{with fear}} and dread; For into the square, with a brazen tread, There rode a figure whose stately head [...] O'erlooked the review that morning, That never bowed from its firm-set seat When the living column passed its feet, Yet now rode {{steadily}} up the street [...] To the phantom bugle's warning: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you love}} {{this time of}} the evening, Mr. Wooster, when the sun has gone to bed and all the bunnies come out to have their little suppers? When I was a child, I used to think that rabbits were gnomes, and that if <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath</b> and stayed quite still, I should see the fairy queen." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw Lane {{glance at}} him with a puzzled expression, and next moment try to signal the stranger, who was clearly in league with him, and fail in the attempt to attract his attention. Then <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> for, after two more {{reluctant}} bids, there was only silence when the auctioneer repeated the last offer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will try," [...] I answered, [...] "but it's a long shot." [...] Dismounting, I {{climbed a}} pile of stones and, resting my rifle on the topmost of them, took a very full sight, aimed, <b>held</b> <b>my</b> <b>breath,</b> and pressed the trigger. A second {{afterwards}} the shouter of insults threw his arms wide, letting fall his spear, and pitched forward on to his face.|$|R
60|$|So we {{rose and}} went home. But <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> peace, for <b>I</b> was afraid, very much afraid.|$|R
60|$|The {{manager was}} a grave, calm man. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>my</b> fifty-six dollars {{clutched}} in a crumpled ball in my pocket.|$|R
