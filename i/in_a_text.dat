5|$|Vaishnava {{followers}} including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayendra Tirtha (1514–93) {{refute the}} portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as they consider the Shaivite Puranas as tamasic - and thus not authoritative - based on their reading of Sattvic Puranas and Shruti texts. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> by Vijayindra Tirtha called Shaivasarvasvakhandanam.|$|E
5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela15 records that he was already ruling Copán by AD504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> on Stela16 from Caracol, a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|Flare: The {{earliest}} recorded use of gunpowder for signalling purposes was the 'signal bomb' {{used by the}} Song Dynasty Chinese as the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty besieged Yangzhou in 1276. These soft-shelled bombs, {{timed to}} explode in mid-air, were used to send messages to a detachment of troops far in the distance. Another mention of the signal bomb appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> dating from 1293 requesting their collection from those still stored in Zhejiang. A signal gun appears in Korea by 1600. The Wu I Thu Phu Thung Chih or Illustrated Military Encyclopedia written in 1791 depicts a signal gun in an illustration.|$|E

25|$|TeX is {{an example}} of a {{computer}} typesetting system that makes use of ligatures automatically. The Computer Modern Roman typeface provided with TeX includes the five common ligatures ff, fi, fl, ffi, and ffl. When TeX finds these combinations <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>text,</b> it substitutes the appropriate ligature, unless overridden by the typesetter. Opinion is divided over whether it is the job of writers or typesetters to decide where to use ligatures.|$|E
25|$|Use of Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects limits interoperability, {{because these}} objects are not widely {{supported}} in programs for viewing or editing files (e.g. embedding of other files inside the file, such as tables or charts from a spreadsheet application <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>text</b> document or presentation file).

25|$|When {{opened by}} a text editor, human-readable content is {{presented}} to the user. This often consists of the file's plain text visible to the user. Depending on the application, control codes may be rendered either as literal instructions acted upon by the editor, or as visible escape characters that can be edited as plain text.
