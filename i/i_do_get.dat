500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. But I like to think I bring a lot more to the game and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E
500|$|Park's music {{takes its}} roots in R and hip hop, more {{specifically}} from the 90's. He {{is influenced by the}} work of American artists he grew up listening to, such as Usher, Michael Jackson, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Ginuwine, Musiq Soulchild, Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Canibus. Park credits Usher as his idol and as one of his biggest influences, who he started listening to in the 6th grade. He also cites Michael Jackson as his role model, as [...] "he is the best". He cites both Usher and Michael Jackson as singers and dancers who influence him vocally and in dance, as he attempts to mimic them, looking at their music videos. Park also cites Chris Brown as an inspiration, and wants [...] "to be a singer who can be good at both singing and rapping like [...] ". Park began listening to hip hop music when he was in second grade, after one of his cousins let him listen to Warren G's [...] "Regulate". In general, Park stated he [...] "doesn't really listen to music to get inspiration, I listen to music because I listen to music, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> inspired when I listen to music, it definitely helps".|$|E
500|$|Months later, {{during an}} April 1988 {{appearance}} on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump discussed his displeasure with the United States' {{status as a}} [...] "debtor nation" [...] and its seeming inability to compete with Japan. [...] Winfrey asked Trump if he would ever run for president. [...] He replied, [...] "Probably not, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> tired of seeing the country get ripped off ... I just don't think I have the inclination to do it." [...] Furthermore, he asserted that if he ever did run, he would win the election. [...] He later appeared at the 1988 Republican National Convention. [...] In an interview on the floor, NBC News reporter Chris Wallace asked whether Trump's visit to his first national convention would induce him to [...] "take the plunge" [...] into a presidential campaign. [...] In response, Trump downplayed his prior exploration into presidential politics, though repeated that he would win if he ever ran, and praised then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee George H. W. Bush. [...] During another convention interview on Larry King Live, Trump dismissed the speculation that he had considered running for president and commented, [...] "I doubt I’ll ever be involved in politics beyond what I do right now." [...] Talk of a potential Trump candidacy grew silent {{for much of the}} next decade.|$|E

500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> {{a chance to talk to}} them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E
500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> beat and [...] comes up and does a moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E

I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry.

If <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> back in, I don't want to be a coach... I want to be a manager, but that's easier said than done... I {{want to be able to}} pick the team, make the decisions and everything that goes with it. That said, I can't do anything without my badges", he told the Liverpool Echo.|$|E

After the videos completion, Minogue hosted a special website that required her fans to use Twitter to hashtag [...] "KylieTimebomb" [...] {{in order to}} unlock the music video. The campaign was an extreme success on Twitter, with over 25,000 tweets in under an hour and 10 tweets per second and the hashtag was subjected {{as one of the}} trending topics worldwide.

2500|$|On 17 April 1964 Springfield issued {{her debut}} album A Girl Called Dusty which {{included}} mostly remakes of her favourite songs. Among the tracks were [...] "Mama Said," [...] "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes," [...] "You Don't Own Me," [...] and [...] "Twenty Four Hours from Tulsa." [...] The album reached No.6 in the UK in May 1964. The chart hits [...] "Stay Awhile," [...] "All Cried Out," [...] and [...] "Losing You" [...] {{followed the same}} year. The B-side of [...] "Stay Awhile" [...] featured another self-penned track, [...] "Somethin' Special," [...] which AllMusic's Richie Unterberger described as [...] "a first-rate Springfield original". However, Springfield declared: [...] "I don't really {{see myself as a}} songwriter. I don't really like writing... I just don't get any good ideas and the ones <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> are pinched from other records. The only reason I write is for the money – oh mercenary creature!" [...] In 1964, Springfield recorded two Burt Bacharach songs: [...] "Wishin' and Hopin'" [...] – a US Top10 hit – and the emotional [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself," [...] which reached No.3 on the UK chart. The latter song set the standard for much of her later material. In December 1964, Springfield's tour of South Africa with her group The Echoes was controversially terminated, and she was deported, after they performed for an integrated audience at a theatre near Cape Town, which was against the then government's segregation policy. Her contract specifically excluded segregated performances, making her one of the first British artists to do so. In the same year, she was voted the Top Female British Artist {{of the year in the}} New Musical Express poll, topping Lulu, Sandie Shaw, and Cilla Black. Springfield received the award again for the next three years. During 1965, Springfield released three more UK Top40 hits: [...] "Your Hurtin' Kinda Love," [...] "In the Middle of Nowhere," [...] and the Carole King-penned [...] "Some of Your Lovin'." [...] However, these were not included on her next UK album recorded with The Echoes, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty, which was released in October 1965 and featured songs by Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley, Rod Argent, and Randy Newman, and a cover of the traditional Mexican song, [...] "La Bamba." [...] The album peaked at No.6 on the UK chart.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's {{hair has}} {{dominated}} her many styles {{and she has}} had several different hair colours. When asked about her character's [...] "crazy" [...] hair styles Fox revealed that the ideas for the styles are a collaboration of her own ideas and the production teams': [...] "I had a brown bob forever and I was sick to death of it, so when {{we came out of}} the Jake storyline last year, they wanted to change the image. They asked me if I wanted to dye it any colour, so I thought 'let's go red'". Fox said that her initial Hollyoaks image featuring green hair was [...] "definitely not a good look". She added that during her tenura Nancy has had a [...] "few hair disasters", especially the in between stages when she [...] "went back to black from red and then to blonde". She said that since her character has been through so much she no longer feels it necessary to [...] "desperately shock" [...] everyone with her hair styles as she has had to grow up and evolve. Fox said she enjoys Nancy's style which has [...] "evolved" [...] as she has [...] "been a Goth, she’s been a New Romantic and now I like to call her Dusty Springfield on acid! It’s a bit Duffy, a bit ’50s-style, and now I’ve got the red hair it gives us more to play with". Fox added that [...] "one of my favourite things about being in a soap for a long time - <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>get</b> to change my image a lot". She said that she enjoys the feedback she receives from her style changes and when her latest style was aired and she had [...] "cut it into a short bob, I got so many tweets from people - some negative, but mostly positive thankfully". She said that she would be open to changing her image in future. Fox has also commented on Nancy's large tattoo on her back, which she deemed to be [...] "too masculine". Fox said that when she was initially on the serial she found it [...] "great to be different" [...] but felt that it was difficult playing the [...] "alternative" [...] character of Nancy when her colleagues were such [...] "gorgeous, glamourous women". The tattoo has since disappeared. Of the character's dress sense the Hollyoaks wardrobe department said [...] "Nancy Hayton has a unique distinctive look on Hollyoaks. She wears rich colours and vibrant patterns, which compliment [...] her slim shape".|$|E
