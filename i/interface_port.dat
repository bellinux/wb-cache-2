These offer performance comparable to internal drives, {{limited by the}} current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface (in practice about 30MB/s for USB 2.0 and potentially 400MB/s or more for USB 3.0). These external drives typically include a [...] "translating device" [...] that bridges between a drive's interface to a USB <b>interface</b> <b>port.</b> Functionally, the drive appears to the user much like an internal drive. Other competing standards for external drive connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently Thunderbolt.|$|E

Tempted by the wealth of information and technology available to him, he has an advanced computer <b>interface</b> <b>port,</b> activated by a click of the fingers, installed in his head {{that allows him to}} access the future's computer system. He attempts to transmit information back to 21st century Earth using Rose's modified mobile phone, but this backfires when the villains running the station attempt to extract information on the Doctor directly from Adam's brain.

5000|$|The {{general format}} of EDIF {{involves}} using parentheses to delimit data definitions, {{and in this}} way it superficially resembles Lisp. The basic tokens of EDIF 2.0.0 were keywords (like library, cell, instance, etc.), strings (delimited with double quotes), integer numbers, symbolic constants (e.g. GENERIC, TIE, RIPPER for cell types) and [...] "Identifiers", which are reference labels formed from a very restricted set of characters. EDIF 3.0.0 and 4.0.0 dropped the symbolic constants entirely, using keywords instead.So, the syntax of EDIF has a fairly simple foundation. A typical EDIF file looks like this: (edif fibex (edifVersion 2 0 0) (edifLevel 0) (keywordMap (keywordLevel 0)) (status (written (timeStamp 1995 1 1 1 1 1) (program [...] "xxx" [...] (version [...] "v1")))) (library xxx (edifLevel 0) (technology (numberDefinition (scale 1 (e 1 -6) (unit distance)))) (cell dff_4 (cellType generic) (view view1 (viewType netlist) (<b>interface</b> (<b>port</b> aset (direction INPUT)) (port clok (direction INPUT)) ...

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} network {{interface}} for an on-chip network. Our network interface decouples computation from communication by offering a shared-memory abstraction, which is independent of the network implementation. We use a transactionbased protocol to achieve backward compatibility with existing bus protocols such as AXI, OCP and DTL. Our network interface has a modular architecture, which allows flexible instantiation. It provides both guaranteed and best-effort services via connections. These are configured via network <b>interface</b> <b>ports</b> using the network itself, instead of a separate control interconnect. An example instance of this network <b>interface</b> with 4 <b>ports</b> has an area of 0. 143 mm 2 in a 0. 13 µm technology, and runs at 500 MHz. ...|$|R

Another popular {{example of this is}} Game Genie for Genesis, NES, Super NES, Game Boy, and Game Gear game consoles. Modern disc-based cheat hardware include GameShark and Code Breaker which modify game code from a large database of cheats. In later generation consoles, cheat cartridges have come to be replaced by cheat discs, containing a simple loader program which loads a game disc and modifies the main executable before starting it.|$|E

50|$|SiConnect's {{first product}} was the PLT050, which was {{launched}} in 2007. This was the digital baseband integrated circuit for its 21Mbit/s POEM powerline comms technology. It presented Ethernet and USB data-plane traffic interfaces, {{as well as a}} host-processor <b>interface</b> <b>port</b> for control-plane management. The PLT050 was built on UMC's 0.18 micron digital process. The PLT050 required an external analog front-end (AFE) circuit, including an integrated component for high-speed and scalable A/D and D/A conversion. Initial powerline modems built around the PLT050 used Analog Devices's AD9865 integrated AFE part, in common with the powerline modem designs from other silicon manufacturers. SiConnect had designed its own integrated AFE, codenamed the SCA10, which delivered superior performance at lower cost than the AD9865. The company intended to combine the SCA10 with the PLT050 in a single package to sell a single-package solution {{to be known as the}} PLi050, but this had not come to market before SiConnect ceased trading.|$|E

5000|$|One-armed routers that perform traffic {{forwarding}} {{are often}} implemented on virtual local area networks (VLANs). They {{would use a}} single Ethernet network <b>interface</b> <b>port</b> {{that is part of}} two or more Virtual LANs, enabling them to be joined. A VLAN allows multiple virtual LANs to coexist on the same physical LAN. This means that two machines attached to the same switch cannot send Ethernet frames to each other even though they pass over the same wires. If they need to communicate, then a router must be placed between the two VLANs to forward packets, just as if the two LANs were physically isolated. The only difference is that the router in question may contain only a single Ethernet network interface controller (NIC) that is part of both VLANs. Hence, [...] "one-armed". While uncommon, hosts on the same physical medium may be assigned with addresses and to different networks. A one-armed router could be assigned addresses for each network and be used to forward traffic between locally distinct networks and to remote networks through another gateway.|$|E
