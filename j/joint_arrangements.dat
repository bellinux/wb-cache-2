The mayor's statutory planning strategy is published as the London Plan, which was most recently revised in 2011. The local authorities are the councils of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London Corporation. They are responsible for most local services, such as local planning, schools, social services, local roads and refuse collection. Certain functions, such as waste management, are provided through <b>joint</b> <b>arrangements.</b> In 2009–2010 the combined revenue expenditure by London councils and the GLA amounted to just over £22 billion (£14.7 billion for the boroughs and £7.4 billion for the GLA).|$|E

The county council was reconstituted in 1974 as a non-metropolitan county council, regaining jurisdiction in Southend-on-Sea; however, the non-metropolitan county was reduced in size in 1998 and the council passed responsibilities to Southend-on-Sea Borough Council and Thurrock Council in those districts. For certain services the three authorities co-operate through <b>joint</b> <b>arrangements,</b> such as the Essex fire authority.|$|E

25|$|A German {{attack from}} {{south-eastern}} Belgium towards Mézières {{and a possible}} offensive from Lorraine towards Verdun, Nancy and St. Dié was anticipated; the plan was an evolution from Plan XVI and made more provision {{for the possibility of}} a German offensive from the north through Belgium. The First, Second and Third armies were to concentrate between Épinal and Verdun opposite Alsace and Lorraine, the Fifth Army was to assemble from Montmédy to Sedan and Mézières and the Fourth Army was to be held back west of Verdun, ready to move east to attack the southern flank of a German invasion through Belgium or southwards against the northern flank of an attack through Lorraine. No formal provision was made for combined operations with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) but <b>joint</b> <b>arrangements</b> had been made and in 1911 during the Second Moroccan Crisis, the French had been told that six British divisions could be expected to operate around Maubeuge.|$|E

40|$|DE 102009035877 A 1 UPAB: 20110307 NOVELTY - The element (1) has a {{movement}} unit (2) translatory movable in spatial directions (X, Y). A solid joint assembly (4) includes a solid <b>joint</b> <b>arrangement</b> (4 a) forming a lever (H 1), and is mechanically coupled {{to the movement}} unit. Another solid joint assembly (5) includes a solid <b>joint</b> <b>arrangement</b> (5 a), and is mechanically coupled to the movement unit and/or the former joint assembly. The <b>joint</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the latter joint assembly is deflectable by an actuator, and the movement unit is translatory deflectable in one of spatial directions due to coupling of the latter joint assembly. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The actuator {{is formed as a}} piezoactuator. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a device for positioning an object and/or for machining a workpiece (2) a method for executing translatory balance movements in spatial directions. USE - Balance actuating element for use in a device i. e. industrial robot system, for positioning an object and/or for machining a workpiece (all claimed), for executing translatory balance movements in spatial directions. ADVANTAGE - The <b>joint</b> <b>arrangement</b> is deflectable by the actuator, and the movement unit is translatory deflectable in the spatial direction due to the coupling of the joint assembly, such that static and dynamic translatory positioning errors are balanceable three-dimensionally and high-dynamic positioning- and/or balance movements are provided in a regulated manner and dynamic oscillation compensations of high frequency oscillations are provided while providing an accurate device for micrometer-exact positioning of an object and/or for machining a workpiece in three spatial directions.

500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research. [...] Children in <b>joint</b> custody <b>arrangements</b> often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also less likely to feel torn between their parents when compared with children who are in sole custody arrangements. In addition, children in <b>joint</b> custody <b>arrangements</b> report feeling closer to both parents than children in sole custody <b>arrangements.</b> <b>Joint</b> custody <b>arrangements</b> also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents in <b>joint</b> custody <b>arrangements</b> report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those in sole custody <b>arrangements,</b> but <b>joint</b> custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce. However, {{it is important to}} point out that children are far less likely to do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents' frequent, intense, and ongoing conflict.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} plasterboard joints on the fire performance of cold-formed steel walls. Plasterboard joints are unavoidable. However, they can be arranged {{in a way that}} they do not significantly influence the fire performance of cold-formed steel walls. Hence a research study into the effects of plasterboard joints on the fire performance of plasterboard lined cold-formed steel walls was undertaken using both full-scale fire tests and numerical studies. In this study a back-blocking technique was used to eliminate the plasterboard joints being located over the studs. Instead plasterboard joints were used between studs with 150 mm wide plasterboards as back-blocks. Both experimental and numerical results from this study show that the fire resistance rating of single plasterboard lined cold-formed steel walls can be increased by 25 % through the use of a back-blocking <b>joint</b> <b>arrangement</b> in comparison to the traditional plasterboard <b>joint</b> <b>arrangement</b> over the studs...|$|R
