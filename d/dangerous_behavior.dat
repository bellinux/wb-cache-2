25|$|Social psychologists study group-related (collective) {{phenomena}} such as {{the behavior}} of crowds. An important concept {{in this area is}} deindividuation, a reduced state of self-awareness that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior.</b> It is common in crowds and mobs, {{but it can also be}} caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} B-47's long, {{swept wing}} {{was prone to}} twisting during roll maneuvers which caused a <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior</b> known as aileron reversal to occur at airspeeds lower than expected. Based on experience with earlier aircraft, Townsend proposed the use of spoiler ailerons on the B-47 to reduce this unwanted behavior. The use of spoiler ailerons to reduce wing twisting was first tested on the B-47, and although not used on production B-47s, became standard issue for lateral control on many later jets.|$|E
25|$|After the G.I. Joe Team disbanded, Duke disappeared. It {{was later}} learned that he'd been {{performing}} Black Ops for a secret government agency, his missions of which are still highly classified. One such mission was to locate and detain the mercenary Major Bludd, which led to evidence that Cobra Commander had returned, and hastened the reinstatement of G.I. Joe. Duke returned to active duty in G.I. Joe when the team was reinstated, though his maverick and <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior</b> took some of his longtime colleagues by surprise, and caused him to relinquish his position as field commander for a more behind-the-scenes advisory role.|$|E

25|$|Borderline {{personality}} disorder (BPD), {{also known as}} emotionally unstable {{personality disorder}}, is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by unstable relationships with other people, unstable sense of self, and unstable emotions. There is often frequent <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior,</b> a feeling of emptiness, self-harm, and an extreme fear of abandonment. Symptoms may be brought on by seemingly normal events. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs {{across a variety of}} situations. Substance abuse, depression, and eating disorders are commonly associated with BPD. BPD increases the risk of self-harm and 10% of people affected die by suicide.|$|E
25|$|People {{who are not}} {{registered}} {{players are}} not allowed to interfere with gameplay. Under the original rules, this includes spying on the other team, or helping players stay in a safe area by bringing them food or doing something for a player which would otherwise require them to leave a safe-zone. If a non-player is shot with a Nerf dart or attacked by a player in any way, they should report the player(s) involved if the incident was intentional. Players who attack non-players will be banned under most rules. The original rules, and most University custom rules, stress the importance of safety in the game. The rules stress the safety of the players and non-players by not allowing realistic looking weaponry, weaponry which could hurt on impact, or <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior</b> during gameplay.|$|E
500|$|On 15 May 1969, a Soviet Government decree (No. 345–209) {{was issued}} [...] "On {{measures}} for preventing <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior</b> (acts) {{on the part}} of mentally ill persons." [...] This decree confirmed the practice of having undesirables hauled into detention by psychiatrists. Soviet psychiatrists were told whom they should examine and were assured that they might detain these individuals {{with the help of the}} police or entrap them into coming to the hospital. The psychiatrists thereby doubled as interrogators and as arresting officers. Doctors fabricated a diagnosis requiring detention and no court decision was required for subjecting the individual to indefinite confinement in a psychiatric institution.|$|E
40|$|One {{adult and}} three {{adolescent}} mothers with 1 -year-old infants {{were taught to}} reduce their infants' potential for injury in the home. After being taught to increase their positive interactions with their infants, the mothers were taught to child-proof the home, to use playpen time-out for potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and to give positive attention for safe behaviors. A multiple baseline design across subjects {{was used to evaluate}} functional control. Potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>behaviors,</b> observed during 10 min of free play, decreased from variable and, at times, high rates during baseline to stable near-zero rates after treatment.

500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a [...] "scathing" [...] dissenting opinion, {{in which}} {{he argued that the}} tip was unreliable, and that the majority's opinion {{threatened}} the freedom and liberty of all citizens. Likewise, many commentators have noted Navarette represented a departure from earlier precedent, and that the opinion opened the door for expansive new police powers. Some commentators have also noted that the case leaves open several important questions, including the unanswered question of whether anonymous reports of extremely <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior</b> require fewer indicia of reliability before police may act upon those reports. Other scholars have argued it was highly unlikely that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were actually driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol when they were stopped by police.|$|E
500|$|Similarly, the lyricism of Trouble {{deviates}} {{from that}} of Perfectionist. While the latter explored Kills' ambitions and perfectionism, the former narrates her upbringing and adolescence, when she left her home and pursued <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior.</b> Kills stated that she conceptualized the album in order to depict her experiences as a teenager and feelings of [...] "having no control", as she did not identify with recent, [...] "happy" [...] popular music. She regarded this attempt as difficult, since it involved the confrontation of her past problems; nonetheless, Kills desired to reflect them in the songs' lyrics as she felt they had defined her personality. She also stated that [...] "once [...] started writing, [...] couldn't stop" [...] and compared the process to a [...] "confession".|$|E
500|$|Users {{having a}} {{pleasant}} experience can {{feel a sense}} of connection to others, nature, and the universe; other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified. Users having an unpleasant experience (a [...] "bad trip") describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior.</b> In general, the phrase [...] "bad trip" [...] is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip, including [...] "tripping" [...] during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: set and setting). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip. Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline. However, in the Psychedelics Encyclopedia, author Peter Stafford noted, [...] "The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating. It tends to build connections between people, who are generally much more in communication than when they use LSD." ...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of anger behind the wheel on driving {{behavior}} and accident involvement {{has been the subject}} of many studies. However, few studies have explored the interaction between anger and driving experience on <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behavior.</b> This study is a moderated mediation analysis of {{the effect of}} trait anger, driving anger, and driving experience on driving behavior. A sample of 303 drivers was tested using the Trait Anger Scale (TAS), the Driving Anger Scale (DAS), and the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI). The results showed that trait anger and driving anger were positively correlated with <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behavior.</b> Driving anger partially mediated the effect of trait anger on <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behavior.</b> Driving experience moderated the relationship between trait anger and driving anger. It also moderated the effect of driving anger on <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behavior.</b> These results suggest that drivers with more driving experience may be safer as they are not easily irritated during driving. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between driving anger and negative driving outcomes, such as <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behaviors</b> and traffic violations, {{has been the}} topic of several studies, but few studies have explored drivers&# 39; angry thoughts when they encounter anger-provoking situations and the potential consequences of such thoughts. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate drivers&# 39; angry thoughts behind the wheel and their relationship with <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behaviors.</b> A total of 303 Chinese drivers completed the Chinese version of the Driver&# 39;s Angry Thoughts Questionnaire (DATQ), the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI) and the Driving Anger Scale (DAS). A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the Chinese DATQ yielded a five-factor solution with 20 items that showed the best goodness of fit for the data. The brief DATQ also showed good reliability and validity. Three forms of aggressive thinking were positively correlated with <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behaviors,</b> and coping self-instruction was negatively correlated with <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behaviors</b> and traffic violations. More importantly, aggressive thinking mediated the effect of driving anger on <b>dangerous</b> driving <b>behaviors,</b> indicating the importance of thoughts behind the wheel. These results provide evidence supporting the development of strategies to reduce and prevent aggressive driving and accidents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

500|$|Like serials {{throughout}} history, {{soap operas}} use the unstable {{identity as a}} literary device, which {{is evidenced by the}} genre's use of mistaken identities, evil twins, and characters that suffer from multiple personality disorder and whom come back from the dead. [...] Identity is used in the rape storyline as well. [...] Before the rape, Todd was crude yet still human, but afterwards, he became a dehumanized embodiment of rage, demonstrated by Todd's bizarre and <b>dangerous</b> <b>behavior</b> after his conviction. Powell Lord, whose name is full of the same kind of symbolism Dickens used when choosing his characters' names and who initially urges his friends to let Marty go yet ultimately gives into peer pressure, is a [...] "relative 'good character as compared to Todd's absolute evil' identity". In Hayward's opinion, [...] "The show also departs from the rape paradigm not only by insisting on the essential 'goodness' of Powell Lord... but even more startlingly by redeeming the evil Todd". [...] Initially, [...] "the increasingly guilt-ridden" [...] Powell is the only rapist who has a conscience. [...] He attempts to convince Todd and Zach to confess their crime, and comes close to confessing to his lawyer. [...] Hayward calls Powell, like Todd, [...] "redeemed", but unlike Todd, was so guilt-ridden that he attempted suicide, was forgiven by Marty, and received a much lighter jail sentence than Zach or Todd.|$|E

5000|$|While {{there are}} many {{benefits}} to engaging in self-disclosure online {{there are also some}} dangers. There is a relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and problematic behavior. Internet abuse can be defined as, [...] "patterns of using the Internet that result in disturbances in a person's life but does not imply a specific disease process or addictive behavior." [...] When a person is high for Internet abuse and high for self-disclosure it can lead to <b>dangerous</b> <b>behaviors</b> like sending personal information (addresses, home phone number etc.) and photos to online acquaintances. High ratings for Internet abuse and self-disclosure also positively influence online communication with all types of online relationships. These relationship types include long-distance relationships, in which people have met face to face and continue the relationship by communicating online; purely virtual relationships, where people meet online and stay in touch only by using the Internet; and migratory mixed-mode, where the relationship begins online and then proceeds to face to face interaction. The relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and <b>dangerous</b> <b>behaviors</b> could pose an even bigger problem with the high number of communications this group has with others, particularly those they have only communicated with online.|$|R

That is why clearly identifying whether or not vehicles/pedestrians are trapped on the tracks and inside the barriers and efficiently using this information may reduce the risk of collisions between trains and vehicles/pedestrians. Obstacle detection systems appear as a breakthrough solution to improve LX safety and lower the number of fatalities.|$|R
