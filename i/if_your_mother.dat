500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> asked you?" ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. Oh, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{were only}} a widow! She's worth six of you.|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s not a joking matter,” said Bertie resentfully: “you wouldn’t find {{it funny}} <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> opened all your letters.” ...|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. Dont know. Dont care. Providence, probably. <b>If</b> not, <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{will have}} it fetched.|$|R
60|$|SIR PEARCE [rising and {{planting}} himself firmly behind the garden seat]. Well, {{the long and}} the short of it is, O'Flaherty, I must decline to be a party to any attempt to deceive <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> I thoroughly disapprove of this feeling against the English, especially at a moment like the present. Even <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> political sympathies are really what you represent them to be, I should think that her gratitude to Gladstone ought to cure her of such disloyal prejudices.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Béla dryly, [...] "if you {{are really}} taking in all the good advice which Ilona so kindly gives you from time to time. You can't do better than model {{yourself}} on her. She is a pattern wife and makes Aladár perfectly happy. I wonder," [...] he reiterated, with something of a sneer, [...] "if you will learn from her, or <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> influence will remain with you for ever?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then can {{you tell}} me <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> expects to churn to-day," [...] said the pretty creature, slowly folding and {{unfolding}} its dainty wings.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But do {{you really}} mean,' said Laura, 'that <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> had been a musician's daughter, and you had {{inherited}} her talent, {{that you would be}} ashamed of it.' ...|$|E
60|$|F-y K-g:--It {{is better}} not to wear your second best hat to church, but <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> says you must {{it is not for}} me to {{question}} her decision.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part. Not leave <b>your</b> <b>mother!</b> <b>If</b> I were <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> I {{would insist}} on your going.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is quite}} right, Ronald," [...] Colonel Leslie said. [...] "The duke {{is capable of}} anything. However, we will be on our guard, and <b>if,</b> as <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> says, it is a {{fortified}} house, we need have no fear of any sudden attack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"You know, dear, it {{troubles}} me a {{good deal}} ... but <b>if</b> I were <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> I don't know how I should feel,"' she quoted.|$|R
60|$|MINNIE. Cut it out, George! (Glancing around apprehensively.) Say, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{was to find}} me here she'd want to send me up to the {{reformatory}} (she frees herself).|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling, I {{object to}} nothing--except giving {{a ball and}} burning my books. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> will yield on these two points, my house is entirely at her disposal." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> my dear Amadis, had not fancied {{your father}} better than somebody, {{you might have}} been that somebody's son. Consider this. Always be a philosopher, even about women.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nollie dear, I didn't {{mean to be}} harsh. <b>If</b> I were <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> I {{should know}} how to make you see, but I'm only an old bumble-daddy." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{abruptly}} Mr. Stanley {{changed his}} key. [...] "You poor child!" [...] he said; [...] "don't {{you see the}} infinite folly of these proceedings? Think! Think of the love and affection you abandon! Think of your aunt, a second mother to you. Think <b>if</b> <b>your</b> own <b>mother</b> was alive!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like {{to praise}} him too much," [...] I rejoined, [...] "lest I should appear to praise myself; {{he reminds me}} {{so much of what}} I was at his age. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> {{beautiful}} <b>mother</b> were to come to life for an hour she would see the resemblance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And the corduroys is mine,' said George Grant. 'My! they be a sight too {{big in the}} band! Run in, Harold, and see <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> can lend us a pin.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, the darling! <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{would only}} come and tell me,-—but she was frightened, and won't say anything. If she won't, I'm the most miserable {{fellow in the}} world." ...|$|E
6000|$|With a short laugh Ruth said, [...] "Well, never mind; {{but perhaps}} you can tell me, Billy, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> ever had a brother {{connected}} with the sea--a sailor, I mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is so, truly, little one,' said Berenger. 'The only {{little girl}} I cold have taken with me {{would have been}} my own;' and as her eyes looked at him wistfully, he added, 'No doubt, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> poor <b>mother</b> could, she would thank this good Mother-prioress for {{teaching}} you to serve God and be a good child.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Treffry glanced uneasily about him. [...] "God knows I don't want {{anything}} but her happiness," [...] he said. [...] "What {{is it to}} me <b>if</b> you'd murdered <b>your</b> <b>mother?</b> It's her I'm thinking of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to my love, {{there can}} be no change in that. <b>If</b> it suits <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> to be disdainful to me, I can bear it. I always thought that it would come to be so some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did I not bid {{you speak}} the truth, Teule? <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{was one of}} them, must you not also be of them; for are you not of your mother's bone and blood?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Norman," [...] {{said his}} father, {{in a voice}} betraying much grief, [...] "it will not do to go on in this way. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> was here, you would not close {{yourself}} against her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't I?" [...] she glowed, with a flirt of {{the head}} {{sideward}} and a white flash of teeth. [...] "If you weren't smoking a cigarette I'd ask you <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> knew you're out, Mr. Babe-in-the-Sandbank." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was halfway}} to the door, but Mr. Cashmore, though so easy, had not done with him. [...] "I suppose you mean that <b>if</b> it's only <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> who's told, you may depend on her to shield you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't be angry, Eustace, if I tell you?" [...] I said. [...] "My uncle, as I {{understood}} him, {{had several}} motives for {{writing to the}} major. One of them was to inquire <b>if</b> he knew <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're quite {{at liberty}} to go," [...] said the earl. [...] "You were never very ceremonious with regard to me; pray don't begin to be so now. Pray go--to-night <b>if</b> you like. <b>Your</b> <b>mother's</b> heart will be broken, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|If {{you see the}} stable-door setting open wide; If you see a tired horse {{lying down}} inside; <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> mends a coat cut about and tore; If the lining's wet and warm--don't you ask no more! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} there is any, but I think that though the crisis might be {{pleasing}} enough, yet <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> found out what was going on, she might be vexed at not having been informed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If she churns to-day, I'll {{fly over}} to the house and try to steal some butter. But <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> isn't going to churn, I'll fly down into the gulch and rob a bees' nest I know of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wretched pedant! Can your intellect be deluded by such barefaced sophistries? [...] "God's will," [...] forsooth! And <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother's</b> {{opposition}} {{is not a}} sign that God's will--if it mean anything except your own will, or that--that man's--is against this mad project, and not for it, what sign would you have? So [...] "celibacy is the highest state!" [...] And why? Because [...] "it is the safest and the easiest road to heaven?" [...] A pretty reason, vicar! I should have thought {{that that was a}} sign of a lower state and not a higher. Noble spirits show their nobleness by daring the most difficult paths. And even if marriage was but one weed-field of temptations, as these miserable pedants say, who have either never tried it, or misused it to their own shame, it would be a greater deed to conquer its temptations than to flee from them in cowardly longings after ease and safety!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's my duty, I fear," [...] said Giles, [...] "to {{take you}} both into custody and lock {{you up in}} a cell for {{breaking}} the teapot {{as well as the}} peace, but I'll be merciful and let you off this time, Monty, <b>if</b> you lend <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> a hand to pick up the pieces." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{forgot that}} I {{probably}} look {{the worse for}} wear," [...] said Festing, who wiped his cut lip. [...] "Still <b>if</b> I met <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> she might get a shock, and now I {{come to think of}} it, I'm no doubt jarring you, so I'll go off and see <b>your</b> agent <b>if</b> you'll tell me where he lives." ...|$|R
