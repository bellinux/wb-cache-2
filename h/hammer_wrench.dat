50|$|Unlike steel, bronze struck {{against a}} hard surface will not {{generate}} sparks, so it (along with beryllium copper) {{is used to}} make <b>hammers,</b> mallets, <b>wrenches</b> and other durable tools {{to be used in}} explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors. Bronze is used to make bronze wool for woodworking applications where steel wool would discolour oak.|$|R

The work is about the losses and the giving during the Christchurch earthquakes of February 2011: a giant nail board is marked with the silhouettes of tools such as <b>hammers,</b> saws, <b>wrenches</b> and unusual objects such as a security camera, a classical bust and a small dog.|$|R
25|$|Polishing {{operations}} for {{items such as}} chisels, <b>hammers,</b> screwdrivers, <b>wrenches,</b> etc., are given a fine finish but not plated. In order to achieve this finish four operations are required: roughing, dry fining, greasing, and coloring. Note that roughing is usually done on a solid grinding wheel and for an extra fine polish the greasing operation may be broken up into two operations: rough greasing and fine greasing. However, for inexpensive items money is saved by only performing the first two operations.|$|R
5000|$|Compressed air is air {{kept under}} a {{pressure}} that {{is greater than}} atmospheric pressure. Compressed air is an important medium for transfer of energy in industrial processes. Compressed air is used for power tools such as air <b>hammers,</b> drills, <b>wrenches</b> and others. Compressed air is used to atomize paint, to operate air cylinders for automation, and {{can also be used}} to propel vehicles.Brakes applied by compressed air made large railway trains safer and more efficient to operate. Compressed air brakes are also found on large highway vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Metropolitan Stores {{were usually}} {{free-standing}} or located in strip malls or {{shopping malls and}} ranged in size between 20000 to 40000 sq ft. The stores carried household items (batteries, locks, screwdrivers, <b>hammers,</b> saws, <b>wrenches,</b> pliers, wire cutters, nuts, bolts, screws, shovels, pitchforks, hand spades, spades, rakes, watering hoses, sprinklers), sundries, seasonal products, clothing and footwear (men, women, children, infants), food and snacks, jewellery, stationery, crockery, beauty products, furniture, toys (namely dolls, doll clothing including dresses, sleep ware and accessories, model cars, miniature pick-up trucks, container trucks, wheels, rigs and doll play bags), vinyl records, electronics, creative products like needlecrafts, fabrics and Phentex yarn.|$|R
5000|$|Ironworkers are tools {{just like}} <b>hammers</b> and <b>wrenches</b> but they provide many more safety hazards {{that must be}} {{addressed}} and thoroughly thought out before they are purchased. Most of them have at least 4 stations that require boundaries around them to safely produce parts. They can shear flat plate, angle iron, round and square bar stock as well as punch plates, angles, I-beam and channel iron. Some have a station for notching and forming of different materials. The area around each station should be at least 20 feet since that is the common stock length of most materials used on ironworkers.|$|R

5000|$|When Coach Glenn Caruso {{took over}} the University of St. Thomas {{football}} team in 2008, he approached {{the men at the}} seminary and asked them to come and cheer on the Tommies at football games, as not many people attended them due to their losing record. Since then, the men of SJV have been some of the most active fans for the football team, attending every home game. [...] A subgroup of the seminarians, called [...] "Caruso's Crew", dress up as hard hat workers and paint on faux moustaches. The crew carry large tools made of cardboard and duct tape (a <b>hammer,</b> saw, <b>wrench,</b> and lunch box). This group has been known to travel hundreds of miles to attend away games.

5000|$|Within a {{few hours}} Lloyd had made an {{inspection}} tour of the airfields and the main workshops at Kalafrana. The state of the island was worse than he expected. The slackening of German air activity had allowed the number of aircraft to increase, but the RAF still had fewer than 60 machines of all types. Maintenance was difficult. Hardly any spare or replacement parts were available. Spares had to be obtained by sifting through the debris of wrecks or by cannibalising undamaged aircraft. Furthermore, the airfields were too small; there was no heavy equipment to work with; and even the commonest sorts of tools, such as <b>hammers</b> and <b>wrenches,</b> were all but impossible to find. All refuelling {{had to be done}} by hand from individual drums. The shelter was also inadequate, so there was little protection for what equipment they did have. Most aircraft were clustered together on open runways, presenting tempting targets. At Kalafrana, all the buildings were close together and above ground. The single engine-repair facility on Malta was located right next to the only test benches. Lloyd himself said, [...] "a few bombs on Kalafrana in the summer of 1941 would have ruined any hope of Malta ever operating an air force".|$|R
50|$|Very few metals {{react to}} heat {{treatment}} in the same manner, or to the same extent, that carbon steel does, and carbon steel heat treating behavior can vary radically depending on alloying elements. Steel can be softened to a very malleable state through annealing, {{or it can be}} hardened to a state nearly as rigid and brittle as glass by quenching. However, in its hardened state, steel is usually far too brittle, lacking the structural integrity to be useful for most applications. Tempering is a method used to decrease the hardness, thereby increasing the ductility of the quenched steel, to impart some springiness and malleability to the metal. This allows the metal to bend before breaking. Depending on how much temper is imparted to the steel, it may bend elastically (the steel returns to its original shape once the load is removed), or it may bend plastically (the steel does not return to its original shape, resulting in permanent deformation), before fracturing. Tempering is used to precisely balance the mechanical properties of the metal, such as shear strength, yield strength, hardness, ductility and tensile strength, to achieve any number of a combination of properties, making the steel useful {{for a wide variety of}} applications. Tools such as <b>hammers</b> and <b>wrenches</b> require good resistance to abrasion, impact resistance, and resistance to deformation. Springs do not require as much rigidity, but must deform elastically before breaking. Automotive parts tend to be a little less rigid, but need to deform plastically before breaking.|$|R

5000|$|A {{single point}} or single buoy mooring {{system is a}} {{facility}} for loading and unloading petroleum products to tankers, which moor to them only by the bow. One or two flexible hoses are used to transfer the products between the pipeline and tanker. A SPM {{may be used in}} deep water to take oil from the oilfield via a production platform, an in shallow water to export or import crude oil or oil products from an oilfield or refinery, usually by way of a storage facility. A range of single point mooring configurations are in use, and installation, maintenance and inspection work on all types is commonly done by divers. The work may include placing the pipeline end manifold (PLEM) and connecting it to the submarine pipelines, installing anchor chains and checking and adjusting chain angles, installing the submarine hoses between the PLEM and the buoy, installing a ships mooring system and operating subsea valves. The work is likely to involve the use of winches and cranes, rigging, including use of tirfors, chain hoists, strops and spreaders, flanging, using <b>wrenches,</b> <b>hammers</b> and gaskets, oxy-arc burning and welding.|$|R
40|$|Properties of equestrian {{surfaces}} such as hardness, traction {{and resistance}} to penetration may change during competition. A surface itself has a direct impact upon an athlete {{since it is the}} primary point of contact, therefore any changes which occur could affect performance or the possibility of injury. At present management regimes which are aimed at reducing such risks are based upon anecdotal evidence from site managers and surface construction companies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to validate a suite of mechanical tests on sand, fibre, rubber and wax equestrian surface, which were then used to quantify the effects of a preliminary, unaffiliated dressage competition on the hardness, traction {{and resistance to}} penetration of the surface. In addition laboratory analysis was used to determine surface components and the effects of temperature on the surface. The mechanical properties that were measured were hardness, using a Clegg Impact tester, traction, using a torque wrench and penetrability, using a penetrometer. Each piece of equipment was tested on a prepared, synthetic equestrian surface at Myerscough International Arena, in order to determine the method of use which produced results with least variability. The results of this work suggested that the 2. 25 kg Clegg <b>hammer,</b> the torque <b>wrench</b> using a horse shoe plate, under a weight of 30 kg, and the Longchamp penetrometer, should be used. It was also found that five repetitions should be made in a single position with each piece of equipment. The equipment was used to test a 20 m x 40 m dressage arena, before and after six preliminary, unaffiliated dressage competitions, held between January and June 2009. Thirty two positions were tested within the arena, which were split into two sets of 16. The first set of 16 were positioned 7. 5 m apart around the outside (track) area, and the second set of 16 were randomly positioned in the central area using a stratified random sampling method. In addition, temperature data was recorded at each of the competitions. The results showed that the hardness of the surface increased significantly (P< 0. 05) after a preliminary, unaffiliated dressage competition. The changes in the traction of the surface varied with each competition, all changes were found to be significant (P< 0. 05). The results regarding the penetrability of the surface were affected by the presence of the fibres in the surface, and therefore were deemed unreliable in this instance. There were significant changes to the surface over the period of six months, hardness decreased from 80 ± 0. 9 G to 62 ± 0. 8 G (P< 0. 001), traction decreased from 21. 5 ± 0. 1 Nm to 16. 9 ± 0. 1 Nm (P< 0. 001) and total penetration depth increased from 1. 9 ± 0. 03 cm to 3. 6 ± 0. 06 cm (P< 0. 001). There were significant differences found between the mechanical properties of the track and the central areas (P< 0. 05). The findings show that the mechanical properties of the surface changed significantly over a dressage competition. Short term changes could leave late competitors working on a different surface to early competitors, thus the running order of an event could affect the results. This highlights a need for further examination of the interrelationship between performance and surface variability. Significant long term changes were evident in hardness, traction and penetration, highlighting the need for a management protocol informed by surface testing in order to provide a surface with consistent properties...|$|R
