60|$|I {{was about}} to protest indignantly, but Marian laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm.|$|E
60|$|She started forward, laying <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm, and Dorothy gave {{a little}} cry.|$|E
60|$|As I {{was turning}} away {{she got up}} quickly and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulders}} and drew {{me down to}} kiss her.|$|R
60|$|She paid no heed to me; {{she came}} back and put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulders}} and thoughtfully and sadly looked up in my face.|$|R
6000|$|She paused, came {{round to}} where I was sitting, perched {{herself on the}} end of the table, and, resting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, added gently: ...|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mouth, {{and stopped}} me before I could say any more.|$|E
60|$|I was {{a little}} startled. She laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm, and sank her voice to a whisper.|$|E
60|$|She laughed, and {{the laugh}} was like {{her eyes and}} her voice and the touch of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> temples.|$|E
60|$|An {{expression}} of surprise and pleasure passed over her face; she rose, and putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, {{as if to}} keep me still in the place I occupied, looked at me intently.|$|R
6000|$|... "’I don’t think so,’ ses Miss Butt, putting <b>her</b> <b>’and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. ’Sit {{down and}} {{stay where you}} are. I don’t {{want you to get}} hurt, if it is. Let {{somebody}} I don’t like go.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{her voice}} went low and she whispered," [...] said Mr. Skelmersdale, [...] "and laid <b>'er</b> <b>'and</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>'and,</b> you know, and came {{close with a}} soft, warm {{friendly}} way she 'ad, it was as much as I {{could do to keep}} my 'ead." ...|$|R
60|$|She didn't {{seem to hear}} me: she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, {{and kept}} me where I was, sitting by her side.|$|E
60|$|She laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulder}} {{and looked at}} me in anxious silence. I saw she understood the serious risk that threatened us.|$|E
60|$|This was so {{absolutely}} true, that I had no remark to make. She {{came up to}} me, and put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I look {{men in the}} face, and {{how could}} I ever see the Maid again, if I go not?" [...] I said; and, {{loosening}} her grasp, she laid <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, and so gazed on me steadfastly, as if my picture could be fixed on the tablets of her brain.|$|R
5000|$|... 6. Lieb Liebchen, leg's Händchen aufs Herze (Sweetheart, <b>her</b> little <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> heart) ...|$|R
60|$|She laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> caressingly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, drawing me {{a little}} closer to her; and it {{remained}} there.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{not stop}} him,' hastily said the lady, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. 'I love it! I rejoice in it! Do not deprive me, {{for the love}} of Heaven!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Oh, {{her eyes}} were beautiful, and the repose and certitude of her were tremendous, as she rested <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm {{for a moment and}} in a low, quiet voice said: ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{the last}} {{act in the}} curious comedy of the decoy came to its end, little Mary laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, and, raising herself on tiptoe, whispered in my ear: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{waited a}} moment, {{turned her face}} full on me, and {{reaching}} across the table, laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> firmly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} {{guess so}} simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, placing <b>her</b> white <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{shoulders}} and smiling straight into my face.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{remember}} now {{a word of}} all the vague threatenings against the sundering universe with which I replied. <b>Her</b> <b>hand</b> was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder as she listened....|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, poor boy, you {{are very}} ignorant," [...] she returned, placing <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> forehead. [...] "You must {{know that this is}} a mother's book, and only a mother may read in it." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{re-entering}} the parlour, I found Diana {{standing at}} the window, looking very thoughtful. Diana {{was a great deal}} taller than I: she put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.|$|E
60|$|After a {{time the}} music ceases, and my wife puts <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. Perhaps I start a little, and then she says I have been asleep. This is the book of my dreams.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed {{you shall}} stay here," [...] said Diana, putting <b>her</b> white <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head. [...] "You shall," [...] {{repeated}} Mary, {{in the tone}} of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut up, Jesse!" [...] {{my mother}} cried, landing {{the back of}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> stingingly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mouth. And then, to the stranger, [...] "Go away and let the boy alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that was}} why," [...] she {{admitted}} shamelessly, then leaned away from me, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> resting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders, while she gurgled {{and her lips}} parted from over her beautiful white teeth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{twice about}} it, sir!" [...] said Mrs. Clements, rising in her earnestness and laying <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm. [...] "She's an awful woman--you don't know her as I do. Think twice about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm and I felt its {{pressure}} deepen as she spoke. [...] "He {{was thrown}} from his {{horse in the}} park. He died on the spot. Six days have passed. Six months!" ...|$|E
60|$|Any man, not an inbred and inborn villain, {{would have}} {{respected}} her at that moment. I put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm {{and led her}} away gently past the ruined chapel, and down {{the slope of the}} hill.|$|E
60|$|I led {{her away}} from the crowd that had collected. She was evidently frightened--I felt <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> {{trembling}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm--but she had one great merit; she made no fuss about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're {{fighting}} at McAfee's Station," [...] said Polly Ann. She put <b>her</b> cool <b>hand</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head, {{and little}} Tom {{climbed up on}} the bed and looked up into my face, wistfully calling my name.|$|R
60|$|Once {{more she}} turned away and fell into a revery. Over the housetop, from across the street, came the gay music of the fiddler. Mrs. Temple laid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> gently <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder.|$|R
