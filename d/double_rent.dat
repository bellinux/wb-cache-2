Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces, and must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group until all of them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect <b>double</b> <b>rent</b> for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent also increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank, then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house.|$|E

5000|$|The {{names of}} those tenants who {{answered}} were entered by the Steward {{with a piece of}} charcoal, ink being forbidden; in addition, no candles were allowed, with only natural light being permitted. For its strange procedure, the Court gained a variety of names; most commonly the [...] "Lawless Court", but also [...] "The Whispering Court" [...] and [...] "The Court of Cockcrowing". The Court continued without fail until the 19th century, although it became a tradition only; no prosecutions or litigation ever took place in it, and it is sometimes formally known as the [...] "Curia Sine Lege", or [...] "court without a leet-day". In later years there were many shortcuts in the court's procedure; most tenants simply paid their <b>double</b> <b>rent</b> at the Steward's office in the morning, preferring this to standing around in the damp, and a local man was employed to make the noise of a cock crowing after the court's business had been concluded.|$|E

According to tradition, the court was first created some time before 1661, after the Lord of the Manor of King's Hill was woken by a cock crowing, to discover a group of his vassals planning to murder him. Interrupting them, he convicted them of treason, for which their lands would be forfeit. As an act of clemency, he declared {{that they would be}} allowed to keep their lands in a state of [...] "shameful service". Each year, the day the plot was discovered (the Wednesday after Old Michaelmas Day), the tenants were to assemble at midnight where the plot was discovered, where the Lord's Steward would whisper out their names as quietly as possible. Those tenants who did not answer to their name would be fined <b>double</b> <b>rent</b> for every hour they failed to do so. The tenants were then obliged to wait there until a cock crowed three times, at which point they were dismissed.|$|E

40|$|Hong Kong Public Housing Program was {{initiated}} by a disastrous fire {{sixty years ago}} which made thousands people lose their shelter. Public rental housing (PRH) was built to provide affordable accommodation {{to people who are}} in housing need, such as the victims of disaster, low income families, etc. The financial situation of some PRH households had been improved after receiving years of housing subsidy by residing in PRH, which is heavily subsidized by the Government. They had affordability in finding a home in private sector, but they chose to stay in PRH and continued to receive housing subsidy, which they should not entitled. This phenomenon aroused widespread public concern in 1980 s. After conducting public consultation in 1984 - 85, the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) finally implemented the Housing Subsidy Policy (HSP) in April 1987 to reduce the housing subsidy to those who are no longer in need of it. Under the HSP, tenants who have resided in public housing for 10 years or more are required to declare their household income. Households with income exceeding the Subsidy Income Limits (SIL) are required to pay double net rent plus rates. The policy was reviewed after implemented for five years. Responding to PRH’s opinion on the policy, the policy was revised in 1993. Under the new measure, households with income between two to three times of the WLIL would be charged 1. 5 times rent. Tenants, with income exceeds 3 times of the WLIL would have to pay <b>double</b> <b>rent.</b> Although HKHA did not adopted the method of eviction to force the well–off tenants to move out from the PRH, the ultimate aim of HSP was to vacate the flats resided by them. Instead of taking enforcement action, a moderate method of reducing subsidy and encouragement of home ownership was adopted to encourage well-off PRH tenants to surrender their PRH units, {{so that they can be}} re-allocated to the people who had genuine housing need. With a moderate approach, the effective of HSP has been reduced. The first part of this study would conduct an examination of the effectiveness of HSP. Effectiveness in achieving its aim and the policy outcomes would be the focus of this part. Public Housing is a scarce and limited social resource. A rational and equitable allocation of the PRH units is expected. The HSP is the first step for HKHA to take measure to rationalize the distribution of the existing heavily subsidized PRH units since the public housing program started in 1953. The later part of this study would evaluate the equity of the HSP based on some theorists’ conception on equity. Recommendations would be made in conclusion to provide future policy directive on HSP. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E
