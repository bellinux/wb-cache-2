25|$|The area {{now called}} Kiribati has been {{inhabited}} by Micronesians speaking the same Oceanic language since sometime between 3000 BC and AD 1300. The area was not isolated; invaders from Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji, later introduced Polynesian and Melanesian cultural aspects, respectively. Intermarriage tended to blur cultural differences {{and resulted in}} a significant degree of cultural <b>homogenisation.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{effects of}} the urban heat island may be overstated. One study stated, [...] "Contrary to {{generally}} accepted wisdom, no statistically significant impact of urbanization {{could be found in}} annual temperatures." [...] This was done by using satellite-based night-light detection of urban areas, and more thorough <b>homogenisation</b> of the time series (with corrections, for example, for the tendency of surrounding rural stations to be slightly higher in elevation, and thus cooler, than urban areas). If its conclusion is accepted, then it is necessary to [...] "unravel the mystery of how a global temperature time series created partly from urban in situ stations could show no contamination from urban warming." [...] The main conclusion is that microscale and local-scale impacts dominate the mesoscale impact of the urban heat island. Many sections of towns may be warmer than rural sites, but surface weather observations are likely to be made in park [...] "cool islands." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 19th century, {{an influx}} of enslaved Africans from other regions had relegated Watermama to a {{position}} in the pantheon of the deities of the Surinamese Winti religion. When Winti was outlawed in the 1970s, her religious practices [...] lost some of their importance in Suriname. Furthermore, a relative lack of freedom compared to their African brethren prevented the <b>homogenisation</b> that occurred with the Mami Wata cult across the Atlantic.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{photographer}} Van Stipriaan {{and some}} western anthropologists, the various West African religions came to resemble one another during the 20th century, especially in urban areas. The <b>homogenisation</b> was largely {{the result of}} greater communication and mobility of individuals {{from town to town}} and country to country, though links between the spirit's nature and the perils of the urban environment have also been proposed. This led to a new level of standarisation of [...] priests, initiations of new devotees, healing rituals, and temples.|$|E
2500|$|The deeper ancestral {{demography}} of Bermuda's {{population has}} been obscured by the ethnic <b>homogenisation</b> {{of the last four}} centuries. There is effectively no ethnic distinction between black and white Bermudians, other than those characterising recent immigrant communities. In the 17th century, this was not so. For the first hundred years of settlement, white Protestants of English heritage were the distinct majority, with white minorities of Irish (the native language of many of whom can be assumed to have been Gaelic) and Scots sent to Bermuda after the English invasions of their homelands that followed the English Civil War. Non-white minorities included Spanish-speaking, free (indentured) blacks from the West Indies, black chattel slaves primarily captured from Spanish and Portuguese ships by Bermudian privateers, and Native Americans, primarily from the Algonquian and other tribes of the Atlantic seaboard, but possibly {{from as far away as}} Mexico. By the 19th century, the white ethnically-English Bermudians had lost their numerical advantage. Despite the banning of the importation of Irish, and the repeated attempts to force free blacks to emigrate and the owners of black slaves to export them, the merging of the various minority groups, along with some of the white English, had resulted in a new demographic group, [...] "coloured" [...] (which term, in Bermuda, referred to anyone not wholly of European ancestry) Bermudians, gaining a slight majority. Any child born before or since then to one coloured and one white parent has been added to the coloured statistic. Most of those historically described as [...] "coloured" [...] are today described as [...] "black", or [...] "of African heritage", which obscures their non-African heritage (those previously described as [...] "coloured" [...] who were not of African ancestry had been very few, though the numbers of South Asians, particularly, is now growing. The number of persons born in Asian countries doubled between the 2000 and the 2010 censuses), blacks have remained in the majority, with new white immigration from Portugal, Britain and elsewhere countered by black immigration from the West Indies.|$|E

50|$|Some experts see a {{trend toward}} <b>homogenisation</b> of {{financial}} institutions, meaning a tendency to invest in similar areas and have similar business strategies. A consequence of this might be fewer banks serving specific target groups, for example small-scale producers could be under served.|$|E
50|$|Transfersome vesicles are {{prepared}} {{in a similar}} manner as liposomes, except that no separation of the vesicle-associated and free drug is required.

50|$|Since the 1980s Wigston's retail {{economy has}} become {{increasingly}} dependent on national retailers. Up to 50% of retail in the town belongs to supermarkets and chain stores. The share of local business has caused local and independent businesses to close. This followed the trend of the 1990s <b>homogenisation</b> of British high streets.|$|E

Decommissioning works are now taking place, while a small workforce is still employed in <b>homogenisation,</b> where heat treatment takes place for the Kitts Green plant.|$|E
5000|$|..... {{the term}} 'cultural' has {{become synonymous with}} the {{category}} of the ethnic or minority (...). It views culture as an entity that is highly abstracted from the practices of daily life and therefore represents the illusion that there exists a spirit of the people. This formulation leads to the <b>homogenisation</b> of cultural identity and the ascription of particular values and proclivities onto minority cultural groups.|$|E
5000|$|... === Food & Drink === The {{food you}} eat at Christmas may still depend on which region {{you live in}} the country. But here, too, <b>homogenisation</b> has set in, due in no small part to the uniform offerings of the {{department}} stores and the ready availability of convenience foods. Few have time to salt their own hams or stuff their own pork sausages nowadays.|$|E

50|$|Homogenization or <b>homogenisation</b> is any {{of several}} {{processes}} {{used to make}} a mixture of two mutually non-soluble liquids the same throughout. This is achieved by turning one of the liquids into a state consisting of extremely small particles distributed uniformly throughout the other liquid. A typical example is the homogenization of milk, where the milk fat globules are reduced in size and dispersed uniformly {{through the rest of the}} milk.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{similarities}} between the measurement system used in Tamil Nadu and that used by the Indus Valley civilisation. A shift of Indian mathematicians to South India after the 12th century could be a driving factor for <b>homogenisation.</b> However, this remains a hypothesis because study of ancient science has been neglected in India. A large number of ancient manuscripts in Kerala and Tamil Nadu remain untranslated and unpublished.|$|E
50|$|There is, however, no {{well-established}} {{testing procedure}} for daily climatological data {{as well as}} no accepted method to apply the homogeneity results. There is a clear need for additional research on techniques for <b>homogenisation</b> of daily data {{in order to create}} high quality, daily datasets for the assessment of extremes without abandoning entire series or tossing out real extremes. This is of particular importance for areas that have a low density of stations with long, daily data series.|$|E
5000|$|In {{most cases}} with food to be {{analysed}} {{there are two}} levels of sampling - the first being selection of a portion from the whole, which is then submitted to a laboratory for testing, and the second being the laboratory’s taking of the individual amounts necessary for individual tests that may be applied. It is the former that is ‘food sampling’: the latter is analytical laboratory ‘sub-sampling’, often relying upon initial <b>homogenisation</b> of the entire submitted sample.|$|E

50|$|It {{includes}} the west {{part of the}} marsh between the city of Isla Cristina, the reed area (cañas) and the limit of Ayamonte, with an area of 371.24 hectares. It is a degraded marsh, transformed long ago for the exploitation of table salt and currently developing aquaculture. These uses degrade the marsh, bringing <b>homogenisation</b> and impoverishment that weigh on its ecological value. Here stands a well-preserved tidal mill (es: El Pintado tidal mill) restored in 1995, presently used as a small visitors' center.|$|E
