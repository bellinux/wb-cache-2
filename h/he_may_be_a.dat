Frank and his co-pilot are able to land the plane on the adjacent Hydra Island, although the co-pilot is killed. After gathering the survivors of Flight 316 together, Frank accompanies Sun and Ben to the main island. They meet Christian Shephard (John Terry), who reveals that the remaining survivors have travelled through time to 1977. Christian instructs them to await the arrival of John Locke, which they do. Sun is determined to remain with Locke and find her husband Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), so Frank parts from her, returning to Hydra Island intent on repairing the jet radio to call for help. Upon his return, Frank finds that passenger Ilana (Zuleikha Robinson) has found guns on the island and claimed leadership of the group.

Whereas most {{of the characters in}} the cycle are inter-related, through birth, marriage, or sometimes both, the Rhinemaidens are seemingly independent. The identity of their father who entrusted them with the guardianship of the gold is not given in the text. Some Wagnerean scholars have suggested that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Supreme Being" [...] who is the father of Wotan and all the gods—indeed, of all creation. Others take the German Rheintöchter literally and say that they are the daughters of the Rhine River.

500|$|The {{story is}} {{influenced}} by many previous deconstructions of the superhero genre. Morrison himself wanted the novel to be his own re-imagining of Batman. Morrison includes themes such as symbolism and psychological horror, while depicting how insanity works within the setting of Arkham Asylum. Morrison references Carl Jung, Aleister Crowley, and Alice in Wonderland, while also presenting psychologically different versions of several classic characters in the Batman universe. Examples include Maxie Zeus, an electrified, emaciated figure with messianic delusions obsessed with electric shocks and coprophagia; Clayface, who is rapidly wasting away from lack of [...] "feeding"; the Mad Hatter, whose obsession with Alice in Wonderland has pedophilic overtones; and Batman himself, who is driven close {{to the breaking point}} by the Asylum. Killer Croc was originally drawn as suffering deformities similar to those of Joseph Merrick, the [...] "Elephant Man", although his final incarnation is that of a humanoid crocodile. The Joker's mental condition is described as [...] "super sanity": He re-invents himself every day, to suit his circumstances. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> harmless prankster one moment, and a homicidal maniac the next.|$|E

Edward Winter writes, [...] "It is unwise for the 'non-playing' historian to publish his own analysis, although <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> useful compiler. Similarly, players who are unversed in, and indifferent to, chess history should not touch it." [...] William Hartston wrote of Staunton's non-match with Morphy, [...] "Sadly, this blemish on Staunton the man also did considerable harm to the reputation among later generations of Staunton the chess player." [...] G. H. Diggle wrote in the British Chess Magazine, [...] "That [...] excused himself... from playing a match against the greatest player of the century, then at the zenith of his youth and fame, was no tragedy for chess.
