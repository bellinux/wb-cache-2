40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The {{objective of this}} project is to produce a large user-friendly and research-oriented database of the <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> that transpose EU directives into domestic law {{in order to provide}} the basis for large-N theoretically-based academic research on the causes of variance in the timing and quality of national implementation. The pre-existing databases on national transposition were not designed to facilitate academic research. The Commission publishes an annual report on the application of Community law, but it lists only the proportion of directives that have been transposed up to a given year, without providing data on delay of transposition. It also uses cumulative data since 1960, creating a severe upward bias in the national compliance record. The report tends to consider a directive transposed when the first measure has been notified by the Member States. But transposition normally needs more than one <b>national</b> <b>measure,</b> so the Commission’s data are likely overestimated compliance. Finally, no information is provided on the dates and instruments of national transposition. Recently, Celex, the EU legal database, has been opened to the public for free online consultation. The database contains approximately 3, 000 directives, but it is not designed in a way that could be immediately used for research purposes. Fields than contains dates need to be converted from string to date format. Deadlines for the adoption of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> need to be separated from deadlines for the application. There are no fields containing the dates of adoption of <b>national</b> transposition <b>measures.</b> These need to be deducted from the title of <b>national</b> implementing <b>measures</b> or by other available means. Moreover, there are no fields that record the types on <b>national</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, there are mistakes and missing information that need correcting and completing. The project consists of migrating the raw data available from Celex into an appropriately-designed database...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Breastfeeding {{is crucial}} for child {{survival}} and development, and exclusive breastfeeding is recommended {{for the first six}} months of the infant’s life, with continued breastfeeding until two years of age and beyond. Marketing of breastmilk substitutes has a negative impact on the recommended breastfeeding behaviour, and interferes with maternal and child rights. The International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code) was launched to guide breastfeeding promotion and regulate breastmilk substitutes marketing. The aim of this study is to examine the protection of breastfeeding through international recommendations and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> adopting provisions from the Code, as well as the breastfeeding promotion and breastmilk substitutes marketing through mass media in five Southeast Asian countries. Methods: Media clips collected from January 2015 to January 2016 through media monitoring services were analysed, in addition to international frameworks in support of the protecting of breastfeeding and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of the Code. Relevant provisions from the Code were chosen to assess compliance. Results: Several international recommendations and human rights conventions are in support of breastfeeding. All the five countries studied had <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of provisions from the Code, either legally enforceable or voluntary. “Growing-up milk” for children above 12 months was the most common product advertised for, counting for more than two thirds of the collected advertisement clips. Social medias were used by companies to promote all categories of breastmilk substitutes. Conclusions: Despite international frameworks and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> to promote and protect breastfeeding, breastmilk substitutes are marketed through various media outlets. Companies are in violation of the Code, hindering states to fulfil their obligation to protect breastfeeding. There is a need for strengthening of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of the Code, especially in expanding the covered age range and better monitor compliance on social media outlets.

40|$|In {{light of}} {{widespread}} agreement that poverty and social exclusion {{should be understood}} as multidimensional phenomenon, {{in this paper we}} explore the practical implications of such an understanding in relation to widely employed indicators of such phenomena in Ireland. One persistent critique of the current <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> of poverty and social exclusion comes from those who feel that the findings they produce are inaccurate in relation to particular stages of the life-course. To date the critiques in the Irish case have been accompanied by relatively {{little in the way of}} systematic research documenting the alleged limitations of <b>national</b> <b>measures.</b> In this paper we have taken advantage of the inclusion of a special module on childhood deprivation in EU-SILC 2009 to explore such issues in more depth. Our analysis reveals that, to the extent that <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> fail to identify childhood deprivation, this is largely a consequence of limitations in capturing wider command over economic resources and distinctive risk profiles in relation to exposure to deprivation and economic stress. Overall our analysis leads us to the conclusion that those exposed to childhood deprivation are generally a sub-set of the children captured by national indicators. Adopting a multidimensional and dynamic perspective on household resources and deprivation enables us to capture the large majority of children exposed to childhood deprivation. Conversely restricting our attention to childhood deprivation would lead us to miss out on larger numbers of children living in households experiencing basic deprivation. The <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> of poverty and social exclusion that have been employed in the Irish case are largely successful in capturing childhood deprivation. ...|$|R

Since coordination behavior may vary across countries, we run experiments in Denmark, Spain and Ghana, and map cross-country rankings in coordination with known <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> of fractualization, uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation. Our results show that exogenous interventions increase subsequent coordination, with earlier interventions yielding better coordination than later interventions.

40|$|Legal {{regulation}} {{shapes the}} form and content of food labels. Whether in developed or developing countries, national laws outline obligations for labelling that reflect a combination of safety, commercial, and proprietary objectives based on a country's unique circumstances. This dissertation mines one particular dimension of the interplay between national and international law. While focusing on the narrow issue of food labelling legislation, it canvasses the national and international obligations affecting food labels that arise from intellectual property law, trade regulation and consumer protection. National food labelling regimes share some similar legislative provisions. French, Canadian, and Ghanaian law all recognize three categories of food labelling elements for pre-packaged foods: (1) mandatory labelling elements; (2) prohibited elements; and (3) reserved elements. As well, failure to comply with food labelling laws can result in criminal or civil liability, although implementation varies from country to country, with "food-centred" cultures more apt to vigorously enforce food labelling laws. Yet, it not simply national law that dictates the final form of food labels. International legal obligations increasingly play a pivotal role. While early international agreements were driven by States' desires to harmonize certain commercial and intellectual property laws, a shift occurred with the GATT 1947. This Agreement did not look to harmonize private law regimes amongst trading partners, but rather it set out general obligations that prohibited certain <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> which inhibited trade. The pendulum has swung even further {{with the establishment of}} the WTO. National governments, in light of their WTO obligations, must now (a) undertake positive law reform; (b) make <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> WTO-compatible; and (c) submit to compulsory trade dispute resolution, all of which can affect national food labelling laws. Clear international obligations established to address commercial or health concerns permit States to maintain <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> while still pursuing trade liberalization. However, international obligations applied to discipline <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> like the marking of food quality and the provision of new consumer information tread on national cultural sensitivities. Until further consensus evolves concerning how international obligations should be applied to such <b>national</b> food labelling <b>measures,</b> significant conflicts between national and international obligations will continue...|$|R

40|$|Member States of the European Union have {{tackled the}} {{financial}} crisis by adopting rescue measures such as guarantees on debt and capital injections into banks facing difficulty, some of which even went bankrupt. These measures are, however, bound by the state aid rules of the EU {{for the sake of}} competition in the Internal Market. Member states are therefore required to report rescue measures to the European Commission beforehand in order to obtain its approval. In response to a deterioration in the crisis, the Commission issued temporarily applicable rules in the form of communications, the first one of which is known as the Banking Communication. Rules and principles set out in the communications together constitute a flexible evaluation regime under which <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> are examined and approved in a more appropriate and prompt manner than would be under the conventional framework. The new framework keeps the general principles of the state aid rules, even amid {{the financial crisis}}, i. e., the aid granted does not exceed what is necessary to achieve its legitimate purpose and that any distortion of competition is avoided or minimised as much as possible. So far the Commission has unconditionally approved all of the respective <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> except one case that was disapproved and seven cases that were conditionally approved. The temporal rules have made great contributions to tackling the problems of utmost urgency. However, the brevity of the approval decisions leaves some ambiguity of how the Commission applied the relevant communication and evaluated the compatibility of the proposed <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> with the Internal Market. ...|$|R
