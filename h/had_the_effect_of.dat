5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the argument over the need for manned aircraft, additional political machinations <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> complicating the project. In September 1957 the Ministry of Supply informed {{the heads of the}} aviation companies that the only acceptable proposals would be those issued from teams consisting of more than one company. There were a large number of competing aircraft manufacturing companies in the UK while orders were decreasing, thus the government intended to foster cooperation between certain companies and encourage mergers.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, {{the guerrillas}} assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, {{displaying}} his severed {{head in the}} town market. The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina {{were each}} {{subjected}} to attacks from the other, and the English engaged the French based at Mobile {{in what was}} essentially a proxy war involving primarily allied American Indians on both sides. The southern war {{did not result in}} significant territorial changes, but it <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida, including parts of present-day southern Georgia, and destroying Spain's network of missions in the area.|$|E
5|$|The late 19th century carvings of Roman Emperors and Governors of Roman Britain on {{the terrace}} {{overlooking}} the Great Bath are particularly susceptible {{to the effect of}} acid rain and are being protected with a wash of a sacrificial shelter coat every few years. Exhibits within the temple precincts are susceptible to warm air which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> drawing corrosive salts out of the Roman stonework. To help reduce this, a new ventilation system was installed in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> defacing the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} {{closure of}} 150coal mines, {{some of which}} were not losing money, resulted in the loss {{of tens of thousands of}} jobs and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> devastating entire communities. Miners had helped bring down the Heath ministry, and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed. Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks, appointing hardliner Ian MacGregor as NCB leader, and ensuring that police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear, contributed to her triumph over the striking miners.|$|E

5|$|Today, Beebe's 1915 {{description}} of his hypothetical four-winged bird ancestor is regarded as prescient, {{and there is no}} doubt that Microraptor looks startlingly similar to the almost-century old Tetrapteryx illustrations. After its discovery, Microraptor <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> both reinvigorating the arboreal hypothesis as well as finally putting an end to the widespread acceptance of Heilmann's disregard for the Tetrapteryx theory.|$|E
5|$|After 24 hours, only 2,500 {{men of the}} 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne {{were under}} the control of their divisions, {{approximately}} a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response. The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.|$|E
5|$|Compounding {{these issues}} was the one-year {{rotation}} policy {{adopted by the}} Pentagon in Southeast Asia. Although the first aircrews arriving in-theater were highly experienced, the rapidly growing tempo and ever-expanding length of the operation demanded more personnel. This exacerbated a growing lack of experienced aircrews. This dilemma was further compounded by an Air Force policy which dictated universal pilot training while proscribing involuntary second combat tours, which combined, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> rotating personnel to different aircraft. Conversely, the Navy tended to maintain its aircrews within the same community {{for the duration of}} their careers, thereby retaining their expertise, but also incurring greater losses among experienced crews undergoing multiple combat tours.|$|E

5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a nationally televised forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|George Orwell's book The Road to Wigan Pier was {{illustrated}} by {{a photograph of}} homes in the Rosehall area of Coatbridge. In 1934 there was an exodus to Corby in England when the local Union Plant relocated. This <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered {{in the end of}} serious iron production. The decline of the Clydeside shipbuilding industry in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. A legacy of 'devastating' unemployment, appalling housing conditions and some of the worst overcrowding in Scotland left its stamp on the Coatbridge of the early 1930s. As late as 1936 Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 {{categories}} for Novelette, Fan Writer, and Fan Artist were added, and a category for Best Novella was added the following year; these new categories <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously {{left up to}} voters. Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the individual military punishments, the army took further internal measures to {{lower the risk of}} another insurrection. According to Maurice Rives, 10,000 Vietnamese troops were given transfers to different zones. This meant that more than 80% of Tonkin's approximately 12,000 Tirailleurs Tonkinois were moved, a transfer of enormous proportions, indicating the extent of insecurity among French commanders towards Vietnamese troops, {{and the extent to which}} they were willing to go to make future Yen Bays impossible. One possible rationale for this measure was to break up any undiscovered VNQDĐ cells and to sever personal ties, within units and between soldiers and civilians in their local district. The mass transfer of soldiers also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> creating a state of constant mobilisation, denying troops the time and opportunity for anti-colonial organisation.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E
5|$|Just before midday on 11March, the USAF {{turned their}} {{attention}} (recon) from looking for their missing personnel to that of destroying the captured radar, {{along with all the}} documentation and operation information left behind at Lima Site 85. Between 12–18March, the USAF conducted a total of 95 strike sorties against the radar site, and on 19March an A-1 fighter-bomber destroyed every building at the old facility. In addition to the destruction of their radar equipment, the USAF bombing of Lima Site 85 may also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> obliterating the bodies of U.S. personnel left behind at the site (2 remains found in 2013). In the days following the loss of Phou Pha Thi, Sullivan reflected on the disaster at Lima Site 85 and commented that U.S. technicians operating there should have been evacuated on 10March, when it became amply clear the North Vietnamese were preparing to launch an assault.|$|E
