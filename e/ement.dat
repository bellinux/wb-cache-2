40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem in distributed computin is to map {{activities such as}} computation or data transfer onto resources that meet requirements for performance, cost, security, or other quality of service metrics. The creation of such mappin s requires ne otiation amon application and resources to discover, reserve, acquire, confi ure, and monitor resources. Current resource mana <b>ement</b> approaches tend to specialize for specific resource classes, and address coordination across resources only in a limited fashion. We present a new approach that overcomes these di#culties. We define a resource mana <b>ement</b> model that distin uishes three kinds of resource-independent service level a reements (S LAs), formalizin a reements to deliver capability, perform activities, and bind activities to capabilities, respectively.

40|$|In market- 9 iven {{requirements}} engineering a crucialdecision {{is whether or}} not to select a requirement for implementation in the next software release. The selection process is part of the release planning process and {{can be viewed as a}} series of refinement steps resulting in either rejection or propagation to the next step. This paper presents an analytical model of the selection process which takes the quality of the decisionmaking into account. The model is a network of queues with multiclass jobs corresponding to requirements of different quality. The analytical model can act as a baseline for simulation of more realistic models where no analytical solution is possible. Further work includes empirical assessment of the model and further experiments using simulation. The long- erm objective of the presented research is to provide means for practitioners to optimize the selection process in terms of minimizing wasted effort. 1 In troduction This pape d esc ibes an analytical mod el of a ma ketd iven equi <b>ements</b> enginee ing (RE) p ocess.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis is the {{analytic}} predicate with event nouns with the suffix -ement in French. It {{is divided into}} two parts, the theoretical and the practical one. In the first theoretical part we concentrate on the description of the analytic predicate and we also introduce some test for its identification. The next parts are dedicated to the particular components of this predicate: to the light verb and the predicative noun with a particular emphasis on event nouns, for which we examine their possible typologies. After this we focus on the suffix <b>ement</b> itself, its characteristics as well as the characteristics of nouns, which are created by this suffix. The last topic which we cover is the concurrence between suffixes -ement and age. In the practical part, we begin by describing used methods thanks to which we received needed data as well as our instruments. Then we divided the extracted nouns with the suffix <b>ement</b> according to their meaning into a few groups and we continued by verifying their eventive meaning. Subsequently we concentrated on the collocability of chosen nouns with verbs and we finished by comparing the suffix <b>ement</b> with suffix -age...|$|E

It describes {{the results of the}} Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) test on the fourth of four pavement test sections, an asphalt-concrete section containing an untreated aggregate base designated Section 503 RF. The tests on these four test sections have been performed as part of Goal 1 of the CAL/APT Strategic Plan (1). One objective of the test program is to obtain data to quantitatively verify existing Caltrans pavement design methodologies for asphalt treated permeable base (ATPB) pavements and conventional aggregate base pavements with regard to failure under trafficking at moderate temperatures (Goal 1), while preparing a uniform platform on which overlays (Goal 3) will be constructed to be trafficked. Other objectives are: to quantify the effective elastic moduli of the various pavement layers, based on an ad-hoc use of layered elastic analysis; to quantify the stress dependence of the pavement layers; to determine the failure mechanisms of the various layers; and to determine and compare the fatigue lives of the two types of pavement structure. HVS loading on this pavement section began in March 1996 and was completed in September 1996 after the application of about 1. 9110 load repetitions.
