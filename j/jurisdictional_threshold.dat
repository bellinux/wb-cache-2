25|$|Dart Cherokee Basin Operating Co. v. Owens, 574 U.S. ___ (2015), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{clarified}} procedures for removing a class action lawsuit from state court to federal court. The case involved a dispute about revenue from oil and gas leases in which the defendant filed a motion to remove the case from a state court in Kansas to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. However, the plaintiff argued that the defendant's motion was defective because the defendant's notice of removal did not include evidence demonstrating that the amount in controversy satisfied the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>threshold.</b> The United States District Court for the District of Kansas ultimately ruled the case should be returned to the state court, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit declined to review the district court's decision.|$|E
2500|$|Under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, {{the federal}} courts' {{jurisdiction}} {{is limited to}} [...] "cases...or controversies." [...] Historically the court has determined that various requirements must be met {{to comply with the}} Article III <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>threshold,</b> without which federal courts cannot consider the case and the wrongdoing alleged by the plaintiff goes forward. Those requirements include, among others, [...] "standing to sue". The Constitution does not identify what requirements must be met to ensure standing; the Supreme Court has developed the requirements over time through its case law. Just prior to SCRAP’s decision to sue the United States and the ICC, the Supreme Court had, in Sierra Club v. Morton, denied standing to the Sierra Club in its environmental challenge to Disney’s effort (with the support of the Interior and Agriculture Departments) to build a hotel and ski resort in California. SCRAP’s claims of wrongdoing and harm to its members were not directed against a single project but against concrete but less discernible harm throughout the nation, including in the Washington, D.C. area where they lived and attended law school.|$|E

40|$|The International Court of Justice (ICJ) refused {{jurisdiction}} in Georgia’s suit against Russia under the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, {{finding that the}} treaty’s jurisdictional clause, which limits jurisdiction to unsettled disputes, did not apply {{in the absence of}} good-faith negotiation. The court reversed its provisional measures order, which entertained jurisdiction, and continued a line of cases holding that clauses like the treaty’s jurisdictional clause serve mainly to give the parties notice of the dispute. The ICJ’s ruling noted that these clauses also reflect limits on parties’ consent to jurisdiction and a general preference for negotiated solutions. This suggests that the court will scrutinize attempted diplomacy more in the future to ensure good-faith conduct. Yet the court refused to overturn precedents permitting use of open forums such as the UN and finding negotiations where the specific treaty obligations are not identified, making good faith harder to ensure. The ICJ’s adherence to a more flexible standard thus still provides a way for complainants to satisfy <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>thresholds</b> without fully engaging respondents beforehand...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{dissent in}} Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency (549 US 497, 2007), Chief Justice John G. Roberts of the U.S. Supreme Court cites [...] "all for the {{want of a}} {{horseshoe}} nail" [...] {{as an example of}} a possible chain of causation. He claimed that, by contrast, the <b>threshold</b> <b>jurisdictional</b> issue of standing requires a likely chain of causation, which was not satisfied by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulation of new automobile emissions to prevent the loss of Massachusetts coastal land due to climate change.|$|R
40|$|On April 10, 2015, in Hawkes Co. v. U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit {{held that}} a U. S. Army Corps of Engineers {{jurisdictional}} determination made pursuant to the Clean Water Act is subject to judicial review as final agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act. <b>Jurisdictional</b> determinations are <b>threshold</b> decisions of the Corps assessing whether {{a piece of land}} is subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act. The Eighth Circuit’s decision contradicts a previous decision of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held pre-enforcement judicial review of Corps jurisdictional determinations improper under the Administrative Procedure Act. This Comment argues that the Eighth Circuit’s analysis inappropriately relied on the costs of permitting under the Clean Water Act. This Comment urges the U. S. Supreme Court to reverse the Eighth Circuit’s decision and to follow instead the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit. Not only would the Eighth Circuit’s decision in this case disrupt the system of review in place for agency action under the Administrative Procedure Act, it would complicate jurisdictional jurisprudence by creating two discrete sets of jurisdictional case law subject to different standards of review in the courts...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 and the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 gave freight railroads increased freedom to price their services according to market conditions. A number of shippers are concerned that freight railroads have used these pricing freedoms to unreasonably exercise their market power in setting rates for shippers with fewer alternatives to rail transportation. This report updates the rate information in GAO's 1999 report (RCED- 99 - 93) using selected commodities and with effective competitive transportation alternatives. From 1997 through 2000, rail rates generally decreased, both nationwide and {{for many of the}} specific commodities and markets that GAO examined. However, rail rates for some commodities and distance categories [...] such as wheat moving long distances and coal moving short distances [...] have stayed about the same or increased. In other instances, such as wheat moving medium distances, rail rates stayed about the same or decreased. Overall, the proportion of rail shipments above the Surface Transportation Board's statutory <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>threshold</b> for considering rate relief actions [...] where railroad revenues for the shipment exceed 180 percent of variable costs [...] stayed relatively constant at 30 percent from 1997 through 2000. However, the proportion of shipments for which revenues exceeded variable costs by 180 percent varied, depending on commodity and markets. ...|$|E
40|$|For an {{investment}} treaty tribunal {{to proceed to}} adjudge the merits of claims arising out of {{an investment}}, it must have jurisdiction over the parties and the claims, and the claims submitted to the tribunal must be admissible. Inconsistent interpretations of substantive and procedural principles of international investment law that govern the existence and exercise of the arbitral tribunal’s supremacy to adjudge an investment dispute have caused incoherence in investment treaty arbitration. The thesis is an in-depth study of article 25 of the 1965 Washington Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), which articulates the Material, Personal and Consensual requirements for establishing {{the existence of the}} adjudicative power (Jurisdiction) for dispute resolution and to exercise that adjudicative power (Admissibility) under the aegis of ICSID. The main findings of the research are as follows: 1) ICSID’s double-filtering nature, which has been largely overlooked in ICSID jurisprudence, is fundamental to correct decision-making by arbitral tribunals when deciding on admissibility and jurisdiction issues. 2) ‘Fraudulent intent’ criterion, which borrows its rationale from the concurrent themes in international law jurisprudence, is instrumental to test compliance as required in the upper <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>threshold.</b> 3) ‘Bona fide investor’ test used to measure compliance with the objective requirements of article 25 of the ICSID runs counter to the object and purpose of the Convention. 4) ‘Dynamic’ test, rather than plain ‘objective’ test, would be the adequate pattern to ensure compliance with article 25 of the ICSID Convention for the contemplated investment due to evolving meaning of such generic term. 5) ‘Lex Juridictio’ or set of rules, principals and mechanisms governing jurisdictional and admissibility issues is required as foundation for legal unification and harmonization...|$|E
40|$|It is not {{possible}} to police the movement of “aliens” without first determining who is and is not a citizen. Yet little scholarly attention has been devoted to the nature of citizenship determinations or their implication for our understanding of immigration enforcement as a whole. Thousands of U. S. citizens are caught up in immigration enforcement actions every year, and dozens of cases have come to light in which erroneous deportations {{can be traced to the}} lack of procedural protections within the deportation system, manifested in summary proceedings, lengthy detention, and lack of access to counsel. Such cases compel us to reconceptualize citizenship as not just a status that precedes immigration enforcement but also one that is, in a functional sense, produced by such enforcement. This insight has important consequences for both theoretical understandings of citizenship and constitutional analysis of immigration enforcement. Drawing on historical and contemporary material, this Article proposes a new understanding of “immigration exceptionalism,” exploring its implications for the rights of both citizens and noncitizens and highlighting its central reliance on the notion that citizenship status can function as a <b>threshold</b> <b>jurisdictional</b> inquiry. Arguing that such reliance is misplaced, this Article proposes a wholesale reconsideration of immigration enforcement’s procedural norms...|$|R
40|$|The European Court of Human Rights {{has brought}} a revolutionary aspect to the {{extraterritorial}} application of its Convention by extending it to cover the state parties’ actions abroad. By {{opening the door to}} the application of the European Convention on Human Rights to activities of a member state beyond its territorial borders, the Court has changed its case-law practice from more restrictive to more allowing. The major authority on the extraterritorial application of the ECHR has thus far been the Bankovi? v Belgium case from 2001. In Bankovi? the Court decided on the claims against 17 NATO states for the bombardments in Yugoslavia in 1999. The Court dismissed the claims on the basis of jurisdiction as it held that the <b>jurisdictional</b> <b>threshold</b> of Article 1 of the ECHR was not met. Contrary to Bankovi?, the Court decided on Al-Skeini and Al-Jedda positively on the application of the Convention outside of its direct territory. This is a big change in the practice and will have an even bigger impact on the states and thus it is now time to reevaluate the issue in light of these new cases. The incoherence of the Court’s judgments places the states, and individuals, in an unpredictable world as the meaning of ‘within their jurisdiction’ as set out in Article 1 of the Convention remains controversial. The two identities of the Convention as a regional, European instrument and as a universal human rights mechanism create a challenging relationship. This thesis explores the change in the Court’s interpretation views through the case law concerning the extraterritorial application of the ECHR. For a global comparison other human rights treaties and their jurisdiction clauses are reviewed in order to evaluate the status quo in this field and the impacts on states’ actions and respective policies thereof. The Article 1 plays a fundamental role in this context and thus it is reflected throughout the thesis...|$|E
