40|$|Abstract—Source {{location}} {{privacy is}} an important issue in sensor network monitoring applications. It is difficult to be addressed by traditional security mechanisms, because an external attacker may perform simple traffic analysis to trace back to the event source. Solutions such as flooding or using <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> have the drawback of introducing a large amount of message overhead. In this paper, we avoid using network-wide <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> by utilizing beacons at the MAC layer. Beacons are sent out regularly, which essentially forms a constant-rate of <b>dummy</b> <b>messages.</b> Using beacons to replace the <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> may increase the delivery delay of event information because beacons are only sent out at the predefined beacon interval, but this latency can be controlled. To do this, we propose a crosslayer solution in which the event information is first propagated several hops through a MAC-layer beacon. Then, it is propagated at the routing layer to the destination to avoid further beacon delays. Simulation results show that our cross-layer solutions can maintain low message overhead and high privacy, while controlling delay. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Communication privacy {{techniques}} that pro-tect {{the locations of}} source sensor nodes and sink nodes from either global or local adversaries have received significant attention recently. The improvement in capture time, which is {{the time it takes}} for an adversary to identify the location of the source, is often estimated using simulations. In this paper, we present probabilistic models to analyze the expected capture time of source sensor nodes for recently privacy protocols against (1) local adversary using phantom routing, and (2) global adversary using statistically strong source anonymity (SSA). Using these models, we show that both phantom routing and SSA fall short of achieving high degree of anonymity. The phantom source routing improves the capture time over normal routing methods, but falls short of possible upper bounds on expected capture time. SSA is prone to simple time correlation attack by a global adversary; even with a large number of <b>dummy</b> <b>message</b> transmitted by non-source nodes, the propagation of one real message from source to sink will be sufficient to identify the source with almost no false positives. Based on these findings, we suggest a simple modification to SSA that increases the false positive rate to nearly 90 percent and thus the capture time. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} value of limited rate {{cooperation}} between the transmitters for managing interference and simultaneously ensuring secrecy, in the 2 -user Gaussian symmetric interference channel (GSIC). First, the problem is studied in the symmetric linear deterministic IC (SLDIC) setting, and achievable schemes are proposed, based on interference cancelation, relaying of the other user's data bits, and transmission of random bits. In the proposed achievable scheme, the limited rate cooperative link is used to share a combination of data bits and random bits depending on the model parameters. Outer bounds on the secrecy rate are also derived, using a novel partitioning of the encoded messages and outputs depending on the relative strength of the signal and the interference. The inner and outer bounds are derived under all possible parameter settings. It is found that, for some parameter settings, {{the inner and outer}} bounds match, yielding the capacity of the SLDIC under transmitter cooperation and secrecy constraints. In some other scenarios, the achievable rate matches with the capacity region of the 2 -user SLDIC without secrecy constraints derived by Wang and Tse [1]; thus, the proposed scheme offers secrecy for free, in these cases. Inspired by the achievable schemes and outer bounds in the deterministic case, achievable schemes and outer bounds are derived in the Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian case is based on Marton's coding scheme and stochastic encoding along with <b>dummy</b> <b>message</b> transmission. One of the key techniques used in the achievable scheme for both the models is interference cancelation, which simultaneously offers two seemingly conflicting benefits: it cancels interference and ensures secrecy. Many of the results derived in this paper extend to the asymmetric case also. Comment: 77 pages, part of it has been accepted for publication in SPAWC 2013 and NCC 2014.

40|$|In {{multiuser}} wireless communications, interference {{not only}} limits {{the performance of}} the system, but also allows users to eavesdrop on other users’ messages. Hence, interference management in multiuser wireless communication has received significant attention in the last decade, both in the academia and industry. The interference channel (IC) is one of the simplest information theoretic models to analyze the effect of interference on the throughput and secrecy of individual messages in a multiuser setup. In this thesis, the IC is studied under different settings with and without the secrecy constraint. The main contributions of the thesis are as follows: • The generalized degrees of freedom (GDOF) has emerged as a useful approximate measure of the potential throughput of a multiuser wireless system. Also, multiple antennas at the transmitter and receiver can provide additional dimension for signaling, which can in turn improve the GDOF performance of the IC. In the initial part of the thesis, a K-user MIMO Gaussian IC (GIC) is studied from an achievable GDOF perspective. An inner bound on GDOF is derived using a combination of techniques such as treating interference as noise, zero-forcing receiving, interference alignment (IA), and extending the Han-Kobayashi (HK) scheme to K users. Also, outer bounds on the sum rate of the K-user MIMO GIC are derived, under different assumptions of cooperation and providing side information to the receivers. The derived outer bounds are simplified to obtain outer bounds on the GDOF. The relative performance of these bounds yields insight into the performance limits of the multiuser MIMO GIC and the relative merits of different schemes for interference management. • Then, the problem of designing the precoding and receive filtering matrices for IA is explored for K-user MIMO (M × N) GIC. Two algorithms for designing the precoding and receive filtering matrices for IA in the block fading or constant MIMO IC with a finite number of symbol extensions are proposed. The first algorithm for IA is based on aligning a subset of the interfering signal streams at each receiver. As the first algorithm requires global channel knowledge at each node, a distributed algorithm is proposed which requires only limited channel knowledge at each node. A new performance metric is proposed, that captures the possible loss in signal dimension while designing the precoders. The performance of the algorithms are evaluated by comparing them with existing algorithms for IA precoder design. • In the later part of the thesis, a 2 -user IC with limited-rate transmitter cooperation is studied, to investigate the role of cooperation in managing interference and ensuring secrecy. First, the problem is studied in the deterministic setting, and achievable schemes are proposed, which use a combination of interference cancelation, relaying of the other user’s data bits, time sharing, and transmission of random bits, depending on the rate of the cooperative link and the relative strengths of the signal and the interference. Outer bounds on the secrecy rate are derived, under different assumptions of providing side information to receivers and partitioning the encoded message/output depending on the relative strength of the signal and the interference. The achievable schemes and outer bounds are extended to the Gaussian case. For example, while obtaining outer bounds, for the Gaussian case, {{it is not possible to}} partition the encoded message or output as performed in the deterministic case, and the novelty lies in finding the analogous quantities for the Gaussian case. The proposed achievable scheme for the Gaussian case uses a combination of cooperative and stochastic encoding along with <b>dummy</b> <b>message</b> transmission. For both the models, one of the key techniques used in the achievable scheme is interference cancelation, which has two benefits: it cancels interference and ensures secrecy simultaneously. The results show that limited-rate transmitter cooperation can greatly facilitate secure communications over 2 -user ICs...|$|E

40|$|Sensors {{deployed}} {{to monitor the}} surrounding environment report such information as event type, location, and time when a real event of interest is detected. An adversary may identify the real event source through eavesdropping and traffic analysis. Previous work has studied the source location privacy problem under a local adversary model. In this work, we aim to provide a stronger notion: event source unobservability, which promises that a global adversary cannot know whether a real event has ever occurred {{even if he is}} capable of collecting and analyzing all the messages in the network at all the time. Clearly, event source unobservability is a desirable and critical security property for event monitoring applications, but unfortunately it is also very difficult and expensive to achieve for resource-constrained sensor networks. Our main idea is to introduce carefully chosen dummy traffic to hide the real event sources in combination with mechanisms to drop <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> to prevent explosion of network traffic. To achieve the latter, we select some sensors as proxies that proactively filter <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> {{on their way to the}} base station.

30|$|Protecting the sink's {{location}} privacy {{under the}} global attack model is challenging. We can encrypt and authenticate all packets during their forwarding to prevent content privacy [4]; however, this cannot solve the traffic analysis attack threat [1, 35]. For example, traffic patterns of WSNs can disclose valuable statistical information that exposes {{the location of}} sink(s), thus jeopardizing their location privacy. Current literatures describe techniques that employ fake sink(s) [5, 26], <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> [25], <b>dummy</b> trajectories [36], random message forwarding delay [1], multipath [24] routing, and false distances between nodes to the sink(s) [37].

(3) There is a trade-off between communication/computation/consumption cost and offered security/privacy level. Use of dummy traffic [38] increases significantly the volume of network traffic, thus increasing the communication, computation, and energy consumption costs. The goal we set for this work is to come up with a technology capable of defending sink(s) location privacy, even when the global attacker applies all the abovementioned kinds of traffic analysis attack simultaneously.

In the QRS scheme, there is a trade-off between the resilience against spam attacks and the number of authentications. Our experiments show that, in the worst-case scenario that we considered, a not quarantined node catches 80 percent of the spam messages by authenticating only 50 percent of all messages that it processes.

40|$|Multi-hop Wireless Networks (MWNs) {{represent}} {{a class of}} networks where messages are forwarded through multiple hops of wireless transmission. Applications of this newly emerging communication paradigm include asset monitoring wireless sensor networks (WSNs), command communication mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), community- or campus-wide wireless mesh networks (WMNs), etc. Information security {{is one of the}} major barriers to the wide-scale deployment of MWNs but has received little attention so far. On the one hand, due to the open wireless channels and multi-hop wireless transmissions, MWNs are vulnerable to various information security threats such as eavesdropping, data injection/modification, node compromising, traffic analysis, and flow tracing. On the other hand, the characteristics of MWNs including the vulnerability of intermediate network nodes, multi-path packet forwarding, and limited computing capability and storage capacity make the existing information security schemes designed for the conventional wired networks or single-hop wireless networks unsuitable for MWNs. Therefore, newly designed schemes are highly desired to meet the stringent security and performance requirements for the information security of MWNs. In this research, we focus on three fundamental information security issues in MWNs: efficient privacy preservation for source anonymity, which is critical to the information security of MWNs; the traffic explosion issue, which targets at preventing denial of service (DoS) and enhancing system availability; and the cooperative peer-to-peer information exchange issue, which is critical to quickly achieve maximum data availability if the base station is temporarily unavailable or the service of the base station is intermittent. We have made the following three major contributions. Firstly, we identify the severe threats of traffic analysis/flow tracing attacks to the information security in network coding enabled MWNs. To prevent these attacks and achieve source anonymity in MWNs, we propose a network coding based privacy-preserving scheme. The unique “mixing” feature of network coding is exploited in the proposed scheme to confuse adversaries from conducting advanced privacy attacks, such as time correlation, size correlation, and message content correlation. With homomorphic encryption functions, the proposed scheme can achieve both privacy preservation and data confidentiality, which are two critical information security requirements. Secondly, to prevent traffic explosion and at the same time achieve source unobservability in MWNs, we propose a network coding based privacy-preserving scheme, called SUNC (Source Unobservability using Network Coding). Network coding is utilized in the scheme to automatically absorb <b>dummy</b> <b>messages</b> at intermediate network nodes, and thus, traffic explosion induced denial of service (DoS) can be naturally prevented to ensure the system availability. In addition to ensuring system availability and achieving source unobservability, SUNC can also thwart internal adversaries. Thirdly, to enhance the data availability when a base station is temporarily unavailable or the service of the base station is intermittent, we propose a cooperative peer-to-peer information exchange scheme based on network coding. The proposed scheme can quickly accomplish optimal information exchange in terms of throughput and transmission delay. For each research issue, detailed simulation results in terms of computational overhead, transmission efficiency, and communication overhead, are given to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed solutions...|$|R
