At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot exhaust gasses before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe pipe-in-pipe {{which the}} authors propose {{in this paper}} is an {{innovative}} structural material to exert a more flexible and ductile bending performance than usual steel pipes. It consists of double thin wall pipes with granular materials such as sand between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>pipes</b> to transmit their interactive stresses within a cross section. If a single hollow pipe is subjected to bending moment, the curvature of the pipe increases with the growth in magnitude of bending moment. Upon increasing of the bending moment, the pipe finally failed by local failure, and an oval-shaped deformation of cross section was observed. This failure {{is known as the}} Brazier Effect, a kind of local buckling. However, the major parts of the pipe still keep its original strength except for the failure portion. The sand filled between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>pipes</b> of the pipe-in-pipe prevent this local failure by transmitting the interactive stresses between the pipes. As a result, smooth and flexible bending deformation is realized even under large bending moments.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study four {{problems}} with potential biological and industrial applications which rely on fluid mixing and transport. The problem of simultaneous ultrafiltration, diffusion and osmosis across a membrane separating two fluids is studied, numerically and asymptotically, {{as a model}} for an artificial kidney dialyser. Couplings between the different transport mechanisms prove significant in determining overall transport rates. Our model appears {{to be the first to}} treat the three transport mechanisms in a spatially structured framework, and shows that previous, spatially averaged models can overestimate transport rates. Our results can be used to optimise dialyser geometry and to profile dialysis sessions. The remainder of this thesis concerns some fundamentals of fluid mixing and mixer design. Techniques for assessing the quality of fluid mixing are reviewed, and applied to a two-dimensional laminar chaotic flow. We find no outright optimum mixing method across the range of measures, suggesting that `sieving' a collection of mixing methods according to increasingly complicated mixing measures may fail to identify a global optimum. `Topological chaos' appears to allow good mixing stretch rate to be built-in to batch mixer design, avoiding the need to tune the mixer parameters, provided a correct flow topology is created. We show that the theoretical stretch rate predictions are achieved quite tightly, in practice in a significant fraction of the flow domain; we investigate the practicalities of topologically chaotic mixers. Finally, we discuss whether topological chaos may also apply to three-dimensional static mixer design, in a braided pipe mixer, in which pipe flow is mixed around carefully designed twisted <b>inner</b> <b>pipes.</b> We expect such a device to mix well if the <b>inner</b> <b>pipes</b> have appropriate topology. However, we demonstrate how three-dimensional flow features can undermine mixing performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Assuming that the hydraulic head in the aquifer will reach or exceed the preconsolidation level in the near future, will subsidence in the Houston-Galveston area eventually cease? The key to answer this question is to identify if there is deep-seated subsidence in this area. This study investigated the recent subsidence observed at different depths in the Houston-Galveston area. The subsidence was recorded by using 13 borehole extensometers and 76 [*]GPS antennas. Four of the GPS antennas are mounted on the deep-anchored <b>inner</b> <b>pipes</b> of borehole extensometers. We conclude that recent subsidence (1993 – 2012) in the Houston-Galveston area was dominated by the compaction of sediments within 600 [*]m below the land surface.

40|$|Abstract — Enhancing {{the heat}} {{transfer}} {{by the use}} of helical coils has been studied and researched by many researchers, because the fluid dynamics inside the pipes of a helical coil heat exchanger offer certain advantages over the straight tubes, shell and tube type heat exchanger, in terms of better heat transfer and mass transfer coefficients. This configuration offers a high compact structure and a high overall heat transfer coefficient; hence helical coil heat exchangers are widely used in industrial applications. Convective heat transfer between a surface and the surrounding fluid in a heat exchanger has been a major issue and a topic of study in the recent years. In this particular study, an attempt has been made to experimental work of various parameters like radius of tubes, pitch of coil, pitch circle diameter, number of turns of helical coil, flow rate and temperature that affect the effectiveness of a heat exchanger and increases heat transfer rate at two different flows (parallel and counter-flow) on the total heat transfer from a helical tube, where the cold fluid flows in the outer pipe and the hot fluid flowing in the <b>inner</b> <b>pipes</b> of the pipe in pipe helical coiled heat exchanger.

50|$|In a {{water-cooled}} {{power reactor}} (or in a water-filled spent fuel pool, SFP), if a power surge occurs {{as a result}} of a reactivity initiated accident, an understanding of the transfer of heat from the surface of the cladding to the water is very useful. In a French study, metal pipe immersed in water (both under typical PWR and SFP conditions), was electrically heated to simulate the generation of heat within a fuel pin by nuclear processes. The temperature of the pipe was monitored by thermocouples and for the tests conducted under PWR conditions the water entering the larger pipe (14.2 mm diameter) holding the test metal pipe (9.5 mm outside diameter and 600 mm long) was at 280 °C and 15 MPa. The water was flowing past the <b>inner</b> <b>pipe</b> at circa 4 ms−1 and the cladding was subjected to heating at 2200 to 4900 °C s−1 to simulate an RIA. It was found that as the temperature of the cladding increased the rate of heat transfer from the surface of the cladding increased at first as the water boiled at nucleation sites. When the heat flux is greater than the critical heat flux a boiling crisis occurs. This occurs as the temperature of the fuel cladding surface increases so that the surface of the metal was too hot (surface dries out) for nucleation boiling. When the surface dries out the rate of heat transfer decreases, after a further increase in the temperature of the metal surface the boiling resumes but it is now film boiling.|$|E
5000|$|On 8 September, BP {{released}} a 193-page report on its web site. The report identified 8 key findings {{with respect to}} the cause of the accident. 1) The day before the accident, cement had been poured to fill the gap between the borehole (the actual hole in the ground) and the casing (the outermost pipe), and this cement failed and oil moved into that space from the reservoir. 2) Oil then entered the production casing (an <b>inner</b> <b>pipe)</b> although two barriers (one made of cement called a [...] "shoe track") were supposed to prevent this. 3) A test was conducted as to whether the well was sealed (a negative pressure test), conducted by temporarily replacing heavy drilling mud with lighter seawater. This is controlled unbalancing of the well. The test was considered successful, although it was not, since oil was actually moving out of the reservoir. The report names the Transocean rig crew and the BP staff on hand as having made this error. 4) When the test was completed, the seawater was replaced with mud, stopping the flow. But later, when preparing to temporarily shut down the well, mud was again replaced with seawater, allowing oil to flow up the riser toward the rig. This flow was detected by pressure sensors on the rig. The report blames the rig crew for missing the increased pressure readings. 5) When the flow was noticed, the crew activated the blowout preventer and diverted the oil to a mud separation system rather than diverting it into the ocean; diverting it into the ocean may have spared much of the damage. 6) The design of the mud separation system allowed the oil to keep coming and gas carried by the oil to be vented onto the rig. 7) The venting system allowed the gas to move into areas of the rig where it would be in contact with electrical equipment. 8) The blowout preventer failed in several ways; controls on the rig were disabled by the explosion; an automatic shutoff system within the blowout preventer failed, probably due to failure of two components - a solenoid and battery; when a submersible was able to activate a blind shear within the blowout preventer, the blind shear functioned but failed to seal the well. Transocean, responding to the report, blamed [...] "BP's fatally flawed well design." ...|$|E
