The bulldozer kept moving, and she slipped and fell off the plow. But the bulldozer kept moving, the shovel above her. I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about 10 or 15 meters that it dragged her {{and for some reason}} didn't stop. We shouted like crazy to the operator through loudspeakers that he should stop, but he just kept going and didn't lift the shovel. Then it stopped and backed up. We ran to Rachel. She was still breathing.|$|E

She said [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my rebellious phase. It wasn't really for me. I kind of smartened up and tried to distance myself from that." [...] As of May 2016, Khalifa was still performing as a webcam model.|$|E
500|$|Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer {{that the}} rain was the biggest {{challenge}} of the night shoot, as it was [...] "beyond freezing". She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and they made her feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E

You haven’t <b>guessed</b> what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> And {{you must}} <b>guess</b> what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I can’t think of taking it out, till you <b>guess</b> what <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> Don’t be {{in such a}} hurry! Wait a minute! A {{little bit more of}} the cover. Now guess!’ ...|$|R
500|$|Despite her {{interest}} in acting from an early age, Pinto was undecided on which career path to take until watching Monster (2003) while at college. She stated: [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> when I watched Monster... I pretty much knew. I {{had to find a}} way. I had to do something like that, something completely transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E
500|$|Several Americans {{died during}} and after the raid. A {{prisoner}} weakened by illness {{died of a heart attack}} as a Ranger carried him from the barracks to the main gate. The Ranger later recalled, [...] "The excitement had been too much for him, I <b>guess.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> really sad. He was only a hundredfeet from the freedom he had not known for nearly threeyears." [...] Another prisoner died of illness just as the group had reached Talavera. Although Mucci had ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could evacuate Fisher to get medical attention, it was never dispatched, and he died the next day. His last words were [...] "Good luck on the way out." [...] The other Ranger killed during the raid was Sweezy, who was struck in the back by two rounds from friendly fire. Both Fisher and Sweezy are buried at Manila National Cemetery. Twenty of Pajota's guerrillas were injured, as were twoScouts and twoRangers.|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} the studio, Herren met Joshua Kay and Romulo del Castillo, two Miami-based {{producers}} who had founded Schematic Records, a label known for IDM. Herren recorded and composed music on his MPC and manipulated it to fit Schematic's aesthetic. While {{working at the}} recording studio, Herren felt that the hip hop musicians coming in had very trite lyrics, and felt he could use them for his own Prefuse 73 material. For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren sampled more famous hip hop records by artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Herren stated that he used some of his favorite MCs instead of the musicians he worked with, as he felt these artists were [...] "saying totally relevant stuff, but I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just my excitement to make it happen. But a vocal doesn't have to say anything. Why not challenge people's imagination and let it say whatever they want it to?" [...] For Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives, Herren created the music using two turntables plugged into his MPC. To create the glitch sounds through the MPC, Herren switched between different sample sources by instantaneously silencing groups of audio channels at the same time.|$|E

500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Shermer, who {{considers}} himself {{an admirer of}} Rand, has tempered his judgment. Contrasting Leonard Peikoff's [...] "heavy-hammer approach" [...] with the [...] "big-tent approach" [...] of The Atlas Society, Shermer told Ed Hudgins: [...] "If we're close enough {{on the same page}} about many things, I think it's more useful to cut people some slack, rather than going after them on some smaller points. I don't see the advantage of saying, 'You shouldn't have liked that movie because ultimately, if you were an Objectivist, you wouldn't have.' I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> those sorts of judgments made by some Objectiv that I objected to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been kind}} of supposing that you must be going to marry somebody, and folks just <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me," [...] said Young Thomas--he said it anxiously.|$|R

2500|$|The {{sound of}} the {{original}} rave style is barely (if at all) discernible (save some typical analog synth lines) {{in the majority of}} bands referred to as new rave. Bands such as The Sunshine Underground, Cansei de Ser Sexy and Hot Chip are often labeled as new rave due to their large following by fans of the genre. M.I.A. has been described as [...] "a new raver before it was old." [...] Several have publicly declared they {{had nothing to do with}} the genre. Stylist Carri Mundane described it as funny, saying New Rave was [...] "Vacant in retro. It’s just a marketing machine.... I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a fun time but I’m more excited about what happens now. The next level - the next generation. There’s a mood of neo-spiritualism and futurism that excites me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The lead single, [...] "Chains", {{was issued}} {{ahead of the}} album in September 1994 in Australia, which peaked at No.4 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached No.6 in the UK, No.7 in New Zealand, No.9 in Ireland and No.20 in Canada. In 1995 she toured Europe, {{appearing}} on Top of the Pops, which broadcast {{to an audience of}} 60million people. In the European market Arena was an unknown and a fresh commodity, she opined: [...] "I loved every minute of that – of people not knowing who I was. I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> tiring fighting the individual thing. It was good to not {{be a part of a}} past and being accepted as an artist. Not having to carry this Young Talent Time luggage which was constantly shoved in my face." [...] Five additional singles were released, [...] "Sorrento Moon (I Remember)" [...] (February 1995), [...] "Heaven Help My Heart" [...] (May), [...] "Wasn't It Good" [...] (September), [...] "Show Me Heaven" [...] (November) and [...] "That's the Way a Woman Feels" [...] (March 1996).|$|E
2500|$|In May 1994 Steć, Pazik, Major Donny MacNeil of Canada and Colonel Clayton Yaache of Ghana {{along with}} four Tunisian UNAMIR peacekeepers {{attempted}} unsuccessfully an evacuation {{of some of}} those trapped in the Hotel des Mille Collines with MacNeil and Steć reading the names of those to be evacuated in the crowded hotel lobby. [...] "I had a 'Schindler's List' of the people we were allowed to save. The conditions were: they did need a visa guarantee and a financial guarantee that they would be received outside Rwanda (...). Although approved by the Rwandan Chief of Staff, the convoy was halted by military and militia and following a very dangerous stand off they managed to return the refuges safely to the Hotel des Milles Collines. A few blocks away from the Mille Collines, there was a church, l' Eglise St. Famille, with more than 5000 refugees. Every night militia were killing people there. We did nothing to evacuate them and I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because they didn't have visas".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "as we'll {{probably}} be here {{a day or}} two, I <b>guess</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> I'll {{tell you about it}} when we get supper." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she replied, {{with a faint}} note of truculence in her tone. [...] "You know I'm not {{short of}} money, and I <b>guessed</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> where I should find you." ...|$|R
