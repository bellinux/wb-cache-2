5|$|A {{shakedown}} of {{the system}} {{took place during the}} first two weeks of November 1967 and it seemed to work. The PAVN siege of the U.S. Marines at the Khe Sanh Combat Base, in western Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, provided the opportunity for an operational test. The American command in Saigon launched Operation Niagara, the largest tactical and B-52 operation thus far in the conflict, to support the Marines at Khe Sanh. By the end of January 1968, Muscle Shoals had emplaced 316 sensors in 44 strings to detect PAVN troop movements in the vicinity of the combat base. The operation was deemed a success, but locating and targeting enemy troops moving toward a fixed location like Khe Sanh was not the same as doing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ho Chi Minh Trail.|$|E

5|$|According to Ovid, Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid was not to blame for Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. Ovid further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. Ovid therefore blamed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Furies.|$|E
5|$|According to USA Today, the match-up {{between the}} Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes (OSU) {{was one of}} the most-anticipated games of the 2005season. Teams have become {{increasingly}} conservative in scheduling highly ranked non-conference opponents, so a meeting of the number 2 and number 4 teams in the country was unusual this early in the season. Because of the significance of the game in the national championship race, ESPN College GameDay chose the game as the site of its weekly broadcast. The American Football Coaches Association brought the national championship trophy to the game and displayed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field near Bevo, the UT mascot (photo below).|$|E

5|$|Acorn Antiques {{is perhaps}} the best-remembered regular item from the series. It was a spoof soap opera set in an {{antiques}} shop, which, despite its provincial high-street status, manages to supply an unending stream of works by Picasso, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. The two shop customers appearing {{at the start of}} each sketch, examining some antique, are always played by the same two actors. The sketch parodied the soap genre with its bad acting, ridiculous dialogue and contrived plot twists. Wood, as a homage, based <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long-running ATV/Central serial Crossroads, and the BBC radio soap opera Waggoners Walk (1969–1980).|$|E
5|$|After {{destroying}} the gravity well, Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth, doubting the Chief and Cortana's testimony. The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana, and stays behind {{to oppose the}} Didact. Infinity executive officer Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck. Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact's ship before he leaves, but when they are unsuccessful they follow the Didact to a Halo ring, Installation 03. The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station, which the Covenant attack. The Chief defends Ivanoff, but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> station, composing every individual except the Chief.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if and when it is detected.|$|E

5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be the spelling for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature that a more solid justification for assuming one spelling over the other was proposed.|$|E

Da Matta and Mears both held the position over the next two laps before Papis reclaimed it on lap 109. Andretti passed Papis to move into the first position on lap 110, before the Italian reclaimed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next lap. Da Matta, Andretti, Papis and Fernández all held the position over the following four laps. Green-flag pit stops began on lap 116. Papis and da Matta made their pit stops on laps 119 and 120. After the pit stops, Fernández moved back into the lead. Fittiapldi took over the first position on the 133rd lap, before Fernández passed him to retake the lead four laps later. Papis and Moreno shared the first position between laps 139 and 140, before da Matta retook the position seven laps later. Papis passed him to reclaim the lead on lap 148. Fernández moved back into first place on lap 150, and held a 0.7 second advantage over da Matta, who in turn was three-tenths of a second in front of Papis.|$|E
