25|$|Marasmus (‘to waste away’) {{is caused}} by an {{inadequate}} intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels. Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival. It is traditionally seen in famine, significant <b>food</b> <b>restriction,</b> or more severe cases of anorexia. Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in <b>food</b> <b>restriction.</b> Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{gastrointestinal}} complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation, but also include elevated liver function tests, diarrhea, acute pancreatitis, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and, rarely, superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following <b>food</b> <b>restriction</b> and weight loss; {{the most common}} symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. Other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using metoclopramide to increase emptying of food from the stomach. Gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.|$|E

2500|$|For example, it {{is still}} widely {{perceived}} that gastric bypass works by mechanical means, i.e. <b>food</b> <b>restriction</b> and/or malabsorption. Recent clinical and animal studies, however, have indicated that these long-held inferences about the mechanisms of Roux en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) may not be correct. A {{growing body of evidence}} suggests that profound changes in body weight and metabolism resulting from RYGB cannot be explained by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption. One study in rats found that RYGB induced a 19% increase in total and a 31% increase in resting energy expenditure, an effect not exhibited in vertical sleeve gastrectomy rats. [...] In addition, pair-fed rats lost only 47% as much weight as their RYGB counterparts. Changes in food intake after RYGB only partially account for the RYGB-induced weight loss, and {{there is no evidence of}} clinically significant malabsorption of calories contributing to weight loss. Thus, it appears RYGB affects weight loss by altering the physiology of weight regulation and eating behavior rather than by simple mechanical restriction or malabsorption.|$|E

2500|$|Activity {{anorexia}} (AA) is {{a condition}} where rats begin to exercise excessively while simultaneously cutting down on their food intake, similar to human anorexia nervosa or hypergymnasia. When given free access to food and an exercise wheel, rats normally develop a balanced routine between exercise and food intake, which turns them into fit rats. However, if food intake is restricted and wheel access is unrestricted, rats begin to exercise more and eat less, resulting in excessive weight loss and, ultimately, death. The running cycles shift so {{that most of the}} running is done in hours before feeding is scheduled. In other conditions, AA does not develop. Unrestricted food access and restricted wheel access will not cause any significant change in either feeding or exercise routine. Also, if rats are restricted both in food intake and wheel access, they will adjust accordingly. In fact, if rats are first trained to the feeding schedule and then given unrestricted access to a running wheel, they will not develop AA behavior. Results support the notion that the running interferes with adaptation to the new feeding schedule and is associated with the reward system in the brain. One theory is that running simulates foraging, a natural behavior in wild rats. Laboratory rats therefore run (forage) more in response to food shortages. [...] The effect of semi-starvation on activity has also been studied in primates. Rhesus macaque males become hyperactive in response to long-term chronic <b>food</b> <b>restriction.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Food {{and luxury}} {{competitions}} {{have been a}} part of the series since it first premiered. In early seasons, the losers of the food competition would be placed on a peanut butter and jelly diet, and would not be permitted to eat any other foods. Beginning with Big Brother 7, the losers of the Have-Not competition were required to eat [...] "Big Brother Slop" [...] for food, sleep in the Have-Not bedroom, and take cold showers for the week. Slop has proven to be an issue for some HouseGuests; Hypoglycemic HouseGuest Amanda Hansen fainted and had a seizure after only a few days of being on the slop diet, while HouseGuest Allison Nichols had an allergic reaction to the slop (both of these cases occurred in Big Brother 9). Both women were medically evacuated from the house, though they returned the following morning. HouseGuests who choose to break the slop rule are punished by Big Brother. HouseGuest Jen Johnson from Big Brother 8 was the first HouseGuest to break the <b>food</b> <b>restriction</b> rules, and earned a penalty eviction vote for doing so; she was ultimately evicted that week. Audrey Middleton from Big Brother 17 and Matt Clines from Big Brother 19 also broke the rules and earned a penalty vote and ultimately evicted. HouseGuests Jeff Schroeder and Kevin Campbell of Big Brother 11 also broke the rules, to a lesser degree, and earned an extra day on the slop diet. The HouseGuests also frequently compete in luxury competitions during their time in the house. Most frequently, HouseGuests will compete for the right to watch a film or television show in the house. When competitions for films or television shows occur, an actor or actress from the series may enter the house to host the competition or speak with the HouseGuests. Actors such as Jeremy Piven, David Hasselhoff, and Neil Patrick Harris have all entered the house to participate in luxury competitions or rewards.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{forms of}} the drug carry {{warnings}} about <b>food</b> <b>restrictions,</b> to avoid hypertensive crisis {{that are associated with}} MAO inhibitors. [...] The patch form of the drug was created in part to overcome the issues with food restrictions: the clinical trials did not include <b>food</b> <b>restrictions,</b> and no hypertensive crisis during the course of them. Additionally, in post-marketing surveillance from April 2006 to October 2010, only 13 self-reports of possible hypertensive events or hypertension were made out of 29,141 exposures to the drug, and none were accompanied by objective clinical data. The lowest dose of the patch method of delivery, 6mg/24 hours, does not require any dietary restrictions. Higher doses of the patch and oral formulations, whether in combination with the older non-selective MAOIs or in combination with the reversible MAO-A inhibitor moclobemide, require a low tyramine diet.|$|R

This study examined family correlates of children's pocket money, associations of pocket money with eating behaviors and weight status, {{and how the}} associations may be modified by schools' unhealthy <b>food</b> <b>restrictions</b> in urban China. Data were collected in 2015 from 1648 students in 16 primary and middle schools in four mega-cities in China (4 schools/city) : Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Xi'an. Cluster robust negative binomial regression models were fit to assess family correlates of pocket money, associations of pocket money with child eating behaviors and weight outcomes, and possible modifying effects of schools' unhealthy <b>food</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Sixty-nine percent of students received pocket money weekly. Students received more pocket money if mothers frequently ate out of home (IRR =  2. 28 [1. 76, 2. 94]) and/or family rarely had dinner together (IRR =  1. 42, 95 % = [1. 01, 1. 99]). Students got less pocket money if parents were concerned about child's future health due to unhealthy eating (IRR =  0. 56 [0. 32, 0. 98]). Students with more pocket money more frequently consumed (by 25 – 89 %) sugary beverages, snacks, fast food, or at street food stalls, and were 45 – 90 % {{more likely to be}} overweight/obese.

40|$|Purpose: Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma and its treatment are associated with facial disfigurement and functional inabilities {{that may lead to}} malnutrition or under nourishment. This study assessed the incidence of <b>food</b> <b>restrictions</b> in patients undergoing treatment for oral and oropharyngeal cancer. Method: We interviewed 120 patients in two hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil, using a structured food frequency questionnaire comprising the most commonly consumed foods in Brazil. This questionnaire was applied twice; the first time to inform dietary patterns prior to the diagnosis of cancer and the second time to assess recent modifications of diet that were associated with the disease and its treatment. Hospital files provided information on clinical status. Multivariate Poisson regression models assessed covariates with prognostic value. Results: One third of patients suffered major <b>food</b> <b>restrictions</b> (i. e., they reduced substantially the intake of more than 50 % of the most commonly consumed food items before the diagnosis); 39 % suffered a less severe condition (they could not eat less than 50 % of the most commonly consumed food items before the diagnosis, and they needed changes in food preparation). Larger tumour size (adjusted incidence ratio IR = 1. 45), posterior location (IR = 1. 33), radiotherapy (IR = 1. 84), loss of tongue mobility (IR = 1. 36) and loss of teeth (IR = 1. 25) in the surgery were associated significantly with the study outcome. Conclusion: This study identified clinical predictors of <b>food</b> <b>restrictions</b> in patients undergoing treatment for oral and oropharyngeal cancer. This knowledge may contribute to improve patient care and management, and to develop interventions aimed at preventing nutritional depletion of these patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Dynorphin {{has been}} implicated as an {{appetite}} stimulant. A {{number of studies}} in rats have shown that increasing the dynorphin levels stimulates eating.
