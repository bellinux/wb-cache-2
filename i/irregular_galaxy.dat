5|$|The {{constellation}} {{does not}} lie on the galactic plane of the Milky Way, {{and there are no}} prominent star clusters. NGC 625 is a dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxy</b> of apparent magnitude 11.0 and lying some 12.7 million light years distant. Only 24000 light years in diameter, it is an outlying member of the Sculptor Group. NGC 625 is thought to have been involved in a collision and is experiencing a burst of active star formation. NGC 37 is a lenticular galaxy of apparent magnitude 14.66. It is approximately 42 kiloparsecs (137,000 light-years) in diameter and about 12.9 billion years old. Robert's Quartet (composed of the <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxy</b> NGC 87, and three spiral galaxies NGC 88, NGC 89 and NGC 92) is a group of four galaxies located around 160 million light-years away which {{are in the process of}} colliding and merging. They are within a circle of radius of 1.6 arcmin, corresponding to about 75,000 light-years. Located in the galaxy ESO 243-49 is HLX-1, an intermediate-mass black hole—the first one of its kind identified. It is thought to be a remnant of a dwarf galaxy that was absorbed in a collision with ESO 243-49. Before its discovery, this class of black hole was only hypothesized.|$|E

50|$|Type Sm and Im galaxies {{have also}} been {{categorized}} as <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> with some structure (type Irr-1).

50|$|Collectively {{they are}} thought to make up {{about a quarter of}} all <b>galaxies.</b> Some <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> were once spiral or {{elliptical}} galaxies but were deformed by an uneven external gravitational force. <b>Irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> may contain abundant amounts of gas and dust.

25|$|The {{constellation}} {{also contains}} the Sculptor Dwarf, a dwarf galaxy {{which is a}} member of the Local Group, as well as the Sculptor Group, the group of galaxies closest to the Local Group. The Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), a barred spiral galaxy and the largest member of the group, lies near the border between Sculptor and Cetus.

40|$|The {{problems}} associated with measurements of star formation rates in galaxies are briefly reviewed, and specific models are presented for determinations of current star formation rates from H alpha and Far Infrared (FIR) luminosities. The models are applied {{to a sample of}} optically blue <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies,</b> and the results are discussed in terms of star forming histories. It appears likely that typical <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> are forming stars at nearly constant rates, although a few examples of systems with enhanced star forming activity are found among HII regions and luminous <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies...</b>|$|R

25|$|At {{magnitude}} 2.2, Alpha Cassiopeiae, or Schedar, {{is generally}} {{the brightest star}} in Cassiopeia, though is often shaded by Gamma Cassiopeiae, which has brightened to magnitude 1.6 on occasion. The constellation hosts some of the most luminous stars known, including the yellow hypergiants Rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae and white hypergiant 6 Cassiopeiae. The semiregular variable PZ Cassiopeiae {{is one of the largest}} known stars. In 1572, Tycho Brahe's supernova flared brightly in Cassiopeia. Cassiopeia A is a supernova remnant and the brightest extrasolar radio source in the sky at frequencies above 1GHz. Fourteen star systems have been found to have exoplanets, one of which—HR 8832—is thought to host seven planets. A rich section of the Milky Way runs through Cassiopeia, containing a number of open clusters, young luminous galactic disc stars, and nebulae. IC 10 is an <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxy</b> that is the closest known starburst galaxy and the only one in the Local Group of galaxies.|$|E
500|$|The Tucana Dwarf galaxy, {{which was}} {{discovered}} in 1990, is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy of type dE5 that is an isolated member of the Local Group. It is located [...] from the Solar System and around [...] from the barycentre of the Local Group—the second most remote of all member galaxies after the Sagittarius Dwarf <b>Irregular</b> <b>Galaxy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Centaurus {{is rich in}} galaxies as well. NGC 4622 is a face-on {{spiral galaxy}} located 200 million light-years from Earth (redshift 0.0146). Its spiral arms wind in both directions, which makes it nearly {{impossible}} for astronomers to determine {{the rotation of the}} galaxy. Astronomers theorize that a collision with a smaller companion galaxy near the core of the main galaxy could have led to the unusual spiral structure. NGC 5253, a peculiar <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxy,</b> is located near the border with Hydra and M83, with which it likely had a close gravitational interaction 1-2 billion years ago. This may have sparked the galaxy's high rate of star formation, which continues today and contributes to its high surface brightness. NGC 5253 includes a large nebula and at least 12 large star clusters. In the eyepiece, it is a small galaxy of magnitude 10 with dimensions of 5 arcminutes by 2 arcminutes and a bright nucleus. NGC 4945 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on from Earth, 13 million light-years away. It is visible with any amateur telescope, as well as binoculars under good conditions; it has been described as [...] "shaped like a candle flame", being long and thin (16' by 3'). In the eyepiece of a large telescope, its southeastern dust lane becomes visible. Another galaxy is NGC 5102, found by star-hopping from Iota Centauri. In the eyepiece, it appears as an elliptical object 9 arcminutes by 2.5 arcminutes tilted on a southwest-northeast axis.|$|E
40|$|We {{determine}} the radial abundance distributions across the discs of 14 <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> {{of the types}} Sm and Im (morphological T types 9 and 10) as traced by their H II regions. The oxygen and nitrogen abundances in H II regions are estimated through the Te method or/and with the counterpart method (C method). Moreover, we examine the correspondence between the radial abundance gradient and the surface brightness profile. We find that <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> with a flat inner profile (flat or outwardly increasing surface brightness in the central region) show shallow (if any) radial abundance gradients. On the other hand, <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> with a steep inner profile (with or without a bulge or central star cluster) usually show rather steep radial abundance gradients. This {{is in contrast to}} the widely held belief that <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> do not usually show a radial abundance gradient...|$|R

40|$|The low-luminosity dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> are considered. The oxygen abundances in HII {{regions of}} dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> were recalculated from {{published}} spectra through the recently suggested P - method. It {{has been found}} that the metallicity of low-luminosity dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies,</b> with a few exceptions, correlates well with galaxy luminosity. The dispersion of oxygen abundances around the metallicity - luminosity relationship increases with decreasing of galaxy luminosity, as was found by Richer and McCall (1995). No relationship between the oxygen abundance and the absolute magnitude in the blue band for <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> obtained by Hidalgo-Gamez and Olofsson (1998) {{can be explained by the}} large uncertainties in the oxygen abundances derived through the Te - method, that in turn can be explained by the large uncertainties in the measurements of the strengths of the weak oxygen line [OIII] 4363 used in the Te - method.

40|$|A {{number of}} dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> have been {{selected}} in the three most nearby groups of galaxies: the M 81, Centaurus A, and Sculptor groups. The final objective is to establish {{whether there is a}} relationship between the luminosity and the fraction of oxygen contained in dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> and for that homogeneous oxygen abundances and near-IR luminosities are being collected. By comparison of observations from different groups at considerably different interaction rates we are hoping to clear up the debated luminosity-metallicity assumption for the case of dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies.</b> We have reduced, measured and analysed optical spectra of HII regions of five dwarf <b>irregular</b> <b>galaxies</b> in the Sculptor group. Fluxes are measured and corrected from reddening and electron temperatures and homogeneous chemical abundances are obtained. The oxygen abundances normalised to hydrogen are estimated with calculations that ranges between 2 × 10 - 5 and 33 × 10 - 5. The empirical method based on R 23 is also applied.
