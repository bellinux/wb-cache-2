5|$|Nickel {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as <b>German</b> <b>silver.</b> About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E

5|$|The Mint then struck silver or gold in {{response}} to deposits by those holding bullion, and made little profit from those transactions. By the 1840s, profits, or seignorage, from monetizing copper into cents helped fund the Mint. In 1849, copper prices rose sharply, causing the Department of the Treasury to investigate possible alternatives to the large one-cent pieces. The cent was unpopular in trade; as {{it was not a}} legal tender, nobody had to take it, and banks and merchants often refused it. The cent was disliked for its large size as well. In 1837, the eccentric New York chemist Lewis Feuchtwanger had experimented with a smaller cent size in making model coins as part of a plan to sell his alloy (similar to base-metal <b>German</b> <b>silver)</b> to the government for use in coinage. His pieces circulated as hard times tokens in the recession years of the late 1830s and early 1840s.|$|E

In Iran, samovars {{have been used}} for at least two centuries (roughly since the era of close political and ethnic contact between Russia and Iran started), and electrical, oil-burning or natural gas-consuming samovars are still common. Samovar is pronounced samăvar in Persian. Iranian craftsmen used Persian art motifs in their samovar production. The Iranian city of Borujerd has been the main centre of samovar production and a few workshops still produce hand-made samovars. Borujerd's samovars are often made with <b>German</b> <b>silver,</b> in keeping with the famous Varsho-Sazi artistic style. The art samovars of Borujerd are often displayed in Iranian and Western museums as illustrations of Iranian art and handicraft.|$|E

Also considered for use in the cent was [...] "French bronze" [...] (95% copper with the remainder tin and zinc) and various varieties of <b>German</b> <b>silver.</b> In his 1854 annual report, Mint Director James Ross Snowden advocated the issue of small, bronze cents, as well as the elimination of the half cent, which he described as useless in commerce. A number of pattern cents were struck in 1854 and 1855. These featured various designs, including several depictions of Liberty and two adaptations of work by the late Mint chief engraver Christian Gobrecht: one showing a seated Liberty, which Gobrecht had placed on the silver coins in the 1830s, and another of a flying eagle, which Gobrecht had created based upon a sketch by Titian Peale.|$|E

The nine-man jury found her not guilty. The Weekly Arizona Miner of Prescott reported on February 5, 1875, that Sadie Mansfield won a prize in the [...] "Grand New Year Gift Enterprise".

2500|$|Clear hoof polish may {{be applied}} before the horse enters the arena. The horse is {{thoroughly}} clean. The horse's saliva often forms [...] "foam" [...] about the horse's lips, {{which is generally}} considered to be a sign of the horse's submission and acceptance of the bit. Some riders believe that foam should not be cleaned off the horse's mouth before entering the arena due to it being a sign of submission. Conversely, some riders choose to wipe the foam from their horses' mouths prior to entering the arena, as foam can land on the horses' chests and legs. It {{should be noted that the}} presence of foam does not necessarily indicate the horse's acceptance of the bit, as certain metals such as <b>German</b> <b>silver</b> may cause the horse's salivation to increase without full acceptance of the bit.|$|E
2500|$|The Baitcasting reel or revolving-spool reel, {{like the}} {{conventional}} reel, is a multiplying reel – {{that is to}} say that the line is stored on a bearing-supported revolving spool that is geared so that a single revolution of the crank handle results in multiple revolutions of the spool. [...] The bait casting reel is mounted above the rod, hence its other name given to it in New Zealand and Australia, the overhead reel. [...] The baitcasting reel dates from at least the mid-17th century, but came into wide use by amateur anglers during the 1870s. [...] Early bait casting reels were often constructed with brass or iron gears, with casings and spools made of brass, <b>German</b> <b>silver,</b> or hard rubber. [...] Featuring multiplying gears ranging from 2:1 to 4:1, these early reels had no drag mechanism, and anglers used their thumb on the spool to provide resistance to runs by a fish. [...] As early as the 1870s, some models used bearings to mount the spool; as the free-spinning spool tended to cause backlash with strong pulls on the line, manufacturers soon incorporated a clicking pawl mechanism. [...] This 'clicker' mechanism was never intended as a drag, but used solely to keep the spool from overrunning, much like a fly reel. [...] Baitcasting reel users soon discovered that the clicking noise of the pawls provided valuable warning that a fish had taken the live bait, allowing the rod and reel to be left in a rod holder while awaiting a strike by a fish.|$|E
