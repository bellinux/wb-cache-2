2500|$|Twice in Ecclesiastes, {{there are}} concise {{statements}} {{of an idea}} of recurrence: [...] "What has been, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> be [...] ", [...] "What is, has already been; what will be, has already been [...] ", (1:9 and 3:15, resp.). However, their context is not as assertions of a tenet of time being cyclic or infinite; instead, they appear as just items in {{the long list of}} the book's reiterations of its theme that life is hevel (vain, futile). [...] See main article: Ecclesiastes.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{important}} research breakthrough {{came from}} Turner Whitted in 1979. Previous algorithms traced rays from the eye into the scene until they hit an object, but determined the ray color without recursively tracing more rays. [...] Whitted continued the process. [...] When a ray hits a surface, it can generate {{up to three}} new types of rays: reflection, refraction, and shadow. A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. The closest object it intersects <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> {{be seen in the}} reflection. [...] Refraction rays traveling through transparent material work similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material. [...] A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it. [...] This recursive ray tracing added more realism to ray traced images.|$|E

A visit to Moose Murders <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> {{separate}} the connoisseurs of Broadway disaster from mere dilettantes for many moons to come. He later described it as [...] "the worst play I've ever seen on a Broadway stage". Rich's original review stated, [...] "I won't soon forget the spectacle of watching the mummified Sidney rise from his wheelchair to kick an intruder, unaccountably dressed in a moose costume, in the groin." [...] In an end-of-season review, he described Moose Murders as [...] "the season's most stupefying flop—a show so preposterous that it made minor celebrities out of everyone who witnessed it, whether from on stage or in the audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} in the press that the Sauber, Lotus and Force India teams had considered withdrawing from the race to signal a message to Formula One's commercial leaders about the current financial state of the sport following Caterham and Marussia's non-participation in the race. Ecclestone stated that if two of those teams left Formula One then [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> happen" [...] and that teams should only be taking part if they were competitive. Force India team principal Bob Fernley said discussions about a boycott but it would only be performed as a final recourse. Lotus owner Gérard Lopez later admitted he had not heard about the proposed boycott and the team insisted that they would contest the Grand Prix. Vijay Mallya, the owner of Force India, severely criticised suggestions of a boycott six days after the race: [...] "Who said that we wanted to boycott the race? Please tell me. If I am wrong, you educate me. I speak on behalf of Force India. I have never said {{that we are going to}} boycott, and I have clarified this in Austin. Why would we? We have come to go racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
