There are two distinctive processes observed bellow and above 50 K that define different ground states of CDW. The first one due to the weakly pinned elastic CDW freezes at about 50 K and a second one due to the dynamics of topological defects of frozen CDW appears below. Similar change of regime is observed in linear conductivity in the same temperature range This second process we detect also in thermally stimulated discharge, an alternative technique of low frequency dielectric measurement, which allows access to <b>effective</b> <b>frequencies</b> down to 0. 1 mHz. 1...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} type of RAM comprises flat {{plates of}} ferrite material, {{in the form}} of flat tiles fixed to all interior surfaces of the chamber. This type has a smaller <b>effective</b> <b>frequency</b> range than the pyramidal RAM and is designed to be fixed to good conductive surfaces. It is generally easier to fit and more durable than the pyramidal type RAM but is less effective at higher frequencies. Its performance might however be quite adequate if tests are limited to lower frequencies (ferrite plates have a damping curve that makes them most effective between 30 - 1000 MHz).|$|E

This droop is a consequence of the hold property of a conventional DAC, and is not due to the sample and hold that might precede a conventional analog-to-digital converter (ADC).|$|E
50|$|Japan started digital {{broadcasting}} using the DVB-S standard by PerfecTV in October/1996, and DirecTV in December/1997, with communication satellites. Still, DVB-S did not {{satisfy the requirements}} of Japanese broadcasters, such as NHK, key commercial broadcasting stations like Nippon Television, TBS, Fuji Television, TV asahi, TV Tokyo, and WOWOW (Movie-only Pay-TV broadcasting). Consequently, ARIB developed the ISDB-S standards. The requirements were HDTV capability, interactive services, network access and <b>effective</b> <b>frequency</b> utilization, and other technical requirements. The DVB-S standard allows the transmission of a bit stream of roughly 34 Mbit/s with a satellite transponder, which means the transponder can send one HDTV channel. Unfortunately, the NHK broadcasting satellite had only four vacant transponders, which led ARIB and NHK to develop ISDB-S: The new standard could transmit at 51 Mbit/s with a single transponder, which means that ISDB-S is 1.5 times more efficient than DVB-S and that one transponder can transmit two HDTV channels, along with other independent audio and data. Digital satellite broadcasting (BS digital) was started by NHK and followed commercial broadcasting stations on 1 December 2000. Today, SKY PerfecTV!, successor of Skyport TV, and Sky D, CS burn, Platone, EP, DirecTV, J Sky B, and PerfecTV!, adopted the ISDB-S system for use on the 110 degree (east longitude) wide-band communication satellite.|$|E

As a result the network can attain phase synchronization even if the natural interoscillatory couplings are small.
