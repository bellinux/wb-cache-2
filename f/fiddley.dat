The sea must a-caught hum on the upper brudge deck, carried hum clean across the <b>fiddley,</b> an' banged hum head-on tull the pipe cover.

I tull ye ut was fair grewsome. We putt hum {{together}} an' rolled hum in canvas uz we pulled hum out." ...|$|E
60|$|So saying, Captain MacElrath {{turned and}} glanced aft, aloft and alow, and the pilot, {{following}} his gaze, saw the mute but convincing explanation of that loss of time. The smoke-stack, buff-coloured underneath, was white with salt, while the whistle- pipe glittered crystalline in the random sunlight that broke for the instant through a cloud-rift. The port lifeboat was missing, its iron davits, twisted and wrenched, testifying to the mightiness of the blow {{that had been}} struck the old Tryapsic. The starboard davits were also empty. The shattered wreck of the lifeboat they had held lay on the <b>fiddley</b> beside the smashed engine-room skylight, which was covered by a tarpaulin. Below, to star-board, on the bridge deck, the pilot saw the crushed mess-room door, roughly bulkheaded against the pounding seas. Abreast of it, on the smokestack guys, and being taken down by the bos'n and a sailor, hung the huge square of rope netting which had failed to break those seas of their force.|$|E

5000|$|The {{specific}} {{idea for}} the style of Girl Genius came about when Kaja Foglio went through some of Phil's loose drawings: [...] "I was going through all of Phil's old files and I was filing all of the old sketches, and I was coming across weird airships and cats in tophats with walking canes, and all of this... wonderful... Victoriana sci-fi stuff... it was like 'Oh, this is everything I love!'" [...] CBR News quoted Phil Foglio as saying, [...] "We {{wanted to do something}} with a strong female lead character. We both like the tropes associated with mad science, and I really enjoy drawing <b>fiddley</b> Victorian-style gizmos". After some intensive long-term plotting starting in 1993, the Foglios announced the publication of Girl Genius in 2000.|$|E
