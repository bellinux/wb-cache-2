5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> everyday to quench his hunger. It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the <b>human</b> <b>being</b> on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E
5000|$|The {{catch is}} that any such {{characteristic}} that is possessed by all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> will not be possessed only by <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> For example, all <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> but not only <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> are capable of feeling pain; and while only <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are capable of solving complex mathematical problems, not all humans can do this.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{problems}} of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> especially concerning prevention. The theoretical part characterizes forms of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and their {{appearance in the}} Czech Republic. Further the impact of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> on the trafficked subjects and the specificity of social work {{in the sphere of}} trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are described. In the end of the theoretical part organizations engaged in prevention of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> in the Czech Republic are introduced. The aim of the diploma thesis was to map České Budějovice youth's knowledge of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> The subaim of the diploma thesis was to prepare and carry out lectures on prevention of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> at secondary schools and secondary educational establishment and subsequently to map if studentś information about trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> increases after the lectures. In the practical part this research used quantitative investigation, method of questioning, questionnaire technology. Youth's information about trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> in České Budějovice was not better than the hypothesis, which arose pursuant to the results of the pilot research, assumed. By means of following questioning, which ran at intervals from 3 to 6 months after the lecture, it was found out, that students´ knowledge of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> increased however the partial hypothesis was not confirmed. The lecture on prevention of trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> with special intention on working migration abroad and prevention of its risk, done by the author, is stated in the part Apendices...|$|R

5|$|However, when Kraft {{began to}} plan NASA's flight operations, no <b>human</b> <b>being</b> had yet flown in space.

5|$|The {{characters}} in the novel are integral to its understanding. Not only do they highlight the temporal and political context of voodoo and other forces, but they also allow Carpentier to surpass temporal and spatial limitations to reach the ultimate reality of life: the universal essence that lies in every <b>human</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For Zubiri {{there is}} no need for a realist/anti-realist {{discussion}} on if there is or not a reality that is external and independent to <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> or if reality is a bulk of internal illusions to <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> It is both, but not in the sense critical realism pretends (where <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are seen as a reality that can be separated from an objective outer reality). For Zubiri, <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> are imbedded in reality and cannot exist without it. They need air, food, water and other beings. The [...] "outer" [...] and objective world must also come inside <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> for them to continue existing. Sentient intelligence should be able to make sense of this existence in a way that allows <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> to realise their capabilities in the world.|$|R
50|$|Different theorists {{emphasized}} {{different aspects}} of the theory. Where Mihailo Marković writes of alienation and the dynamic nature of <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> Petrović writes of philosophy as radical critique of all existing things, emphasizing the essentially creative and practical nature of <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Milan Kangrga emphasizes creativity as well, but also the understanding of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> as producers humanizing nature.|$|R
50|$|Paola Cavalieri {{writes that}} the current humanist {{paradigm}} is that only <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> {{are members of the}} moral community, and that all are worthy of equal protection. Species membership, she writes, is ipso facto moral membership. The paradigm has an inclusive side (all <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> deserve equal protection) and an exclusive one (only <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> have that status).|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{inspired}} by the DC Graphic Novel Lex Luthor: The Unauthorized Biography. Glen Morgan stated that he wanted the episode to show that The Smoking Man was the most dangerous <b>human</b> <b>being</b> alive. The episode was originally intended to end with The Smoking Man killing Melvin Frohike, but the show's executive staff vetoed the idea.|$|E
5|$|The {{first day}} we were to work {{together}} I was nervous as a school girl. We were shooting a Junkanoo Festival with noisy drums and hundreds of extras. But he never faltered in his concentration and he put me completely at ease. It was all so natural. He's an extraordinary actor– and just a nice <b>human</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} the player character, an unnamed <b>human,</b> <b>being</b> killed and resurrected as a fledgling vampire.

30|$|Nature has {{protected}} <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> {{since their}} {{appearance on the}} earth, giving us the basic conditions for life. In ancient China, philosophers proposed {{the thought of the}} integration of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> and heaven and following nature. It stresses the harmony between nature and <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> as well as admiration of the laws of nature. Since industrialization, <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> have acquired a strong power to leverage nature and modernize the world. In turn, nature has also taken revenge on <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> for abusing this power. Humans have not been aware of the mistake we have made until a few years ago. Now, we start to show our kindness towards nature and would like to create harmony between two sides with the New Green Deal.|$|R

5|$|Anarchism, then, really {{stands for}} the liberation {{of the human mind}} from the {{dominion}} of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every <b>human</b> <b>being</b> free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.|$|E
5|$|Bill Nighy as Davy Jones: Captain of the Flying Dutchman. Davy Jones {{was once}} a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> who was unable to bear the pain of losing his true love. He carved out his heart {{and put it into}} the Dead Man's Chest, then buried it in a secret location. He has become a bizarre {{creature}} – part octopus, part lobster, part man. Jones collects the souls of dead or dying sailors to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of <b>human</b> <b>being,</b> such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E

50|$|Trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is {{punishable}} under Dutch Law. Trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> {{does not}} only occur inside the sex industry, {{but can also}} be found in other economic sectors in which people are forced to work under such bad conditions and circumstances that human rights are infringed upon. Trafficking in <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> also includes the removal of organs and forced surrogacy.|$|R
5|$|Danner's bodily tissues have a {{somewhat}} greater density {{than those of}} an ordinary <b>human</b> <b>being.</b> Though he has an athletic build, his strength is far greater than what his frame would naturally allow. People guess him to be 155 pounds, but he actually weighs 211. During his stint as a sailor, he goes pearl diving with the natives of Cristobal {{and is able to}} dive deeper and stay under longer because of his density.|$|E
5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed. During those events, Asellus was {{supposed}} to visit Dr. Nusakan's clinic, Bio Research Lab, Lambda Base, and Furdo's Workshop {{so that she would}} find her true identity so that she would decide to live as a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> or as a mystic. These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with a <b>human</b> <b>being</b> and not a program. But in fact, ELIZA {{had no idea what}} she was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E

50|$|A <b>human</b> <b>being’s</b> new {{experience}} {{is created by}} the a priori method, irrespective of its scale. For example, according to Orudzhev, the three well-known stages of a <b>human</b> <b>being’s</b> temporal existence can be characterised as the dominance of a <b>human</b> <b>being’s</b> homogenous (mass) abilities in the first (primitive) stage; group abilities in the second (historical) stage; and individual, creative abilities in the third (post-historical) stage. All these changes took place gradually, of course, {{over the course of}} tens of thousands of years, as a result of the changing modes of thought that controlled the actions of <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b>|$|R
5|$|New Age {{literature}} often {{refers to}} benevolent non-human spirit-beings {{who are interested}} in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, guardian angels, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts. New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors. The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced <b>human</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plutonium is more {{dangerous}} when inhaled than when ingested. The risk {{of lung cancer}} increases once the total radiation dose equivalent of inhaled plutonium exceeds 400 mSv. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no <b>human</b> <b>being</b> {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} AI {{research}} was founded at a workshop {{held on the}} campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956.

5000|$|Heidegger {{then turns}} to a {{consideration}} of the river as the dwelling place of <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> As such, the river is what brings <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> into their own and maintains them there. Yet what is their own often remains foreign to <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> for a long time, and can be abandoned by them because it threatens to overwhelm them. It is not something that produces itself, but must come to be appropriate, and needs to be appropriated. The river is of assistance in the becoming-homely of <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> but this [...] "assistance" [...] is not an occasional support but a steadfast standing by.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{studies that}} use microanatomical methods, {{there is no}} {{reported}} evidence that <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> have active sensory neurons like those in working vomeronasal systems of other animals. Furthermore, {{there is no evidence}} to date that suggests there are nerve and axon connections between any existing sensory receptor cells that may be in the adult human VNO and the brain. Likewise, there is no evidence for any accessory olfactory bulb in adult <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> and the key genes involved in VNO function in other mammals have become pseudogenes in <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Therefore, while the presence of a structure in adult <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> is debated, a review of the scientific literature by Tristram Wyatt concluded, [...] "most in the field … are sceptical about the likelihood of a functional VNO in adult <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> on current evidence." ...|$|R
