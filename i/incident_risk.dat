40|$|Previous {{systematic}} {{reviews and}} meta-analyses have evaluated {{the association of}} dairy consumption {{and the risk of}} cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the findings were inconsistent. No quantitative analysis has specifically assessed the effect of yogurt intake on the <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of CVD. We searched the PubMed and the Embase databases from inception to 10 January 2017. A generic inverse-variance method was used to pool the fully-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) with a random-effects model. A generalized least squares trend estimation model was used to calculate the specific slopes in the dose-response analysis. The present systematic review and meta-analysis identified nine prospective cohort articles involving a total of 291, 236 participants. Compared with the lowest category, highest category of yogurt consumption was not significantly related with the <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of CVD, and the RR (95 % CI) was 1. 01 (0. 95, 1. 08) with an evidence of significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 52 %). However, intake of ≥ 200 g/day yogurt was significantly associated with a lower risk of CVD in the subgroup analysis. There was a trend that a higher level of yogurt consumption was associated with a lower <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of CVD in the dose-response analysis. A daily dose of ≥ 200 g yogurt intake might be associated with a lower <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of CVD.

A review of the different models available {{for the study of}} <b>risks,</b> <b>incidents,</b> and injuries reveals that they lack some of the points that could be considered most relevant for a good investigation. Therefore a new model for the investigation of <b>risks,</b> <b>incidents,</b> and injuries needed to be elaborated, and this paper will propose and delineate such. If one’s objective is to continue improving results in matters of safety within a company, it is necessary to study the role played by incidents in these results. So, not only is the study of incidents necessary to improve safety, but {{it is important that the}} three factors of <b>incidents,</b> <b>risks,</b> and injuries must be considered simultaneously within the workplace. Another basic factor in the effort to improve safety results is to determine the causes of <b>risks,</b> <b>incidents</b> and injuries.

30|$|Many {{lines of}} {{evidence}} show the pro-atherogenic property of TMAO.

Circulating choline, betaine and carnitine levels also have been shown associated with prevalence of cardiovascular disease and can predict <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> for major adverse cardiac events. However, their prognostic values are dependent on the serum TMAO levels (Koeth et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014). ApoE-null mice fed a chow diet supplemented with TMAO appear to have an enhanced aortic lesion. Furthermore, choline can also increase aortic lesion and promote atherosclerosis but indispensable to gut microbiota, indicating the causal of TMAO in atherosclerosis (Wang et al., 2011). In vitro animal models have also confirmed the prothrombotic effect of TMAO by enhancing platelet aggregation (Zhu et al., 2016). Consistently, oral choline supplementation increases fasting TMAO levels and also enhances platelet aggregation (Zhu et al., 2017).|$|E

40|$|Aims/Introduction: This {{cohort study}} of middle-aged Japanese {{participants}} investigated {{the relationship between}} family history of diabetes, the <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of type 2 diabetes and the interaction of these variables with other factors. Materials and Methods: Study participants were 3, 517 employees (2, 037 men and 1, 480 women) of a metal products factory in Japan. Baseline health examinations included questions about medical history, physical examination, anthropometric measurements, questions about lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption and habitual exercise, and a self-administered diet history questionnaire. Family history of diabetes was defined as having at least one-first-degree relative with diabetes. The incidence of diabetes was determined in annual medical examinations over a 7 -year period. Hazard ratios (HRs) for type 2 diabetes were estimated by Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results: Of the 3, 517 participants, 630 (18 %) had {{a family history of}} diabetes mellitus. During the study, 228 participants developed diabetes. The age and sex-adjusted HR for type 2 diabetes in participants with a family history of diabetes was 1. 82 (95 % confidence interval 1. 36 - 2. 43) as compared with those without a family history of diabetes. HRs did not change after adjustment for body mass index and lifestyle factors. We found no interactions with body mass index, insulin resistance, pancreatic β-cell function or lifestyle factors. Conclusions: Family history of diabetes was associated with the <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of diabetes, and these associations were independent of other risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and lifestyle factors in Japanese men and women. © 2013 Asian Association for the Study of Diabetes and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{release of}} {{chemicals}} from their containment, either accidentally or initiated by an intentional act, {{is one of}} the most relevant risk scenarios in Europe. The ability to perform a human health risk assessment is a prerequislte for effective chemical incident prevention, preparedness and response. At present, no European consented guidance is available for risk assessment, risk management and risk communication purposes for these scenarios. Such an assessment requires the prediction of possible health effects at increasing levels. of health impact. A review of legislation, existing or currently under revision, suggests that a basis for such guidance is not to be expected in the short term. Through a web-based survey the availability of European consented and harmonized Acute Exposure Reference Values (AERVs) was considered to be an important need. An increasing number of European countries are developing their own procedures to assess human health risk of chemical incident scenarios. The AERVs thus produced serve different purposes and are not interchangeable, even though they are often used in practice as if they are, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the chemical <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> assessment. Lack of international harmonization seriously hampers a harmonized response in chemical emergencies with trans-boundary effects within and beyond the EU, will hamper multinational companies to make consistent risk assessments worldwide and will hinder consistent and transparent assessment, management and communication of risks by the different stakeholders. Emerging chemical <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> scenarios and risk drivers have been identified. It is recommended to monitor more frequently for new trends in chemicals, scenarios and risks from chemical incidents at an early stage. A specific need for an approach to deal with single exposure to mixtures of chemicals was identified, as well as for specific guidance to adequately protect professional first responders...|$|E

Risk management assigns probabilities and accident as well as measure costs to errors and causes of error, and suggests preventative measures on a cost-risk basis. Risk changes are predicted with the aim of improving safety, saving resources and cutting costs. Benefits are described and the selected results of 10, 000 accident analyses are presented...|$|E

40|$|Background and aim The body {{adiposity}} index (BAI) {{has been}} recently proposed {{as a new}} method to estimate the percentage of body fat. The association between BAI and hypertension risk has not been investigated yet. The aim of our study was to evaluate the ability of BAI to predict hypertension in males and females compared with traditional body adiposity measures. Methods and results The present follow-up analysis comprised 10, 309 individuals (2259 females) free of hypertension from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, who completed a baseline examination between 1988 and 2003. Body adiposity measures included BAI, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, percentage of body fat and waist to hip ratio (WHR). Incident hypertension was ascertained from responses to mail-back surveys between 1990 and 2004. During an average of 9. 1 years of follow-up, 872 subjects (107 females) became hypertensive. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) showed that males in the highest categories of all body adiposity measures showed a higher <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of hypertension (HRs ranged from 1. 37 to 2. 09). Females showed a higher <b>incident</b> <b>risk</b> of hypertension only in the highest categories of BAI, BMI and WHR (HRs ranged from 1. 84 to 3. 36). Conclusion Our results suggest {{that in order to}} predict incident hypertension BAI could be considered as an alternative to traditional body adiposity measures.
