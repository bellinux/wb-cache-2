5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from flowing water. It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in <b>estivation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals have}} a {{specific}} temperature range where they are active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards hibernate during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of <b>estivation,</b> a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E

25|$|The banded newt (Triturus vittatus vittatus) lives {{mainly in}} the {{northern}} areas of Israel, especially in the Galilee area, mostly in vernal pools. The coastal shores near Ashkelon are the southern border for its global population. Small populations in more southern areas disappeared due to water contamination. They are inactive during the summer, staying underground in <b>estivation,</b> and even in winter they are only active at night. The newts have slightly different breeding seasons depending on location, ranging from January–February in the coastal plains to February–March in the Galilee. The banded newt is critically endangered in Israel (only 5% of the 1950s population remains) and is thus a protected species.|$|E

50|$|<b>Estivation</b> {{is similar}} to hibernation, however, it usually occurs in hot periods to allow animals to avoid high {{temperatures}} and desiccation. Both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate and vertebrates enter into <b>estivation.</b> Examples include lady beetles (Coccinellidae), North American desert tortoises, crocodiles, salamanders, cane toads, and the water-holding frog.|$|E

50|$|At extreme temperatures, Cranwell's frogs enter {{a period}} of <b>estivation,</b> {{developing}} {{a thick layer of}} protective skin to trap moisture and aid in respiration. When <b>estivation</b> is complete, the frog uses its front and hind legs to help shed the protective layer. In many cases, the frog uses its jaws to help pull the skin over its back, often eating the skin in the process.|$|E

50|$|Adults {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their lives underground, in burrows created by other animals, such as ground squirrels and gophers; these salamanders are poorly equipped for burrowing. Little is known about their underground life. This underground phase has often been referred to as <b>estivation</b> (the summertime equivalent of hibernation), but true <b>estivation</b> has never been observed, and fiber optic cameras in burrows have allowed researchers to witness salamanders actively foraging. Adults are known to eat earthworms, snails, insects, fish, and even small mammals but adult California tiger salamanders eat very little.|$|E

50|$|Aestivation, also spelled <b>estivation,</b> is {{an example}} of {{consequential}} dormancy in response to very hot or dry conditions. It is common in invertebrates such as the garden snail and worm but also occurs in other animals such as the lungfish.|$|E
50|$|Aestivation or <b>estivation</b> {{refers to}} the {{positional}} arrangement of the parts of a flower within a flower bud before it has opened. Aestivation is also {{sometimes referred to as}} praefoliation or prefoliation, but these terms may also mean vernation: the arrangement of leaves within a vegetative bud.|$|E
50|$|Many xerocoles, {{especially}} rodents, estivate in the summer, {{becoming more}} dormant. Some desert amphibians estivate underground {{for over a}} year at a time. Unlike hibernation, which leads to a state of torpor, <b>estivation</b> induces lethargy, and can go unnoticed in some animals if their body temperature is not measured.|$|E
50|$|This species {{tends to}} prefer {{temperatures}} between 24 and 30 °C. When it is hotter than that, {{it tends to}} find shelter in a burrow and go {{into a state of}} <b>estivation,</b> or when it is colder it goes into a state of hibernation in order to conserve energy.|$|E
50|$|The small, {{yellowish}} green {{flowers are}} produced in autumn, in axillary and terminal panicles of umbels. The oval flower petals have an inbricate <b>estivation.</b> The superior ovary is 1 or 2-locular, and much compressed laterally. The purplish drupes appear in winter. They {{are of a}} flattened, elliptic shape, with lateral veins.|$|E
50|$|Aestivation or æstivation (from aestas, summer, {{but also}} spelled <b>estivation</b> in American English) {{is a state}} of animal dormancy, similar to hibernation, {{characterized}} by inactivity and a lowered metabolic rate, that is entered in response to high temperatures and arid conditions. It takes place during times of heat and dryness, the hot dry season, which are often the summer months.|$|E
5000|$|Brady{{metabolism}} {{refers to}} organisms {{with a high}} active metabolism and a considerably slower resting metabolism. Bradymetabolic animals can often undergo dramatic changes in metabolic speed, according to food availability and temperature. Many bradymetabolic creatures in deserts and in areas that experience extreme winters are capable of [...] "shutting down" [...] their metabolisms to approach near-death states, until favorable conditions return(see hibernation and <b>estivation).</b>|$|E
50|$|Townsend's ground {{squirrels}} consume mainly green {{vegetation and}} some seeds and insects. Green grasses are apparently a staple from late winter until {{just prior to}} grass senescence and Townsend ground squirrel <b>estivation,</b> when seeds become the primary diet item. Seeds are {{an important source of}} calories just prior to <b>estivation.</b> Wherepresent, winterfat is browsed heavily, but only light browsing of other shrubs has been reported. From March through May on the Arid Land Ecology Reserve in eastern Washington, the Townsend's ground squirrel diet is 49% Sandberg bluegrass, 11% western yarrow (Achillea millefolium var. occidentalis), 8% pinnate tansymustard(Descurania pinnata) seed, 31% other plant species (mostly forbs), and 1% insects. On a big sagebrush-crestedwheatgrass community in southeastern Idaho, 80% of Townsend's ground squirrels trapped in June had consumed crested wheatgrass, and Townsend's ground squirrels became dormant after the crested wheatgrass senesced. Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an important food item in some years. As an annual with wide year-to-year swings in productivity, however, it is not a reliable food source.|$|E

50|$|One {{radiotracking}} {{study focused}} on dispersal of Washington ground squirrels. It found that 72% percent of juvenile males dispersed in April. Dispersal distances ranged from 40-3521 meters and the median dispersal distance was 880 meters. Twenty to 56% of radio-collared juvenile squirrels survived to <b>estivation.</b> Raptors and badgers were the primary causes of mortality. Survival rates of dispersers were higher than non-dispersers, mostly due to badger predation on natal sites.|$|E
50|$|The Mojave ground {{squirrel}} measures about nine inches from nose to tail and feeds on leaves and seeds from February to July. Near {{the end of}} July, the squirrels begin a period of <b>estivation,</b> but this may occur as early as April in drought years. Litters do not survive if drought years force an early hibernation. Local populations can be wiped out if a drought lasts for multiple years.|$|E
50|$|Protopterus amphibius {{generally}} only {{reaches a}} length of 44 cm, making it the smallest extant lungfish. This lungfish is uniform blue, or slate grey in colour. It has small or inconspicuous black spots and a pale grey belly. Like all African lungfish it has two lungs and is an obligate air-breather. Also like all other African lungfish {{it is able to}} burrow and form a mucous cocoon for protection in a process known as <b>estivation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There, it {{is known}} to inhabit still waters, ponds, ditches, sloughs, and swamps. Fluctuating water with {{abundant}} aquatic vegetation is the optimal habitat. It is omnivorous and preys primarily on invertebrates. [...] The western chicken turtle will bask and frequently travels overland {{for a variety of}} activities including nesting, migration, <b>estivation,</b> and hibernation. [...] The eastern chicken turtle exhibits a bimodal nesting pattern, nesting both in August - September and February - March.|$|E
50|$|It lives {{among the}} stones of {{the walls of the}} {{terraces}} and in the crevices of limestone rocks oriented to the north and northwest. Depending on the degree of exposure to the sun, its phenotype changes a lot, becoming more coriaceous the more sunlight it receives. In the driest months of summer comes into <b>estivation,</b> dehydrating their fronds, reaching apparently dead. With the first rains of autumn, the fern rehydrate the dried fronds and turn green quickly.|$|E
50|$|These turtles {{are very}} well adapted, both morphologically and behaviorally, to drought conditions. The turtle uses mainly {{burrowing}} and moving from water hole to water hole to avoid desiccation. The femoral flaps that cover the retracted legs help the turtle survive dry conditions. During a time of drought, the turtles enter a time of <b>estivation</b> {{in an attempt to}} survive the dry conditions. Although many turtles die during drought conditions, some turtles have been reported to survive up to 160 days.|$|E

Giovanni Boccaccio and Niccolò Tommaseo both appreciated its freshness, among the vineyards and olive groves that are the preferred setting for even the most formal Italian gardens.|$|E
50|$|The Washington ground {{squirrel}} lives in sagebrush or grassland habitats in the Columbia River Basin of Washington and Oregon. Washington {{ground squirrel}}s hibernate / estivate 7-8 months each year. Adults breed shortly after emergence from hibernation in January or February and juveniles {{emerge from the}} natal burrow in March. Juveniles disperse away from the natal burrow and settle into new areas. All Washington ground squirrels gain weight and prepare for hibernation in late spring and early summer. Juveniles immerge for <b>estivation</b> in June or July, and adults begin estivating earlier, often in June.|$|E
50|$|This small fern lives {{among the}} stones of {{the walls of the}} {{terraces}} and in the crevices of limestone rocks oriented North and Northwest. It likes light but not direct sun. In the dry summer months enters in <b>estivation</b> (summer sleep), dehydrating the fronds until apparently dead. With the first rains of autumn, the fronds will rehydrate in less than 24 hours and turn green as if nothing had happened. A few days starting to sprout new fronds. Stops in the middle of winter to spring, restarting sprouting in the spring.|$|E
50|$|Helix engaddensis is {{a species}} of snail common in the Levant, both in Mediterranean, desert and montane climates. It is smaller than the closely related European Garden snail and usually lighter in color. H. engaddensis goes through <b>estivation.</b> It is dormant in the ground {{during the dry season}} and emerges after the first rains (in late autumn). Mating takes place soon after emerging. The snails are active through winter (except in high montane regions, where they might be forced into a {{somewhat}} unnatural hibernation) and return to an inactive state {{at the end of the}} wet season (midspring).|$|E

50|$|Their base {{color is}} black and marked with varying amounts of yellow spots or bands, with the {{exception}} of H. alvarezi, which tends to be all black in color. The beaded lizard has a short tail which is used to store fat so it can survive during months of <b>estivation.</b> Unlike many other lizards, this tail does not autotomize and cannot grow back if broken. The beaded lizard has a forked, black tongue which it uses to smell, {{with the help of a}} Jacobson's organ; it sticks its tongue out to gather scents and touches it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.|$|E
5000|$|It lives {{among the}} stones of {{the walls of the}} {{terraces}} and in crevices of limestone rocks. It loves the light and supports a few hours of sunshine in the early hours and tangential final hours of the day. It hates the rain directly on its fronds, preferring the moisture comes to its roots through the soil soaked by seepage of rainwater. For this usually grow well inside the crevices of the rocks and between {{the stones of}} the walls of the terraces, where no rain falls over. Although well-supported long periods of drought, the driest months and hot summer enters in <b>estivation</b> ( [...] summer sleep [...] ), dehydrated their fronds, to appear dead. With the first rains of autumn will rehydrate the dried fronds and it will green quickly.|$|E
