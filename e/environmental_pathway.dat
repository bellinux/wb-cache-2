40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} disease type and latency on willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce environmental risks of chronic, degenerative disease. Using contingent-valuation data collected from approximately 1, 200 respondents in Taiwan, we find that WTP declines with latency between exposure to environmental contaminants and manifestation of any resulting disease, at a 1. 5 percent annual rate for a 20 year latency period. WTP {{to reduce the risk}} of cancer is estimated to be about one-third larger than WTP to reduce risk of a similar chronic, degenerative disease. The value of risk reduction also depends on the affected organ, <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway,</b> or payment mechanism: estimated WTP {{to reduce the risk of}} lung disease due to industrial air pollution is twice as large as WTP to reduce the risk of liver disease due to contaminated drinking water. ...|$|E
40|$|Parenting is {{traditionally}} conceptualized as an exogenous environment that affects child development. However, children can also influence {{the quality of}} parenting that they receive. Using longitudinal data from 650 identical and fraternal twin pairs, we found that, controlling for cognitive ability at age 2 years, cognitive stimulation by parents (coded from video recorded behaviors during a dyadic task) at 2 years predicted subsequent reading ability at age 4 years. Moreover, controlling for cognitive stimulation at 2 years, children’s cognitive ability at 2 years predicted the quality of stimulation received from their parents at 4 years. Genetic and environmental factors differentially contributed to these effects. Parenting influenced subsequent cognitive development through a family-level <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway,</b> whereas children’s cognitive ability influenced subsequent parenting through a genetic pathway. These results suggest that genetic influences on cognitive development occur through a transactional process, in which genetic predispositions lead children to evoke cognitively stimulating experiences from their environments...|$|E
30|$|Of course, {{environmental}} factors, {{other than}} smoking, {{can contribute to}} cancer. Thus, individuals often associate programs designed to promote cleaner environments with reduced disease risks. The costs that individuals {{are willing to pay}} today {{to reduce the risk of}} disease in the future can be determined using contingent valuation methods. For example, in Taiwan, individuals were asked how much they were willing to pay in increased utility costs to promote cleaner water (and thus a lesser chance of liver disease) and in increased cost of consumer goods to promote cleaner air (and thus a lesser chance of lung disease). In both instances, the disease either occurred in a few months or 20 years later. If the negative consequences are delayed, willingness to pay to avoid disease will decrease most likely due to present-biased time preferences. It is also noteworthy that willingness to pay (WTP) is dependent on disease type (cancer vs. non-cancer), the combination of the organ type (liver vs. lung), <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway</b> (water vs. air), and payment method (utility bill vs. consumer goods) (Hammitt and Liu 2004).|$|E

40|$|Most {{existing}} computer {{codes for}} <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway</b> modeling {{have been developed}} to satisfy a specific objective (e. g., perform analyses to demonstrate regulatory compliance). These codes were written in various computer languages and software environments over time and often are not mutually compatible. In recent years, largely driven by advancements in industrial software development, a new concept based on ''modularization'' has emerged. This approach entails the development of common ''modules,'' or components, that can be shared by and used in different applications that have certain common needs. For instance, an air dispersion model can be written as a common component to be shared by several different applications, each with the need to model air dispersion of some material release. When this concept is fully developed, modeling applications would become an exercise of selecting, integrating, and applying a consistent combination of appropriate pre-existing modules for a specific problem. Although modularization holds promising advantages over the traditional approach, a number of issues do exist. These issues must be fully addressed and resolved before the approach can be accepted as a new paradigm for environmental modeling.

40|$|Volatilization and {{subsequent}} processing {{in the atmosphere}} are an important <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway</b> for the transport and chemical fate of pesticides. However, these processes remain a particularly poorly understood component of pesticide lifecycles due to analytical challenges in measuring pesticides in the atmosphere. Most pesticide measurements require long (hours to days) sampling times coupled with offline analysis, inhibiting observation of meteorologically driven events or investigation of rapid oxidation chemistry. Here, we present chemical ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry with iodide reagent ions as a fast and sensitive measurement of four current-use pesticides. These semi-volatile pesticides were calibrated with injections of solutions onto a filter {{and subsequent}}ly volatilized to generate gas-phase analytes. Trifluralin and atrazine are detected as iodide–molecule adducts, while permethrin and metolachlor are detected as adducts between iodide and fragments of the parent analyte molecule. Limits of detection (1  s) are 0. 37, 0. 67, 0. 56, and 1. 1  µg m − 3 for gas-phase trifluralin, metolachlor, atrazine, and permethrin, respectively. The sensitivities of trifluralin and metolachlor depend on relative humidity, changing as much as 70 and 59, respectively, as relative humidity of the sample air varies from 0 to 80  %.

40|$|Understanding how {{environmental}} forcing {{governs the}} productivity of marine and anadromous fish populations is a central, yet elusive, problem in fisheries science. In this thesis, I use a cross-system comparative approach to investigate how <b>environmental</b> forcing <b>pathways</b> could link climatic and ocean processes to dynamics of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. I begin by showing that phytoplankton phenology and ocean current patterns are both strongly associated with inter-annual changes in salmon productivity, suggesting that two alternative <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways</b> may contribute to changes in salmon productivity: one mediated by vertical ocean transport and subsequent phytoplankton dynamics and the other mediated by horizontal ocean transport and subsequent advection of plankton into coastal areas. The relative importance of these pathways, however, may vary over large spatial scales because the magnitude {{and direction of the}} estimated environmental effects on productivity were conditional on the latitude of juvenile salmon ocean entry. I then use a probabilistic network modeling approach to show that changes in climatic and ocean processes can impact salmon productivity via multiple concurrent <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways,</b> including multiple pathways originating from the same climatic process. Finally, I use policy analysis to demonstrate why efforts to integrate highly migratory species, such as Pacific salmon, into ecosystem-based management policies need to explicitly account for mismatches between the scale of ecosystem services provided by these species and the scale at which human activities and natural processes impact those services. Collectively, my thesis provides empirical evidence that accounting for spatial heterogeneity and the relative importance of simultaneously operating <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways</b> may be critical to developing effective management and conservation strategies that are robust to future environmental change...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The goal of {{the project}} was to develop a {{functional}} prototype of an environmental risk assessment parameter database on the World-Wide Web. The ability to develop a consolidated environmental database has become possible due to the phenomenal growth of the Internet and the World-Wide Web over the past few years. A large number of environmental resources do currently exist; however, with the large volume of information available, access, management, reliability, and retrievability have become increasingly difficult. To illustrate the prototype database, a practical environmental concern and the tools necessary to evaluate and characterize that concern were needed. Uranium (²³⁸U) daughters leaching from abandoned mill tailing piles at three abandoned uranium mines in southwestern Colorado were chosen to demonstrate the database concept. The RESRAD <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway</b> modeling code served as the evaluation and characterization tool. Due to the size and complexity of RESRAD, a single radionuclide release rate equation was isolated as a controllable component of the code. The equation was {{a small part of the}} water pathway factor and examined the rate at which radionuclides absorbed in soil were leached by infiltrating water. This serves as the source term for groundwater contamination and directly applies to the ²³⁸U progeny leaching from mill tailing piles scenario. Parameters selected from the equation dealt with the background data that directly influenced the mobility of contaminates in the environment.

These fluvial P fluxes were compared with P imports and exports, in fertilizer, food, feedstuffs, and industrial products, along with coastal direct discharge of wastes, at the British national boundary from 1990 to 2012. The results showed that: (i) Average annual river TP concentrations in Great Britain have declined {{from a peak of}} 0. 27 – 0. 1 mg P/l and annual river TP flux has declined from 120 to 16 ktonnes P/year (0. 49 – 0. 06 tonnes P/km 2 /year); (ii) Average river TRP concentration has declined from a peak of 0. 19 – 0. 05 mg P/l and annual river TRP flux has declined from 71 to 10 ktonnes P/year (0. 29 – 0. 05 tonnes P/km 2); (iii) Over the period 2003 – 2012, even after the introduction of the Urban Waste Water Directive, 60 % of UK’s TP flux was still from urban areas; and (iv) In 1990, the fluvial flux of TP from the UK was equivalent to 41 % of imports; by 2012 this had decreased to 15 %.

The primary goal of this FEVA was to establish an environmental vulnerability baseline at ORNL {{that could be used to}} support the Laboratory planning process and place environmental vulnerabilities in perspective. The information developed during the FEVA was intended to provide the basis for management to initiate immediate, near-term, and long-term actions to respond to the identified vulnerabilities. It was expected that further evaluation of the vulnerabilities identified during the FEVA could be carried out to support a more quantitative characterization of the sources, evaluation of contaminant pathways, and definition of risks. The FEVA was modeled after the Battelle-supported response to the problems identified at the High Flux Beam Reactor at Brookhaven National Laboratory. This FEVA report satisfies Corrective Action 3 A 1 contained in the Corrective Action Plan in Response to Independent Review of the High Flux Isotope Reactor Tritium Leak at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, submitted to the Department of Energy (DOE) ORNL Site Office Manager on April 16, 2001.

40|$|Introduction: Neuroticism is an {{important}} marker of vulnerability for both mental and physical disorders. Its link with multiple etiological pathways has been studied before. Inflammatory markers have been demonstrated to predict similar mental and physical disorders as neuroticism. However, currently no study {{has focused on the}} shared genetic background of neuroticism and inflammatory markers. In the present study we will focus on the phenotypic and genetic relationship between neuroticism and three commonly used inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen and Immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Material and Methods: The study was conducted in 125 Dutch female twin pairs. For each participant, four different neuroticism scores were available to calculate a neuroticism composite score that was used in the statistical analyses. Blood samples for inflammatory marker determination were taken after an overnight fast. Heritabilities, phenotypic and genetic correlations were estimated using bivariate structural equation modeling. Results: Heritabilities are fair for neuroticism (0. 55), CRP (0. 52) and fibrinogen (0. 67) and moderate for IgG (0. 43). No significant phenotypic or genetic correlations were found between neuroticism and the inflammatory markers. Interaction models yielded no moderation of the genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways</b> in the regulation of inflammatory markers by neuroticism. Conclusion: Substantial heritabilities were observed for all variables. No evidence was found for significant shared (or moderation of) genetic or <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways</b> underlying neuroticism and inflammatory status...|$|R

This tool was analyzed in nominal tritium discharge operational reference and selected incidental conditions affecting the Western Mediterranean Basin during 45 days during summer 2010 together with surface “wind observations” or weather data based in real hourly observations of wind direction and velocity providing a real approximation of the tritium behavior {{after the release}} to the atmosphere from a fusion reactor. From comparison with NORMTRI - a code using climatologically sequences as input - over the same area, the real time results have demonstrated an apparent overestimation of the corresponding climatologically sequence of Tritium {{concentrations in}} air outputs, at several distances from the reactor. For this purpose two development patterns were established. The first one was following a cyclonic circulation over the Mediterranean Sea and the second one {{was based on the}} plume delivered over the Interior of the Iberian Peninsula and Continental Europe by another stabilized circulation corresponding to a High Pressure System. One of the important remaining activities defined then, was the qualification tool. In order to validate the model of ECMWF/FLEXPART we have developed of a new complete data base of tritium concentrations for the months from November 2010 to March 2011 and defined a new set of four patterns of HT transport in air, in each case using real boundary conditions: stationary to the North, stationary to the South, fast and very fast displacement.

40|$|Brodifacoum is {{a highly}} {{effective}} anticoagulant rodenticide that presents a secondary hazard to some non-target wildlife. The high acute toxicity of brodifacoum to mammals and birds, and its prolonged persistence in liver predicates secondary risk to predators and scavengers of poisoned rodents. Hence {{there is a need}} to improve ability to monitor and predict hazards of brodifacoum to non-targets, and optimise use patterns accordingly. Use of a less persistent anticoagulant rodenticide, diphacinone, is an alternative approach currently under investigation in New Zealand. This thesis describes a series of laboratory and pen studies that address information gaps relevant to the assessment of non-target hazards in continued use of brodifacoum, and of using diphacinone as an alternative. Non-lethal techniques for determining sublethal brodifacoum exposure in birds was investigated in chickens. Elevation of prothrombin time was a less reliable index than residual concentrations in tissues. Samples requiring less invasive procedures, such as dried blood spots or faeces, have potential to detect recent sublethal brodifacoum exposure and refinement of these indices could be useful in proactive monitoring of avian wildlife. Residual brodifacoum in eggs of sublethally-exposed hens raised further questions regarding wider non-target hazard and adverse effects on development of fertile eggs or chicks. A laboratory trial with rats found a positive correlation between residual brodifacoum concentrations in liver and the amount of brodifacoum ingested as bait. An estimated 14 - 22 % of ingested brodifacoum was excreted in rat faeces in the period between ingestion of a lethal dose and death, indicating another potentially significant <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway</b> for brodifacoum transfer. In considering diphacinone as a less persistent alternative rodenticide to brodifacoum, evaluation of residual concentrations and persistence in pig tissues was required to estimate secondary hazard to human consumers and adequate with-holding periods for hunting feral pigs in areas where diphacinone was applied. A pen trial showed that domestic pigs were more susceptible to diphacinone toxicity, and thus primary poisoning risk, than previously estimated. Hepatic half-life of diphacinone in pigs was approximately 14 days, indicating reduced persistence in comparison to brodifacoum and enabling estimates of with-holding periods for hunting feral pigs from areas where diphacinone baits were applied. To investigate potential hazards of diphacinone use to invertebrates a trial using tree weta, a native New Zealand invertebrate, was undertaken. Weta readily ate diphacinone wax block baits with no mortality or weight loss evident, indicating low susceptibility. Residual whole-body diphacinone concentrations did not increase with the amount of diphacinone bait eaten. A simple, deterministic risk assessment suggested that, as a single secondary exposure, the maximum diphacinone concentration measured in weta would present a low risk to non-target birds. Given international recognition of the high secondary hazard and corresponding restrictions on use of brodifacoum, continued availability of brodifacoum to non-licensed users and sustained field applications for possum and rodent control in New Zealand is an exceptional use pattern. New data in this thesis suggest that baiting strategies that minimise the amount of brodifacoum available in the environment are important and regulatory review of some New Zealand brodifacoum applications should address this. In parallel, development of diphacinone as an alternative to brodifacoum should continue, as new data here confirms lower persistence in mammalian liver than brodifacoum, and also indicates low toxicity to invertebrates. However further investigation of multiple-exposure hazard and potential sublethal effects of diphacinone on non-target mammals and birds is warranted before extensive and sustained field applications of diphacinone are undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Policy, environmental, {{social and}} {{economic}} factors are all driving South Africa's transition to sustainable development and a greener economy. Various policies {{have been developed to}} foster sustainable development in the post-apartheid era in South Africa (i. e. since 1994) and there are various projections on potential job creation for a green economy. However, there is a problem related to both the achievement of sustainable development and green economy objectives: South Africa is said to lack adequately qualified people to implement these goals resulting in what is termed 'scarce skills' in the environmental and sustainable development sector. This problem has, in turn, prompted various skills development studies in the environmental sector, including a national Environmental Sector Skills Plan produced in 2010. All these studies point to a reactive skills development system that provides inadequate learning pathways for existing and newly emerging green occupations, which provided the impetus for a more proactive, transformative praxis oriented system of skills development that supports environmental learning pathways in South Africa. A second problem is that the concept of 'learning pathway' is poorly defined in the South African environmental education and wider education and training policy context. This term is often used in policy discourse within the notion of 'seamless learning pathways' and is only vaguely defined. This study set out to investigate selected occupationally directed environmental learning pathways in the South African National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and green transitioning context. In attempting to characterise the nature of the <b>environmental</b> <b>pathway,</b> the study utilised critical realist metatheory which serves as an underlabourer for domain specific theory of transitioning societies and systems, life-course transitions and career development. This theoretical work allowed the characterisation of environmental learning pathways as educational and occupational progression. The study investigated the nature of learning and work transitions across the life- course of selected environmental professionals in two key occupational categories - environmental engineer and environmental scientist - both of which have been defined as scarce skills in South Africa. This enabled a nuanced examination of the formation of what emerged as 'boundaryless' career stories of professionals engaged in these two occupations. The study also sought to engage with a methodological problem in learning pathways research, notably that studies are generally framed either at the micro level career story, emphasising agency of individuals (voluntarism), or at the policy level, emphasising structural aspects of the skills development system (determinism). This study sought to bridge the macro-micro problem drawing on critical realist retroductive analysis; this facilitated the shift from a focus on events and experiences that can be empirically observed (captured in case study approaches) to the causal mechanisms influencing environmental learning pathways in these two scarce skill occupations (discussed and analysed using dialectical critical realism), shedding light on how systemic and structural dynamics and mechanisms shape and influence the emergence of learning pathways as experienced in scarce skill occupations in the environmental sector. The opening chapters of the thesis provide an historical view of how the South African education and training system, itself in a transitioning process, has had to grapple with how to respond to and meaningfully take up the new emerging environmental / sustainable development mandate, which is increasingly framed within a multi-levelled transitioning social-ecological system perspective in post-apartheid South Africa. These transitioning systems are shaped by substantive policy imperatives for societal transformation, social justice, sustainable development and equity. Since 1994, various transformations have been taking place, often in paradoxical forms, in both the environmental and educational sectors, shaping a complex multi-levelled transitioning systems perspective for the study. This background work on transitioning systems provides the foundation for the first data chapter, which provides a descriptive outline of key supply side systemic elements as these pertain to environmental learning pathways more broadly (qualifications; occupational framing; career systems; sector skills planning). It also points to the lack of adequate mechanisms for analysing demand for environmental occupations, and highlights some of the contradictions in the supply- demand relation as these pertain to newly emerging environmental occupations. This helps to explain the empirical findings of previous environmental sector studies on the slow and reactive defining of environmental education and training for environmental occupations within the transforming education and training system in South Africa. The next two chapters, using case-based qualitative data, present the analysis of the two scarce skill occupations investigated - environmental engineer and environmental scientist. These chapters outline the dominant institutional educational pathway and the key supply platforms that support these pathways (career guidance; qualifications, occupational framings, skills planning) and the learning and work transitions of professionals within the occupation. The chapters highlight the factors and causal mechanisms influencing these learning pathways and thus provide insight into the multi-level dynamics that underpin learning pathways. The final chapter uses dialectical critical realism to outline generative mechanisms influencing the construction of the learning pathways. It also highlights key absences that are shaping the emergence (or not) of environmental learning pathways, thus pointing to opportunities for how the NQF might respond to the two scarce skill occupations under study, and to the emergence of environmental learning pathways more broadly within the framework of society-in-transition. Through this, the study links the career stories as analysed within the framework of learning pathways and skills system transitioning literature, to generative mechanisms and system development elements. The study concludes with providing occupational and systemic insights into absences and disjunctures that characterise the emergence (or not) of occupationally oriented environmental learning pathways. It also provides insight into what leads to these absences, and how they are kept in place and suggests possibilities and openings for transformative praxis within a multi-levelled transitioning system framework. The study makes the following contributions: At a theoretical level, the study has shown that environmental learning pathways need to be viewed as a complex phenomenon that is emergent in open systems and constituted by dialectically interdependent planes. A deeper understanding of environmental learning pathways is driven by both educational and occupational progression. It utilises key contemporary ideas around learning and work transitions but links them to the broader analyses of transitioning societies influencing the environmental sector, indicating the significance of how environmental education and training system development is situated within the wider transitioning process oriented towards social-ecological sustainability, social justice and greener economies. This study has further identified green skills as an important focus in research work on transitioning societies. At a methodological level, the study has shown how macro-micro and laminated system research can be useful in studying transitioning systems. As a laminated systems study with a focus on transitioning societies, it provides a baseline for further systems study on green work and green skills. At a practical level, the study has made actual contributions to the conceptualisation of learning pathways in the South African NQF context, to building and informing future green skill developments in the South African post-school system, the environmental sector and to informing conceptualising in the emergent Green Skills project...|$|E

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} evident {{that for a}} number of high-profile pathogens, transmission involves both direct and <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways.</b> Much of the distinguished evolutionary theory has, however, focused on each of transmission component separately. Herein, we use the framework of adaptive dynamics to study the evolutionary consequences of mixed transmission. We find that environmental transmission can select for increased virulence when direct transmission is low. Increasing the efficiency of direct transmission gives rise to an evolutionary bi-stability, with coexistence of different levels of virulence. We conclude that the overlooked contribution of environmental transmission may explain the curious appearance of high virulence in pathogens that are typically only moderately pathogenic, as observed for avian influenza viruses and cholera...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{antimicrobial}} agents has been {{claimed to be}} the driving force for the emergence and spread of microbial resistance. However, several studies have reported the presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in populations exposed to low levels of antimicrobial drugs or even never exposed. For many pathogens, especially those organisms for which asymptomatic colonization typically precedes infection (e. g., Enterococcus spp. and Escherichia coli), the selective effects of antimicrobial use can only be understood if we considerer all biological and <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways</b> which enable these bacteria, and the genes they carry, to spread between different biomes. This ecological framework provides an essential perspective for formulating antimicrobial use policies, precisely because it encompasses the root causes of these problems rather than merely their consequences...|$|R

40|$|Gene-environment {{interaction}} (G x E) {{is likely}} to be a common and important source of variation for complex behavioral traits. Gene-environment interaction, or genetic control of sensitivity to the environment, can be incorporated into variance components twin and sib-pair analyses by partitioning genetic effects into a mean part, which is independent of the environment, and a part that is a linear function of the environment. An approach described in a companion paper (Purcell, 2002) is applied to sib-pair variance components linkage analysis in two ways: allowing for quantitative trait locus by environment interaction and utilizing information on any residual interactions detected prior to analysis. As well as elucidating <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways,</b> consideration of G x E in quantitative and molecular studies will potentially direct and enhance gene-mapping efforts. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|During {{recent years}} {{the use of the}} {{platinum}} group metals (PGMs) has increased dramatically, mainly as a catalyst for the removal of pollutants in automobile exhaust. The increasing use of platinum and more recently palladium and rhodium has raised questions concerning their release into the environment and the related ecological and human health risks. The potential problems caused by the presence of PGMs in the environment can only be assessed through a clear understanding of their <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways,</b> transformations and speciation 1. In early years, research was dedicated to the difficult task of the determination of total concentrations, but increasingly research groups are trying to provide this clear understanding and this can only be achieved through developments in speciation analysis. This article gives an insight into platinum group metal research with a particular focus on speciation...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{explaining how}} parental depression compromises healthy child development {{are complex and}} multifaceted, with genetic and <b>environmental</b> <b>pathways</b> intertwined. Reexamination of whether and how maternal and paternal depression serve as environmental risk factors is important because such an investigation can be helpful to identify modifiable mechanisms that are accessible to interventions. We review studies that have employed designs that isolate {{the effects of the}} environment from genetic influences, including adoption studies and children of twins studies. Findings indicate that maternal depression is an environmental risk factor for the emotional, behavioral, and neurobiological development of children. Although more studies are needed, preliminary findings suggest that paternal depression appears to be a weaker environmental risk as compared to maternal depression, at least during infancy and toddlerhood. Implications for theory and future research are discussed. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
