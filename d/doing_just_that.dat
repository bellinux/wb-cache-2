5|$|Miami {{got off to}} a {{good start}} <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who would go on to be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins before the end of the season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E

25|$|On June 13, while {{flying in}} a flight led by his {{squadron}} commander, Major Francis Gabreski, Johnson shot down his first German aircraft (of 10 Staffel, JG 26). The 56th had scored its first confirmed kill just the day before, but had missed {{an opportunity to}} achieve a larger victory. As a result, Johnson and his element leader agreed that the pilot spotting the enemy should immediately attack and be supported by the other, regardless of who was leading. Johnson achieved his kill, over an Fw 190, <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that,</b> but discovered that his element leader had not covered him as agreed. Johnson was reprimanded by Zemke, Gabreski, and Jerry Johnson for breaking formation when the other pilot denied his concurrence. Even so, the kill was confirmed, {{one of the very}} first among the novice 8th Fighter Command pilots. Johnson received a bottle of Scotch whisky from Major General Carl Spaatz, commanding the 8th Air Force, to mark the occasion.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} August 1913, Captain Bucey {{was taking}} the BC Express up from Fort George to Tête Jaune Cache when he was stopped a cable strung across the river at Mile 141 where the railway was {{building}} a bridge. Although the railway had promised {{that they would not}} impede steamer travel on the river, it was apparent that they were <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> Bucey turned the BC Express back towards Fort George and immediately wired the company's head office at Ashcroft and informed them of the obstruction. The BC Express Company had the Board of Railway Commissioners investigate the situation and the Board came back in the company's favor and told the railway they must build the bridge at Mile 141 and the other at Bear River with lift spans as they had promised. The GTP refused the order, stating that if they changed the level of the bridges they'd have to change the level of the grade. The company took the railway to court for damages and loss of revenue, as they had been earning in excess of $5000 a week on that route, {{but by the time the}} case was heard, World War I had begun and the company's attorney was engaged in war work and was unable to appear. His replacement, a junior partner with little experience, was unable to prepare and present the evidence properly and the company lost the case.|$|E

(The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because parkour {{philosophy}} is about learning to control oneself in {{interaction with the}} environment, leading parkour experts tend to view physical injury as a deviation from true parkour. Daniel Ilabaca, co-founder of the World Parkour and Freerunning Federation, said [...] "Thinking you're going to fail at something gives you {{a higher risk of}} <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> Committing to something you're thinking or knowing you will land gives you a higher chance of landing or completing the task." [...] There is growing evidence that parkour techniques can reduce injury rates when landing, compared to traditional sport techniques.|$|E

2500|$|Operational {{definitions}} are {{at their}} most controversial {{in the fields of}} psychology and psychiatry, where intuitive concepts, such as intelligence need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as IQ tests. Such definitions are used as a follow up to a theoretical definition, in which the specific concept is defined as a measurable occurrence. John Stuart Mill pointed out the dangers of believing that anything that could be given a name must refer to a thing and Stephen Jay Gould and others have criticized psychologists for <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> [...] A committed operationalist would respond that speculation about the thing in itself, or noumenon, should be resisted as meaningless, and would comment only on phenomena using operationally defined terms and tables of operationally defined measurements [...]|$|E

2500|$|There were {{efforts to}} get {{softball}} on the Olympic program during the 1950s. [...] In 1950, the Amateur Softball Association of America sent letters to national organisations asking for assistance in getting the newly created International Olympic Federation to include softball on the Olympic program. Australia received such a letter and responded by asking for additional information. Irene Burrows, the Australian association secretary, was extremely keen to support this and took active steps {{to try to work}} on this goal. The Australian Softball Council made an effort in 1952 to get the sport included on the programme and thought they had a decent opportunity at <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> because the sport {{had a great deal of}} popularity, being played in over 15 countries. This effort was mirrored by the Americans with the support of other countries such as New Zealand.

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that {{reliance}} on operational definition demands that intuitive concepts, such as depression, need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation. However, John Stuart Mill pointed out the dangers of believing that {{anything that could be}} given a name must refer to a thing and Stephen Jay Gould and others have criticized psychologists for <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> One critic states that [...] "Instead of replacing 'metaphysical' terms such as 'desire' and 'purpose', they used it to legitimize them by giving them operational definitions. Thus in psychology, as in economics, the initial, quite radical operationalist ideas eventually came to serve {{as little more than a}} 'reassurance fetish' (Koch 1992, 275) for mainstream methodological practice." [...] According to Tadafumi Kato, since the era of Kraepelin, psychiatrists have been trying to differentiate mental disorders by using clinical interviews. Kato argues there has been little progress over the last century and that only modest improvements are possible in this way; he suggests that only neurobiological studies using modern technology could form the basis for a new classification.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1982, Daugherty was invited by {{composer}} György Ligeti to study composition {{with him at the}} Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hamburg. [...] In addition to attending Ligeti’s composition seminar (which took place at his apartment in Hamburg), Daugherty traveled with Ligeti to attend concerts and festivals of his music throughout Europe. [...] At the time, Ligeti was interested in the music of Conlon Nancarrow, who lived in isolation in Mexico City and composed complex polyrhythmic music for player pianos. [...] The player piano (by now an antique) was a familiar and nostalgic musical instrument to Daugherty. [...] Daugherty met Nancarrow in Graz, Austria, when Ligeti introduced Nancarrow and his music to the European intelligentsia at the 1982 ISCM (International Society for Contemporary Music) World Music Days. [...] During the following two years (1983–84), Daugherty continued to study with Ligeti while employed as a solo jazz pianist in night clubs in Cambridge, England and Amsterdam. [...] To create [...] "original" [...] music, Ligeti encouraged and inspired Daugherty {{to find new ways to}} integrate computer music, jazz, rock, and American popular music with concert music. [...] In {{the fall of}} 1984, Daugherty returned to America and devoted his career to <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{two major}} {{contemporary}} political parties {{to advocate for}} Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism are The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) or [...] "National Heritage Party", the latter of which is composed solely of Buddhist monks. According to A. R. M. Imtiyaz, these groups share common goals: [...] "to uphold Buddhism and establish {{a link between the}} state and religion, and to advocate a violent solution to the Tamil question and oppose all form of devolution to the minorities, particularly the Tamils". The JHU, in shunning non-violent solutions to the ethnic conflict, urged young Sinhalese Buddhists to sign up for the army, with as many as 30,000 Sinhalese young men <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> One JHU leader even declared that NGOs and certain government servants were traitors and they should be set on fire and burnt due to their opposition to a military solution to the civil war. The international community encouraged a federal structure for Sri Lanka as a peaceful solution to the civil war but any form of Tamil self-determination, even the more limited measure of autonomy, was strongly opposed by hard-line Sinhalese Buddhist nationalist groups such as the JVP and JHU, who pushed for the military solution. These groups in their hard-line support for a military solution to the conflict, without any regard for the plight of innocent Tamil civilians, have opposed negotiated settlement, ceasefire agreement, demanded that the Norwegians be removed as peace facilitators, demanded the war to be prosecuted more forcefully and exerted influence in the Rajapaksa government (which they helped to elect), resulting in the brutal military defeat of the LTTE with heavy civilian casualties. The nationalist monks' support of the government's military offense against the LTTE gave [...] "religious legitimacy to the state's claim of protecting the island for the Sinhalese Buddhist majority." [...] President Rajapaksa, in his war against the LTTE, has been compared to the Buddhist king Dutthagamani by the Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists.|$|E

Good motives had brought them there. They were the same men, or men of the same class, that I had seen before. They were <b>doing</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> which I knew they would have to do. But still I found that the more I saw of them, the more I lost of that respect for them which I had once felt. I think it was their dirt that chiefly operated upon me.

The great boast of this army was that they eat meat twice a day, and that their daily supply of bread was more than they could consume.|$|E
