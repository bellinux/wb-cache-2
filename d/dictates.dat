30|$|Equivalence-based {{instruction}} (EBI) {{can produce}} integration between verbal operants and derive one repertoire from another through {{the transfer of}} stimulus control (de Rose, de Souza, & Hanna, 1996; Mackay & Sidman, 1984; Sidman, 1986). Experimental studies have reported that populations with normal hearing first learn oral tacts (BD), and the accurate oral-textual operant (CD) is provided from equivalence relations that are formed (de Rose et al., 1996; Sidman, 1971). In an inverse route, children with CIs present improvements in oral-tact (BD) accuracy after EBI that includes oral-textual operants (CD) (Almeida-Verdu & Golfeto, 2016). In the study by Anastácio-Pessan et al. (2015), the participants were children with CIs who presented good oral-reading (CD) performance but inaccurate picture tacting (BD). Conditional relations between <b>dictated</b> words and pictures (AB) and between <b>dictated</b> words and printed words (AC word) were strengthened using an MTS procedure, including relations between <b>dictated</b> syllables and printed syllables (AC syllabic). The results showed that after strengthening equivalence relations (between <b>dictated</b> words, pictures, and printed words), accurate speech also started to occur under the presence of pictures. Analogously, Lucchesi et al. (2015) taught children with CIs who were not readers to relate pictures to <b>dictated</b> words (AB), printed words to <b>dictated</b> words (AC word), and printed syllables to <b>dictated</b> syllables (AC syllabic) using an MTS procedure. The training also included constructing printed words conditionally to <b>dictated</b> words using a constructed-response matching-to-sample (CRMTS) procedure. The participants learned to read and improved picture tacting.|$|R

Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that <b>dictates</b> some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief that murder is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered state terrorism. Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' <b>dictates.</b>|$|E
