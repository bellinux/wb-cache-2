40|$|Human <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> {{focus on}} documenting our lifetime. This outlet {{allows us to}} capture and bring {{together}} information that is related to almost any aspect of our lives. Creating these memories allows us to recall experiences, seamlessly; and to re-live specific events, using detailed information about those experiences. The evolution of smart devices enables any object {{to provide us with}} information. With all of this data at our disposal, new opportunities are arising to incorporate this data into our <b>digital</b> <b>memories.</b> Consequently, the challenge is to develop a platform, capable of linking captured information together, to form feature rich <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> of human experiences. This paper presents DigMem, a platform for creating human <b>digital</b> <b>memories,</b> using pervasive devices and linked data.

25|$|Many 2010-era digital delays {{present an}} {{extensive}} array of options, including a {{control over the}} time before playback of the delayed signal.

Some systems in the 2010s allow more exotic controls, such as the ability to add an audio filter, or to play back the buffer's contents in reverse. As <b>digital</b> <b>memory</b> became cheaper in the 1980s, units like Lexicon PCM42, Roland SDE-3000, TC Electronic 2290 offered above 3 seconds delay time, enough to create background loops, rhythms and phrases. The 2290 was upgradeable to 32 seconds and Electro-Harmonix offered a 16-second delay and looping machine.|$|E

The weaknesses of such methods, in particular passwords, are well documented.

40|$|The area {{of human}} <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> has placed {{considerable}} focus on documenting {{the things we}} do, the places we visit and the thoughts we think. Rather than sharing important events face–to–face, i. e. by watching home videos together or looking through photo albums, people tend to share their memories with each other through emails or text messages, or by posting them online. The difficulty is that the vast amounts of data we collect are often difficult to access and less meaningful to us over time. The challenge is to structure human <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> {{in a way that}} can be easily distributed and recollected at different time periods in our lives. More specifically, the collection and organisation of memory-related information (images, video, physiological data and so on) needs to occur using ubiquitous ad hoc services, prevalent within the environments we occupy. This is likely to happen without us necessarily being aware that memories are being created. This will remove the need to manage the growing number of information sources that require conventional tools to achieve this, for example, a camera to take stills and video. This paper posits a new and novel idea that builds on the nomadic nature of people, ubiquitous computing, context awareness, physiological computing, semantic annotation and ad hoc networking that will allow rich interactive <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> to be created amongst individuals and their environments that are unobtrusive to individuals...|$|R

40|$|The area {{of human}} <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> focuses on documenting our entire lifetime. Using this outlet, a {{diverse range of}} {{information}} can be brought together, such as photos, location, temperature and physiological information. Nowadays, we {{have access to a}} number of different data sources, thus allowing more dynamic and data rich memories to be created. In particular, the inclusion of physiological data offers a new insight into the augmentation of memories and provides a richer level of detail. This information can be used to determine how we were feeling, at any time, and, potentially, how we made others feel as well. Memories, created over a lifetime, can be retrieved, and we can see how our bodies have changed over time.

40|$|The {{explosion}} of mobile computing and {{the sharing of}} content ubiquitously has enabled users to create and share memories instantly. Access to different data sources, such as location, movement, and physiology, has helped to create a data rich society where new and enhanced memories will form part of everyday life. Peer–to–Peer (P 2 P) systems have also increased in popularity over the years, due to their ad hoc and decentralized nature. Mobile devices are “smarter” and are increasingly becoming part of P 2 P systems; opening {{up a whole new}} dimension for capturing, sharing and interacting with enhanced human <b>digital</b> <b>memories.</b> This will require original and novel platforms that automatically compose data sources from ubiquitous ad-hoc services that are prevalent within the environments we occupy. This is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, it will allow <b>digital</b> <b>memories</b> to be created that include richer information, such as how you felt when the memory was created and how you made others feel. Secondly, it provides a set of core services that can more easily manage and incorporate new sources as and when you are available. In this way memories created in the same location, and time are not necessarily similar – it depends on the data sources that are accessible. This paper presents DigMem, the initial prototype that is being developed to utilize distributed mobile services. DigMem captures and shares human <b>digital</b> <b>memories,</b> in a ubiquitous P 2 P environment.
