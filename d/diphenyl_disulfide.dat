40|$|Dialkyl and diaryl dichalcogenides {{are highly}} {{versatile}} and modular precursors for {{the synthesis of}} colloidal chalcogenide nanocrystals. We have used a series of commercially available dichalcogenide precursors to unveil the molecular basis for the outcome of nanocrystal preparations, more specifically, how precursor molecular structure and reactivity affect the final shape and size of II-VI semiconductor nanocrystals. Dichalcogenide precursors used were diallyl, dibenzyl, di-tert-butyl, diisopropyl, diethyl, dimethyl, and <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfides</b> and diethyl, dimethyl, and diphenyl diselenides. We find {{that the presence of}} two distinctively reactive C-E and E-E bonds makes the chemistry of these precursors much richer and interesting than that of other conventional precursors such as the more common phosphine chalcogenides. Computational studies (DFT) reveal that the dissociation energy of carbon-chalcogen (C-E) bonds in dichalcogenide precursors (R-E-E-R, E = S or Se) increases in the order (R) : diallyl 3 ̆c dibenzyl 3 ̆c di-tert-butyl 3 ̆c diisopropyl 3 ̆c diethyl 3 ̆c dimethyl 3 ̆c diphenyl. The dissociation energy of chalcogen-chalcogen (E-E) bonds remains relatively constant across the series. The only exceptions are diphenyl dichalcogenides, which have a much lower E-E bond dissociation energy. An increase in C-E bond dissociation energy results in a decrease in R-E-E-R precursor reactivity, leading to progressively slower nucleation and higher selectivity for anisotropic growth, all the way from dots to pods to tetrapods. Under identical experimental conditions, we obtain CdS and CdSe nanocrystals with spherical, elongated, or tetrapodal morphology by simply varying the identity and reactivity of the dichalcogenide precursor. Interestingly, we find that precursors with strong C-E and weak E-E bond dissociation energies such as Ph-S-S-Ph serve as a ready source of thiol radicals that appear to stabilize small CdE nuclei, facilitating anisotropic growth. These CdS and CdSe nanocrystals have been characterized using structural and spectroscopic methods. An intimate understanding of how molecular structure affects the chemical reactivity of molecular precursors enables highly predictable and reproducible synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals with specific sizes, shapes, and optoelectronic properties for customized applications...|$|R

Unlike NPO, which is an established inhibitor of bacterial biofilms, our active compounds did not reduce planktonic cell growth and only affected biofilm formation. When used in a Drosophila-based infection model, both S-phenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide and <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> significantly reduced the P. aeruginosa recovered 18 h post infection (relative to the control), and were non-lethal to the fly hosts.

40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} of poly(methyl methacrylate), (PMMA), {{has been studied}} {{in the presence of}} five tin additives (phenyltin trichloride, diphenyltin dichloride, triphenyltin chloride, tin(IV) chloride, tetraphenyltin), five transition metal chlorides (nickel(II) chloride, copper(I) chloride, copper(II) chloride, iron(II) chloride, iron(III) chloride), and <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide.</b> A complete mechanistic interpretation of these reactions is provided. The degradation of three phenyltin chlorides (PhSnCl 3, Ph 2 SnCl 2, and Ph 3 SnCl) proceeds by the initial loss of a phenyl radical with the formation of a tin-based radical, these initially formed radicals interact with the polymer. For tin tetrachloride, the initial step is coordination of the SnCl 4 to the carbonyl oxygens of the polymer followed by the loss of methyl chloride from the coordinated complex. The Limiting Oxygen Index of this blend is very high indicating some potential flame retardant activity for compounds of this type. For the blend of PMMA with tetraphenyltin, the degradation proceeds in a mutually-assisted manner with radicals from one material promoting degradation of the other. The {{thermal degradation}} of PMMA in the presence of iron(II) chloride, iron(III) chloride, copper(I) chloride, copper(II) chloride, and nickel(II) chloride has been studied by the combined technique of thermogravimetric analysis coupled to a Fourier transform IR spectrometer. In those cases where coordination occurs between the transition metal ion and the carbonyl oxygens of the polymer, there is an effect on the degradation of the polymer; in those cases where coordination does not occur, the degradation is unaffected by the presence of the additive. The presence of methyl chloride as one of the gases evolved is diagnostic for a coordination; when this gas is absent, the degradation of the PMMA proceeds unaffected by the presence of the transition metal ion. <b>Diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> has shown some stabilizing effect on the thermal degradation of PMMA at higher temperatures. Acting as a chain transfer agent, <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> will interact with the macroradicals produced by the polymer and terminate further degradation by producing a high yield of phenylthio-containing oligomer and non-volatile residue.

40|$|Viedma deracemization is the attrition-induced {{asymmetric}} amplification of a conglomerate crystal {{mixture of}} achiral or racemizing compounds. There are 13 reported crystalline systems that undergo Viedma deracemization {{that can be}} classified as having: (i) achirality in solution, (ii) a racemizing state in solution or (iii) a reversible racemizing reaction in solution. This phenomenon {{is based on an}} autocatalytic attrition-enhanced Ostwald ripening process with a requirement for an achiral, or rapidly racemizing state in solution. The concepts of ‘chiral amnesia’, where a molecule’s chiral memory is lost in solution, and ‘the common ancestor effect’, where the chirality of daughter crystals {{is the same as the}} mother crystal, can be used to rationalize the generation of a homochiral solid-state. The involvement of chiral clusters in the overall deracemization mechanism is critical. This research explores the generality of Viedma deracemization for an additional 5 achiral organic molecules: benzil, <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> benzophenone, butylated hydroxytoluene and tetraphenylethylene. Stochastic chiral crystallization was observed for benzil, however chiral crystallization for butylated hydroxytoluene, <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide,</b> tetraphenylethylene and benzophenone was non-stochastic, likely resulting from a cryptochiral environment.

Our results showed that, in all cases, functionalization took {{place with the}} cleavage of the chalcogenchalcogen bond {{on the surface of}} the metal. According to our density functional theory calculations, the molecules assumed a tilted orientation with respect to the metal surface for both Au and Ag, in which the angle of the phenyl ring relative to the metallic surface decreased as the mass of the chalcogen atom increased. The detected differences in the ordinary Raman and SERS spectra were assigned to the distinct stretching frequencies of the carbonchalcogen bond and its relative contribution to the ring vibrational modes. In addition, the SERS spectra showed that there was no significant interaction between the phenyl ring and the surface, in agreement with the tilted orientation observed from our density functional theory calculations.

40|$|A new {{free radical}} chain process of alkyl radical {{additions}} to olefins has been discovered. The alkyl radical addition is {{initiated by the}} reaction of alkylmercury halides with silyl hydrides such as triethylsilane or phenylsilane. The process occurs at room temperature and gives satisfactory results only with dimethyl sulfoxide as solvent. This procedure produces regioselectively the reductive alkylation products in good yield {{for a wide variety}} of substituted olefins. The mechanism of this new process has been established through kinetic studies and product analysis. Experimental results have suggested that the reaction is a free radical chain process with the alkylmercury hydride as an intermediate. The alkylmercury hydride is formed slowly by the reaction of alkylmercury halide with a silyl hydride compound in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reaction of the silyl halide, which is formed from the atom exchange, with dimethyl sulfoxide is the driving force for the alkylmercury hydride formation. The alkylmercury hydride acts as the chain carrier as well as initiator for the reaction by providing alkyl radicals from decomposition;By using this new reaction procedure, the relative reactivities of a wide variety of substituted olefins have been measured by competition studies. The relative reactivity study suggests that the free radical alkylation of olefins is nucleophilic in character with an early transition state in a kinetically controlled process;A mechanistic study has also been carried out for the demercuration of 3, 3 -diacetylpropylmercuric chloride. 3, 3 -Diacetylpropylmercuric chloride showed unusual reactivity towards base to form 1, 1 -diacetylcyclopropane.

40|$|In this work, {{colloidal}} particles {{of gold and}} silver are used as enhancing substrates to study behavior of organic sulfides and a perylene derivative butylimido, butyleneamine perylene (nBu-PTCDA-(CH 2) 4 -NH 2) adsorbed on metal particles using surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) or SERS. In addition, the SERS spectra of the adsorbed species formed by <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> and diphenyl sulfide (DPDS, DPS) on evaporated silver and gold island thin films were obtained. The SERS vibrational spectra of both DPDS and DPS are discussed and the vibrational assignments of the fundamental modes were aided with an ab-initio calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT) at B 3 LYP at 6 - 31 G (d) level of theory. The vibrational assignment, breakage or cleavage of the S-S and C-S bonds on metallic nanoparticles is discussed. In particular, {{the review of the}} observation and assignment of the Ag-S stretching vibration in the range of 150 [...] 250 cm- 1 is provided. Three laser lines (514 nm, 633 nm and 780 nm) were used in this work to study the degree of photo dissociation induced by different energies of the incident beam. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

40|$|As a {{means to}} {{decrease}} {{the amount of waste}} tires and to re-use tire rubber for new tires, devulcanization of ground passenger car tires is a promising process. Being an established process for NR and EPDM, earlier work has shown that for ground passenger car tire rubber with a relatively high amount of SBR, a devulcanization process can be formulated, as well. This was proven for a laboratory-scale batch process in an internal mixer, using <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> as the devulcanization aid and powder-sized material. In this paper, the devulcanization process for passenger car tire rubber is upscaled from 15 g per batch and transformed into a continuous process in a co-rotating twin screw extruder with a capacity of 2 kg/h. As SBR is rather sensitive to devulcanization process conditions, such as thermal and mechanical energy input, the screw design was based on a low shear concept. A granulate with particle sizes from 1 – 3. 5 mm was chosen for purity, as well as economic reasons. The devulcanization process conditions were fine-tuned in terms of: devulcanization conditions (time/temperature profile, concentration of devulcanization aid), extruder parameters (screw configuration, screw speed, fill factor) and ancillary equipment (pre-treatment, extrudate handling). The influence of these parameters on the devulcanization efficiency {{and the quality of the}} final product will be discussed. The ratio of random to crosslink scission as determined by a Horikx plot was taken for the evaluation of the process and material. A best practice for continuous devulcanization will be given...|$|E
40|$|The synthesis, structure, and thiol peroxidase-like {{antioxidant}} {{activities of}} several diaryl diselenides having intramolecularly coordinating amino groups are described. The diselenides derived from enantiomerically pure R-(+) - and S-(-) -N,N-dimethyl(1 -ferrocernylethyl) amine show excellent peroxidase activity. To investigate the mechanistic role of various organoselenium intermediates, a detailed in situ {{characterization of the}} intermediates {{has been carried out}} by Se- 77 MMR spectroscopy. While most of the diselenides exert their peroxidase activity via selenol, selenenic acid, and selenenyl sulfide intermediates, the differences in the relative activities of the diselenides are due to the varying degree of intramolecular Se... N interaction. The diselenides having strong Se... N interactions are found to be inactive due to the ability of their selenenyl sulfide derivatives to enhance the reverse GPx cycle (RSeSR + H 2 O 2 = RSeOH). In these cases, the nucleophilic attack of thiol takes place preferentially at selenium rather than sulfur and this reduces the formation of selenol by terminating the forward reaction. On the other hand, the diselenides having weak Se... N interactions are found to be more active due to the fast reaction of the selenenyl sulfide derivatives with thiol to produce <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> and the expected selenol (RSeSR + PhSH = PhSSPh + RSeH). The unsubstituted diaryl diselenides are found to be less active due to the slow reactions of these diselenides with thiol and hydrogen peroxide and also due to the instability of the intermediates. The catalytic cycles of 18 and 19 strongly resemble the mechanism by which the natural enzyme, glutathione peroxidase, catalyzes the reduction of hydroperoxides...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} the thermochemical properties, bond dissociation energies and atomization energies of sulfur organic derivatives, the complete basis set (CBS) method was employed {{at the lower}} computational level (CBS- 4) owing to the large molecular size {{of a number of}} the molecules chosen. By comparison with experimental values, calculated values of thermochemical properties are subject to error, which increases in line with the increase in molecular complexity. The main source of error affecting the calculated enthalpy of formation stems from the difference between the energy of the molecule and that of the single atoms: the greater the size of the molecule, the greater the accumulation of error. By acting on the empirical correction to the CBS energy and minimizing the error due to the contribution of the single atoms to the dissociation energy a parameter di for each atom i is obtained. Application of these corrections does not greatly affect the heats of formation of the small molecules included in test sets employed for previous comparisons of calculated and experimental values, while there is a great improvement in the case of large molecules, for example, <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide.</b> The mean absolute deviation turns out to be 2. 52, which is greater than that obtained in recent reexaminations of model chemistry methods Including the G 3 and G 3 (MP 3) approaches. The improvement in the results calculated for large molecules, whose heats of formation are calculated with large errors at the CBS- 4 level, in comparison also with the CBS- 4 M version, justify our approach...|$|E
40|$|Pd(PPh 3) 4 catalytically assembles sulfenamide (PhS-NR 2), alkyne, carbon {{monoxide}} and diphenyl diselenide in a one-pot four component coupling reaction to yield (Z) -â-selenyl acrylamides. The reaction proceeds in good to excellent yield (60 - 95 %) and is tolerant {{of a wide}} range of functional groups on both the nitrogen of the sulfenamide and the alkyne. Moderate selectivities ranging from 4 : 1 to 7 : 1 â-selenyl to â-sulfenyl acrylamide have been observed despite the initial concentration of 2 : 1 selenium to sulfur in the reaction. The chalcogeno selectivity was found to depend directly on CO pressure; increased CO pressure decreased selectivity for selenium over sulfur. The azaselenolation of {{carbon monoxide}} by sulfenamide is catalyzed by RhCl(CO) (PPh 3) 2 to give Se-aryl selenocarbamates. The reaction proceeds in moderate to good yield (71 - 89 %) and exhibits a 9 : 1 selectivity for the formation of seleno- over thiocarbamate despite the initial 1. 4 : 1 concentration of selenium to sulfur in the reaction. Selectivity is postulated to arise from the more favorable oxidative addition of diphenyl diselenide to rhodium relative to <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide.</b> Also discussed is the effect of several transition metal complexes on the yield and selectivity of the azaselenolation reaction and our attempts to develop a transition metal catalyzed olefin azasulfenylation reaction. Imine-olefin ring-closing metathesis of á,ù imino-olefins with Schrock-type alkylidene complexes, Mo(=CHR) (=NAr) (OR') 2 is discussed. Ring-closing proceeded to yield the target substrate 2 H-chromene in 63 % yield. Mechanistically, it was determined that the reaction operates under kinetic control via initial alkylidene-olefin metathesis followed by ring-closing alkylidene-imine metathesis...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} a range of {{aromatic}} molecules is investigated electrochemically to determine what makes an effective reducing mediator. With the aim of developing a better understanding of electron transfers (ETs) mediated from lithium in functional group reduction, a series of single ET reactions are reported in this paper. Typical reaction conditions involved the use of aromatic mediators such as naphthalene, anthracene, 4, 4 ′-di-tert-butyl- 1, 1 ′- biphenyl (DBB) with lithium metal in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at - 78 °C. The results of these experiments showed that some mediators were more effective reducing reagents than others. Cryoelectrochemical procedures are used to mimic the conditions of the SET reactions in order to investigate the exact nature and role of the mediator formed upon ET. It is demonstrated that electro-generated and stabilized radical anions of anthracene at - 78 °C mediate the reduction of organic substrates, whereas the more reactive dianion is quickly protonated and therefore unable to act as an ET reagent; direct electrochemical reduction of the sulfide, phenyl 3 -phenylpropylsulfide (RSPh) gives the thiol, thiophenol, and propyl benzene whereas mediated reduction gives the dimer, <b>diphenyl</b> <b>disulfide</b> and propyl benzene. The possibility to selectively reduce a substrate with either a single electron or with two electrons is possible by using either the radical anion (mediated) or via the direct electroreduction. DBB and naphthalene (both single electron accepting species only) {{have been found to be}} the most effective reducing reagents in this study. Anthracene and other two-electron accepting species only showed effective reducing ability when a stoichiometric amount of lithium was used therefore preventing the 'over-reduction' to the dianion.
