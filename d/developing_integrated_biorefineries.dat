40|$|Lignocellulosic {{substrates}} are {{a promising}} alternative resource for the sustainable {{production of energy}} (biofuels), bio-based products and organic compounds. In the past, the extraction and recycling of cellulose (into fermentable glucose) constituted the central axis of lignocellulosic biorefinery processes. Degraded hemicelluloses and lignins were recovered as side-products with no possibilities of high-added value applications. Within {{the context of an}} <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery,</b> and for economic reasons, the recovery and the non-energetic valorization of lignins have opened recently new horizons. Lignin is a cross-linked phenolic polymer and is considered as potential alternative to petrochemical polymers or as a source of antioxidants for cosmetics and food industry, resins, chelating agent [...] . As the final application of lignin depends on both extraction process and type of lignocellulosic sources, the development of fast and efficient physicochemical characterization methods is thus a prerequisite to optimize extraction processing conditions. In this study, beech wood particles (Fagus sylvatica L.) are delignified at atmospheric pressure by a formic acid/acetic acid/water mixture. Firstly, response surface methodology is used to optimize cooking time and temperature for delignification, pulp yield and concentration of degradation products (2 -furfural and 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural). The results highlight that best delignification is obtained in the highest cooking times and temperatures and that 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural is produced during the formic/acetic acid treatment but is also degraded into 2 -furfural. With the aim to <b>develop</b> an <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery</b> approach, multi-criteria optimization is used to find ideal cooking time and temperature (5 h 07, 104. 2 °C) leading to the maximization of delignification and pulp yield and to the minimization of 2 -furfural production Finally, physicochemical and chemical structures of extracted lignins are found dependent on treatment conditions harshness...|$|R

40|$|Utilisation {{of biomass}} is {{identified}} {{as one of the}} promising solutions to reduce society’s dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate climate change caused by the exploitation of fossil fuels. By using the concept of biorefinery, biomass can be converted into value-added products such as biofuels, biochemical products and biomaterials in a greener and sustainable way. To enhance the efficiency of biorefinery, the concept of <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery</b> which focuses on the integration of various biomass conversion technologies is utilised. To date, various biomass conversion pathways are available to convert biomass into a wide range of products. Due to the substantial amount of potential products and conversion technologies, determining of chemical products and processing routes in an <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery</b> have become more challenging. Hence, {{there is a need for}} a methodology capable of evaluating the integrated process in order to identify the optimal products as well as the optimal conversion pathways that produce the identified products. This thesis presents a novel approach which integrates process with product design techniques for <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefineries.</b> In the proposed approach, integration between synthesis of <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery</b> and computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) techniques is presented. By using CAMD techniques, optimal chemical product in terms of target properties which fulfils the required product needs is designed. On the other hand, in order to identify the conversion pathways that produce the identified optimal chemical product in an <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery,</b> chemical reaction pathway map (CRPM) and superstructural mathematical optimisation approach have been utilised. Furthermore, this thesis also presents various chemical product design approaches. In order to solve chemical design problems where multiple product needs are required to be considered and optimised, a novel multi-objective optimisation approach for chemical product design has been presented. By using fuzzy optimisation approach, the developed multi-objective optimisation approach identifies optimal chemical product based on multiple product properties. In addition, fuzzy optimisation approach has been further extended to address chemical product design problems where the accuracy of property prediction model is taken into account. A robust chemical product design approach is developed to design optimal chemical products with consideration of accuracy of property prediction model. Furthermore, together with CAMD techniques and superstructural mathematical optimisation approach, the developed multi-objective optimisation approach has been utilised for the design of mixtures in an <b>integrated</b> <b>biorefinery.</b> For this purpose, a systematic optimisation approach has been developed to identify optimal mixture based on multiple desired product needs as well as the optimal conversion pathways that convert biomass into the optimal mixture.
