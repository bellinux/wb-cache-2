40|$|The {{evolution}} of modern neurosurgical techniques in {{traumatic brain injury}} has been ongoing {{for the last two}} centuries. However it has always been a challenge to obtain an effective clinical outcome, especially those following severe traumatic brain injuries. Other than the well established procedures for acute and/ or chronic subdural hematomas and depressed skull fractures, newer avenues for development of surgical techniques where indicted have been minimal. Practical scenario in trauma neurosurgery comes with multiple challenges and limitations. In an <b>emergency</b> <b>setup,</b> primary management of traumatic brain injuries fall upon the on-duty resident or medical officer in training. Due to the emergent nature of the condition and time being an important variable, the experience of the operating surgeon as well as the severity of the injury become an important contributing factor in the disease prognosis. Based on clinical experience and observation of acute neurosurgical service in tertiary medical center in a developing country, a novel technique in the management of trauma neurosurgery have been elucidated in the current study. The study proposes to apply the principles of microvascular surgery and skull base surgery in selected cases of severe traumatic brain injuries.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{contribution}} of the channel estimation and joint measuring technology on the third generation mobile communications (3 G), the channel estimation and joint detection model of the 3 G system has been installed to analyze the channel estimation approaches grounded on <b>emergency</b> <b>setups</b> and training sequence. Pulse shaping filtering has been conducted by operations such as QPSK baseband modulation and Spread Spectrum on the User Data Source; then to channel estimate and joint measure the data received from base station via the Additive White Gaussian Noise channel. In line with the simulation results, with the increase of signal to noise ratio，the impulse response graph of the signal via the Steiner Estimator channel levels with that via the noise-free channel. Zero Forcing Block Linear Equalizer (ZF-BLE) has a good effect on eliminating the multipath interference and the inter-symbol interference in the system, which prove the good effects on the 3 G system of using both the channel estimation technology of the Steiner Estimator and the joint measuring technology of the ZF-BLE, which is of good application prospects...|$|R
30|$|Carbamazepine (CBZ) is {{a widely}} used drug as an {{anticonvulsant}} to control seizure, and the intoxication is readily seen due to being freely available in the community (Graudins et al. 2002; Sweetman 2009). The first few cases of deaths due to CBZ were documented by Baselt (1982) and Denning et al. (1985) in the early 1980 s (Baselt 1982; Denning et al. 1985), and intoxication is not uncommon in <b>emergency</b> medical <b>setup.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Mobile phones {{can be used}} in {{countries}} with different emergency numbers. This means that a traveller visiting a foreign country does not have to know the local emergency numbers. The mobile phone and the SIM card have a preprogrammed list of emergency numbers. When the user tries to set up a call using an emergency number known by a GSM or 3G phone, the special <b>emergency</b> call <b>setup</b> takes place. The actual number is not even transmitted into the network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk. [...] Most GSM mobile phones can dial emergency numbers even when the phone keyboard is locked, the phone is without a SIM card, emergency number is entered instead of the PIN or there isn't a network signal (busy network).|$|R
40|$|Background : Medication is {{the most}} common health-care intervention, and the errors arising out of its usage are {{potentially}} an avoidable cause of iatrogenic injuries. There are reports of medication errors from neonatal <b>emergency</b> <b>setups.</b> Aims : To study the medication errors of ordering, dispensing and administering in neonates admitted for emergency care and to compare the errors occurring in the emergency department (ED) with those occurring in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a teaching hospital in north India. Primary objective: To study the medication errors in ordering and dispensing for neonates. Secondary objective: To compare these errors in 2 different settings - ED and NICU. Materials and Methods : We did a retrospective chart review of neonatal prescriptions written in the 4 months from January to April 2004 in the neonatal intensive care unit and the pediatric emergency department. The prescriptions were analyzed from the case records bearing an even registration number, obtained from the hospital &#x 2032;medical records&#x 2032; section. Medication error was defined as &#x 2032;any preventable event that occurs in the process of ordering, transcribing, dispensing, administering or monitoring a drug irrespective of whether the injury occurred or potential for injury was present. &#x 2032; Results : A total of 821 prescriptions were analyzed and 81 (9. 6 &#x 0025;) errors were detected. The error rate was found to be 1. 5 (54 / 38) and 0. 7 (27 / 38) per patient in ED and NICU, respectively, being highly significant in ED. Every tenth prescription had medication error in ordering or dispensing; of this, every sixth prescription in ED and nineteenth prescription in NICU had medication error. Dosing errors were the commonest form of detected errors. None of the errors caused any significant harm to the patient but had the potential to cause severe injury, and majority of these errors were preventable. Conclusion : Medication errors are common in neonatology; more so, in emergency departments than in the neonatal intensive care units...|$|R
50|$|MedSTAR's {{development}} commenced during 2007 and it {{has been}} operating since early 2009. Prior to MedSTAR's inception, emergency medical retrievals were carried out by one of three possible teams: one from the Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH), one from the Flinders Medical Centre (FMC) and one from the Women's and Children's Hospital (WCH - for paediatric or neonatal emergencies). In a case where a helicopter would be needed, one would be dispatched to either the RAH or FMC (the WCH team would travel to the RAH because WCH doesn't have a helipad) after the appropriate and most available team was selected. After picking up the retrieval team members it would then head to the <b>emergency.</b> This <b>setup</b> meant it could take up to half an hour before the team was en route to the patient. As a result, it was decided that one single service based near the helicopter would be more appropriate as it would cut down response times and resolve issues pertaining as to which team would be chosen to retrieve the patient/s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} part of a study that involves formulating an optimal development plan for the upgrading, expansion and replacement of the supervisory control and data acquisition, energy management systems (SCADA/EMS) systems and associated telecommunication networks for the efficient operation of the Kuwait Power System. This paper deals specifically with designs that are proposed {{for the expansion of}} an electrical control centers system. The objectives of this expansion are to increase operational security and provide a backup for the SCADA systems. <b>Emergency</b> and multi-site <b>setups</b> are proposed to support the operational security and SCADA systems backup, respectively. The criteria for reducing expenditure and enhancing reliability of a particular setup are the systems and subsystems compatibility and geographical locations...|$|R
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{evidence to suggest}} that racial and ethnic disparities exist in the provision of emergency and wider healthcare. The importance of collecting patient ethnic data has received attention in literature across the world and eliminating ethnic and racial health equalities is one of the primary aims of healthcare providers internationally. The poor health status of certain racial and ethnic groups has been well documented. The improvement of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare is at the forefront of many public health agendas. This article addresses important policy, practice, and cultural issues confronted by the pre-hospital <b>emergency</b> care <b>setup.</b> This aspect of care plays a unique role in the healthcare safety net in providing a service to a very diverse population, including members of ethnic and racial minorities. Competent decision making by the emergency care practitioners requires patient-specific information and the health provider’s prior medical knowledge and clinical training. The article reviews the current ethnicity trends in the UK along with international evidence linking ethnicity and health inequalities. The study argues that serious difficulties will arise between the health provider and the patient if they come from different backgrounds and therefore experience difficulties in cross-cultural com-munication. This adversely impacts on the quality of diagnostic and clinica...|$|R
