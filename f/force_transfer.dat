5000|$|In {{addition}} to similar physical abilities {{she shares with}} Hyperion, such as supersonic flight, super-strength, greatly enhanced reflexes, superhuman senses and nigh-invulnerability, her powers also include some life-force based healing abilities; Zarda's first appearance is as an extremely aged crone. After killing a man that sees her, she then appears as her current form of a youthful woman. Twice in the series, after noticing a gray hair or a scratch from a fight, she kills a human female, somehow absorbing her life energy, thus removing her [...] "imperfection". On {{the opposite end of}} the scale, she used a similar life <b>force</b> <b>transfer</b> to heal Hyperion when he received life-threatening injuries through a simultaneous ground zero detonation of 20 'daisy cutter' bombs, each with an explosive yield of 1 kiloton. While it is possible to hurt her, as shown when the superhuman strong Kingsley Rice cut her, she apparently even survived a direct nuclear explosion through a combination of her nigh-invulnerability and her life-force transference capabilities. While it is safe to say that she is able to drain almost any living being it still has to be revealed if she is able to use her life-force transference capabilities to heal a normal human or any other being besides herself and Hyperion. Like Hyperion she is able to survive the vacuum of space unaided for a considerable time, enabling at least interplanetary travel via her flight capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} on 3 November 2007 that the Air and Space Museum's collections committee, an advisory {{group on the}} acquisition and transfer of aircraft, had voted 5-4 on 28 September 2007 for deaccessioning The Swoose, and transfer it to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The panel forwarded its decision to Gen. John R. [...] "Jack" [...] Dailey, the museum director, and Donald S. Lopez Sr., the deputy director, who subsequently decided to stand by the committee's recommendation. [...] "There were good arguments on both sides," [...] said Dailey, who had requested a collections review to alleviate a storage crunch at the aforementioned Paul Garber Restoration Facility, where The Swoose has been stored since 1961. The Swoose {{has never been in}} a plan to be displayed, Dailey said. A recommended condition of this transfer was that the National Museum of the United States Air <b>Force</b> <b>transfer</b> ownership of a restored B-17 to the National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center annex for display, as that museum lacks a B-17. The matter was discussed by the governing board of the Dayton museum, and with the recent arrival of the B-17F Memphis Belle it was decided that continued display of the Museum's B-17G Shoo Shoo Baby would be unnecessary. Upon completion of the restoration and display of the Swoose, Shoo Shoo Baby will be transferred to the Washington D.C. museum for display (Memphis Belle is now expected to be completed by late 2017 with plans to put it on display on May 17, 2018).4. This decision raised some concerns among the staff and patrons of the Dayton museum, as [...] "Shoo Shoo Baby" [...] is one of the world's finest restored examples of a B-17G, and has been a popular exhibit at the museum for many years. It was eventually pointed out that with the display of the Swoose and eventual display of the Memphis Belle the National Museum of the United States Air Force will possess the world's two most historically significant B-17s, and another B-17G model can easily be obtained when funds and space become available.|$|E
5000|$|The Jacobs Engine Brake {{has been}} on the market since 1961, better known as the “Jake Brake”. The value of an engine {{retarder}} had been recognised many years earlier. In England in 1905, the motor car manufacturer Rover provided on its [...] "16-20" [...] model an auxiliary camshaft and modified exhaust cams which, when selected via a camshaft pedal, lifted the exhaust valve twice to every revolution of the shaft, causing air to be taken in from the exhaust pipe on every downward movement of the piston, compressed on the upward stroke, and then exhausted. Rover declared that [...] "the braking effect of this device is very pronounced - in fact, for all ordinary purposes it can be used without recourse to the friction brakes".Some 26 years later, and despite the advances in friction braking, the need for such a system was experienced by inventor Clessie L. Cummins. In August 1931, Clessie Cummins, Ford Moyer, and Dave Evans driving a Cummins diesel powered Indiana truck from New York to Los Angeles attempted to set a new truck speed record across the continent. All went well until the descent of the Cajon Pass leading into San Bernardino, CA, a long and steep gravel road which almost led to the demise of the truck and its driver, Clessie Cummins.In 1955, Clessie began studying what might be done to turn his engine into an effective “brake”, or vehicle retarder. An idea for a practical method came to Clessie in 1957. The idea revolved around taking advantage of perfectly timed motion already built into Cummins and Detroit Diesel engines; these engines have a third cam on the main camshaft that activates the fuel injector of each cylinder. A simple retrofit mechanism could transfer motion to open the exhaust valve. A patent was ultimately granted by the U.S. Patent Office.Although the principles were proven by mechanically transferring the injector motion, a more practical method was to use a fully hydraulic motion and <b>force</b> <b>transfer.</b> The first retarder housings of the prototype design were installed on a Cummins diesel engine in a truck owned and operated by the Sheldon Oil Company. [...] The initial run with the engine brake was to one of their plants just at the eastern base of the grade, down the Sierras on U.S. Highway 50 near Lake Tahoe.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Sports {{that involve}} {{extensive}} personal contact {{have a high}} incidence of injury. The introduction of regulations mandating the use of personal protective equipment in these sports is the most common injury control strategy (Marshall et al., 2002). Negligible {{attention has been paid to}} the mechanical linkage between the facemask and helmet as a means of reducing <b>force</b> <b>transfer</b> from the facemask, through the helmet, and to the head and or neck of the athlete. Methods A novel prototype mechanical linkage of reasonable simplicity that provides 360 ° of freedom in motion capable of decreasing <b>force</b> <b>transfer</b> from the facemask to the protective helmet when loading occurs was designed. Force was applied at three angulations to the long axis of the a control and prototype mechanical linkage, under both compressive and tensile force, generating six experimental groups: Tension at 0 °, Tension at 45 °, Tension at 90 °, Compression at 0 °, Compression at 45 °, and Compression at 90 °. For each experimental group, the force transferred from the facemask connector to the helmet connector and deflection of the mechanical linkage at failure was evaluated. Results For each condition measured under both compressive and tensile force; maximum <b>force</b> <b>transfer</b> within the limits of the theoretical range of motion, <b>force</b> <b>transfer</b> at failure and linkage deflection at failure statistically significant differences between the control and prototype groups were observed with a t test for independent samples with unequal variance (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), α = 0. 05. Conclusion When compared to currently available designs, the prototype mechanical linkage designed and tested as part of this project is of reasonable simplicity, displays increased flexibility and provides 360 ° of freedom in motion.
