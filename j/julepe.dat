50|$|After having dealt, {{the deck}} {{is placed in}} the middle of the table and the top card is flipped. The suit of this first card is thus {{considered}} the Trump suit, or triunfo, and any card of this suit automatically beats any card from another suit, despite its value. If the flipped trump card is an Ace or a Three, the player that deals can take this card, without seeing your cards. This player is called the postre (lit. dessert) of the game. The postre takes the trump with the condition that the dealer win three tricks tres bazos, as opposed to merely hacer <b>julepe.</b> Otherwise, the dealer will Fall for not having met this condition at the end of the round.|$|E
