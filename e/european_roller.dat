2500|$|Among {{coastal and}} some wetland areas, various water birds {{can come to}} {{contribute}} {{a large portion of}} both prey numbers and prey biomass. This may include more than 50 species of shorebird (from quite small sandpipers to the largest species of gull), more than 30 species of waterfowl, at least 10 species each of herons, 8 species of rails and any grebes or cormorants that are available. [...] The most regularly reported water bird prey in Europe were, roughly in this order, the [...] common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus), the [...] Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), [...] mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), [...] black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus), and the [...] Eurasian teal (Anas crecca). The diet of a handful of eagle-owl pairs in the Riau Islands Province of France were found to be dominated by water birds, especially the [...] yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis), the colonial abundance of which allowed the eagle-owls to atypically occupy these small islands. The diet of eagle-owls in Norway was dominated in coastal areas by water birds, overall for the nation 53% of the food was made of birds, the species most commonly identified as caught being the [...] mew gull (Larus canus), [...] Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and [...] common eider (Somateria mollissima). Despite access to large seabird breeding colonies, almost all large bird species hunted in Norway, including large forest grouse in more inland areas, were apparently fully-grown adults and most water birds were caught while resting on open coastal waters. Eagle-owls in northwestern Poland, an area heavily dotted with lakes, relied on birds for about 64% of the diet, more than half of which were water birds. The main prey species there was the Eurasian coot, at nearly 15% of the prey numbers. [...] In Primorsky Krai in Russia, 53.2% of the food for the eagle-owls were made up of birds, predominantly water birds with the primary prey species being the [...] crested auklet (Aethia cristatella [...] ) (26.9%). In the Russian Far East, similarly, birds occupy up to 57.6% of the diet, a lion’s share of which are water birds. In this study, the grey red-backed vole and reed vole (Microtus fortis) were the most numerous identified individual species but in some years the extremely large Japanese cormorant (Phalacrocorax capillatus), at , were more numerous as prey than either vole. Water birds were found to be even more important in the diet in Korea, as in wetland habitat, with birds in general comprising 68.9% by number and 85.3% by biomass there, but in adjacent upland areas birds were slightly secondary to mammals, which made up 38.7% by number and 64.7% by biomass, led by the brown rat. [...] In Korea, the mallard and the similar spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) made up 38.1% of the biomass. Other recorded bird species in the Eurasian eagle-owl’s diet includes most type of birds found in their range, including bustards, sandgrouse, parrots, cuckoos, swifts, the [...] hoopoe (Upupa epops), the [...] European bee-eater (Merops apiaster), the [...] common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), the [...] <b>European</b> <b>roller</b> (Coracias garrulus), at least seven species of woodpecker (from the smallest to the largest European species) and more than 80 species of passerine. Among passerines, the only family reported widely as prey besides corvids are thrushes. In the Italian Alps, Turdus species were the fourth most frequently recorded type of prey. In particular, the abundant [...] Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula) [...] is widely reported to be taken by eagle-owls.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la 10 th Conference of the European Ornithologist's Union, celebrada en Badajoz (España) del 24 al 28 de agosto de 2015. <b>European</b> <b>Rollers</b> Coracias garrulus are near-threatened long-distance {{migrants}} {{experiencing a}} global decline, {{which has been}} attributed to the degradation of open agricultural habitats in which rollers breed. However, conservation threats in non-breeding areas remain largely unstudied. Here we used ecological niche models to characterise suitable wintering areas for <b>European</b> <b>rollers</b> in Southern Africa and identify potential threats there. Location data from open-access databases and bird atlases allowed a characterization of wintering areas for the overall breeding population, while data from satellite-tracked birds breeding in Spain allowed the characterization of wintering areas of the westernmost Iberian population. Spanish Rollers occupied a relatively narrow wintering area in the north western part of the global wintering range. The most important habitat variables determining wintering areas were distance to roads and tree cover for Iberian birds, and tree and herbaceous cover for the overall population. Wintering habitats used by Iberian rollers differed from those characterizing the overall wintering range, suggesting that birds from different breeding populations may winter in separate areas. Suitable areas for Iberian rollers were reasonably included within current protected areas in southern Africa, more than for the global population. However, suitable wintering areas overlapped with degraded areas more than expected by chance. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
