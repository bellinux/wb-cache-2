Although Messala <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> was an accident, he condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge.|$|E

If the contract is breached, the third party has all the rights that he would have if he had been a party to the initial contract.|$|E
5|$|Maester Aemon summons Jon and {{explains}} {{to him the}} reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either his duty to the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that {{the consequences of his}} choice will haunt him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Max's {{daughter}} Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) becomes {{angry at}} Max for never mentioning Bradley, leading to his confessing {{that he knows}} Bradley did not kill Archie. Lauren starts to suspect Max as he has become violent towards other people, but he tells her he promised {{to look after the}} real killer, who is no longer a danger. When Lauren sees Stacey dancing with Max, she accuses her of trying flirting with Max, but Stacey says they are just friends and he promised he would always look out for her. Lauren realises that Stacey is the killer and tells Max she <b>knows</b> <b>this.</b> She confronts Stacey, who confesses, and Lauren records it on her mobile phone. Lauren later hands the recording to Janine as Stacey and Ryan have begun having an affair. Max wipes the recording so on Christmas Eve, Janine publicly announces in the pub after trying to play the recording that Stacey killed Archie. Outside, Stacey privately tells Ryan that Janine is telling the truth.|$|E

25|$|Clearly, {{the second}} example {{is not a}} grammatically well-formed {{sentence}} in English. A child <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> and does not form sentences {{such as the one}} marked by the asterisk. How does the child know, without being explicitly taught, that the ungrammatical example is, in fact, ungrammatical? From the linguistic perspective being described here, {{the answer to this question}} is that such knowledge pre-exists as part of UG.|$|E
25|$|However, {{only one}} of these Nash equilibria {{satisfies}} a more restrictive equilibrium concept, subgame perfection. Suppose that the first demands a large amount that gives the second some (small) amount of money. By rejecting the demand, the second is choosing nothing rather than something. So, {{it would be better for}} the second to choose to accept any demand that gives him/her any amount whatsoever. If the first <b>knows</b> <b>this,</b> he/she will give the second the smallest (non-zero) amount possible.|$|E
25|$|Years {{pass and}} Kamin grows old, outliving his wife. Kamin and his {{daughter}} Meribor continue their study of the drought. They find {{that it is not}} temporary; extinction of all life on the planet is inevitable. Ultimately, Kamin confronts a government official who privately admits to him that the government already <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> but wishes to keep it a secret to avoid a panic. The official gravely points out to Kamin that they only just recently managed to successfully launch artificial satellites using primitive rockets: their race simply does not possess the technology level needed to evacuate even a small colony's worth of people before their planet is rendered uninhabitable.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{note here}} that, for example, in Christianity (and {{even more in}} Judaism, where God is {{represented}} as talking to Job and explaining why he is just), God is already believed to have exposed himself very distinctly: for example to the Apostles who saw his resurrection. One theistic explanation of this might be that God knows some people wouldn't believe anyway but if God <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> before creating, {{there is a problem}} about God's liability for what is created. More fundamentally in relation to Murray's argument, there is the problem for orthodox believers of explaining the existence of Satan, a fallen angel who is obviously aware of God and yet, according to theistic scriptures, freely chose to rebel against God.|$|E
25|$|A lower {{threshold}} of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental {{state of mind}} of the person {{at the time the}} actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning. Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk. Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system.|$|E
500|$|PETA made further remarks criticizing Discovery Channel's {{decision}} {{to go on with}} the special despite its earlier objections, arguing that [...] "study after study has shown that entertainment features such as this one that show humans interfering with and handling wild animals are detrimental to species conservation. Rosolie <b>knows</b> <b>this.</b> Discovery <b>knows</b> <b>this.</b> Yet they chose to contrive and air this shameful stunt for ratings anyway." [...] In a statement following the broadcast, Discovery Channel re-affirmed that the safety of Rosolie and the anaconda were a top priority, and that he [...] "created this challenge to get maximum attention {{for one of the most}} beautiful and threatened parts of the world, the Amazon Rainforest and its wildlife. He went to great lengths to send this message and it was his absolute intention to be eaten alive." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] {{was directed by}} Lohan in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City, and references her father Michael's alcoholism and alleged domestic abuse. Tommy Mottola, head of Casablanca, revealed {{that no one could}} direct the video better than Lindsay herself, who said to Lohan, [...] "'No one <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> song better than you, no one <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> situation better than you.' It's a lot to take on, but I told her she's ready, and we'll give her all the support she needs". Lohan said that the video's storefront setting was chosen because, in her words, [...] "my life is on display". Lohan also wanted to break a mirror during the bathroom scenes, because she wanted to show her real feelings in the video. Assistant director Jeb Bryan said to Lohan, [...] "This is real glass, Lindsay. We weren't prepared for you to break these things. [...] Do you want this slow motion?" [...] She responded, [...] "Regular frame will make it more violent. [...] I don't want it to be too pretty". The music video was first aired on MTV's Making the Video, and later released to iTunes Store on October 25, 2005.|$|E

When he tells her this, Selma is devastated to {{have been used by}} yet another terrible husband. For a while, she attempts {{to go along with the}} ruse, if only for the creature comforts she can access. When Troy says they need to have a child to divert public attention from rumors of his fetish involving aquarium fish, Selma <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> is a line she will not cross, and they divorce.|$|E

In the far future, River Song, {{recently}} made a Doctor of Archaeology, reviews eyewitness accounts made by those children when they were adults, and also notes the date and location of the Doctor's death. She is interrupted by Madame Kovarian and agents of the Silence. [...] Kovarian tells River that she is still theirs, and will be the one to kill the Doctor. Against River's will, they place her in an augmented astronaut's suit and submerge her in Lake Silencio to await the Doctor.|$|E
500|$|A few of Dickinson's poems {{appeared}} in Samuel Bowles' Springfield Republican between 1858 and 1868. They were published anonymously and heavily edited, with conventionalized punctuation and formal titles. The first poem, [...] "Nobody <b>knows</b> <b>this</b> little rose", {{may have been}} published without Dickinson's permission. The Republican also published [...] "A narrow Fellow in the Grass" [...] as [...] "The Snake", [...] "Safe in their Alabaster Chambers–" [...] as [...] "The Sleeping", and [...] "Blazing in the Gold and quenching in Purple" [...] as [...] "Sunset". The poem [...] "I taste a liquor never brewed–" [...] {{is an example of}} the edited versions; the last two lines in the first stanza were completely rewritten.|$|E
