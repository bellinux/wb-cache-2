40|$|Malaysian {{government}} {{believes in}} the concept of human settlement that is equipped with basic utilities, social facilities and proper landscape. Thus the private developers, who remain to be the sole producer of housing, are not merely constructing a house but they are developing a living environment that gives a proper and pleasant place to stay. In ensuring this, there are certain standards, rules and requirements that need to be followed by the private housing developers and one of them come from the planning authority. The local planning authority that governs the planning and development of an area imposed planning requirements that need to be complied with before any approval for planning permission could be granted. The private developers, therefore, have to understand the requirements set by each local planning authority. This is because the planning requirements vary according to state and local planning authority. This paper, therefore, concentrates on the planning requirements in general, without any particular case study as it could provide a basic knowledge as well as the rationale for such a requirement. Besides that, the paper attempts to look into the impact of planning requirements or planning controls on to the development. 1. 1 Introduction As the title of the paper suggests it is the writer intention to highlight the topics on development controls exercised by the Local Planning Authority (LPA) in Malaysia.

The worst complications of diabetes develop when quality healthcare services are not provided to patients or are not used by them. This study was conducted to depict the first national picture of quality of care provided for known diabetic patients in Iran. The study was conducted alongside the “Iran's National Noncommunicable Diseases Risk Factor Surveillance survey ” of 2005; a cross-sectional study with a multistage cluster sampling approach which targeted Iranians older than 15 years of age. Only 6. 4 % of the respondents had a HbA 1 c test during the year before questioning and 25. 7 % reported to have undertaken a lipid profile examination in the same period of time. Positive responses for eye and foot examinations in the year leading to survey were 39. 8 % and 20. 5 %, respectively.

From 1976 the office was brought {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and two years later its mandate was extended: as the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) it was to assist the 22 nations of the Sudano-Sahelian region in putting the anti-desertification action plan into effect. Today, UNSO's primary aims are to combat the increasing impoverishment of the land: to initiate sustainable development programmes, and to find means of combating drought and desertification. Seventeen out of the region's 22 countries are among the least developed in the world, so the whole region represents the highest concentration of under-developed countries. One of UNSO's priorities is to help governments formulate strategies to address the problems caused by drought and desertification. UNSO therefore supported the creation of a detailed and reliable information base and a <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanism</b> for natural resources, both vital to the planning and execution of programmes. Meetings and information exchange are essential to effective drought and desertification control, and to this end UNSO lent its support to the ministerial conference towards a combined anti-desertification policy in order to coordinate African policies and programmes. UNSO specialists produce widely-circulated studies and reports on desertification. Finally, UNSO also has a duty to inform the public and to maintain current awareness.

The African Commission has not {{put in place a}} <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanism</b> or system to ascertain adherence or to ensure that states implement these recommendations. In the absence of research about state compliance with these recommendations, interviews were conducted to provide a first coordinated attempt at ascertaining the status of compliance with these findings.

This trend is similar in respect of the implementation by African states of the views of the UN Human Rights Committee, established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. A number of diverse factors influence state compliance. Some factors, such as the weaknesses of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) occasioning a lack of publicity and political pressure, and problems surrounding the institutional legitimacy of the African Commission, explain the general low rate of compliance. Other factors, such as the role of NGOs, {{the nature and extent of}} the violation and the form of government in the relevant state, explain (non) -compliance in particular cases.

40|$|Background. Domestic {{violence}} (DV) {{during pregnancy}} is especially serious, {{but can be}} a challenging and difficult subject for midwives to raise with women. The Bristol Pregnancy and Domestic Violence Programme was introduced in an NHS Trust in the south-west of England to equip community midwives with the knowledge and confidence to enquire effectively about DV in the antenatal period. Aim. To evaluate the effect of routine antenatal enquiry about domestic abuse on disclosure outcomes. Method. Semi-structured self-completion questionnaires, face-to-face interviews and focus groups were used to collect data {{from a group of}} community midwives. An audit was also conducted to assess changes in levels of DV reporting after the introduction of routine enquiry. Results. Eight instances of DV were identified in the 17 -month period prior to the programme, and 25 cases of current DV were identified in the nine months following its introduction - an almost six-fold increase. The midwives viewed routine enquiry as important and believed that they have a key role to play. They also identified a lack of pre- and post-registration training and of previous experience in dealing with issues relating to DV. Conclusions. This study supports previous evidence that routine enquiry may increase the number of disclosures of DV during pregnancy. It also implies that any programme of enquiry must include support, appropriate referral and <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for women, and that midwives require pre- and post-registration education, training and support {{if they are to be}} confident and effective in routine antenatal enquiry.

Only the path relationship from ‘adequate postnatal care’ to ‘adequate child’s immunization’ (− 0. 02) was negatively associated and significant at p[*]<[*] 0. 001. Conclusions In conclusion, utilization of each level of MNCH care is related to the next level of care, that is – antenatal care is associated with delivery care which is then associated with postnatal and subsequently with child’s immunization program. At the national level, identification of communities which are greatly contributing to overall disparity in health and a well laid out <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanism</b> from pregnancy through to child’s immunization program could serve towards improving maternal and infant health outcomes and equity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. With the {{widespread}} use of active immunization, significant results have been achieved in the control and prevention of numerous communicable diseases. The Expanded Programme on Immunization of the World Health Organization is intended to strengthen national programs for the reduction in the incidence and mortality rates and global elimination or eradication of communicable diseases. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze results of the immunization program in Vojvodina. Material and methods. The results of the immunization program were analyzed on the basis of the incidence rates, since the introduction of the mandatory reporting system, till 2006. The analysis included immunization coverage against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and measles as well as reported cases of missed opportunities in the period from 1997 to 2006. Results. Poliomyelitis has not been reported in Vojvodina since 1963, diphtheria since 1978 and measles in the period from 2001 to 2006. Sporadic cases of pertussis have been reported in unimmunized children of the youngest age, and tetanus in unimmunized elderly population. Vaccination coverage against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis was above 96 %. Vaccination coverage against measles was lower (95 % vaccination, 87 % revaccination). The highest proportion of missed opportunities was caused by not responding to immunization calls (46. 6 %). Conclusion. These results can be maintained by up-to-date (UTD) immunization and high vaccination coverage without territorial and population differences. Data on the total number of children without up-to-date vaccination cannot be obtained on the basis of administrative coverage follow-up. It is necessary to establish <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for UTD immunization, which would reveal the number of children at risk from vaccine preventable diseases and characteristics of unimmunized population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Higher {{education}} institutions have executed {{policies and practices}} intended to determine and promote good teaching. Students’ evaluation of {{the teaching and learning}} process is seen as one measure of evaluating quality and effectiveness of instruction and courses. Policies and procedures guiding this process are discernible in universities, but it isoften not the case for nursing colleges. Objective: To analyse and describe the views of nursing students on block evaluation, and how feedback obtained from this process was managed. Method: A quantitative descriptive study was conducted amongst nursing students (n = 177) in their second to fourth year of training from one nursing college in KwaZulu-Natal. A questionnaire was administered by the researcher and data were analysed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences Version 19. 0. Results: The response rate was 145 (81. 9 %). The participants perceived the aim of block evaluation as improving the quality of teaching and enhancing their experiences as students. They questioned the significance of their input as stakeholders given that they had never been consulted about the development or review of the evaluation tool, or the administration process; and they often did not receive feedback from the evaluation they participated in. Conclusion: The college management should develop a clear organisational structure with supporting policies and operational guidelines for administering the evaluation process. The administration, implementation procedures, reporting of results and <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should be made transparent and communicated to all concerned. Reports and actions related to these evaluations should provide feedback into relevant courses or programmes.

40|$|Includes bibliographyThe present {{document}} was {{prepared by the}} ECLAC Women and Development Unit for the International Meeting on Gender Statistics and Indicators for Measuring the Incidence of and Trends in Violence against Women in Latin America and the Caribbean (La Paz, Bolivia, 21 - 23 November 2001). The document reflects the inputs which the participants provided for the working paper submitted by ECLAC at that event. It is a tool for measuring the incidence of violence against women in intimate relationships, {{as well as the}} main characteristics of the phenomenon. The first part describes how the problem of violence against women came to be part of national, regional and international public agendas. One of the problems detected in the enforcement of the relevant laws is the lack of sufficient and adequate <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for monitoring the application of penalties. This document represents an attempt to meet that need by providing indicators that make it possible to carry out the consultation processes that result in the formulation of public policy. The second part presents a classification and non-exhaustive analysis of the surveys and administrative records used to measure violence against women in recent years. This part also highlights the challenges that should be analyzed and considered in adapting and improving such sources as statistically valid inputs for the construction of indicators. The third and final part presents a minimum set of indicators {{in the form of a}} proposal to be considered by the countries of the region. The proposal aims to strike a balance between what is ideal and what is possible by attempting to complement efforts already under way while incorporating characteristics, purposes and objectives that go beyond the bare minimum. The document concludes by suggesting institutional arrangements for ensuring that the implementation of this set of indicators is integrated into the process of institutionalizing public policies with a gender perspective...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Task Force on Cervical Cancer Screening Programs, which {{produced}} its first report in 1976, was reconvened by the Department of National Health and Welfare in 1980 {{in response to}} concerns expressed {{about the significance of}} new data, changing sociosexual patterns and wide variations in the implementation of the 1976 recommendations. This article is a summary of the 1982 task force report. In addition to updates of the 1976 material new sections appear on groups at risk, mathematical models of screening, quality control in screening programs, cytologic screening coverage of the Canadian population and management of patients with abnormal smears. The 1982 recommendations deal with frequency of screening, laboratory quality control and <b>follow-up</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The task force concludes that measures to improve the quality and sensitivity of screening programs and to include women who have never been screened will be more effective in reducing mortality from carcinoma of the cervix than will attempts to increase the frequency of screening. The task force views as unnecessary the annual screening of women over 35 years of age whose previous smears have been normal. Since younger women are sexually more active and tend to have more than one sexual partner they are at high risk. Therefore, the task force recommends annual screening for sexually active women aged 18 to 35 years. Physicians, health care professionals and government health agencies {{have a role to play}} in informing women about the recommended intervals for cervical smears and ensuring that screening programs of adequate quality are available. Although women are primarily responsible for entering and continuing in such a program, government-sponsored registries are essential if the full potential of cervical smear programs is to be realized...|$|R
