50|$|At first {{resistance}} to the real-estate development and downtown business interests of Los Angeles remained strong {{enough to keep the}} small farmers unified in opposition to annexation. However, the <b>fruit</b> <b>packing</b> company interests were taken over by the Los Angeles interests.

It was examined thato uncoated <b>fruit</b> <b>packed</b> in polyethylene or coating emulsions having fungicide, ethylene absorbent and antiripening agent had significant effect (p< 0. 05) on overall physico-chemical constituents of Chaunsa at ambient temperature during storage. It was investigated that treated <b>fruit</b> <b>packed</b> in polyethylene had minimum weight loss ranged from 1. 92 - 3. 98 %, lower TSS (15. 17 - 18. 43 %), lower pH (3. 88 - 4. 4), higher retention of TA (0. 81 - 0. 97 %) and lower AA (19. 81 - 30. 91 mg/ 100 g) with an average mean of 3. 20, 15. 84, 3. 99, 0. 87 and 24. 48 respectively at ambient temperature during storage. On the other hand the control (T) had 1 highest weight loss (9. 39 %), TSS (20. 83 %), pH (4. 91), lowest TA (0. 44 %) and highest AA (42. 06 mg/ 100 g) respectively during storage. The coated <b>fruit</b> <b>packed</b> in polyethylene had minimum weight loss, slower increase of TSS, pH, higher retention of acidity and slower increase in AA respectively of fruit during the storage period.

Fruit must be treated gently during in sir handling to improve their qualityin order to get a good price in a competitive market. The correct post-hardvest handling in <b>fruit</b> <b>packing</b> lines is a prerequisite to cut down the heavy post-harvest losses. <b>Fruit</b> <b>packing</b> lines must be evaluated, studying their design, the impacts applied to the fruits, the characteristics of the materials, etc. This study establishes the possibility of carrying out modifications and tests in a packing line during a long period of time. For this purpose, an experimental <b>fruit</b> <b>packing</b> line has been designed and located in the Agricultural Engineering Department of the Polythecnic University of Madrid with the aim of improving mechanical devices and fruit handling conditions to minimize damage to fruit. The experimental line consists of several transporting belts, one rollers transporter, one sizer, one elevator, one singularizer, and three trays to receive the calibrated fruit. The line has a length of 6. 15 m and a width cf 1. 9 m. Movement of the different components is regulated by electric motors with variable velocity electronically controlled. The height of the transfer points is variable and can be easily modified. The experimental line has been calibrated using two instrumented spheres IS 100 (8. 8 cm Ø and 6. 2 cm Ø). Average acceleration values obtained in all the transfers of the experimental line lay under 80 g's, although there is big variation for some of them being some values above 100 g's...|$|R

Characteristics of {{the impacts}} {{suffered}} by the fruit on a transfer point of an experimental <b>fruit</b> <b>packing</b> line were analysed. The transfer is made up by two transporting belts at different heights forming an angle of 90 °. Different tests were carried out to study the effect of transfer height, velocity, belt structure and padding on the acceleration values recorded by an instrumental sphere (IS 100). Results showed that transfer height and belt structure affect mainly impact values on the belt base, and padding affects mainly impact values registered in lateral impact.
