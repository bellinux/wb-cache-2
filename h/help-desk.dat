This implied that Luang Por Dhammajayo had to disrobe because he had not {{transferred}} donated land back to the temple. A warning had preceded this letter, which government officials said {{had not yet been}} forwarded to the Sangha Council and Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The statement had a great impact. In response, the Religious Affairs Department pressed criminal charges of embezzlement against the abbot and a close aide. The temple stated that, being subject to a criminal lawsuit, the abbot would no longer transfer the land, because this might be interpreted as acceptance of guilt. Wat Phra Dhammakaya and the Sangha Council requested the department to wait until the monastic trials were finished first, but it continued the lawsuit anyway. Moreover, the department set up a public <b>help-desk</b> and post office box to receive complaints about the temple. With the resulting witness accounts, more charges were laid against Luang Por Dhammajayo. In the process of these investigations, the main politicians responsible, that is the Minister and Deputy Minister of Education, were both replaced, with the new Minister Somsak Prissanananthakul assuming {{a key role in the}} judicial processes against the abbot.|$|E

For the later, technologies hold unprecedented opportunities however; successful implementation of educational technologies squarely depends on the ability of developers and users in harnessing modern digital-gadgets to stay available and accessible 24 / 7. If the required technical infrastructure (tools and professionals) and live <b>help-desks</b> are not there, eLearning solutions in higher education continue underplaying their role as well as discouraging the users from becoming digitally literate.

Moreover, the temple underlined the legal rights of monks under the constitution, pointing out that possessing personal property is common and legal in the Thai Sangha. Spokespeople also questioned whether the letter of the Patriarch was not a fake. In a statement that was featured in many newspapers, Luang Por Dhammajayo declared that he would not disrobe under any circumstances, but [...] "would die in the monk's saffron robes". When the Prime Minister himself pressured the abbot to acknowledge the charges, the temple asked for a guarantee that the abbot would not be imprisoned and consequently defrocked. No such guarantee was given, an arrest warrant followed, and a standoff began between a police force of hundreds, and thousands of the temple's practitioners, in which the latter barricaded the temple's entrances. After two days, Luang Por Dhammajayo agreed to let the police take him when the requested guarantee was given, and a Sangha Council member threatened to defrock the abbot if he did not go with the police. The abbot was interrogated for three hours, but not defrocked. Then he was released on a bail of two million baht, still on the same day. The news made headlines worldwide. From November onward, Luang Por Dhammajayo started to go to court.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{contribution}} is the role technological artifacts play in shaping working and communicative practices of a <b>Help-Desk</b> department in an Italian company. References to a Communities of Practice approach help to point out processes of knowledge sharing and transfer, among <b>help-desk</b> operators and between them {{and a group of}} newcomers. A wide assembly of technologies (ACD technology, Intranet database, e-mail and so on) is part of the routinized dimension of the <b>Help-Desk</b> work, based on explicit problem-solving processes. At the same time, identity and mutual engagement among the operators identify peculiarities of the <b>Help-Desk</b> towards the rest of the company. Erosion and emergence of patterns associated with old and new technologies constitute the main focus of the ethnography carried out inside the company and especially in the <b>Help-Desk</b> department...|$|E
40|$|We are {{developing}} a corpus-based approach for the prediction of <b>help-desk</b> responses from features in customers ’ emails, where responses are represented at two levels of granularity: document and sentence. We present an automatic and humanbased evaluation of our system’s responses. The automatic evaluation involves textual comparisons between generated responses and responses composed by <b>help-desk</b> operators. Our results show that both levels of granularity produce good responses, addressing inquiries of different kinds. The humanbased evaluation measures response informativeness, and confirms our conclusion that both levels of granularity produce useful responses. ...|$|E
40|$|Responses to <b>help-desk</b> email {{inquiries}} {{are often}} repetitive, sharing {{varying degrees of}} commonality. In addition, {{a significant proportion of}} the responses are generic, containing a very low level of technical content. In this paper, we present a corpus-based approach for identifying common elements in <b>help-desk</b> responses and using them to construct a new response. A <b>help-desk</b> domain is unique in that responses that contain even one incongruous sentence can alienate a user. It is therefore not always possible to automatically generate a complete response, because personalization is often better handled by human operators. Our system is designed to find and collate the generic portions of responses. We have adapted multi-document summarization techniques, and developed a measure that predicts the completeness of a planned response, thus indicating when a fully automated response is possible. Our evaluation shows that 14 % of the responses in our corpus can be represented by complete generic responses. ...|$|E

In this paper, we identify features of electronic discussions that influence the clustering process, and offer a filtering mechanism that removes undesirable influences. We tested the clustering and filtering processes on electronic newsgroup discussions, and evaluated their performance by means of two experiments: coarse-level clustering and simple information retrieval. Our evaluation shows that our filtering mechanism has a significant positive effect on both tasks. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} corpus-based {{approach}} for the automatic anal-ysis and synthesis of email responses to <b>help-desk</b> requests. This ap-proach {{can be used}} to automatically deal with repetitive requests of low technical content, thus enabling <b>help-desk</b> operators to focus their eort on more dicult requests. We propose a method for extracting high-precision sentences for inclusion in a response, and a measure for predicting the completeness of a planned response. The idea is that com-plete, high-precision responses may be sent directly to users, while in-complete responses should be passed to operators. Our results show that a small but signicant proportion (14 %) of our automatically generated responses have a high degree of precision and completeness, and that our measure can reliably predict the completeness of a response. ...|$|E
