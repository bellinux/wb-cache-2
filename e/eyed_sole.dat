Narada suggested that the wise sage Bhrigu should be allowed to decide after he met the Trimurtis. The sage who had an extra <b>eye</b> in the <b>sole</b> of his foot visited Lord Brahma and Lord Shiva and went un-noticed in both these locations. He cursed Brahma that no temple sans one will worship Brahma and cursed Shiva that temples on Earth will worship him as Lingam.|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{documented}} {{cases of}} infectious disease trans-mission to medical staff via conjunctival contamination and wide-spread recommendation of protective eyewear use during surgical procedures, {{a large number}} of surgeons rely on their prescription spectacles as <b>sole</b> <b>eye</b> protection. Modern fashion spectacles, being of increasingly slim design, may no longer be adequate in this role. Methods: A survey was conducted among the surgeons at Waikato Hospital from December 7, 2004 to February 1, 2005, to assess current operating theater eyewear practices and attitudes. Those who wore prescription spectacles were asked to assume a standardized “operating position ” from which anatomic measurements were ob-tained. These data were mathematically analyzed to determine the degree of palebral fissure protection conferred by their spectacles. Results: Of 71 surgical practitioners surveyed, 45. 1 % required prescription lenses for operating, the mean spectacle age being 2. 4...|$|R
50|$|Once, sages {{headed by}} Kashyapa began {{to perform a}} fire {{sacrifice}} (homa) {{on the banks of}} the Ganges. Sage Narada visited them and asked them why they were performing the sacrifice and who is the patron deity of the sacrifice. Unable to answer, the sages approached Sage Bhrigu (who had an extra <b>eye</b> in the <b>sole</b> of his foot) to determine the worthy patron god among the Trimurti, the Hindu trinune gods. Bhrigu first went to Satyaloka, the abode of the god Brahma. At Satyaloka, he found Brahma reciting the four Vedas in praise of Vishnu, with each of his four heads, and attended upon by his consort Saraswati. Brahma did not notice Bhrigu offering obeisance. The angry sage cursed Brahma and left Satyaloka. He then reached Kailash, the abode of the god Shiva. Bhrigu found Shiva deep in meditation with his wife Parvati by his side. Feeling ignored, Bhrigu cursed Shiva too and left for Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu.|$|R
50|$|Madhavankutty (Sreenivasan) is a {{schoolmaster}} in {{a remote}} village. He is famous among students and his friends but his wife (Rajsri) keeps complaining about not helping her in house. The village is identity-less as the title suggests. So, when a theft happens in a moneylender's shop, everyone around is baffled. It gives sleepless nights to the panchayat president (Nedumudi Venu) and the police officer {{in charge of the}} area (Innocent). As they have no inkling about who the culprit may be, they device a plan to catch someone with a previous record. Madhavankutty is the <b>sole</b> <b>eye</b> witness as the shop is visible from the place where he lives. A major part of the story is devoted to showing how Madhavankutty dodges the pressure tactics of the police and counters their arguments. But after this incident, people start moving away from him and the film is about how the incident changes his life.|$|R
5000|$|Ferzetti had a {{supporting}} role in Flavio Calzavara's Sigillo rosso alongside Gino Cervi and Carla Del Poggio, but his first leading role came in Lo Zappatore (both from 1950), a film which focused {{on the life of}} peasants and farm workers during the interwar and great depression period. Roles now came in abundance for Ferzetti, from the crime comedy Welcome, Reverend! (Benvenuto, reverendo!, 1950) alongside Aldo Fabrizi, Massimo Girotti, and Lianella Carell, to Luis Trenker's film Barrier to the North (1950), to Guido Brignone's The Naked and the Wicked ( [...] , 1951) and Inganno (1952), to Curzio Malaparte's drama, The Forbidden Christ (Il Cristo proibito, 1951), to Antonio Pietrangeli's Empty <b>Eyes</b> (Il <b>sole</b> negli occhi, 1953). He starred in the successful biopic of composer Puccini under Carmine Gallone, Puccini (also 1953), and reprised the role in House of Ricordi (Casa Ricordi, 1954), also featuring Roland Alexandre as Gioacchino Rossini. Ferzetti starred in Mario Soldati's The Wayward Wife (La Provinciale, 1953), a Cannes Film Festival nominee for best film, which saw him play the role of a professor who {{falls in love with a}} glamorous star (Gina Lollobrigida). This comedy drama involves the tale of a Romanian countess who forces [...] "Gemma" [...] to become a prostitute. For his performance, Ferzetti received an award from the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, and further cemented his status as a leading actor in Italy by appearing alongside Lollobrigida. Ferzetti appeared in Marcello Pagliero's comedy drama based on the play by Luigi Pirandello, Vestire gli ignudi (1954), playing the character of Ludovico Nota alongside Pierre Brasseur, Manlio Busoni, and Paolo Ferrara, and in Camilla (also 1954), under the directorship of Luciano Emmer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Mice exhibit {{multiple}} nonvisual {{responses to}} light, including 1) pho-toentrainment of circadian rhythm; 2) “masking, ” {{which refers to}} the acute effect of light on behavior, either negative (activity suppressing) or positive (activity inducing); and 3) pupillary constriction. In mammals, the <b>eye</b> is the <b>sole</b> photosensory organ for these responses, and it contains only 2 known classes of pigments: opsins and cryptochromes. No individual opsin or cryptochrome gene is essential for circadian photoreception, gene photoinduction, or masking. Previously, the authors found that mice lacking retinol-binding protein, in which dietary depletion of ocular retinaldehyde can be achieved, had normal light sig-naling to the SCN, as determined by per gene photoinduction. In the present study, the authors analyzed phototransduction to the SCN in vitamin A–replete and vitamin A–depleted rbp-/- and rbp-/- cry 1 -/-cry 2 -/- mice using molecular and behavioral end points. They found that vitamin A–depleted rbp-/- mice exhibit either normal photoentrainment or become diurnal. In contrast, while vitamin A–replete rbp-/- cry 1 -/- cry 2 -/- mice are light responsive (with reduced sensitiv...|$|R

60|$|The chateau, indeed, still {{retained}} {{the characteristics of}} a castle. The site had evidently been selected with a <b>sole</b> <b>eye</b> to defence; the hill on which it stood fell abruptly away on three sides, and could hardly be attacked except in front. Here a plateau extended some three or four hundred yards long and upwards of a hundred yards across. A wall with flanking turrets had been a sufficient defence on the other three sides, but here there was a strong tower on each flank, and also {{on each side of the}} central gate. The walls inclosed a space of some two acres, in the centre of which stood the castle. This had been to some extent modernized--windows having taken the place of loopholes in the upper floors, while those looking into the inner courtyard extended to the ground. The point where the road reached the plateau was some three hundred yards from the gateway, and as Hector galloped towards the walls it was evident that he was recognized, for shouts were raised by the men on guard and the drawbridge over the fosse--cut in the solid rock along the foot of the wall--was lowered.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Rupert had made {{considerable}} progress in Arabic, {{thanks to his}} continually conversing in that language, and his risk of detection had greatly decreased. Once {{or twice a week}} fresh dye was applied to him from head to foot. He was now accustomed to the scantiness of his clothing, and had completely caught the manners and gestures of the natives. The colour of his <b>eyes</b> was the <b>sole</b> point that even a close observer would detect as being peculiar in his appearance, and he had fallen into the habit of keeping them partly closed and the darkened eye-lashes greatly lessened the chance of their colour being noticed. He had, moreover, by the advice of one of the doctors before leaving, taken with him a bottle of belladonna, and a small dose of this prior to entering any populous village had the effect of enlarging the pupils and thus of darkening the general effect of the eyes. The sheik frequently crossed the river with one of his followers and made excursions among the tribes on the opposite bank, but with all their inquiries no news whatever was obtained of any white captive.|$|R
40|$|Construction transcriptomes of non-model organisms is {{a common}} task {{nowadays}} due to the advent of low-cost sequencing platforms. The non-model organisms require a de novo assembling strategy since no reference is available. Moreover, DNA or RNA from non-model species usually comes from natural, highly heterozygous populations, providing an additional complexity to the assembly process. To facilitate the otherwise cumbersome task of obtaining the better transcriptome, here it is presented an automatic, reliable pipeline that uses public and newly designed tools to do so, handling both short and long reads. It starts with our pre-processing software SeqTrimNext that extracts reliable reads and removes any uncertain sequence that could obscure the final result. Two different algorithms (usually MRA 3 and Euler-SR, or Oases) are used to provide different sets of contigs that are then simplified using CD-HIT. Mapping with Bowtie 2 is used to discard artefactual contigs. Reliable contigs are analysed with our software Full-LengtherNext to discard non-coding sequences, split chimeras, detect transcripts containing complete proteins, {{provide an overview of}} the transcriptome, and sort putative new or species-specific transcripts. Other valuable features of Full-LengtherNext are the selection of the closest orthologue from a model species, and the extraction of a reference transcriptome that can be further used for RNA-seq studies. Finally, descriptions, GO, InterPro, KEGG and EC codes are added using Sma 3 and AutoFact, and a set of microsatellite markers is obtained with MREPS. The structure of the pipeline has been automatised with AutFlow, a framework developed in our laboratory to automatise repetitive and long tasks, enabling taking decisions (such as which is the better assembly) during the execution without human intervention. This strategy has been already used for assembling several transcriptomes and provide functional characterisation of pollinic tube genes (olive tree), genes related to <b>eye</b> development (<b>sole),</b> resistance to bight (bean) and the comparison of gene family sizes (pine). Moreover, lot of genes have been cloned in pine, sole and olive tree based on the sequences revealed by our pipeline. Universidad de Málaga. Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tech...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{dissertation}} is to examine the concept of “adaptation,” as it was used by the most influential and most radical German playwrights Bertolt Brecht and Heiner Müller in their political theatre. An adaptation proved to be a useful disguise for both German dramatists at times of literary censorships, oppression, harassments and bans of state-directed cultural policies. Both Bertolt Brecht and Heiner Müller went twice through such difficult times, yet in a reversed order: Brecht first experienced the rule of National Socialists and then saw {{the first decade of the}} Socialist regime, while for his inheritor Heiner Müller the days of National Socialism came first and they were soon followed by a Communistic dictatorship in former East Germany. During these periods, instead of writing brand new plots, both dramatists chose to work on different originals of ancient Greek playwrights, or to rework Shakespeare 2 ̆ 7 s dramas. These adaptations provided them with adequate texts and performance scripts to relentlessly express critique of and their opposing ideas to the respective governments, that in their <b>eyes</b> were the <b>sole</b> responsible source of violence (“Staat als Gewalt”). These works would allow them to pass the censor. This study concentrates on one Sophoclean and one Shakespearean adaptation of each playwright, and shows in what ways both Brecht and Müller made the fullest possible use of the theatre machine in their adaptations, displaying how the average citizen was implicated in the horrors of the “fascist” and “socialist” states, in order to break through censorships, to defy the views of the contemporary government and to open the eyes of their readers/audience to the existing socio-political realities (e. g. every day terror, violence, suppression, lack of humanism) of their country. ...|$|R
60|$|Ithuel's gesture was too {{significant}} to escape attention, and every eye followed its direction. The sight {{was of a}} nature not to be mistaken. It at once changed the current of feeling in all who beheld it. There {{was no longer a}} doubt concerning {{the manner in which the}} news of the accident had travelled, or of its effect on the English at Capri. In point of fact, the padrone of the captured felucca, with a <b>sole</b> <b>eye</b> to the recovery of his vessel, had ascended the Scaricatojo, after landing at the Marinella, at its foot, as fast as his legs could carry him; had rather run, than glided, along the narrow lanes of the piano and the hill-side to the beach of Sorrento; had thrown himself into a boat, manned by four lusty Sorrentine watermen--and Europe does not contain lustier or bolder; had gone on board the Terpsichore, and laid his case before Sir Frederick Dashwood, ignorant of the person of the real commanding officer among the three ships. The young baronet, though neither very wise nor very much experienced in his profession, was exceedingly well disposed to seek distinction. It immediately occurred to his mind, that the present was a fitting opportunity to gain laurels. He was second in rank present, and, in virtue of that claim, he fancied that the first could do no more than send him in command of the expedition, which he rightly foresaw Cuffe would order against the French. But there arose a difficulty. As soon as Sir Frederick reported the nature of the intelligence he had received to his senior captain, and his own wish to be employed on the occasion, the rights of Winchester interposed to raise a question. Cuffe was prompt enough in issuing an order for each ship to man and arm two boats, making six in all, and in giving the necessary details, but he lost some precious time in deciding who was to command. This was the cause of delay, and had given rise to certain hopes in Raoul, that facts were subsequently to destroy. In the end, Sir Frederick prevailed, his rank giving him a decided advantage; and the division of boats that was now approaching was under his orders.|$|R
6000|$|I didn't, for two reasons, {{answer your}} {{delightful}} letter, or rather exquisite note, from the Sydney Club, but I must {{thank you for}} it now, before the gulfs have washed you down, or at least have washed away from you all after-tastes of brineless things--the stay-at-home works of lubberly friends. One of the reasons just mentioned was that I had written to you at Sydney (c/o the mystic Towns,) {{only a few days}} before your note arrived; the other is that until a few days ago I hugged the soft illusion that by the time anything else would reach you, you would already have started for England. This fondest of hopes of all of us has been shattered in a manner to which history furnishes a parallel only in the behaviour of its most famous coquettes and courtesans. You are indeed the male Cleopatra or buccaneering Pompadour of the Deep--the wandering Wanton of the Pacific. You swim into our ken with every provocation and prospect--and we have only time to open our arms to receive you when your immortal back is turned to us in the act of still more provoking flight. The moral {{is that we have to}} be virtuous whether we like it or no. Seriously, it was a real heart-break to have September substituted for June; but I have a general faith in the fascinated providence who watches over you, to the neglect of all other human affairs--I believe that even He has an idea that you know what you are about, and even what He is, though He by this time doesn't in the least know himself. Moreover I have selfish grounds of resignation in the fact that I shall be in England in September, whereas, to my almost intolerable torment, I should probably not have been in June. Therefore when you come, if you ever do, which in my heart of hearts I doubt, I shall see you in all your strange exotic bloom, in all your paint and beads and feathers. May you grow a magnificent extra crop of all such things (as they will bring you a fortune here,) in this much grudged extra summer. Charming and delightful to me to see you with a palate for my plain domestic pudding, after all the wild cannibal smacks that you have learned to know. I think the better of the poor little study in the painfully-familiar, since hearing that it could bear such voyages and resist such tests. You have fed a presumption that vaguely stirs within me--that of trying to get at you in June or July with a fearfully long-winded but very highly-finished novel which I am putting forth in (probably) the last days of May. If I were sure it would overtake you on some coral strand I shouldn't hesitate; for, seriously and selfishly speaking, I can't (spiritually) afford not to put the book under the <b>eye</b> of the <b>sole</b> and single Anglo-saxon capable of perceiving--though he may care for little else in it--how well it is written. So I shall probably cast it upon the waters and pray for it; as I suppose you are coming back to Sydney, it may meet you there, and you can read it on the voyage home. In that box you'll have to. I don't say it to bribe you in advance to unnatural tolerance--but I have an impression that I didn't make copious or clear to you in my last what a grand literary life your Master of B. has been leading here. Somehow, a miracle has been wrought for you (for you they are,) and the fine old feather-bed of English taste has thrilled with preternatural recognitions. The most unlikely number of people have discerned that the Master is [...] "well written." [...] It has had the highest success of honour that the English-reading public can now confer; where it has failed (the success, save that it hasn't failed at all!) it has done so through the constitutional incapacity of the umpire--infected, by vulgar intercourses, as with some unnameable disease. We have lost our status--nous n'avons plus qualité--to confer degrees. Nevertheless, last year you woke us up at night, for an hour--and we scrambled down in our shirt and climbed a garden-wall and stole a laurel, which we have been brandishing ever since over your absent head. I tell you this because I think Colvin (at least it was probably he--he is visibly better--or else Mrs. Sitwell) mentioned to me the other day that you had asked in touching virginal ignorance for news of the fate of the book. Its [...] "fate," [...] my dear fellow, has been glittering glory--simply: and I ween--that is I hope--you will find the glitter has chinked as well. I sent you a new Zola the other day--at a venture: but I have no confidence that I gratified a curiosity. I haven't read The Human Beast--one knows him without that--and I am told Zola's account of him is dull and imperfect. I would read anything new about him--but this is old, old, old. I hope your pen, this summer, will cleave the deeps of art even as your prow, or your keel, or whatever's the knowing name for it, furrows the Pacific flood. Into what strange and wondrous dyes you must be now qualified to dip it! Roast yourself, I beseech you, on the sharp spit of perfection, that you may give out your aromas and essences! Tell your wife, please, to read between the lines of this, and between the words and the letters, all that I miss the occasion to write directly to her. I hope she has continued to distil, to your mother, the honey of those impressions of which a few months ago the latter lent me for a day or two a taste--on its long yellow foolscap combs. They would make, they will make, of course, a deliciously sweet book. I hope Lloyd, whom I greet and bless, is living up to the height of his young privilege--and secreting honey too, according to the mild discipline of the hive. There are lots of things more to tell you, no doubt, but if I go on they will all take the shape of questions, and that won't be fair. The supreme thing to say is Don't, oh don't, simply ruin our nerves and our tempers for the rest of life by not throwing the rope in September, to him who will, for once in his life, not muff his catch: ...|$|R
