5000|$|Family Nature Summits are annual gatherings {{that offer}} a mix of {{environmental}} and outdoor education and adventure, with notable environmental and wildlife educators providing classes and activities for adults and children.

The organization's objectives focus on entertaining educational nature programming for youth, teens, and young adults, led by nationally recognized <b>environmental</b> <b>educators</b> such as Steve Houser, recipient of the 2009 Edward C.

50|$|A {{composite}} approach such as arts-based {{environmental education}} inevitably {{always seems to}} fall between two stools: it is neither environmental education proper (because it starts off from an arts- rather than science-based perspective), nor can it convincingly be classified as a subfield of art education, as it moves away from artmaking as primarily a self-referential discipline (“l’art pour l’art”). In fact, {{one could say that}} two rather separate communities of art educators and <b>environmental</b> <b>educators</b> exist, often not understanding (or more often not aware of) each other’s discourse, hence bringing along the problem of incommensurability of the paradigms from which they each approach education.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the current}} trends within {{environmental}} education seeks to move from an approach of ideology and activism to one that allows students {{to make informed decisions}} and take action based on experience as well as data. Within this process, environmental curricula have progressively been integrated into governmental education standards. Some <b>environmental</b> <b>educators</b> find this movement distressing and a move away from the original political and activist approach to environmental education while others find this approach more valid and accessible. Regardless, many educational institutions are encouraging students to {{take an active role in}} environmental education and stewardship at their institutions. They know that [...] "to be successful, greening initiatives require both grassroots support from the student body and top down support from high-level campus administrators." ...|$|E

Week-long Summits have been held most frequently in Colorado, North Carolina, and New York, but also in Wisconsin, California, Maine, Washington, Wyoming, Utah, Canada, Alaska, Hawaii, and other locations. The NWF changed the name to Family Summits in 2000.

50|$|Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine {{celebrated the}} merger in 2008 by {{producing}} The Twelve Dancing Princesses in the Dress-Up Theatre followed by The Seussification of Romeo and Juliet. After many months {{of developing a}} new brand, the new kitetails logo was revealed in April 2009 at the Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine Annual Auction. The Museum & Theatre saw many changes {{over the next few}} months. The DinoTracks exhibit opened in May 2009 in the main gallery, the fifth in a series of science exhibits the Museum & Theatre had been creating since 2006 with the Environmental Exhibits Collaborative (EEC). Shortly afterwards, the rainy month of July 2009 crippled many businesses in Portland but the Museum & Theatre thrived and welcomed over 14,000 visitors. The record number of visitors had a chance to explore the Have a Ball! exhibit, which was given a permanent home in the front gallery. In the drier month of September, Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine held its 4th Annual Golf Tournament at Nonesuch River Golf Course and the Kids on the Block educational puppet program started rehearsals and performances in the Dress-Up Theatre. The 2009-2010 theatre season began with Everyone Knows What a Dragon Looks Like and included The Polar Express at Maine Narrow Gauge Railroad, The Emperor's New Clothes, Cinderella and The Rabbit Who Wanted Red Wings. Today, The Youth Ranger program continues to employ high school students as <b>environmental</b> <b>educators</b> and outreach programs bring the Children’s Museum & Theatre of Maine experience to nearly 2,000 children and caregivers each year.|$|E
5000|$|When in the 1980s new expressionist painting, {{earth and}} {{environmental}} art emerged in society, these “were greeted as {{a breath of}} fresh air by art educators after the threatening images of the 1970s that had failed to empower those who had created them.”. Art students participated in courses on environmental pedagogy and camp schools were organized in “unspoilt” environments such as the Finnish archipelago and Lapland. Pohjakallio lists the following sources of inspiration for the new activities: deep ecology, gestalt therapy, experimental learning theories, and environmental aesthetics. Mantere notes that the ability and experience of Finnish art teachers to work in environmental education through artistic means began to draw the interest of <b>environmental</b> <b>educators</b> in general. What was attractive to them was this insight: “Attitudes and values do not seem to change through teaching that emphasizes scientific facts”. By consequence, she adds, emotional, aesthetic and practical methods became more and more appreciated. What came into focus was the pupil’s own relationship with nature and the environment, which implied a holistic and hermeneutic approach to environmental issues. Pohjakallio adds that in the newly emerging arts-based environmental education, the life-world approach came to stand central. Through that emphasis on the idea that the environment is, first of all, inhabited by persons and not something remote or detached, aspects were taken up that had been mostly neglected in art education’s earlier bearings in formalist and semiotic approaches. Characteristically, the inhabitant’s relationship with the environment was participatory rather than solely informed by focused attention. It involved a two-way influence and identification: ...|$|E
