5|$|<b>General</b> <b>relativity</b> can be {{understood}} by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics.

5|$|<b>General</b> <b>relativity</b> {{includes}} a dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum.

5|$|<b>General</b> <b>relativity</b> is the {{geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. <b>General</b> <b>relativity</b> generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In <b>general</b> <b>relativity,</b> the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E
5|$|If <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> were {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} two pillars of modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid state physics, would be the other.

5|$|Noether {{was brought}} to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her {{expertise}} in invariant theory to help them in understanding <b>general</b> <b>relativity,</b> a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in <b>general</b> <b>relativity,</b> because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for <b>general</b> <b>relativity,</b> but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of forming the <b>general</b> theory of <b>relativity,</b> demands of the {{theoretical}} principle play an important part, and these are regarded as the basis that the <b>general</b> theory of <b>relativity</b> is a relativistic theory of space and time, combined with Einstein's philosophical reference. However, historically speaking, the <b>general</b> theory of <b>relativity</b> was not constructed on some theoretical stipulations in a consistent way, but rather it went through some shifts of them. So by scrutinizing these shifts, we may clarify the actual process of the theory's construction. In this paper, we pay attention to two ideas, "the relativity of inertia" and "Mach's principle," which are not regarded as a theoretical principle of the <b>general</b> theory of <b>relativity</b> nowadays. And {{we will try to}} give an answer to the following questions: (1) why Einstein thought that "Mach's principle" was important as a theoretical principle when the <b>general</b> theory of <b>relativity</b> completed, (2) why he thought "Mach's principle" was related to what Ernst Mach claimed, and (3) what is the idea which was called "the relativity of inertia.

5|$|Since the {{equations}} of <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> are non-linear, {{a lump of}} energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which {{is determined by the}} Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Some {{predictions}} of <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> {{differ significantly from}} those of classical physics, especially concerning the passage of time, the geometry of space, the motion of bodies in free fall, and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include gravitational time dilation, gravitational lensing, the gravitational redshift of light, and the gravitational time delay. The {{predictions of}} <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> have been confirmed in all observations and experiments to date. Although <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> {{is not the only}} relativistic theory of gravity, it is the simplest theory that is consistent with experimental data. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how <b>general</b> <b>relativity</b> can be reconciled with the laws of quantum physics to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

50|$|Under special relativity's {{simplified}} model Einstein {{assumes that}} light-dragging effects do not occur, {{and that the}} speed of light is independent of the speed of the emitting body's motion. However, the special theory of relativity does not deal with particulate matter effects or gravitational effects, nor does it provide a complete relativistic description of acceleration.
