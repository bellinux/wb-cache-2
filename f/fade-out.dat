5|$|Lonnie is {{repelled}} by his uncle's treatment of Homer and Alma {{and leaves the}} ranch after his grandfather's funeral, uncertain if he will ever return. When he tells Hud to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, his uncle replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did. Hud {{goes back into the}} Bannon house alone; as he closes the door, the final <b>fade-out</b> is the window shade's pull-ring swaying.|$|E
25|$|The song closes with Harrison {{playing an}} {{arpeggio}} {{of the opening}} chord (Fadd9) during the <b>fade-out.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{changes would}} be a redesigned, more {{integrated}} sunshade and spoiler on the rear hatch. The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The L-types of this year were not available with a leather interior, but P-types were. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and <b>fade-out</b> system.|$|E
5000|$|The Sire Records (US) {{version of}} On {{contains}} only [...] "On", [...] "73-Yips", and [...] "Xepha" [...] with early <b>fade-outs,</b> {{followed by the}} Reload Mix of [...] "On", and it is housed in an Ecopak case instead of the standard slimline jewel {{case in which the}} Warp (UK) release was packaged.|$|R
25|$|When {{music is}} {{broadcast}} over radio, the station applies its own signal processing, further reducing the dynamic {{range of the}} material to closely match levels of absolute amplitude, regardless of the original recording's loudness. This technique is also used as a security feature to prevent quiet passages or <b>fade-outs</b> from becoming dead air.|$|R
5000|$|Jonathan {{describes}} his music as [...] "Rock and Soul 45s of the 1950s and 1960s" [...] Despite the era's tendency for music to have long <b>fade-outs,</b> Toubin aggressively beat-matches his 45s without {{the assistance of}} ubiquitous DJ software such as Serato {{in order to maintain}} the energy level of his music sets.|$|R
500|$|John Lennon's [...] "Hey Bulldog" [...] was {{recorded}} on 11 February 1968 and evolved from an initial intent {{to shoot a}} promotional film for the single [...] "Lady Madonna". Like [...] "All Together Now", it was specifically recorded with the film soundtrack in mind. The track's ending featured a jam session after the point where a <b>fade-out</b> was intended in the final mix, which was kept in the finished version. Lennon later described the song as [...] "a good-sounding record that means nothing".|$|E
500|$|... "Hey Jude" [...] {{is a song}} by the English {{rock band}} the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and {{credited}} to Lennon–McCartney. The ballad evolved from [...] "Hey Jules", a song McCartney wrote to comfort John Lennon's son, Julian, during his parents' divorce. [...] "Hey Jude" [...] begins with a verse-bridge structure incorporating McCartney's vocal performance and piano accompaniment; further instrumentation is added as the song progresses. After the fourth verse, the song shifts to a <b>fade-out</b> coda that lasts {{for more than four}} minutes.|$|E
500|$|Pollack {{views the}} song's outro as partly a reprise of the {{introduction}} and partly a departure {{in the form}} of [...] "a one-two-three-go! style of <b>fade-out</b> ending". On the Beatles' recording, the group vocals over this section include Indian-style gamaks (performed by McCartney) on the word [...] "time", creating a melisma effect that is also present on Harrison's Revolver track [...] "Love You To" [...] and on Lennon's [...] "Rain". Further to Harrison's drawn-out phrasing over the first line of the verses, this detail demonstrates the composition's subtle Indian influence.|$|E
40|$|A {{documentary}} on the life and work of American film-maker D. W. Griffith, who pioneered {{the use of such}} film techniques as close ups, cuts, cross-cuts, fade-ins, <b>fade-outs,</b> and moving the camera. Includes clips from: The birth of a nation, Intolerance, Orphans of the storm, Way down East, and other Griffith films. Narrator, Bill Bixb...|$|R
5000|$|Cacophonous {{feedback}} <b>fade-outs</b> {{ending a}} song {{are most often}} used to generate rather than relieve tension, often cross-faded too after a thematic and musical release. Examples include Modwheelmood's remix of Nine Inch Nail's [...] "The Great Destroyer"; and the Jesus and Mary Chain's [...] "Teenage Lust", [...] "Tumbledown", [...] "Catchfire", [...] "Sundown", and [...] "Frequency".|$|R
50|$|The SOLar RADiation {{satellite}} program (SOLRAD) {{was conceived}} {{in the late}} 1950s to study the Sun's effects on Earth, particularly during periods of heightened solar activity. Solrad 1 is launched on June 22, 1960, aboard a Thor Able from Cape Canaveral at 1:54 a.m. EDT. As the world's first orbiting astronomical observatory, Solrad 1 determined that radio <b>fade-outs</b> were caused by solar X-ray emissions.|$|R
500|$|Covay's vocal is {{described}} as [...] "impassioned" [...] and [...] "assured". Music historian Peter Guralnick notes that the guitar part [...] "established a new guitar dominated soul sound". [...] It plays a prominent role, beginning with the chorded lead-in, which music writer Keith Shadwick describes as [...] "rhythmic patterns that are tasteful modifications of the motifs favored by Curtis Mayfield and Jimmy Johnson – {{and there have been}} suggestions that it is Johnson himself on the record". [...] Covay recalled that the song was recorded in one or two takes and additional single-note fills at the <b>fade-out</b> suggest a second guitarist or an overdub.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy IV OSV {{was well}} received; reviewers have praised {{the quality of}} the {{composition}} despite the limited medium. Soundtrack Central compared it favorably with Uematsu's later works, especially the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI, and termed it a [...] "great CD". However, the length of several tracks {{as well as of the}} album as a whole was criticized, with reviewers finding it [...] "too short" [...] and disapproving of the early <b>fade-out</b> of some tracks. [...] Reviewers found the expanded and remastered version found in the Finest Box to be comparable to {{the quality of the}} original album, with some tracks improving in their remake, becoming [...] "deeper" [...] or [...] "sharper" [...] as was appropriate.|$|E
500|$|Holst {{made some}} recordings, {{conducting}} his own music. For the Columbia company he recorded Beni Mora, the Marching Song and the complete Planets with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in 1922, using the acoustic process. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual <b>fade-out</b> of women's voices {{at the end}} of [...] "Neptune", and the lower strings had {{to be replaced by a}} tuba to obtain an effective bass sound. With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the St Paul's Suite and Country Song in 1925. Columbia's main rival, HMV, issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by Albert Coates. When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded The Planets for Columbia in 1926.|$|E
50|$|Melbourne did {{not reach}} the playoffs in its first four seasons in the AIHL. Its first two seasons were {{coloured}} by several crushing defeats; its second season combined a strong, low scoring home record with a poor away record, again containing many big losses. However, in 2005, the Ice were competitive almost every week, both home and away, finishing 5 points out of the playoffs, and left rueing several third period <b>fade-outs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The album {{represents}} the diverging {{interests of the}} two remaining members of the original group, Anne Dudley and J.J. Jeczalik. Dudley's influence {{is evident in the}} album's ambient interludes of melodic, orchestral pieces, while Jeczalik's influence can be heard in the album's dub tracks and harder, rock-edged pieces. The latter songs also feature arrangements more typical of the band's earlier material, utilising sampling techniques, lengthy <b>fade-outs,</b> a diverse mixture of classical instruments, guitar riffs and percussion typical of industrial music.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{detecting}} shot boundaries in video sequences using metrics {{based on information}} theory is proposed. The method relies on the mutual information and the joint entropy between frames and can detect cuts, fade-ins and <b>fade-outs.</b> The detection technique was tested on TV video sequences having different types of shots and significant object and camera motion inside the shots. It was favorably compared to other recently proposed shot cut detection techniques. The method is proven to detect both fades and abrupt cuts very effectively...|$|R
500|$|Bridget Daley of Hollyscoop was {{impressed}} with the song saying, [...] "It’s super beat, and now we understand what RedOne meant when he told Hollyscoop how much we were going to love Nicole’s 'new' sound!" [...] However, Becky Bain of Idolator thought the [...] "pulsating dance song" [...] was underwhelming. [...] "We have to admit, we’re not bowled over by this one, which pretty much follows a standard, predictable dance-pop formula from the double shout-out at the start to the 'woosh'ing <b>fade-out</b> finish". However Bain also pointed out that current trends on the US Billboard Hot 100 were unpredictable, [...] "then again, since when has the Hot 100 shyed away from generic pop tunes we’ve heard over and over again? This one could go either way, folks." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Fearless" [...] employs field {{recordings}} of the Liverpool F.C. Kop choir singing [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", their anthem, which brings the song {{to an end in}} a heavily reverberated <b>fade-out.</b> [...] "San Tropez", by contrast, is a jazz-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo, composed by Waters in his increasingly deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. The song was inspired by the band's trip to the south of France in 1970. Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed their sense of humour with [...] "Seamus", a pseudo-blues novelty track featuring Steve Marriott's dog (which Gilmour was looking after) howling along to the music. [...] "Seamus" [...] often tops polls as the worst song Pink Floyd ever created, but the band would later use animal sounds again, in Animals.|$|E
500|$|Writing in {{the late}} 1970s, Nicholas Schaffner noted the song's [...] "towering simplicity" [...] and the [...] "endlessly {{repetitive}} <b>fade-out</b> that somehow manages to be hypnotic instead of boring". Like Leng and Schaffner, a number of commentators have remarked on the significance of [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] {{in the context of}} the Beatles' demise, starting with the song's length: 7:10 – just a second under [...] "Hey Jude". Ben Gerson, in his 1971 Rolling Stone review, described the song as a [...] "lament... whose beginning is the broken thirds of John's 'I Am the Walrus' and whose end is the decadent, exultant last half of Paul's 'Hey Jude'". Peter Doggett considers [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] a [...] "remarkably non-judgemental commentary on the disintegration of the Beatles' spirit".|$|E
5000|$|These Humble Machines is a {{compilation}} album by American electronic musician BT, composed of edited versions of songs from his album These Hopeful Machines. Released on April 26, 2011, {{the album was}} released {{with the intention of}} making the album more accessible for newer listeners while still displaying the same technical prowess found in its predecessor. The album features some radio edits ("Suddenly", [...] "Always") while also liberally using splice editing and <b>fade-outs</b> to edit down songs ("The Emergency", [...] "Every Other Way", [...] "Le nocturne de lumière").|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the songs}} on Let It Be... Naked differ {{significantly}} from the original versions on Let It Be. Firstly, {{they are in a}} different running order than the original LP. Secondly, none of Phil Spector's orchestral and choral overdubs were included, and his mixes were not used. Additionally, all lead vocals and drums are now placed {{in the middle of the}} stereo picture, giving the album a more modernised sound and feel. Finally, all studio and rooftop dialogue from the original album was removed, resulting in a number of sharp <b>fade-outs</b> where dialogue had been previously audible.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on CD in two editions, which are significantly different. The first edition, with the [...] "glam" [...] cover (illustrated in this article) had the original song order reshuffled, with poorly done <b>fade-outs</b> and fade-ins. This edition also came with a second section, a reunion show with (at least) Stiv Bators and Cheetah Chrome present, from 1987. This edition also had extensive liner notes detailing Bators' trick of singing off-mike, and claims he re-recorded the entire album in one take, from memory, while drunk and in the booth with two groupies - in other words, typical Stiv.|$|R
500|$|Rhodes {{came up with}} an {{idea for}} the backing track in the car while he was going to the studio. He started playing with the Roland Jupiter 8 keyboard, while singer Simon Le Bon was working with the lyrics. The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Little Red Riding Hood, and the repeating of the word [...] "do" [...] {{at the end of each}} verse takes its melody from the instrumentals in Gordon Lightfoot's song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind". Andy Taylor worked out a Marc Bolan-ish guitar part, a very Marshall-sounding Les Paul guitar lick that was added to the track. Then the bass and drums were added, and the whole track was finished that day, including Le Bon's vocal melody and lyrics. The laugh at the beginning of the song and the screams during the song's <b>fade-out</b> were performed and recorded live by Rhodes' girlfriend at the time.|$|E
500|$|Now {{in the key}} of G (two semitones {{down from}} the Get Back performance), [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] begins [...] "dirge"-like with a two-note pedal point {{provided}} by layers of keyboards and acoustic guitars. Only at the one-minute mark, {{at the start of}} verse two, does the rhythm section come in, after which the instruments begin to [...] "break out of their metronomic straitjacket to attain an almost ecstatic release", as Beatles Forever author Nicholas Schaffner put it in 1977. The [...] "balmy" [...] slide guitar passage, supported by Barham's string section, follows this second verse, and from that point on – around 2:38 – the same, circular chord structure continues for the remaining four-and-a-half minutes of the song. The long <b>fade-out</b> sees what Schaffner termed the [...] "pseudo-symphonic tension" [...] burst into a frenzy of brass and timpani, further bottleneck soloing, and the [...] "What a pity" [...] mantra joined by [...] "Hey Jude"-style [...] "Na-na-na-na" [...] chorus.|$|E
500|$|... "Good Morning Good Morning" [...] was {{inspired}} by a television commercial for Kellogg's Corn Flakes, from which Lennon adapted a jingle as the song's refrain. The track utilises the bluesy mixolydian mode in A, which Everett credits with [...] "perfectly express Lennon's grievance against complacency". Lennon regarded the song as [...] "a throwaway piece of garbage", and McCartney viewed it as Lennon's reaction to the frustrations of domestic life. Womack praises the song's varied time signatures, including 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, calling it a [...] "masterpiece of electrical energy". MacDonald notes Starr's [...] "fine performance" [...] and McCartney's [...] "coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo", which he credits with delivering the track's climax. A series of animal noises are heard during the <b>fade-out</b> that are sequenced – at Lennon's request – so that each successive animal is large enough to devour the preceding one. Martin spliced the sound of a chicken clucking {{at the end of the}} track to overlap with a guitar being tuned in the next one, making a seamless transition between the two songs.|$|E
5000|$|Within just a {{few days}} prior to the {{construction}} permit's deadline date to start broadcasting, WHJM [...] "Radio Maria" [...] first came on the air on June 15, 2006. Its transmitting antenna and tower was abruptly struck by a spectacular display of lightning only after two hours on the air during its inaugural sign-on. However, the brief airtime before the lightning strike was enough to fulfill the FCC deadline. After necessary repairs were made, WHJM returned to the air August 11, 2006. Its current operating power is 1,000 watts ERP. WHJM's current signal <b>fades-out</b> north of Lima at Beaverdam where CIMX in Windsor, Ontario begins to fade-in north towards Findlay.|$|R
500|$|At the 1984 Billboard Music Awards, [...] "Borderline" [...] {{received}} two nominations, in {{the categories of}} Best New Artist and Best Choreography in a Music Video, but did not win either. In September 2014, the song was placed at number two on Rolling Stones list of [...] "100 Best Singles of 1984". Carrie Grant from the magazine described the track as a [...] "melodic synth-a-palooza with the plunky low end", and also noting that Madonna's vocals were restrained on the song, but sounded emotional. [...] "The radio remix, which trims nearly three minutes from the tune, boasts one of Madge's most iconic <b>fade-outs,</b> standing by as she [...] "la la la"s into the void." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{beginning}} of the music video shows Bolton performing the selection whilst he is sitting in his living room, and small bits of story about his and his girlfriend's relationship are told through <b>fade-outs.</b> As {{he is about to}} leave the apartment, already having packed his suitcases, he thinks of her and the time they spent together and seemingly decides against the decision; he then cuddles with his girlfriend. It is revealed, the next night, that he plans to give her a bracelet, which he quickly hides as he reads a newspaper before she enters the room. She surprises him with breakfast and they cuddle again. Later on, the two have a fight about something and she storms out of the apartment, and Bolton visibly feels guilty.|$|R
500|$|... "Phantom Lord" [...] is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song {{begins with}} {{synthesized}} bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. [...] "No Remorse" [...] is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo {{in the fifth}} minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] was inspired by Diamond Head's [...] "Dead Reckoning" [...] and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. [...] "Metal Militia", {{one of the fastest}} songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity. Mustaine composed the main riff, which emulates a marching army. The song ends with tramping feet and bullet ricochet in a <b>fade-out.</b>|$|E
500|$|Among {{more recent}} commentators, Alan Pollack admires [...] "Hey Jude" [...] as [...] "such a good {{illustration}} of two compositional lessons – {{how to fill}} a large canvas with simple means, {{and how to use}} diverse elements such as harmony, bassline, and orchestration to articulate form and contrast." [...] Pollack considers that the song's long coda provides [...] "an astonishingly transcendental effect", while AllMusic's Richie Unterberger similarly opines: [...] "What could have very easily been boring is instead hypnotic because McCartney varies the vocal with some of the greatest nonsense scatting ever heard in rock …" [...] In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald wrote that the [...] "pseudo-soul shrieking in the <b>fade-out</b> may be a blemish" [...] but he praised the song as [...] "a pop/rock hybrid drawing on the best of both idioms". MacDonald concluded: [...] "'Hey Jude' strikes a universal note, touching on an archetypal moment in male sexual psychology with a gentle wisdom one might properly call inspired." [...] Lennon said the song was [...] "one of [...] masterpieces".|$|E
500|$|Christian imagery appears {{throughout}} the film. In {{addition to the}} scenes of the Monster trussed in a cruciform pose and the crucified figure of Jesus in the graveyard, the hermit has a crucifix {{on the wall of}} his hut – which, to Whale's consternation, editor Ted Kent made glow during a <b>fade-out</b> – and the Monster consumes the Christian sacraments of bread and wine at his [...] "last supper" [...] with the hermit. Horror scholar David J. Skal suggests that Whale's intention was to make a [...] "direct comparison of Frankenstein's monster to Christ". Film scholar Scott MacQueen, noting Whale's lack of any religious convictions, disputes the notion that the Monster is a Christ-figure. Rather, the Monster is a [...] "mockery of the divine" [...] since, having been created by Man rather than God, it [...] "lacks the divine spark". In crucifying the Monster, he says, Whale [...] "pushes the audience's buttons" [...] by inverting the central Christian belief of the death of Christ followed by the resurrection. The Monster is raised from the dead first, then crucified.|$|E
50|$|The songs {{have all}} been {{digitally}} remastered and also remixed from the original master tapes. The quality of the sound is much clearer than any collection before, however, the mixes can sound drastically different from the original versions, especially the songs recorded between 1964 and 1969. Having used the original elements from the original masters, the mixers were able to attain new recordings, with much clearer sounds, heavier bass and noticeably higher volume levels of the background vocals. Another peculiarity about several songs on this album {{is that they are}} longer than the original versions. The vocals and instrumentations are let go on until the musicians stopped playing and the girls finished singing, without <b>fade-outs.</b> These had never been heard before being issued on this album.|$|R
50|$|The video {{opens with}} an old woman {{stroking}} her dog; she then comes upon some passers-by and Peter Kingsbery enters the recording studio. As Kingsbery starts singing, people mill around {{the entrance to the}} studio {{and other members of the}} band also arrive inside and set up the instruments, with Anna LaCazio joining Kingsbery singing. As a fruit stand is knocked over outside, the last band member goes into the studio. In no time all the instruments are in place. Most of the video is made up of <b>fade-outs,</b> alternating the scenes inside the studio showing the band with images of the members of the public outside the studio entrance. The clip ends with pictures of Kingsbery and Anna LaCazio leaving the studio together.|$|R
5000|$|Children of God was re-issued {{along with}} the World of Skin {{compilation}} (minus the covers) on CD in 1997 as Children of God/World of Skin. On this re-release, the original album version of [...] "Our Love Lies" [...] was replaced with the version included on the Love Will Tear Us Apart EP. Also, the re-release added [...] "Damn You to Hell" [...] and [...] "I'll Swallow You" [...] (under one title as [...] "I'll Swallow You") from the New Mind single as a bonus. Also, [...] "Sex, God, Sex", [...] "Beautiful Child" [...] and [...] "Children of God" [...] were shortened by several seconds with earlier <b>fade-outs</b> and [...] "Trust Me" [...] faded directly into the brief interlude at the end.|$|R
