40|$|Rapid {{flocculation}} and sedimentation of {{suspended particles}} in primary cane sugar juice is achieved using a {{high molecular weight}} anionic polymer flocculant. This work reports on efforts to enhance the performance of an anionic flocculant {{by the addition of}} cationic polymers. Homopolymers of poly(trimethylammonium <b>ethyl</b> methacrylate <b>chloride)</b> (TMAEMAC) and cationic copolymers of poly(trimethylammonium <b>ethyl</b> acrylate <b>chloride)</b> (TMAEAC) and acrylamide were synthesized and their performance, to enhance the flocculation and sedimentation of cane sugar juice particles, was evaluated by turbidity and settling rate measurements. The charge-patch mechanism best explains the performance of the homopolymers, whereas the action of the copolymers is attributed to the bridging mechanism. The results of this work indicate that the copolymers are more effective than the homopolymers to aid flocculation and sedimentation of the cane sugar juice particles, and that the best-performing polymers are those that act by the bridging mechanism. Addition of increased amounts of anionic flocculant did not confer an improvement, suggesting that the cationic bridging flocculant targets a different population of particles that is largely responsible for the residual turbidity...|$|R

2500|$|A major {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of ethane are the forcing conditions required for its use, which can be attributed to its lack of molecular functionality. In contrast to ethylene, which easily undergoes chlorine addition, ethane must first be functionalized by substitution reactions, which gives rise to a variety of consecutive and side-chain reactions. The reaction must, therefore, be kinetically controlled in order to obtain a maximal vinyl chloride yield. Vinyl chloride yields average 20–50% per pass. Ethylene, <b>ethyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> and 1,2-dichloroethane are obtained as major byproducts.

AbstractGuanidyl {{moieties}} of both arginine (Arg) and Nα-benzoyl-l-argininate <b>ethyl</b> ester <b>chloride</b> (BAEE) are protonated in all environments studied, i. e., {{dry solid}} state, D 2 O solutions, and dry and hydrated lipids {{as suggested by}} DFT(B 3 LYP) / 6 - 31 +G(d,p) calculations. Arg and BAEE are able to insert in the lipid interphase of both DMPC and DOPC monolayers as revealed by the observed decrease in the membrane dipole potential they induce. The larger decrease in the dipole potential induced by BAEE, compared to Arg, can be explained partially by the higher affinity of the hydrophobic benzoyl and ethyl groups for the membrane phase, which allows an easier insertion of this molecule. FTIR studies indicate that the guanidyl moiety of Arg is with all probability facing the hydrophobic part of the lipids, whereas in BAEE this group is facing the water phase. Zeta potential measurements provide a direct evidence that Arg orients in the lipid interphase of phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers with the negative charged carboxylate group (−COO−) toward the aqueous phase...|$|R
