40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} a statistically-based Fourier-Voronoi approach recently proposed by the authors to generate packing of granular particles with key characteristics reproduced from real sands. The key sand properties identified in this approach include the grain size distribution, density, particle orientation and the shape characteristics. Four important shape factors are chosen to characterize {{the shape of a}} particle, including elongation, circularity, roundness and regularity. To generate a packing of particles, a 2 D container of arbitrary shape is discretised by a Voronoi tessellation with prescribed cell size and orientation distributions. Each of the Voronoi cells is then filled by a particle with the prescribed shape characteristics. The proposed method is shown to be capable of realistically reproducing a variety of <b>granular</b> <b>sands</b> based on available experimental data. This method is further generalized to reproduce 3 D sand shapes based on the Fourier descriptor concept, with demonstrative examples on two sands (Michigan Beach sand and Ottawa sand). The proposed methods provide a rational and systematic way to reconstruct real sand particles for discrete modelling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Granular</b> <b>sands</b> are {{characterized}} and modeled here by explicitly exploiting the discrete-continuum duality of granular matter. Grain-scale kinematics, obtained by shearing a sample under triaxial compression, are {{coupled with a}} recently proposed multiscale computational framework to model {{the behavior of the}} material without resorting to phenomenological evolution (hardening) laws. By doing this, complex material behavior is captured by extracting the evolution of key properties directly from the grain-scale mechanics and injecting it into a continuum description (e. g., elastoplasticity). The effectiveness of the method is showcased by two examples: one linking discrete element computations with finite elements and another example linking a triaxial compression experiment using computed tomography and digital image correlation with finite element computation. In both cases, dilatancy and friction are used as the fundamental plastic variables and are obtained directly from the grain kinematics. In the case of the result linked to the experiment, the onset and evolution of a persistent shear band is modeled, showing for the first time three-dimensional multiscale results in the post-bifurcation regime with real materials and good quantitative agreement with experiments.

40|$|Loose <b>granular</b> <b>sand</b> {{deposits}} formed {{during the}} land reclamation process {{are vulnerable to}} liquefaction upon imparting seismic forces. These loose <b>granular</b> <b>sand</b> fills could encounter bearing failures or compress beyond tolerable limits under static and dynamic loads. In order to eliminate such failures, loose granular soils require densification to enhance their engineering properties. Deep compaction is the only means to improve these thick deposits of loose sandfill in many foreshore land reclamation projects. Muller Resonance Compaction (MRC) and vibroflotation are deep vibratory compaction techniques, which are suitable to densify thick layers of loose granular fills. This paper describes the applications of deep compaction vibratory techniques in a mega-land reclamation project in the Republic of Singapore where the efficacy of densification was verified by Cone Penetration Tests (CPT) undertaken in a Pilot Test Area. The top sand layer of about 1. 5 to 6. 0 meters is in the medium to dense state and dilates during shear. In the MRC technique, high vibrating energies are used, which results in the whole mass of soil being rearranged, but a weak point was found {{at the location of}} the probing point. In vibroflotation, the densified column of soil was found to form at and surrounding the probe point and the density of the granular soil reduced with distance from the probe point. The aging effect in vibroflotation was found to be significant. vibroflotation was found to have several advantages compared to the MRC technique. Due to the excess water in the pore spaces caused by the high pressure jetting in vibroflotation, the water pressure dissipation further enhances the densification due to the aging effect...|$|E

This paper presents a set of simplified design charts and procedures to determine the densification achievable during ground improvement of sands and non-plastic silty sands using DC supplemented with pre-installed wick drains. The methodology is based on a model for performance of soil deposits during dynamic compaction using energy principles governing soil liquefaction and soil densification by consolidation.

50|$|In {{soft ground}} with very high water {{pressure}} or where ground conditions are <b>granular</b> (<b>sands</b> and gravels) {{so much so}} that a plug could not be formed in the Archimedes screw, Slurry Shield TBMs are needed. The cutterhead is filled with pressurised slurry which applies hydrostatic pressure to the excavation face. The slurry also acts as a transport medium by mixing with the excavated material before being pumped out of the cutterhead back to a slurry separation plant, usually outside of the tunnel. Slurry separation plants are multi-stage filtration systems, which remove particles of spoil from the slurry so that it may be reused in the construction process. The limit to which slurry can be 'cleaned' depends on the particle size of the excavated material. For this reason, slurry TBMs are not suitable for silts and clays as the particle sizes of the spoil are less than that of the bentonite clay from which the slurry is made. In this case, the slurry is separated into water, which can be recycled and a clay cake, which may be polluted, is pressed from the water.|$|R

40|$|Fluidized {{beds are}} formed inside {{containers}} where {{the flow of}} fluid {{from the bottom of}} the container causes solid particles to be suspended in the fluid due to friction. As the terminal velocity increases the solid phase eventually gets fluidized and starts to behave in a more fluid-like manner. Typical industrial applications of fluidized beds range from energy production to the chemical industry. Fluidized bed combustion (FBC) has proved to be an efficient and low emission technology due to its intensely turbulent mixing of the solid and fluid phases. Further insights into this complex process are the topic of much currect research.

40|$|The {{field of}} shock physics {{as a whole}} has only {{recently}} begun to pay particular attention to modeling heterogeneous materials under shock loading. These materials are important because of their practicality in terms of creating stronger, more shock resistant materials. To understand why they absorb shock impact energy better than homogeneous materials means that the small-scale processes that occur during the shock loading of these heterogeneous materials needs to be understood. Recent computational experiments, called mesoscale simulations, have shown that explicitly incorporating small-scale heterogeneous features into hydrocode simulations allows the bulk shock response of the heterogeneous material to be observed while not requiring the use of empirically determined constitutive equations. Including these features in simulations can offer insights into the irreversible mechanisms that dominate the propagation of shock waves in heterogeneous materials.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiscale modeling framework for granular media {{based on a}} hierarchical cross-scale approach. The overall material is treated as a continuum on the macroscale and the corresponding boundary value problem is solved by finite element method (FEM). At each Gauss point of the FEM mesh, a discrete element assembly is embedded from which the material behavior is obtained for the global FEM computation. It is demonstrated that this technique may capture the salient macroscopic behavior of granular media in a natural manner, and meanwhile helps to bypass the conventional phenomenological nature of continuum modeling approaches. Moreover, the framework provides us with rich information on the particle level which can be closely correlated to the macroscopic material response and hence helps to shed lights on the cross-scaling understanding of granular media. Specific linkages between the microscopic origins and mechanisms and the macroscopic responses can be conveniently developed.

One of the main features of our network is that pore throats can be oriented in 13 different directions, allowing a maximum coordination number of 26 that is possible in a regular lattice in 3 D space. The coordination number of pore bodies ranges from 0 to 26, with a pre-specified average value for the whole network. We have applied this method to reconstruct real sandstone and <b>granular</b> <b>sand</b> samples through utilizing information on their coordination number distributions. Good agreement was found between simulation results and observation data on coordination number distribution and other network properties, such as number of pore bodies and pore throats and average coor-dination number.

The objective of this work {{is to develop a}} fundamental understanding of the formation and transmission of dynamic force chains, and the motion and fracture of the individual sand grains as the projectile passes. This is accomplished by launching a projectile along a view window, backed by sand, in order to directly view and photograph the projectile/sand interactions. Within the sand system, a two-wave structure was observed, composed of a compaction wave (bow shock) that detaches from the dart and moves through the sand at a wave speed near 100 m/s and a damage wave, which remains near {{the leading edge of the}} dart. The compaction wave removes porosity and the damage wave fractures grains in the region near the projectile nose. Grain fracture is not observed at dart speeds below 35 m/s. In addition the axial strain to failure of individual sand grains was measured in a quasi-static configuration. These results were used in conjunction with a simple analytic force balance model to predict the depth of penetration.

40|$|Fabric and its {{evolution}} need to {{be fully}} considered for effective modeling of the anisotropic behavior of cohesionless <b>granular</b> <b>sand.</b> In this study, a three-dimensional anisotropic model for granular material is proposed based on the anisotropic critical state theory recently proposed by Li & Dafalias [2012], in which the role of fabric evolution is highlighted. An explicit expression for the yield function is proposed {{in terms of the}} invariants and joint invariants of the normalized deviatoric stress ratio tensor and the deviatoric fabric tensor. A void-based fabric tensor that characterizes the average void size and its orientation of a granular assembly is employed in the model. Upon plastic loading, the material fabric is assumed to evolve continuously with its principal direction tending steadily towards the loading direction. A fabric evolution law is proposed to describe this behavior. With these considerations, a non-coaxial flow rule is naturally obtained. The model is shown to be capable of characterizing the complex anisotropic behavior of granular materials under monotonic loading conditions and meanwhile retains a relatively simple formulation for numerical implementation. The model predictions of typical behavior of both Toyoura sand and Fraser River sand compare well with experimental data. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A strong {{influence}} of microbial mats on {{the physics of}} Neoproterozoic sedimentation is explored within a 60 m-thick stratigraphic interval within the Sonia Sandstone, Jodhpur Group, western India. This marine interval is bounded by two terrestrial units, its base being marked by a transgressive lag and the top by an unconformity. Progradation from upper neritic, above fair-weather wave base to supralittoral settings was later terminated by a transgression; deposits of lower shoreface-upper shoreface transition thus overlie supralittoral aeolian sandstones, the basal contact of the former deposits being marked by another transgressive lag. A wide spectrum and abundant examples of microbial mat or mat-derived structures supports unusual cohesiveness within <b>granular</b> <b>sand</b> deposited in a high-energy marine environment. The cohesiveness is manifested in abundant preservation of several delicate primary structures and also in their replication in overlying beds, even after they were subjected to high-energy currents. A low rate of sedimentation and severely restricted sediment reworking resulted from prolific mat growth, and consequent depletion in the sediment budget was manifested in bedform migration and evolution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the influence of the silica sand grains on pressure during the energy release in a HBC fuse. During the HBC fuse operation, the pressure evolution is the result of two opposite trends: the pressure increase due to the interaction of the silica plasma with the surrounding <b>granular</b> <b>sand,</b> and the pressure decrease due to the propagation of the pressure waves toward the porous medium. Due to the complex phenomena occuring during the current extinction by a fuse, two kinds of pressure are distinguished: the pressure inside the silica plasma and the pressure in silica sand. From the simulations, we show that the Forchheimer flow resistance is stronger than the Darcy flow resistance once the electric power is over 30 % of the maximum value. A comparison of the calculated and measured pressures is made at various positions from the fuse element axis. Two different pressures are obtained experimentally: the pressure exerted on the sand grains due to the plasma pressure and the pressure of the gas flowing through the interstices of the silica sand. We show that the experimentally and calculated trends are similar and they both depend on the electric power level and the silica sand mean granulometry. The maximum pressures are observed at the same time as the maximum electric power levels...|$|E

Using simple self-assembled monolayer (SAM) techniques, a silica substrate was modified as an adsorbent and tested for its potential for reduction of water quality parameters such as UV absorbance, colour and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Silica particles that were coated with an amino-siloxane SAM (NH 2 -SAM) were evaluated in both a high surface area powder form and also a more realistic <b>granular</b> <b>sand</b> form. Initial results using direct stirred contact with powdered NH 2 -SAM showed promising results with 60 % reduction of UV 254 after 1 h and up to 70 % removal of DOC with higher doses and contact times. NH 2 -SAM powder removed NOM in a broader and less selective molecular weight (MW) range than coagulation treatment and this removal was enhanced by pH control at 6, especially for medium MW components. When NH 2 -SAM sand was applied, the significantly reduced effective surface area resulted in lower DOC removal but colour removal was still considerable for realistic treatment plant contact times. Attempted regeneration with acidic solutions showed greater effectiveness at lower applied pH, however recovery of adsorption capacity reduced with successive adsorption/regeneration cycles highlighting the need for further refinement of operating conditions for more effective application of this relatively simple water treatment technology.

Macroscopic plastic deformation is obtained by considering local plastic sliding in a limit number of families of contact planes.
