5|$|He {{was arrested}} on 10 October 1990 on charges {{relating}} to kidnapping and <b>extortion.</b> The charges alleged an <b>extortion</b> scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, {{he was elected to}} the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which fast-track trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.|$|E

5|$|On 3 June 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged Van der Sloot with <b>extortion</b> {{and wire}} fraud. U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance issued {{an arrest warrant}} through Interpol to have Van der Sloot prosecuted in the United States. On 4 June, {{at the request of}} the U.S. Justice Department, Dutch {{authorities}} raided and confiscated items from two homes in the Netherlands, one of them belonging to reporter Jaap Amesz, who had previously interviewed Van der Sloot and claimed knowledge of his criminal activities. Aruban investigators used information gathered from the <b>extortion</b> case to launch a new search at a beach, but no new evidence was found. Aruba's Solicitor-General said they would not seek Van der Sloot's extradition to Aruba. On 30 June, a federal grand jury formally indicted Van der Sloot of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court seeks the forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to Van der Sloot.|$|E
5|$|Ransomware {{is a type}} of {{malicious}} software from cryptovirology that threatens to publish the victim's data or perpetually block access to it unless a ransom is paid. While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral <b>extortion,</b> in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral <b>extortion</b> attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem – and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash and Bitcoin are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Recent Ransomware attack in 2017 has caused a stir in the world as the attack caused many of the internet connected devices to not work and companies spent a large amount to recover from these attacks.|$|E

40|$|Repeated {{game theory}} {{has been one of}} the most {{prevailing}} tools for understanding the long-run relationships, which are footstones in building human society. Recent works have revealed a new set of "zero-determinant (ZD) " strategies, which is an important advance in repeated games. A ZD strategy player can exert a unilaterally control on two players' payoffs. In particular he can deterministically set the opponent's payoff, or enforce an unfair linear relationship between the players' payoffs, thereby always seizing an advantageous share of payoffs. One of the limitations of the original ZD strategy, however, is that it does not capture the notion of robustness when the game is subjected to stochastic errors. In this paper, we propose a general model of ZD strategies for noisy repeated games, and find that ZD strategies have high robustness against errors. We further derive the pinning strategy under noise, by which the ZD strategy player coercively set the opponent's expected payoff to his desired level, although his payoff control ability declines with the increase of noise strength. Due to the uncertainty caused by noise, the ZD strategy player cannot secure his payoff to be higher than the opponent's, which implies strong <b>extortions</b> do not exist even under low noise. While we show that the ZD strategy player can still establish a novel kind of <b>extortions,</b> named weak <b>extortions,</b> where any increase of his own payoff always exceeds that of the opponent's by a fixed percentage, and the conditions under which the weak <b>extortions</b> can be realized are more stringent as the noise becomes stronger.
