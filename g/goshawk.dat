5|$|Another {{study found}} that the risk of {{predation}} for a bird targeted by a Eurasian sparrowhawk or northern <b>goshawk</b> increased 25-fold if the prey was infected with the blood parasite Leucocytozoon, and birds with avian malaria were 16 {{times more likely to be}} killed.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} element of diet analysis is species adaptability to alternative prey sources. The breeding-season diet of Northern <b>Goshawks</b> (Accipiter gentilis) includes both mammalian and avian species, varies geographically, {{and is often}} dependent upon tree squirrels of the genera Sciurus andTamiasciurus. We studied alternative prey sources of Northern <b>Goshawks</b> in the South Hills of south-central Idaho, an area where tree squirrels are naturally absent and other prey frequently important in the diet of <b>goshawks,</b> such as smaller corvids, are uncommon. We quantified the diet of <b>goshawks</b> using nest cameras and surveyed abundance of prey using line transects. We found that <b>goshawks</b> consumed roughly 18. 5...|$|R
50|$|A. g. laingi (Tavernier, 1940) - This insular race {{is found}} on the Queen Charlotte Islands and Vancouver Island. This {{subspecies}} is slightly smaller than the <b>goshawks</b> {{found on the}} mainland and is linearly the smallest race on average in North America. The wing chord of males can range from 312 to 325 mm and that of females is 332 to 360 mm and is on average nearly 5% smaller than those sampled <b>goshawks</b> from the nearby mainland. These <b>goshawks</b> are characteristically darker than mainland <b>goshawks</b> with the black of the crown extending to the interscapulars. The underside is a sootier gray overall.|$|R
50|$|Despite their {{propensity}} to pursue relatively large prey and capability to pursue alternate prey, northern <b>goshawks</b> can be locally outcompeted for resources by {{species that are}} more adaptable and flexible, {{especially in terms of}} habitat and prey. Most northern buteonine hawks largely take small rodents such as voles (which are usually ignored by <b>goshawks)</b> but can adapt to nearly any other type of prey when the staple local rodent prey populations go down. Comparisons with <b>goshawks</b> and red-tailed hawk nesting in abutting areas of Arizona (other large common Buteos like Swainson's hawks (Buteo swainsonii) and ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis) utilize open habitats and so do not come into conflict with <b>goshawks)</b> shows the red-tailed hawks as being able to take a broader range of prey than <b>goshawks</b> and nest in more varied habitats, the latter species being perhaps the most commonly seen, widespread and adaptable of diurnal American raptors. On occasion, <b>goshawks</b> are robbed of their prey by a diversity of other birds, including harriers, other hawks, eagles, falcons and even gulls.|$|R

5|$|The nests of red wattlebirds {{are often}} parasitized by the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus), and less {{commonly}} by the Pacific koel (Eudynamys orientalis). Nest predators include the brown <b>goshawk</b> (Accipiter fasciatus), black falcon (Falco subniger), pied currawong, Australian raven (Corvus coronoides), common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), domestic cat, and snakes.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{ecoregion}} remains ecologically intact, {{it faces}} conservation challenges {{that include the}} negative affects of certain forestry management and logging practices, higher risks of forest fires due to the alteration of the trees {{that make up the}} forest composition, and habitat fragmentation as a result of urban sprawl and development, which endangers the long-term survival of vulnerable species such as mountain caribou and the Northern <b>goshawk.</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The {{ability of}} {{northern}} <b>goshawks</b> (Accipiter gentilis) {{to persist in}} intensively managed and selectively harvested forest habitats is largely unknown. To address the concern that populations of northern <b>goshawks</b> in eastern Oregon may be declining in response to habitat alteration, I studied occupancy rates and habitat relationships of nesting <b>goshawks</b> on the Fremont National Forest and adjacent private lands during 1992 - 1994. My objectives were to determine if historic territories (i. e., those occupied ≥ 1 season during 1973 - 1991) were still occupied, document current site conditions and quantify changes in forest cover on those territories between 1973 - 1994, and compare present conditions of forest vegetation between nest sites that were currently occupied and those where I did not detect the presence of territorial <b>goshawks</b> (no-response sites). In 1994, I surveyed a forest-wide random sample of 51 historic nest sites, stratified by forest cover type. Occupancy of historic sites by <b>goshawks</b> was 29...|$|R

5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern <b>goshawk.</b> This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|Parrotfinches may be preyed upon by {{indigenous}} {{birds of}} prey such as the endemic Fiji <b>goshawk,</b> or by introduced mammals such as the small Asian mongoose, rats, and mice, {{and they may be}} susceptible to disease.

5|$|The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs {{which are}} then raised by the unsuspecting foster parents.

40|$|Anthropogenic habitat {{alteration}} {{has probably}} {{contributed significantly to}} the decrease of raptor populations in West African savannas. To evaluate the impact of habitat degradation on foraging by sedentary Afrotropical raptors, we investigated the differences in microhabitat selection, foraging effort and energy returns between Dark-chanting <b>Goshawks</b> Melierax metabates inhabiting natural and transformed savannas in Cameroon. We expected that the agro-ecosystems in the transformed savannas have become unprofitable for Dark-chanting <b>Goshawks</b> due to scarcity of food resources. In both savanna types we radio-tracked six mated, adult males during the non-breeding season and determined foraging effort, by time spent at each perch and distance covered between perches, and energy intake through estimation of the energy value of prey items. <b>Goshawks</b> in natural habitats had smaller home-ranges and exploited their range more intensively than <b>Goshawks</b> in transformed habitats. In both natural and transformed habitats, <b>Goshawks</b> selected foraging patches with comparatively tall trees, underlining their importance to foraging <b>Goshawks.</b> The extent of shrub and herbaceous layer cover, agriculture cover, and tree density were other important predictors of foraging patch use, but their importance differed between habitats. The extent of shrub, herbaceous layer and agriculture cover were positively associated with foraging patch use in transformed habitats, suggesting that cultivated fields and ground vegetation support important prey resources for <b>Goshawks</b> in agro-ecosystems. The composition of broad prey categories to the diet, foraging effort and returns were comparable between habitats. However, we found indications that the proportion of heavy-bodied lizard species among reptile prey items was higher in natural than transformed habitats, whereas on average smaller lizards were more commonly caught in the latter. Mean herbaceous layer height and tree density within home ranges, both higher in natural habitat, were negatively related to prey capture rates. Tree clearance and livestock grazing thus favored greater prey capture rates in transformed habitat, offsetting a lower meal energy value compared to natural habitat. We conclude that foraging Dark-chanting <b>Goshawks</b> may cope with moderate land transformation, but practices focused on conservation of tall trees and ground vegetation cover would be beneficial by maintaining important prey resources and their exploitability under growing land pressure. </p...|$|R
