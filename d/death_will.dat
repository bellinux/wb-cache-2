5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, <b>death</b> <b>will</b> ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E
5|$|Other wrong {{beliefs are}} killing {{those who are}} in state of {{happiness}} or {{those who are in}} meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the time of <b>death</b> <b>will</b> be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation.|$|E
5|$|Jex {{tells the}} Doctor he is remorseful {{for all those}} deaths his work has caused. The townsfolk demand the Doctor turn Jex over, but he reminds them that Isaac's <b>death</b> <b>will</b> be for naught if they do so, and {{has come up with}} a plan from {{learning}} about Jex' society. When the Gunslinger arrives the next day, residents wearing facial markings similar to Jex race through town, confusing the cyborg and allowing Jex to flee to his ship. However, instead of taking off, Jex tells the Doctor he is ready to face justice in the afterlife, and causes the ship to self-destruct.|$|E

5|$|A sequel, titled Toy Story 4, will be {{released}} on June 21, 2019. The film was originally to be directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Josh Cooley. In July 2017, however, {{it was announced that}} Cooley would be the movie's sole director. The film will focus on Bonnie's toys helping Woody to reunite with Bo Peep, who was given away before the events of this film. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Kristen Schaal and Laurie Metcalf will reprise their roles of Woody, Buzz, Trixie and Mrs. Davis. The rest of this film's cast may also return. Don Rickles also signed on to return to voice Mr. Potato Head; however, Rickles died during production. It is uncertain how his <b>death</b> <b>will</b> affect Potato Head's role in the fourth film.|$|E

30|$|Thus, as in {{the case}} of ‘AIDS Diagnoses’, when the AIDS data {{category}} is narrow, the forecasting results are robust in less States.

25|$|Without doubt, the US {{was right}} to remove bin Laden, but {{it is wrong to}} think that his <b>death</b> <b>will</b> weaken al-Qaeda. Yes, a colossal {{psychological}} blow has been dealt, but al-Qaeda is no longer a mere organisation, but a global brand, an idea, a philosophy that now has its first Saudi martyr from the holy lands of Islam.|$|E
25|$|The first {{campaign}} {{towards the}} abolition of the death penalty began on 30 May 1791, but on 6 October that year the National Assembly refused to pass a law abolishing the death penalty.

25|$|Some sects {{who hold}} to the {{doctrine}} of baptismal regeneration also believe in a third realm called Limbo, which is the final destination of souls {{who have not been}} baptised, but who have been innocent of mortal sin. Souls in Limbo include unbaptised infants and those who lived virtuously but were never exposed to Christianity in their lifetimes. Christian Scientists believe that sin brought death, and that <b>death</b> <b>will</b> be overcome with the overcoming of sin.|$|E

25|$|In August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was {{launched}} {{to clean up}} the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside. On 1 September 2014, a U.S. drone strike carried out as part of the broader mission killed Al-Shabaab leader Moktar Ali Zubeyr. U.S. authorities hailed the raid as a major symbolic and operational loss for Al-Shabaab, and the Somali government offered a 45-day amnesty to all moderate members of the militant group. Political analysts also suggested that the insurgent commander's <b>death</b> <b>will</b> likely lead to Al-Shabaab's fragmentation and eventual dissolution.|$|E
25|$|In humans, a {{characteristic}} of poisoning by the nephrotoxin orellanine is the long latency; the first symptoms usually do not appear until 2–3 days after ingestion and can in some cases {{take as long as}} 3 weeks. The first symptoms of orellanine poisoning are similar to the common flu (nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, headaches, myalgia, etc.), these symptoms are followed by early stages of renal failure (immense thirst, frequent urination, pain on and around the kidneys) and eventually decreased or nonexistent urine output and other symptoms of renal failure occur. If left untreated <b>death</b> <b>will</b> follow.|$|E

25|$|There are {{suggestions}} of that Naderipour {{might have been}} subjected to torture after being detained by the revolutionary government, therefore the details of his narrative, which was obtained under duress, is questionable by all standards. The circumstance of Bijan Jazani's <b>death</b> <b>will</b> remain a mystery. The only truth that remains is that he was killed by execution shortly before finishing his sentence. All of Jazani's books were written in prison from 1970 to 1974. They discussed the establishment of the independent leftist movement in the two decades of the 1960s and '70s. Jazani is buried in the 33rd block of Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.|$|E
25|$|In ancient China, {{a brutal}} and tyrannical warlord unites the country's kingdoms into an empire and becomes the Dragon Emperor. He orders the {{construction}} of the Great Wall of China to bury and curse his dead enemies, eventually learning power over the classical elements fire, water, earth, wood and metal. The Emperor soon grows fearful that his <b>death</b> <b>will</b> end all he has accomplished and summons Zi Yuan, a sorceress who is said to know the secret of immortality. She seemingly casts a spell on the Emperor in Sanskrit, before he executes General Ming, his trusted friend and Zi Yuan's secret lover. He impales Zi Yuan, but having foreseen such events, she immolates and detains the Emperor, transforming his army into the Terracotta Army, and flees.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, for true believers and the righteous, <b>death</b> <b>will</b> cause {{a feeling of}} love, then it's arrives and their souls will be aparted tender. When a righteous believer dies, bright-faced angels from heaven descends with divine perfume and shroud. Then the angel of death comes, and tells the soul {{to come out to}} the {{pleasure}} and mercy of God. The soul is then extracted as easily as water comes out from the pitcher. The soul is then wrapped in the perfumed shroud and is taken up to the seventh heaven where God declares: 'write down his name in 'Illiyin' and take him back to earth. I created him from earth, and I will raise him second time from this very earth.' The soul is then pushed back into the body and is interrogated by two angels called Munkar and Nakir. He succeeds in answering the questions, and is blessed with heavenly rewards.|$|E
