2500|$|Eukaryotes {{initiate}} DNA replication {{at multiple}} {{points in the}} chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome. [...] Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach {{the very end of}} the chromosomes. [...] Due to this problem, DNA is lost each replication cycle from the end of the chromosome. [...] Telomeres are regions of repetitive DNA close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in somatic cells. [...] This shortens the telomeres of the daughter <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome.</b> [...] As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the Hayflick limit.) [...] Within the germ cell line, which passes DNA to the next generation, telomerase extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to cancer formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear DNA and {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{differ in}} many ways, starting with location and structure. Nuclear DNA is {{located within the}} nucleus of eukaryote cells and usually has two copies per cell while mitochondrial DNA {{is located in the}} mitochondria and contains 100-1,000 copies per cell. The structure of nuclear <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is linear with open ends and includes 46 chromosomes containing 3 billion nucleotides. Mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosomes</b> usually have closed, circular structures, and contain for example 16,569 nucleotides in human. Nuclear DNA is diploid, inheriting the DNA from both mother and father, while mitochondrial DNA is haploid, coming only from the mother. The mutation rate for nuclear DNA is less than 0.3% while that of mitochondrial DNA is generally higher.|$|R

50|$|Histones are {{proteins}} that the <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> are wrapped around. Histones are present as an octamer (set of 8 proteins) {{and they can}} be modified through acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation, etc. These changes can either open or close up the chromosome. Thus, depending on which histone is modified and the exact process, histone modifications can either silence or promote gene expression (while DNA methylation almost always silences).|$|E

5000|$|P22 has a linear, {{double-stranded}} <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{within its}} virion {{that is about}} 44 kilobases long with blunt ends and a circular genetic map. [...] However, its [...] "wild type" [...] nucleotide sequence is about 42 kilobases long. [...] The genome of P22 has been sequenced and sixty five genes have been annotated. [...] The sequencing results {{support the hypothesis that}} phage P22 is a virus that has evolved through extensive recombination with other viruses.|$|E
5000|$|A {{prophage}} is a bacteriophage (often shortened to [...] "phage") genome inserted {{and integrated}} into the circular bacterial <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> or existing as an extrachromosomal plasmid. This is a latent form of a phage, in which the viral genes {{are present in the}} bacterium without causing disruption of the bacterial cell. Pro means , so, prophage means the stage of a virus in the form of genome inserted into host DNA before attaining its real form inside host.|$|E
5000|$|The viral capsid {{has been}} the subject of studies in P22 virus assembly. Like other large dsDNA viruses, P22 first builds a protein [...] "procapsid" [...] {{structure}} and then packages it with the <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome.</b> [...] P22 procapsid is assembled by a well-studied scaffolding protein. [...] About 250 molecules of scaffolding protein are present in the procapsid during assembly, but during DNA packaging, the scaffolding protein is released. [...] The released scaffolding protein is not damaged and can re-assemble with newly synthesized coat protein to make more procapsids.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} precepts {{in the theory}} are possible. For instance, a helical virus with a bilipid {{envelope}} bears a distinct resemblance to a highly simplified cellular nucleus (i.e., a <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> encapsulated within a lipid membrane). In theory, a large DNA virus could take control of a bacterial or archaeal cell. Instead of replicating and destroying the host cell, it would remain within the cell, thus overcoming the tradeoff dilemma typically faced by viruses. With the virus {{in control of the}} host cell's molecular machinery, it would effectively become a functional nucleus. Through the processes of mitosis and cytokinesis, the virus would thus recruit the entire cell as a symbiont — a new way to survive and proliferate.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of cells is a crowded environment. For example, an Escherichia coli cell {{is only about}} 2 micrometres (μm) long and 0.5 μm in diameter, with a cell volume of 0.6 - 0.7 μm3. However, E. coli can contain up to 4,288 different types of proteins, and about 1,000 of these types are produced at a high enough level to be easily detected. Added to this mix are various forms of RNA and the cell's <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome,</b> giving a total concentration of macromolecules of between 300 and 400 mg/ml. In eukaryotes the cell's interior is further crowded by the protein filaments {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, this meshwork divides the cytosol into a network of narrow pores.|$|E
50|$|The major {{functions}} of LTag in the viral life cycle involve dysregulation {{of the host}} cell's cell cycle and replication of the virus's circular DNA genome. Because polyomavirus genome replication relies on the DNA replication machinery of the host cell, the cell must be in S phase (the part of the cell cycle in which the host cell's genome is normally replicated) {{in order to provide}} the necessary molecular machinery for viral DNA replication. The SV40 LTag can induce S phase and activate the host cell's DNA damage response. Coordinated actions of the OBD and helicase regions result in physical manipulation of the viral genome, melting the DNA double helix at the origin of replication and unwinding the circular <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosome</b> in a bidirectional fashion. The structure and function of LTag resembles that of the human papillomavirus oncoproteins.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the history}} of {{molecular}} biology, non-helical or [...] "side-by-side" [...] models of DNA were proposed in the 1970s {{as a challenge to}} the standard double-helical model. The non-helical models attempted to solve problems relating to the topology of circular <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosomes</b> during replication. These theories were briefly considered seriously as a minority viewpoint, but they were later largely rejected due to X-ray crystallography of DNA duplexes and later the nucleosome core particle, as well as the discovery of topoisomerases, and these non-double-helical models are not currently accepted by the mainstream scientific community.|$|R

40|$|AbstractVarious means {{employed}} {{to solve problems}} associated with the ends (telomeres) of linear <b>DNA</b> <b>chromosomes</b> exhibit one common feature: generation of both intra- and intercellular heterogeneity of telomeres at the level of their structural and functional states. We argue that this heterogeneity is not a simple by-product of molecular pathways mediating telomere maintenance. Instead, we propose that these mechanisms were selected because they generate heterogeneity. Similarly as noise in gene expression, stochastic events at telomeres may have an adaptive value allowing cells to sustain viable and flexible populations, with implications for fields ranging from evolutionary biology to molecular medicine...|$|R
40|$|This paper solves {{a complex}} PS problem by {{employing}} a reproduction mechanism which {{is closer to}} natural than the common GA methods. The PS problem consists of: operations sequence constraints, alternative modes per operation, multi renewable resources, resource setups, and other properties. The resulting model is very complex; hence, common GA methods produce unfeasible solutions very frequently. By mimicking the multilevel Chromosome’s structure in natural reproduction, we reduce the rate of unfeasibility produced by the crossover. The GA levels we consider are: <b>DNA,</b> <b>Chromosome,</b> Gene, and a Nucleic. The main idea is that crossover is conducted only between chromosomes, and mutations within genes. The proposed GA method is much more efficient, especially for large problems, and reaches its objective close to optimal versus a customized B&B algorithm...|$|E

About 8 hours after infection, viral DNA replication commences, reaching a maximum rate several hours later. Late transcription to produce messenger RNA (mRNA) for capsid and other virus-specific proteins begins after the onset of DNA replication and continues for about 2 days, when the infected cells die...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of heterochromatin classes along the chromosomes of specimens from two {{populations of the}} fish Astyanax scabripinnis was examined using fluorescence banding with GC- and AT-DNA specific fluorochromes and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with an AT-rich satellite DNA (As 51) probe. For the pericentromeric heterochromatin blocks neither GC/AT-DNA specific fluorochromes nor the FISH technique produce any response with chromosomes from either of the populations. On the other hand, the telomeric distal heterochromatin blocks of both populations fluoresced when the FISH technique was applied but showed distinct responses after GC-specific fluorochrome treatments, leading us to propose different structural arrangements of the FISH-positive heterochro-matins. Such differences in chromosome banding patterns together with other karyotypic differences suggest differ-entiation of these populations at taxonomic level.
