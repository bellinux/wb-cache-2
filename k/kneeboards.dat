5000|$|A kneeboard is a board ridden in a {{kneeling}} stance. <b>Kneeboards</b> are ridden {{in ocean}} surf, or while being towed behind a boat {{on a lake}} or river.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} types of <b>kneeboarding</b> is 'tourist kneeboarding'. In this type of <b>kneeboarding,</b> the rider begins on land, already strapped to the board. This type of <b>kneeboarding</b> is far easier than normal <b>kneeboarding,</b> usually done in a river or on a lake. Regular <b>kneeboarding</b> is far superior to [...] "tourist kneeboarding" [...] because you {{are already in the}} water and can take of faster.|$|R
50|$|Surf <b>kneeboard</b> innovators include George Greenough, Steve Lis, Peter Crawford and Ron Romanosky. Till Wipperfuerth {{is one of}} {{the actual}} top {{performers}} in <b>kneeboarding,</b> since he became champion of the Tunilake <b>Kneeboard</b> Masters.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kneeboarding</b> (1973) :A {{discipline}} of surfing where the rider paddles {{on his belly}} into a wave on a <b>kneeboard,</b> then rides the wave face typically on both knees.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kneeboards</b> {{were first}} {{produced}} commercially in the 1950s. While {{they were not}} widely popular at first, kneeboarding had become widespread by the mid-1950s. Today, kneeboarding remains popular, with sales of about 100,000 units per year.|$|E
50|$|As waterskiing gained popularity, riders also {{experimented with}} {{kneeling}} down on round plywood discs. Others tried kneeling on surfboards and some used purpose-built <b>kneeboards</b> {{designed specifically for}} riding waves, but the water ski kneeboard did not emerge as a product until the 1970s.|$|E

Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to 12 ft long and 150 lb). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kneeboarding</b> {{popularity}} increased markedly {{with the}} release of the surf movie [...] "Crystal Voyager" [...] by the most prominent of <b>kneeboard</b> riders, Californian, George Greenough. The music of Pink Floyd's [...] "Meddle" [...] combined with spectacular slow-motion images by Mr. Greenough, filming inside the tube whilst surfing a [...] "spoon" [...] <b>kneeboard,</b> changed surfing's direction, influenced board and fin design and earned him a Palme d'Or for short film at the Cannes film festival in the late 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Required {{equipment}} {{includes a}} tow rope, a <b>kneeboard</b> and {{a boat that}} can go about 15-20 mph (28-32 km/h). Also, most importantly, a certified life vest for safety. <b>Kneeboarding</b> starts are relatively simple, and the rider {{does not need to}} travel very quickly.|$|R
5000|$|The Southwest Conference Explorer Division added <b>kneeboarding</b> in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The first commercially {{available}} water ski kneeboard was Knee Ski, co-invented by Mike Murphy and Bud Hulst in 1972. Hulst had {{a background in}} surfing, manufacturing <b>kneeboards</b> for wave riding {{under the name of}} El Paipo. Murphy had been a professional show skier. The original Knee Ski was made from molded fiberglass, like a boat hull, and was neutrally buoyant. Each Knee Ski had a flat neoprene pad covering the entire deck, and a Velcro strap.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s Greenough's {{equipment}} was distinctly {{different from the}} longboard design of the day, and he rode short <b>kneeboards</b> under 5' 5" [...] and air mattresses regularly. He is credited as being the best mat rider ever, and still surfs the unique waveriding craft. His most famous board was a fiberglass spoon using only small amounts of buoyant foam, shaped kneeboard he christened [...] "Velo". Greenough {{is also known as}} a genius level inventor and the master of fiberglass engineering, design, and construction, having used the material to build surfboards, camera housings, and boats.|$|E
5000|$|Models {{vary from}} a small {{clipboard}} with thigh straps to more elaborate designs with multiple panels that fold much like a wallet (usually with a means to hold the folded board closed such as a snap or velcro.) As the kneeboard is designed to keep flight-pertinent information close at hand, it may have charts and information (such as IFR references) printed directly on it, or include pockets and clips to hold maps, approach plates, and aids to calculation such as the E6B Flight Computer. The popularity of cockpit iPads have necessitated the need for <b>kneeboards</b> designed to hold iPads or other tablets.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Kneeboard</b> riders {{generally}} {{wear life}} jackets or wet suits {{and catch the}} wave by paddling and kicking or dipping their hand in the water [...] Advantages to <b>kneeboarding</b> include an extremely low center of gravity, less wind resistance, the ability to ride higher and farther back in the tubes, and taking off on a steeper part of the wave.|$|R
50|$|Towed kneeboarding is an {{offshoot}} of kneeboard surfing; kneeboard riders compete tricks, and expression session events. Towed <b>kneeboards</b> have a padded deck contoured {{to the shape of}} the shins and knees and a strap holds the rider to the board. Towed kneeboarding declined in popularity with the advent of wakeboarding and other modern watersports; however, it still enjoys popularity among water skiers and newer models of the kneeboard are still in production. A kneeboard is a good piece of equipment to start out on for boat-towed sports - the low center of gravity often makes it easier to get up on than a waterski or wakeboard, which both require standing up.|$|E
5000|$|Usually a short stubby board under 6 ft {{in length}} {{developed}} from <b>kneeboards</b> in 1967 by Steve Lis. Other prominent fish shapers include Skip Frye, Larry Mabile and Steve Brom. Primarily a twin fin {{set up with}} a swallow tail shape and popular in smaller waves, the fish enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the early 2000s after legendary surfer Tom Curren rode one during an ASP event at Hossegor. Note, any type of board (such as shortboard or mini-longboard) can have a fish tail, and these are {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "fish", but they lack the other properties of a traditional, or [...] "retro" [...] fish as described here.|$|E
50|$|Kneeboarding is an aquatic sport {{where the}} {{participant}} is towed on a buoyant, convex, and hydrodynamically shaped board at a planing speed, most often behind a motorboat. Kneeboarding on a surf style board with fin(s) is also done in waves at the beach. In the usual configuration of a tow-sport kneeboard, riders kneel on their heels on the board, and secure {{themselves to the}} deck with an adjustable Velcro strap over their thighs. Most water ski <b>kneeboards</b> do not have fins to allow for easier surface spins. As in wakeboarding or water skiing, the rider hangs onto a tow-rope. The advantages of kneeboarding versus other tow-sports {{seems to be an}} easier learning curve and a sense of being closer to the water when falls occur.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{the very first}} {{association}} for competition was formed called the International <b>Kneeboard</b> Association (IKA). Founded by Roland Hillier of Maitland, Florida, a former World Overall and Slalom Champion; National Slalom and Trick Champion; Masters Overall Water Ski Champion and three time Intercollegiate Overall Champion. Hillier created {{the rules and regulations}} for <b>kneeboarding</b> not only for boat towing method but also cableway towing. In boat towing the three competition events were tricks, slalom and wake crossing. A special event was also included to be called the [...] "Flip-off" [...] to see how many flips could be completed in twenty seconds. This proved to be quite popular with the spectators. In cableway competition, Roland designed the trick event which also included the use of small ramps for doing spins and flips. Calculations were needed to adjust for cableway towline length when the water levels changed. Roland Hillier also wrote and published the first book on <b>kneeboarding</b> called [...] "Kneeboarding A - Z". After several National Championships, he produced and broadcast on ABC and, later, PBS of [...] "The International <b>Kneeboard</b> Championships". This broadcast was the very first of its kind. The next year, Sea World of Orlando approached the IKA to hold a National Championship at their park, however, the original sponsors to the IKA {{would not be allowed to}} participate and Hillier felt strongly that supporters should be included and did not accept. The American <b>Kneeboarding</b> Association (AKA) was founded by another group of people after the International <b>Kneeboard</b> Association rejected the Sea World offer, and created their own form of competition. Eventually the AKA merged with USA WaterSki as one of its designated towable sports. ¹ <b>Kneeboarding</b> History ...|$|R

50|$|Kneeboarding is a {{discipline}} of surfing where the rider paddles {{on his or}} her belly into a wave on a kneeboard, then rides the wave face typically on both knees. The typical kneeboard is between five and six and a half feet in length, with a wide round nose and constructed of Glassfibre over a polyurethane foam core. Kneeboard designers however are known for their wild experimental excess and so most modern materials including various aerospace elements such as Titanium alloys (for fins), carbon fibre and kevlar in epoxy matrices are not unusual. Modern <b>kneeboards</b> may have a rubber pad for the rider's knees, preventing undue wear of the knees, also preventing slipping to help the rider maintain control. Kneeboarders also typically use swimfins and an ankle surfleash.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{motive to}} use the iPad as a {{navigation}} tool is the practicality of the product. The iPad would replace about 25 pounds of paper charts used by pilots that include aircraft flight manuals, approach plates, navigation charts, policy manuals, minimum equipment list and taxi charts. Major airlines based in the United States are mainly paper based, which includes some who have fleets of 900 plus planes. This translates {{to a lot of}} paper in the form of charts that could be saved by the iPad. The switch to an electronic system would also make life easier on the pilot. No longer would pilots carry around a heavy flight bag. It would be replaced by the 9.5 inch by 7.31 inch 1.33 pound tablet. When used in conjunction with a specially designed strap, this small size allows them to be used in place of <b>kneeboards.</b> Flight planning is also made easier by the iPad. The pilot would be able to use one device to check everything from weather, other airport facilities and flight plans. All this makes a pilot's life a lot easier.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 Greenough {{traveled}} to Australia {{and ended up}} impressing the locals by showing them his new school wave riding style blending speed, power, and grace; drawing sharp turns and deep barrel rides. He influenced the likes of Nat Young into using Greenough’s style of surfing fin which he used to win the 1966 world surfing championships in San Diego California ushering {{in a new era}} in surfing in which the Australians were seen to emerge as a dominant surfing country. “The greatest surfer in the world today,” is what Young described Greenough back then. After the visit to Australia, Greenough shaped a board which he explained as {{the next step in the}} progression of surfing, “a fish moves when he swims… so why not make a whole board that moves when it’s on a wave?” what he created was a board that had multiple layers of fiberglass shaped just like the old balsa <b>kneeboards</b> he rode, a glued on ridge of polyurethane foam on top of the deck near the rails and nose with the back end of the board entirely made of fiberglass; and the final piece to the board was his signature flex-fin to top off the board. the board was so small and light that it was not very good in small surf; only in big surf did the board show it’s true excellence and allowed Greenough to maneuver on the wave with a new school style, more power and speed than previous designs, “Greenough was riding like a visitor from ten years in surfing’s future. He cranked out bottom turns where his board tilted up almost 90 degrees…” In 1966 Greenough made his second board which he nicknamed ‘velo’ for velocity.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>kneeboard</b> is an {{accessory}} (usually made from cloth, plastic or metal) with {{various types of}} clips or mounts to hold objects for pilots during flight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{advantage}} of <b>kneeboarding</b> {{is the ability}} it gives the rider to deal with tube rides that might require too quick of a take off for a standup surfer or bodyboarder to get into and might get too tight or steep for a stand-up board surfer to deal with. Being closer to the Face of the wave, the feeling of speed is more enhanced, with a resulting increase in excitement. It seems that <b>kneeboarding</b> is where {{the best of the}} skill sets unique to each of the surfing disciplines [...] "comes together".|$|R
50|$|The International Surfing Association (ISA) is {{the world}} {{governing}} authority for surfing and wave riding disciplines, including bodyboarding, <b>kneeboarding,</b> longboarding, tandem, skimboarding and bodysurfing. The ISA is recognized by the International Olympic Committee.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} options for {{recreational}} or competitive water skiers. These include speed skiing, trick skiing, show skiing, slaloming, jumping, barefoot skiing and wakeski. Similar, related sports are wakeboarding, <b>kneeboarding,</b> discing, tubing, and sit-down hydrofoil.|$|R

50|$|Swimfins, swim fins, fins or {{flippers}} are finlike accessories worn on {{the foot}} or leg and made from rubber, plastic or combinations of these materials, to aid movement through the water in water sports activities such as swimming, bodyboarding, bodysurfing, <b>kneeboarding,</b> riverboarding, underwater hockey, underwater rugby and various other types of underwater diving.|$|R
50|$|DB-110 installations, such as RAPTOR, {{also include}} a {{reconnaissance}} mission planning system (RMPS). Planned missions produce route cards for a pilot's <b>kneeboard,</b> are downloaded to route planning systems on either the recon aircraft or AWACS aircraft and are placed on a PCMCIA card {{that is used to}} load the pod itself with sensor tasking information.|$|R
