25|$|By 2009, {{suggestions}} of a rivalry between Modi and N. Srinivasan surfaced. During 2009–10, Lalit Modi oversaw the bidding process for induction {{of two new}} teams in the Indian Premier League. In December 2009, he inserted two new clauses in {{the invitation to tender}} (ITT): the bidder should have a net worth of at least USD 1 billion and must provide a bank guarantee of USD 100 million. Modi stated that these clauses protected BCCI's interests. However, other BCCI board members claimed that he was rigging bids to suit Adani Group and Videocon Group, as the new clauses would rule out most of the other prospective bidders. After the ITT was floated on 22 February 2010, some of the prospective bidders, including Sahara Group and Jagran Group, complained to the BCCI President Shashank Manohar that they were being deliberately kept out of the tendering process. After receiving only two bids, IPL changed the ITT, removing the net worth clause and reducing the <b>guarantee</b> <b>amount</b> to USD 10 million.|$|E

It authorized a program to promote coal production that would guarantee qualifying underground coal mining operations up to $30 million per project. The qualifying requirements are tailored to promote more environmentally friendly development and smaller coal producers. Recipients of the loan guarantees are required to have a contract with a customer who is certified by the Environmental Protection Agency to operate their plant {{in compliance with the}} Clean Air Act. At least 80% of the total <b>guarantee</b> <b>amount</b> must finance low-sulfur coal development. Finally, large coal or oil companies are prohibited from receiving loan guarantees.|$|E

50|$|After the {{cancellation}} of the contract, India encashed over 250 crore made by AgustaWestland as a bank guarantee in the Indian banks in January 2014. Separately, India requested the Italian government to retrieve the bank <b>guarantee</b> <b>amount</b> made by the firm in Italian banks which was more than €275 million (2,364 crore). On 17 March 2014, a request made by India was rejected by an Italian court. However, the appellate court in Milan reversed the lower court's judgement and upheld {{the claims of the}} Indian government. Accordingly, in June 2014, the Indian government encashed 1,818 crore, taking the total amount recovered so far to 2,068 crore. With this, India has recovered the entire amount of around 1,620 crore (45% of the total contract value 3,600 crore) it had paid to AgustaWestland.|$|E
50|$|The FSS {{also took}} a series of {{measures}} to strengthen the lines of support to {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in times of liquidity shortage during the global financial crisis. Working jointly with the Korea Federation of Banks and other organizations, the FSS introduced the SME Fast Track program in October 2008, injecting a combined liquidity of 2.82 trillion won to 1,672 SMEs by the end of 2008. By coordinating policies with the FSC and other relevant agencies, and enlisting the active cooperation of the financial sector, the FSS helped to increase the <b>guarantee</b> <b>amount</b> from guarantee institutions and to extend the maturity of SME loans. Thanks to the combination of SME support measures, SME loans increased by 52.4 trillion won in 2008 - despite the bleak economic circumstances of the global financial crisis - which is comparable with the average increase of 56.7 trillion won in 2006 and 2007.|$|E

30|$|While most {{countries}} seek to encourage high-tech firms’ growth, essentially expansion capital {{able to support}} substantive growth have less access to debt financing, as compare with larger firms (Riding et al. 2001; Beck et al. 2005). However, Crowling (2010) argued that banks would not lend to high-tech enterprises {{in the first instance}} {{in the absence of a}} loan guarantee, thus, the available finance of small firms was constrained to an imperfect capital market. Riding et al. (2001) found that loan guarantee programs is an effective means of supporting start-up and risky enterprise expansion in Canada, and similar schemes are in effect in Japan, the U.K., Korea, and Germany, which can create a large number of jobs. Columba et al. (2010) proposed that, while it is difficult for high-tech enterprises with a short repayment record and credit history to obtain loans from banks, their borrowing capacity may be improved by joining mutual guarantee institutions (MGIs) that have better screening and monitoring ability in borrowers. At the peak of crisis, if small firms with joined MGIs did not appear financial tensions, however, the information from MGIs which can be rating systems (Bartoli et al. 2013). A well-designed government-sponsored credit guarantee scheme should consist of credit rating databases, limit the ratio of guaranteed loans to total loans, and has an affordable ceiling on total budget (Honohan 2010). According to Beck et al. (2010), the largest loan <b>guarantee</b> <b>amount</b> in Asia is approximately $ 41.1 billion, which is almost 5 % of the GDP, where 45 % of these funds were established to assist SMEs and 5 % to new business.|$|E
40|$|The {{multimillion dollar}} price {{guarantees}} that an auction house can offer for paintings {{have already had}} a large impact on auction house profits, and place new demands on the auctioneer's decision making and negotiating skills. Yet auctioneers have not been studied as independent entities and decision makers. To create a price guarantee, the auction house and the seller must negotiate both the <b>guarantee</b> <b>amount</b> and the extra commission the seller pays if the auction price exceeds the guarantee. We present a normative model of negotiations and find the frontier of guarantee and commission that is the Nash bargaining solution. We also determine the optimal reserve that the auctioneer should place on guaranteed property. We find that guarantees decrease the auction house's expected revenue compared to a conventional auction, but do allow it to attract business which might otherwise be lost. Guarantees benefit sellers, increasing the expected value and lowering the variance of their auction revenue. The auctioneer's optimal strategy depends {{not only on the}} distribution of the artwork's auction price, but also the price it will bring if it fails to sell at auction. In the latter case the auction house must pay the seller the guarantee and then sell the artwork, which it now owns, in a private secondary market where buyers regard the property as "damaged goods" and lower their offers. Although all points on the frontier produce equal expected revenue, several frequently used decision making rules suggest that both parties may prefer a guarantee arrangement where the seller pays no additional commission and the guarantee has the lowest value on the frontier. auctions, guarantees, negotiation, decision-making...|$|E

In return for their contributions, members expect a benefit at termination of their contract. Due to the volatile nature of returns that pension funds attain, pension companies started attaching a minimum <b>guaranteed</b> <b>amount</b> to member’s benefits. In this mini-thesis we look at the pioneering work of Brennan and Schwartz [10] for pricing these minimum guarantees. The model they developed prices these minimum guarantees using option pricing theory. We also look at the model proposed by Deelstra et al. which prices minimum guarantees in a stochastic financial setting. We conclude this mini-thesis with new contributions where we look at simple alternative ways of pricing minimum guarantees.

A contract holder's use of reset provisions also contributes to costs, since resetting the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>amount</b> at a higher level means that the issuer will be liable for this higher amount.|$|R
