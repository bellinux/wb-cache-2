5|$|Their {{collaboration}} proved successful when, on the 3tht <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> on the 1976 voyage, Mau stated {{soon they}} would see land, and the next day, Tahiti. A few hours later, they spotted land-based white terns (Gygis alba) followed by a diminution of the trade-wind swell. That night, they spotted Mataiva. After a brief stopover, {{with little more than}} another day's sailing they made landfall at Tahiti where they were welcomed by 17,000 people, half the population of Tahiti.|$|E
25|$|Allan {{emigrated to}} the U.S. via Liverpool, England, sailing on the Ship Thornton to New York City. On the second <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> 26-year-old Allan married Jessie Ireland, a 28-year-old whom the ship's {{manifest}} identified as a spinster, although they had been dating for about ten years. They rendezvoused in New York with Allan and Hugh's mother (Mary McPherson Findlay), then headed west. Although they crossed the plains with the ill-fated Willie Handcart Company, all three survived and made it to Salt Lake City.|$|E
25|$|First {{to leave}} Charleston Harbor, on 2 June 1861, was the {{privateer}} Savannah. Her second <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> she captured brig Joseph, and thereby {{became the first}} Charleston privateer to take a prize in the war. Later the same day, she chased another sail, but discovered too late that it was , an armed brig. After a brief running gun battle, Captain T. Harrison Baker of Savannah surrendered his lightly armed ship. He and his men were put in irons and were taken to New York, where they were imprisoned and tried for piracy (see below).|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{match the}} new German speedsters, White Star decided {{to drop out}} of the {{competition}} and commission the four large Celtic-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the Deutschland, Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the Celtic. However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse.|$|E
500|$|From Halifax, {{the ship}} sailed to Boston {{and was there}} for a full day at the cruise terminal. (Boston was the {{terminus}} of the original crossing in 1840.) [...] In the evening, the captain backed the ship out of the slip and continued backing {{up all the way}} to the Maritime History Museum, where a fireworks display was presented before Queen Mary 2 sailed away. After a night and <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> the vessel entered New York Harbor early the morning of 14 July and docked at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal. Later in the evening the vessel sailed to the lower harbor, between the Statue of Liberty and the Battery, for the Forever Cunard Queen Mary 2 Light Show.|$|E
500|$|Despite Howe's pursuit, {{the main}} French sortie found initial success, running into a Dutch convoy and taking 20ships from it on Villaret's first <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> For {{the next week}} Howe {{continued}} to follow the French, seizing and burning a trail of French-held Dutch ships and enemy corvettes. On 25 May Howe spotted a straggler from Villaret's fleet and gave chase; Audacieux led Howe straight to his opponent's location. Having finally found Villaret, on 28 May Howe attacked, using a flying squadron of his fastest ships to cut off its rearmost vessel Révolutionnaire. This first rate was at various times engaged with six British ships and took heavy damage, possibly striking her colours late in the action. [...] As darkness fell the British and French fleets separated, leaving Révolutionnaire and her final enemy, HMS Audacious, still locked in combat behind them. These two ships parted company during the night and eventually returned to their respective home ports. By this stage Villaret knew through his patrolling frigates that the grain convoy was close, and deliberately took his fleet to the west, hoping to decoy Howe away from the vital convoy.|$|E

500|$|By {{adopting}} the plein-air approach, the painters {{were able to}} create their works in the open, immediately capturing the special effects of light and colour on their subjects. Fishermen were considered an especially interesting group in view of their dangerous work and their heroic behaviour. Lars Kruse, depicted by Michael Ancher, was famous for his success in rescuing a number of sailors who would otherwise have drowned. P.S. Krøyer's works were less dramatic, depicting fishermen pulling their nets in after a <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> While some of the paintings portrayed authentic occurrences, the artists often paid the fishermen to act as models, supplementing their modest incomes. Krøyer's works also included scenes of walks on the beach, romantic evenings in the moonlight and portraits of his wife Marie. As time went by, Krøyer increasingly painted [...] "moods", works which depicted the special atmosphere of the [...] "Blue Hour" [...] which developed in the evening as the sky merged with the sea. In addition to his landscapes and family portraits, Laurits Tuxen is remembered for painting the flowers in his garden. Anna Ancher's paintings, on the other hand, focused on interiors of the home, including women and children, in a more abstract style.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, {{two decades}} after Lightfoot's {{original}} song was written, singer-songwriter Camille West recorded a parody song with a similar rhythm titled [...] "The Nervous Wreck of Edna Fitzgerald," [...] about a well-to-do family's disastrous <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> She recorded and released it on her album Mother Tongue (subtitled [...] "Maternal Madness, Month by Month") that year. Ten years later, after she had joined the band Four Bitchin' Babes, she and the band performed the song live, prefacing it with the comment, [...] "With apologies to Gordon Lightfoot." [...] It was included on their album of that year, Gabby Road.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1939, Strathmore {{set off on}} {{a three-week}} cruise to the eastern Mediterranean, but shortly after she had passed Gibraltar there came an Admiralty signal {{ordering}} non-essential British ships {{to get out of}} the Mediterranean. The cruise was diverted to Rabat and from there it was intended to proceed to Bermuda, but after only one <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> there came a signal that war was imminent, and the ship returned to Tilbury, with a blackout being imposed after dark. [...] On 31 March 1940, towards the end of the [...] "Phoney War", the vessel was requisitioned on the orders of the Ministry of Shipping, which later became the Ministry of War Transport, and during the rest of the Second World War she served as a troop ship, with no major incidents in that role. On 21 July 1941 Strathmore sailed from Newfoundland carrying 3,800 Canadian soldiers to Britain. In February 1947 she sailed from Southampton bound for Singapore, Hong Kong, and Shanghai, carrying some 2,000 people going to China, including missionaries, colonial police, business men, and their families, many returning home after being displaced by the war.|$|E

50|$|Repositioning cruises are {{generally}} cheaper because most passengers {{will have to}} combine them with a one-way airline ticket. Also, most passengers prefer port-intensive cruises (cruises which visit a lot of ports of call and have few <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea),</b> while some repositioning cruises are forced to spend many <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> (when crossing the Atlantic Ocean for instance).|$|R

2500|$|Fisher's aim was 'efficiency of {{the fleet}} and its instant {{readiness}} for war', which won him support amongst {{a certain kind of}} navy officer. He believed in advancing the most able, rather than the longest serving. This upset those he passed over. Thus, he divided the navy into those who approved of his innovations and those who did not. As he became older and more senior he also became more autocratic and commented, 'Anyone who opposes me, I crush'. He believed that nations fought wars for material gain, and that maintaining a strong navy deterred other nations from engaging it in battle, thus decreasing the likelihood of war: [...] On the British fleet rests the British Empire. Fisher also believed that the risk of catastrophe in a sea battle was far greater than on land: a war could be lost or won in a <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> with no hope of replacing lost ships, but an army could be rebuilt quickly. When an arms race broke out between Germany and Britain to build larger navies, the German Kaiser commented, 'I admire Fisher, I say nothing against him. If I were in his place I should do all that he has done and I should do all that I know he has in mind to do'.|$|E

60|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} for a man-of-war to communicate with a merchant vessel, or with some other war-ship belonging to a foreign country. For this purpose the international code is also carried in the signal-chest. These signals are those in general use by all the merchant navies {{of the world for}} communication by <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> There are eighteen flags and a code pennant, corresponding to the consonants of the alphabet, omitting x and z. The code pennant is also used with these signals.|$|E
60|$|On {{the fifth}} <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> {{they fell in}} with a French fleet of six men of war. Two carried eighty guns, two seventy, one sixty-eight, and the other fifty-eight. The Resolution was a slow sailer, and the French, who at once gave chase, gained rapidly upon her. As {{resistance}} against such overwhelming odds seemed hopeless, Peterborough determined {{to go with the}} Spanish envoy and the state papers on board the Enterprise. There was little time for reflection. A small boat was lowered, and the earl, with a hasty adieu to his son, Jack, and Graham, descended the ship's side with the Spanish envoy and rowed away to the Enterprise.|$|E
60|$|While Clay traced her {{movements}} {{as far as}} they could be learned, the Cetacea was slowly working north. She met with light, baffling winds, and calms, and then was driven into a lonely inlet by a fresh gale. Here she was detained for some time, and adverse winds still dogged her course when she put to sea again, though they were no longer gentle, but brought with them a piercing rawness from the Polar ice. Her crew grew anxious and moody as they stubbornly thrashed her to windward under shortened sail, for every <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> increased the strain on their finances and the open-water season was short.|$|E

60|$|Among others, Dick Shand {{was sure}} {{that there was some}} entanglement. Entanglement was the word he always used in {{discussing}} the matter with Mrs. Callander. Between Dick and his friend there had been very little confidential communication of late. Caldigate had forbidden Shand {{to talk to him about}} Mrs. Smith, and thus had naturally closed the man's mouth on other matters. And then they had fallen into different sets. Dick, at least, had fallen into a set, while Caldigate had hardly associated with any but the one dangerous friend. Dick had lived much with a bevy of noisy young men who had been given to games and smoking, and to a good deal of drink. Caldigate had said not a word, even when on one occasion Dick had stumbled down into the cabin very much the worse for what he had taken. How could he find fault with Dick's folly when he would not allow Dick to say a word to him as to his own? But on this last <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> it became necessary that they should understand each other.|$|E
6000|$|The {{captain was}} expatiating {{in a low}} {{conversational}} tone to the chief mate upon the danger of these derelicts, and upon his dread of coming upon them at night, when suddenly a man forward screamed out, [...] "There's people on board of her, sir! I see them!" [...] in a most extraordinary voice--a voice never heard before in our ship; the amazing voice of a stranger. It gave the signal for a sudden tumult of shouts. The watch below ran up the forecastle head in a body, the cook dashed out of the galley. Everybody saw the poor fellows now. They were there! And all at once our ship, which had the well-earned name of being without a rival for speed in light winds, seemed to us to have lost the power of motion, as if the sea, becoming viscous, had clung to her sides. And yet she moved. Immensity, the inseparable companion of a ship's life, chose that day to breathe upon her as gently as a sleeping child. The clamour of our excitement had died out, and our living ship, famous for never losing steerage way {{as long as there}} was air enough to float a feather, stole, without a ripple, silent and white as a ghost, towards her mutilated and wounded sister, come upon at the point of death in the sunlit haze of a calm <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b>|$|E
60|$|No {{such small}} matter {{could affect the}} {{happiness}} of the successful traders. Five days more the ship lay in the lagoon, with little employment for any one but Tommy and the captain, for Topelius's natives discharged cargo and brought ballast. The time passed like a pleasant dream; the adventurers sat up half the night debating and praising their good fortune, or stayed by day in the narrow isle gaping like Cockney tourists, and {{on the first of}} the new year the Currency Lass weighed anchor for the second time and set sail for 'Frisco, attended by the same fine weather and good luck. She crossed the doldrums with but small delay; on a wind and in ballast of broken coral she outdid expectations; and, what added to the happiness of the ship's company, the small amount of work that fell on them to do was now lessened by the presence of another hand. This was the boatswain of the Leslie. He had been on bad terms with his own captain, had already spent his wages in the saloons of Butaritari, had wearied of the place, and while all his shipmates coldly refused to set foot on board the Currency Lass, he had offered to work his passage to the coast. He was a north of Ireland man, between Scotch and Irish, rough, loud, humorous, and emotional, not without sterling qualities, and an expert and careful sailor. His frame of mind was different indeed from that of his new shipmates. Instead of making an unexpected fortune he had lost a berth, and he was besides disgusted with the rations, and really appalled at the condition of the schooner. A stateroom door had stuck the first <b>day</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> and Mac (as they called him) laid his strength to it and plucked it from the hinges.|$|E
