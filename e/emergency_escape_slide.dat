50|$|The first {{prototype}} V-10 {{emerged with}} canted main undercarriage legs with single wheels {{on all four}} legs, {{as well as a}} retractable emergency escape chute extending below the cockpit and external auxiliary fuel tanks either side of the centre fuselage. As development progressed the main undercarriage legs were replaced with vertical units carrying twin wheels, twin nose undercarriage wheels after a period retaining the single wheels, an Auxiliary power unit (APU) installed behind the cockpit on the starboard side and <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> cables for use when the pallet is carried.|$|E
50|$|In the aircraft, {{many of the}} {{passengers}} were dazed from hitting their heads {{on the backs of}} the seats in front of them. Some passengers had difficulty unfastening their seatbelts because they were unfamiliar with the mechanism (it differs from the type used in car seatbelts). The purser went to announce instructions to {{the passengers}} but the public address system handset had been torn off. He then tried to open the left-side forward door, which was blocked by trees. The door opened partway, and the <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> began inflating while it was stuck partly inside the fuselage. The purser, a passenger, and a flight attendant (a guest from another airline) managed to push the door fully open. In the process, the purser and the passenger were thrown out of the fuselage with the slide landing on top of them. The flight attendant then began evacuating the passengers but they soon began to pile up at the bottom of the slide as their route was blocked by trees and branches. The egress of the passengers was temporarily halted while the purser and another flight attendant began clearing the branches. When the evacuation continued, the flight attendant stayed at the door, helping passengers, until she began suffering from smoke inhalation.|$|E
50|$|A {{collective}} {{of engineers}} led by Severin worked out some major principles and working prototypes of landing systems and rocket <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> for Vostok spacecraft.|$|R
50|$|Under his direction, {{the company}} {{developed}} space-suits, {{life support systems}} and rocket <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> <b>slides</b> for all USSR/Russia spacecraft and orbiting space stations, starting from Vostok 1, including the special inflatable EVA airlock of the Voskhod 2, an open space manoeuvring unit, etc.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} shows that emergency ground conditions for aircraft occur with su@&tt frequency to require <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> devices. The nature of these emergencies allows for a reasonable possibility of escape if care is taken in selection and design of escape provisions. For normal low-wing aircraft, the inpatable <b>escape</b> <b>slide</b> provides for reliable support during descent. Extensive experimental data are given for design qf overwing emergency exits and similar installations. These data show some significant relations t o body dimensions and agility of the subject. Standard methods are necessary for comparing escape exit tests in the future, if optimum design of exits and devices for minimum wekht and space requirements is to be achieved...|$|R

This <b>emergency</b> <b>escape</b> ramp that enables vehicles that are having braking problems to safely stop. It is typically a long, sand or gravel-filled lane adjacent to a road with a steep grade, and is designed to accommodate large heavy vehicles. The deep gravel allows the heavy vehicles momentum to be dissipated in a controlled and relatively harmless way, allowing the operator to stop it safely.|$|R
