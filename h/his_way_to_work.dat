He showed a keenness to fly, sound school leaving certificate qualifications and a good sporting record. After waiting two months, in August 1938 Brendan Finucane was ordered {{to report to the}} 6 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School at Sywell in Northamptonshire. He arrived on 28 August.|$|E
5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> (this proved {{impossible}} as the Afghans had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before {{the assault on the}} Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB agent, was given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E

5|$|New York Police linked rapper Fabolous to {{a crew of}} robbers who {{targeted}} Judah twice. According {{to police}} reports, the Street Fam Crew, the gang that attempted to rob Judah, {{is made up of}} 20members, all former drug dealers from Fabolous' Brooklyn neighborhood. In 2006, three men tried to rob Judah as he stood next to his Lamborghini on West 27th Street at 10th Avenue in New York City. The three men drove up to Judah in a minivan at about 5am, and came out. One man pulled a handgun on Judah, and told him to put his jewelry on the hood of his car, but Judah ran instead. The muggers followed in their minivan, but crashed into a tree a block away. All three robbers fled the scene, but one was captured by a Homeland Security agent on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and another was grabbed by a nearby cab driver.|$|E

25|$|Despite suspicions {{against him}} Brown was {{appointed}} to the newly formed Kidnap Squad. With prohibition over, local criminals turned to new sources of income. Racketeers Jack Piefer and Harry Sawyer suggested that the Barker-Karpis gang should move into kidnapping. They kidnapped wealthy businessman William Hamm. Brown informed them of plans by police to trap them. The ransom money was successfully collected, and a cut given to Brown. Another kidnapping followed. Edward Bremer, a local businessman, was snatched on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after dropping his daughter at school on January 15, 1934. The FBI became actively involved. When it became evident that leaks were coming from the local Kidnap Squad, Brown was isolated from the investigation.|$|E

The lane was only yards {{from her home in}} Langside Place. She had been raped and strangled. The {{previous}} night, she had told her parents that she was going out dancing at a nearby club, the Majestic Ballroom in Hope Street. Patricia had, in fact, gone to the Barrowland Ballroom for the over-25s night. It transpired that {{at some point during the}} night, Docker left the Majestic and ended up at the Barrowlands where it is thought she met her killer. It was several days after her murder that the police found out that she had actually gone to the Barrowlands. Focusing their investigation on the Majestic cost the police valuable time. Pat's handbag and clothes were missing and despite months of investigation, neither were ever found.|$|E

Six months out of school, he was in Joseph Papp's Central Park Shakespearean Productions festival, and next in The Comedians with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.

500|$|The first {{rehearsal}} in March 1942 {{was intended}} to be three hours long, but had to be stopped after 15 minutes because the 30 musicians present were too weak to play their instruments. They frequently collapsed during rehearsals, especially those playing brass instruments. Eliasberg himself had to be dragged to rehearsals on a sledge, and was eventually moved by Communist officials to an apartment nearby and given a bicycle for transport. His first attempts at conducting were like a [...] "wounded bird with wings that are going to drop at any moment". A report by Babushkin noted that [...] "the first violin is dying, the drum died on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> the French horn is at death's door...". Orchestral players were given additional rations (donated by civilian music enthusiasts) in an effort to combat starvation, and hot bricks were used to radiate heat; nevertheless, three performers died during rehearsals. Posters went up around the city requesting all musicians to report to the Radio Committee for incorporation into the orchestra. Performers were also recalled from the front or reassigned from Soviet military bands {{with the support of the}} Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, Leonid Govorov.|$|E
500|$|Itaru Hinoue, who had {{previously}} worked at VisualArt's once before, introduced Key's founding members {{to the president of}} VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998. With the production of Key's debut title Kanon still in its early stages, a brand name had still not been decided on by the developers. The tentative brand name was [...] at first, but Jun Maeda was not pleased with this and wanted a name that would capture the image of the brand. Maeda came upon the name Key when he saw it on a sign for a musical instrument store he would always pass on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> and instantly liked the name. The name Key for the studio was ultimately decided by majority rule. Key released Kanon on June 4, 1999 as an adult game, though the scenes containing adult content were kept to a minimum. This gave the player more of a focus on the characters' stories and on the visuals and music, especially for a visual novel {{at the time of its}} release. A year later, on September 8, 2000, Key released their second game Air, which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to Kanon.|$|E
