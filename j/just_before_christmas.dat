5|$|But {{the event}} could not mask the {{economic}} crisis into which Poland was drifting, exacerbated by Soviet demands for more military spending. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (<b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas),</b> the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source of hard currency when exported. The new measures were incomprehensible to many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.|$|E
5|$|Before Joy struck Australia, {{residents}} {{evacuated from}} resorts on Fitzroy and Green islands by boat or plane. Officials set up evacuation centres {{on the mainland}} and put the Australian Army on standby. The military evacuated its fleet of Blackhawk helicopters inland from RAAF Base Townsville. A man required rescue from Hope Island by helicopter {{in advance of the}} storm. The threat of the storm caused shopping malls and the airport near Cairns to close <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas.</b> Several flights were diverted or delayed, stranding about 1,000travellers, many of whom spent Christmas in the airport. Road travel was banned in some areas of northeastern Queensland, and residents in Port Douglas were forced to evacuate. The Flood Warning Centre in Brisbane issued 192flood warnings related to Cyclone Joy in December and January, beginning on 23December. Most of the warnings were related to increased water levels along rivers.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did not give it much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1142 Robert {{returned}} to Normandy to assist Geoffrey with operations against some of Stephen's remaining followers there, before returning in the autumn. Matilda came under increased pressure from Stephen's forces and was surrounded at Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the River Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping Matilda in the castle. Oxford Castle was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen decided to settle down for a long siege. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> Matilda sneaked out of the castle {{with a handful of}} knights (probably via a postern gate), crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape past the royal army to safety at Wallingford, leaving the castle garrison free to surrender the next day.|$|E
5|$|Wright's {{position}} in the band was tenuous to begin with, as he did not choose a definitive instrument, playing piano if a pub had one, otherwise settling on the trombone or rhythm guitar. He moved in with Waters and Mason to a house in Stanhope Gardens, Highgate, and they began serious rehearsals to become a professional group. Although Mason and Waters were competent students, Wright found architecture of little interest and after only a year of study moved to the London College of Music. He took a break from studies and travelled to Greece for a sabbatical. Their landlord, Mike Leonard, purchased a Farfisa organ and briefly replaced Wright in the band. However, the organ ultimately became Wright's main instrument. Through a friend, he arranged the fledgling group's first recording session in a West Hampstead studio, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas</b> 1964. Guitarists Bob Klose and Syd Barrett joined the band, which became Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1142 Stephen fell ill, and by Easter rumours had begun to circulate that he had died. Possibly this illness {{was the result of}} his imprisonment the previous year, but he finally recovered and travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully convince Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking some of the new Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham. In September, he spotted an opportunity to seize the Empress Matilda herself in Oxford. Oxford was a secure town, protected by walls and the river Isis, but Stephen led a sudden attack across the river, leading the charge and swimming part of the way. Once on the other side, the King and his men stormed into the town, trapping the Empress in the castle. Oxford Castle, however, was a powerful fortress and, rather than storming it, Stephen had to settle down for a long siege, albeit secure in the knowledge that Matilda was now surrounded. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas,</b> the Empress left the castle unobserved, crossed the icy river on foot and made her escape to Wallingford. The garrison surrendered shortly afterwards, but Stephen had lost an opportunity to capture his principal opponent.|$|E

5|$|Like most 2nd AIF units, the 2/4th drew its cadre {{staff of}} {{officers}} and senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) from volunteers from local Militia units. These were augmented by partially trained Other Ranks (ORs) {{from the three}} local recruit training depots; the first batch of these, numbering 394 men, arrived at Northam on 27 November and a further 262 marched in on 4 December. As the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 800 men, personnel were formed into four machine gun companies, 'A' to 'D', under a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons—including signals and anti-aircraft platoons—and battalion headquarters. There were no platoon commanders until a contingent arrived from the regional Officer Training Units. Initially training was hampered {{by a lack of}} equipment—only 12 of 48 Vickers machine guns assigned to the battalion were available—so at the start the focus was on individual rather than collective training. As more stores arrived, training accelerated with the help of experienced Militia NCOs and First World War veterans, who were brought in to share their experiences with the new troops. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas</b> and New Year's leave, the battalion received its distinctive Unit Colour Patch: a black and gold triangle.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1998, the RUF {{began to}} re-mobilise in {{northern}} Sierra Leone. As tensions escalated, the FCO ordered an evacuation of British citizens <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>Christmas.</b> Penfold believed the evacuation—the eighth of his career—was unnecessary and argued against it; his objections were over-ruled and {{he was ordered to}} evacuate his staff, though he was allowed to remain in Freetown with his military protection detail. The Royal Air Force evacuated approximately 35 people, but many British people chose to stay. Penfold travelled to Abidjan after Christmas for an international summit on Sierra Leone, but the FCO refused to allow him to return to Sierra Leone, so he again based himself in a hotel in Conakry. The RUF attacked Freetown on 6 January 1999. After 10 days of fighting, the rebels were pushed back and Penfold was transported back to Sierra Leone by a British warship. He flew to Freetown for daily meetings with Kabbah, but was not allowed to move back into his residence and so temporarily lived on the ship. Later in 1999, the Sierra Leone government entered into negotiations which resulted in the Lomé Peace Agreement. Penfold opposed power-sharing with the RUF, and believed he was excluded from the talks in Lomé because of his views. The agreement did not hold, and violence again broke out in early 2000.|$|E
