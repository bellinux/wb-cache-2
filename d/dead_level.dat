25|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a nine-man {{match for the}} WWE Cruiserweight Championship in which Gregory Helms defended the title against Brian Kendrick, Funaki, Kid Kash, Nunzio, Paul London, Psicosis, Scotty 2 Hotty and Super Crazy. In the beginning, Helms hid outside the ring but his opponents brought him into the ring and {{attacked}} him. Helms received a Sliced Bread #2 from Kendrick, a senton bomb from London and the Worm from Scotty. Psicosis pinned Helms but Kash broke the pin. Kash performed a <b>Dead</b> <b>Level</b> on Psicosis but Super Crazy broke up the pinfall by performing a moonsault. Helms pinned Psicosis to retain the title.|$|E

Ability insufficiently {{in shear}} {{is one of}} common trouble of old RC (reinforced concrete) beams, so {{scientific}} and reasonable shear resistant reinforcement method {{is one of the}} important research topics in the old bridge reinforcement and rehabilitation fields, and is of great significance in improving old bridge’s mechanical properties and reducing safe accidents. The shear resistant strengthening effect of strengthened beams with SWR (steel wire rope) external prestressing is studied under different <b>dead</b> load <b>level</b> and damage degree when strengthening, through the indoor experiment in shear. The results of the experiment shows: the width of diagonal cracks of the beams strengthened with SWR external prestressing become smaller and the yield load of stirrups is delayed, and the shear capacity is improved compared with basic beam. Both <b>dead</b> load <b>level</b> when strengthening and damage degree of original beams are the important factors influencing the shear resistant reinforcement effect, and with increasing of the <b>dead</b> load <b>level</b> and damage degree when strengthening, the improved amplitude of the yield load of stirrups and the shear bearing capacity are getting decreasing. The <b>dead</b> load <b>level</b> and damage degree when strengthening should be taken into account...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of Benjamin Disraeli's victory, Gladstone retired from the {{leadership}} of the Liberal party, although he retained his seat in the House. [...] In November 1874, he published the pamphlet The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance, directed at the First Vatican Council's dogmatising Papal Infallibility in 1870, which had outraged him. Gladstone claimed that this decree had placed British Catholics in a dilemma over conflicts of loyalty to the Crown. [...] He urged them to reject papal infallibility as they had opposed the Spanish Armada of 1588. The pamphlet sold 150,000 copies by the end of 1874. [...] A second pamphlet followed in Feb 1875, a defence of the earlier pamphlet and a reply to his critics, entitled Vaticanism: an Answer to Reproofs and Replies. [...] He described the Catholic Church as [...] "an Asian monarchy: nothing but one giddy height of despotism, and one <b>dead</b> <b>level</b> of religious subservience". He further claimed that the Pope wanted to destroy {{the rule of law and}} replace it with arbitrary tyranny, and then to hide these [...] "crimes against liberty beneath a suffocating cloud of incense".|$|E

40|$|The Dead Sea is a {{severely}} disturbed ecosystem, greatly damaged by anthropogenic inter-vention in its water balance. Since {{the beginning of}} the 20 th century, the <b>Dead</b> Sea <b>level</b> have dropped by more than 20 meters, and presently (2006) it is about 419 meters below mean sea level. The rate of water level drop over the last 10 years is about 1. 0 m/yr, repre-senting an annual water deficit of about 650 million cubic meters. The sharp level drop reflects the annual interception by riparian countries of over 1000 million cubic meters of freshwater which in the past drained to the Dead Sea. In addition to the water interception upstream, the Israeli and Jordanian mineral industries contribute to this deficit by arti-ficially maintaining extensive evaporation surfaces in the otherwise now dried southern Dead Sea basin.

The deserts of Australia and the ice-barrens of Greenland have no speech, for they have no venerable history; with nothing to tell of man and his vanities, his fleeting glories and his miseries, they have nothing wherewith to spiritualize their ugliness and veil it with a charm.|$|R

Supernatant and precipitate fractions were lyophilized, and known quantities were incubated with washed spermatozoa for 90 min at 40 to 41 C. All supernatants and precipitates significantly increased sperm 0 2 consumption within the PO intervals, but no differences were observed within a segment between the PO intervals. Generally, both fractions decreased postincubation sperm motility and increased the percentage of dead spermatozoa within the PO intervals, but no differ-ences were observed within a segment between the PO intervals. Magnal supernatants stimulated the least amount of O, consumption while maintaining postincubation sperm motility and percent-age <b>dead</b> <b>levels</b> comparable to control values. Sperm motility and percentage dead after incubation in infundibular supernatants were comparable to control levels yet stimulated Oa consumption about fourfold over that of controls.
