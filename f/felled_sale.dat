25|$|The natural {{boundaries}} of the fell are Bassenthwaite Lake to the east, Wythop Valley {{to the south and}} west, and the Vale of Embleton to the north. <b>Sale</b> <b>Fell</b> is a satellite of Lord's Seat, the highest of the hills north of Whinlatter. The connecting high ground runs south eastward above the shore of Bassenthwaite before turning inland to the summit of the parent fell. The connection is extremely tenuous, passing along a very narrow strip of land between Wythop Beck and Beck Wythop. These two streams run side by side down the slopes of Lord's Seat before diverging to surround <b>Sale</b> <b>Fell</b> on all sides. Wythop Beck is the main stream of the Wythop Valley, running west around <b>Sale</b> <b>Fell</b> and then out down the narrow wooded defile which stands between it and Ling Fell. Joining the Dubwath Beck it then flows eastward along the Vale of Embleton and into the northern end of Bassenthwaite. Beck Wythop by contrast cuts through the ridge of high ground running alongside Bassenthwaite, and drops directly into the lake.|$|R
