40|$|A giant planet {{embedded}} in a protoplanetary disk forms a gap. An analytic relationship among the <b>gap</b> <b>depth,</b> planet mass M_p, disk aspect ratio h_p, and viscosity α has been found recently, and the <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> can be written {{in terms of a}} single parameter K= (M_p/M_∗) ^ 2 h_p^- 5 α^- 1. We discuss how observed gap features can be used to constrain the disk and/or planet parameters based on the analytic formula for the <b>gap</b> <b>depth.</b> The constraint on the disk aspect ratio is critical in determining the planet mass so the combination of the observations of the temperature and the image can provide a constraint on the planet mass. We apply the formula for the <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> to observations of HL Tau and HD 169142. In the case of HL Tau, we propose that a planet with ≳ 0. 3 is responsible for the observed gap at 30 AU from the central star based on the estimate that the <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> is ≲ 1 / 3. In the case of HD 169142, the planet mass that causes the gap structure recently found by VLA is ≳ 0. 4 M_J. We also argue that the spiral structure, if observed, can be used to estimate the lower limit of the disk aspect ratio and the planet mass.

In order to determine possibilities, problems, perspectives, and threats to overcoming the gap by developing countries, the authors use the SWOT-analysis method. For studying the global economy's economic development disproportions, this research uses specially developed proprietary analysis of <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> in economic development.

As {{shown by}} the previous work, we confirm that the high spatial resolution (0. " 019, corresponding to 2. 7 AU) dust continuum images at λ = 0. 87, 1. 3, and 2. 9 mm exhibit a multiple ring-like gap structure in the circumstellar disk. Assuming that the observed gaps are opened up by currently forming, unseen bodies, we estimate the mass of such hypothetical bodies based on following two approaches; the Hill radius analysis and a more elaborated approach developed from the angular momentum transfer analysis in gas disks. For the former, the measured gap widths are used for calibrating {{the mass of the}} bodies, while for the latter, the measured <b>gap</b> <b>depths</b> are utilized. We show that their masses are likely comparable to or less than the mass of Jovian planets, and then discuss an origin of the observed gap structure. By evaluating Toomre's gravitational instability (GI) condition and cooling effect, we find that the GI might be a possible mechanism to form the bodies in the outer region of the disk. As the disk might be gravitationally unstable only in the outer region of the disk, inward planetary migration would be needed to construct the current architecture of the hypothetical bodies. We estimate the gap-opening mass and show that type II migration might be able to play such a role. Combining GIs with inward migration, we conjecture that all of the observed gaps may be a consequence of bodies that might have originally formed at the outer part of the disk, and have subsequently migrated to the current locations. While ALMA's unprecedented high spatial resolution observations can revolutionize our picture of planet formation, more dedicated observational and theoretical studies are needed in order to fully understand the HL Tau images.

40|$|It {{is known}} that an {{embedded}} massive planet will open a gap in a protoplanetary disc via angular momentum exchange with the disc material. The resulting surface density profile of the disc is investigated for one dimensional and two dimensional disc models and, in agreement with previous work, {{it is found that}} one dimensional gaps are significantly deeper than their two dimensional counterparts for the same initial conditions. We find, by applying one dimensional torque density distributions to two dimensional discs containing no planet, that the excitement of the Rossby wave instability and the formation of Rossby vortices {{play a critical role in}} setting the equilibrium depth of the gap. Being a two dimensional instability, this is absent from one dimensional simulations and does not limit the equilibrium <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> there. We find similar gap depths between two dimensional gaps formed by torque density distributions, in which the Rossby wave instability is present, and two dimensional planet gaps, in which no Rossby wave instability is present. This can be understood if the planet gap is maintained at marginal stability, even when there is no obvious Rossby wave instability present. Further investigation shows the final equilibrium <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> is very sensitive to the form of the applied torque density distribution, and using improved one dimensional approximations from three dimensional simulations can go even further to reducing the discrepancy between one and two dimensional models, especially for lower mass planets.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the first experimental results of confining miscible magnetic fluids in a rotating Hele-Shaw cell. Variations in {{the prominence of}} labyrinthine instabilities are observed under a range of experimental conditions, with different magnetic field strengths, gap depths, and rotation speeds. These instabilities are characterized by two modified Peclect numbers, namely, Pe(m) (the ratio of the characteristic magnetic advection rate and the diffusion rate) and Pe(C) (the ratio of characteristic rotation advection and the diffusion rate). The magnetic effect is characterized by dipolar repulsion, which triggers a distinctive fingering pattern differing from the progressive diffusion pattern that occurs without magnetic fields or rotation. Under the same rotation speed, the magnetoviscous effect will hinder {{the growth rate of}} the magnetic drops at the later stage. However, both the rotation effect and the <b>gap</b> <b>depth</b> greatly enhance the growth rate of the magnetic drops, as these conditions help to intensify the labyrinthine instabilities. In contrast, the countering pressure gradient produces an opposite force that constrains the trend toward expansion. Two major phases in the growth of instabilities are defined: a magnetization phase and a rotation phase, which are dominated by the magnetic and the rotation effect, respectively. The significance of the rotation effect is confirmed by the linear regression between the rotation growth rate and Pec.

40|$|Transitional disks around {{young stars}} are {{promising}} candidates {{to look for}} recently formed, embedded planets. Planet-disk interaction models predict that planets clear {{a gap in the}} gas while trapping dust at larger radii. Other physical mechanisms could be responsible for cavities as well. Previous observations have revealed that gas is still present inside these cavities, but the spatial distribution of this gas remains uncertain. We present high spatial resolution observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of 13 CO and C 18 O lines of four well-studied transitional disks. The observations are used to set constraints on the gas surface density, specifically cavity size and density drop inside the cavity. The physical-chemical model DALI is used to analyze the gas images of SR 21, HD 135344 B, DoAr 44 and IRS 48. The main parameters of interest are the size, depth and shape of the gas cavity. CO isotope-selective photodissociation is included to properly constrain the surface density in the outer disk from C 18 O emission. The gas cavities are up to 3 times smaller than those of the dust in all four disks. Model fits indicate that the surface density inside the gas cavities decreases by a factor of 100 - 10000 compared with the surface density profile derived from the outer disk. A comparison with an analytical model of <b>gap</b> <b>depths</b> by planet-disk interaction shows that the disk viscosities are likely low, with a< 1 E- 3 for planet masses < 10 MJup. The resolved measurements of the gas and dust in transition disk cavities support the predictions of models that describe how planet-disk interactions sculpt gas disk structures and influence the evolution of dust grains. These observed structures strongly suggest the presence of giant planetary companions in transition disk cavities, although at smaller orbital radii than is typically indicated from the dust cavity radii alone.
