Under our scheme, most receiver nodes only send negative acknowledgments to their repair nodes to request packet retransmissions while some representative nodes also send positive acknowledgments to indicate which packets can be discarded from the repair node’s buffer. Our scheme provides scalability because it significantly reduces the number of <b>feedbacks</b> <b>sent</b> by the receiver nodes. In addition, it provides fast recovery of transmission errors since the packets requested from the receiver nodes are almost always available in their buffers.

40|$|Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) {{has been}} shown to be a {{technique}} with several benefits, in particular when applied over wireless mesh networks, since it provides robustness against packet losses. On the other hand, Tunable Sparse Network Coding (TSNC) is a promising concept, which leverages a trade-off between computational complexity and goodput. An optimal density tuning function has not been found yet, due to the lack of a closed-form expression that links density, performance and computational cost. In addition, it would be difficult to implement, due to the feedback delay. In this work we propose two novel tuning functions with a lower computational cost, which do not highly increase the overhead in terms of the transmission of linear dependent packets compared with RLNC and previous proposals. Furthermore, we also broaden previous studies of TSNC techniques, by means of an extensive simulation campaign carried out using the ns- 3 simulator. This brings the possibility of assessing their performance over more realistic scenarios, e. g considering MAC effects and delays. We exploit this implementation to analyze the impact of the <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> by the decoder. The results, compared to RLNC, show a reduction of 3. 5 times in the number of operations without jeopardizing the network performance, in terms of goodput, even when we consider the delay effect on the <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> by the decoderThis work has been supported by the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional, FEDER) by means of the projects COSAIF, “Connectivity as a Service: Access for the Internet of the Future” (TEC 2012 - 38754 -C 02 - 01), and ADVICE (TEC 2015 - 71329 -C 2 - 1 -R).

We provide an analysis of our codes, including bounds on computational complexity and failure probability for a maximum likelihood decoder; the latter are tighter than bounds known for classical rateless codes. Through numerical simulations, we also show that feedback information paired with a nonuniform selection distribution can highly improve the symbol recovery rate, and that the amount of <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> can be tuned to the specific transmission properties of a given feedback channel.

In the latter case, we provide an achievable secrecy rate region and show that as long as the erasure event is not a probability 1 event, the transmitter can still transmit the confidential information with a positive secrecy rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We study {{an online}} random linear network coding {{approach}} for {{time division duplexing}} (TDD) channels under Poisson arrivals. We model {{the system as a}} bulk-service queue with variable bulk size and with feedback, i. e., when a set of packets are serviced at a given time, they might be reintroduced to the queue to form part of the next service batch. We show that there is an optimal number of coded data packets that the sender should transmit back-to-back before stopping to wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver. This number depends on the latency, probability of packet erasure, degrees of freedom at the receiver, the size of the coding window, and the arrival rate of the Poisson process. Random network coding is performed across a moving window of packets that depends on the packets in the queue, design constraints on the window size, and the <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> from the receiver. We study the mean time between generating a packet at the source and it being “seen”, but not necessarily decoded, at the receiver. We also analyze the mean time between a decoding event and the next, defined as the decoding of all the packets that have been previously “seen ” and those packets involved in the current window of packets. Inherently, a decoding event implies an inorder decoding of a batch of data packets. We present numerical results illustrating the trade-off between mean delay and mean time between decoding events.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{physical}} layer security {{builds on the}} pivotal idea of turning the channel's imperfections, such as noise and fading, into a source of security. This is established through appropriately designed coding techniques and signal processing strategies. In this vein, {{it has been shown}} that fading channels can enhance the transmission of confidential information and that a secure communication can be achieved even when the channel to the eavesdropper is better than the main channel. However, to fully benefit from what fading has to offer, the knowledge of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is of primordial importance. In practical wireless communication systems, CSIT is usually obtained, prior to data transmission, through CSI <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> by the receivers. The channel links over which this feedback information is sent can be either noisy, rate-limited, or delayed, leading to CSIT uncertainty. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent and ongoing research works on physical layer security with CSIT uncertainty. We focus on both information theoretic and signal processing approaches to the topic when the uncertainty concerns the channel to the wiretapper or the channel to the legitimate receiver. Moreover, we present a classification of the research works based on the considered channel uncertainty. Mainly, we distinguish between the cases when the uncertainty comes from an estimation error of the CSIT, from a CSI feedback link with limited capacity, or from an outdated CSI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This thesis {{presents}} an interactive Soapbox platform, which utilizes the networked public displays to encourage local citizens {{to participate in}} civic engagement. The Soapbox is comprised of three subsystems: Soapbox for speaker, Soapbox for audience and Shoutbox. Soapbox for speaker allows people to deliver {{a speech to the}} public. It also receives and displays the <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> by the audience. Soapbox for audience enables users to watch a speech and give feedback to it, such as thumbs-up, thumbs-down and report. The feedback will be synchronously sent to all connected public displays. Shoutbox is seen as an input tool that runs on personal devices, to edit comments and share them on the public displays. With Shoutbox, the local citizens can express their opinions and exchange ideas with the speaker and other audiences. In addition, the audience can also give thumbs-up or thumbs-down through Shoutbox. The Soapbox platform was evaluated in both the lab and the field. In the lab study, twelve participants were recruited to implement the prepared tasks and evaluate the system by filling a questionnaire generated by AttrakDiff. Apart from that, we conducted a short interview about their feeling of using the system. In the field trials, we deployed four public displays at the campus of the University of Oulu for seven weekdays, during which we conducted 28 h observations and interviewed 21 participants (seven speakers, fourteen audience members). The respondents were also asked to evaluate the system through a semi-structured questionnaire. In total, 23 speakers tried and experienced the system, and 39 audience members joined Shoutbox and sent 92 comments. We studied users’ behaviors when they interacted with the Soapbox platform. The evaluation shows that the users are curious and positive about trying Soapbox platform, and they can quickly grasp how to use it. The honey pot effect made a significant difference in increasing the number of speakers and audiences participating in civic engagement. The questionnaire results show that the Soapbox platform is perceived as a simple, practical, straightforward, predictable, stylish, attractive, inviting, appealing and motivating system. The chi-square test shows that during a speech, females tend to give more encouraging comments to speakers than males. We argue that the Soapbox’s design as a practical and stylish tool is very appropriate for its purpose, and believe that the interactive Soapbox platform can effectively attract more citizens to participate in the civic engagement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the contemporary research themes published in IJOPM in order to contribute to current debates about the future directions of operations management (OM) research. Design/methodology/approach All 310 articles published in IJOPM from volume 24 issue 9 in 2004 through volume 29, issue 12 in 2009 are analysed using content analysis methods. This period of analysis is chosen because it represents all the articles published in issues for which the authors are able to have full control, during their period of tenure as Editors of the journal. This analysis is supplemented by data on all 1, 853 manuscripts submitted to the journal during the same time period and further, by analysis of reviews and <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> to all authors after review. Findings The paper reports the main research themes and research methods inherent in the 310 published papers. Statistics on the countries represented by these papers and the size and international composition of author teams are provided, together with the publication success rates of the countries that submit in the highest volumes, and the success rates associated with the size of the author team. Finally, data on the reasons for rejection of manuscripts are presented. Research limitations/implications There is some residual inaccuracy in content analysis methods, whereby, in extracting research themes there is often more than one topic covered. In the same vein, as regards categorisation of the causes of rejection of manuscripts during the review process, there is frequently more than one reason for rejection, so perhaps a weighted scoring system would have been more insightful. In determining the country of origin of papers, while the country of the corresponding author is used, it should be recognised that some studies originate from international collaborations so that this method may give a slightly distorted picture. Finally, in computing publication success rates by comparison of submissions and published papers there is a time delay between the two data sets within any defined period of analysis. Practical implications The analysis adds generally to debates about contemporary research themes; in particular it extends the work of Pilkington and Fitzgerald, which analyses all articles solely in IJOPM between 1994 and 2003. In addition, the findings suggest a need for more frequent exploitation of multiple research methods, for greater rigour in the planning and execution of fieldwork, for greater engagement with the world of OM practice and finally, consideration of how OM research can address wider social and political issues. Originality/value This paper represents an inside view of the publication process from a leading OM journal; this kind of insight is rarely available in the public domain...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{transfer}} data reliably and with low delay over an unreliable service is intrinsic {{to a number}} of emerging technologies, including digital video broadcasting, over-the-air software updates, public/private cloud storage, and, recently, wireless vehicular networks. In particular, modern vehicles incorporate tens of sensors to provide vital sensor information to electronic control units (ECUs). In the current architecture, vehicle sensors are connected to ECUs via physical wires, which increase the cost, weight and maintenance effort of the car, especially as the number of electronic components keeps increasing. To mitigate the issues with physical wires, wireless sensor networks (WSN) have been contemplated for replacing the current wires with wireless links, making modern cars cheaper, lighter, and more efficient. However, the ability to reliably communicate with the ECUs is complicated by the dynamic channel properties that the car experiences as it travels through areas with different radio interference patterns, such as urban versus highway driving, or even different road quality, which may physically perturb the wireless sensors. This thesis develops a suite of reliable and efficient communication schemes built upon feedback-based rateless codes, and with a target application of vehicular networks. In particular, we first investigate the feasibility of multi-hop networking for intra-car WSN, and illustrate the potential gains of using the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP), {{the current state of the}} art in multi-hop data aggregation. Our results demonstrate, for example, that the packet delivery rate of a node using a single-hop topology protocol can be below 80 % in practical scenarios, whereas CTP improves reliability performance beyond 95 % across all nodes while simultaneously reducing radio energy consumption. Next, in order to migrate from a wired intra-car network to a wireless system, we consider an intermediate step to deploy a hybrid communication structure, wherein wired and wireless networks coexist. Towards this goal, we design a hybrid link scheduling algorithm that guarantees reliability and robustness under harsh vehicular environments. We further enhance the hybrid link scheduler with the rateless codes such that information leakage to an eavesdropper is almost zero for finite block lengths. In addition to reliability, one key requirement for coded communication schemes is to achieve a fast decoding rate. This feature is vital in a wide spectrum of communication systems, including multimedia and streaming applications (possibly inside vehicles) with real-time playback requirements, and delay-sensitive services, where the receiver needs to recover some data symbols before the recovery of entire frame. To address this issue, we develop feedback-based rateless codes with dynamically-adjusted nonuniform symbol selection distributions. Our simulation results, backed by analysis, show that feedback information paired with a nonuniform distribution significantly improves the decoding rate compared with the state of the art algorithms. We further demonstrate that amount of <b>feedback</b> <b>sent</b> can be tuned to the specific transmission properties of a given feedback channel...|$|E
