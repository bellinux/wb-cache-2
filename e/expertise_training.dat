50|$|Due to factory/genuine {{spare parts}} restrictions, an {{increasing}} minority of watchmakers in the USA are 'independent,' {{meaning that they}} choose not to work directly for industry or at a factory service center. One major Swiss watch brand (Rolex) now pre-qualifies independent watchmakers before they provide them with spare parts. This qualification may include, but is not limited to, holding a modern training certificate from one of several reputable schools; having a workshop environment that meets Rolex's standards for cleanliness; using modern equipment; and {{being a member of}} the American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute. The Omega brand has the same approach. However, the vast majority of modern, Swiss brands do not sell parts to independent watchmakers, irrespective of the watchmaker's <b>expertise,</b> <b>training</b> or credentials. This industry policy is thought to allow the Swiss manufacturers to maintain tighter quality control of the after-sales service for its watch brands, produce high margins on after sales services (2-4 times what an independent watchmaker would ask), and to lower second-hand watchmaking parts on the used and fake market.|$|E

30|$|The {{emergence}} of a holistic strategy with radiological experience has implications for training medical students. In our study, the expert radiologists acquired holistic strategies implicitly over many years of clinical experience, evaluating thousands, even {{tens of thousands of}} mammograms images. It is interesting to speculate whether this perceptual knowledge can be taught explicitly during medical training by presenting medical students with many images of abnormal and normal mammograms, asking them to judge the normality of each image and providing the appropriate feedback. A perceptual expertise protocol might accelerate the learning process and allow radiological trainees to achieve expert performance more quickly. The perceptual <b>expertise</b> <b>training</b> approach has been successfully applied in other medical domains that require visual diagnosis. For example, participants showed reliable gains in their ability to detect melanoma skin lesions after four 30 -min sessions of perceptual <b>expertise</b> <b>training</b> (Xu, Rourke, Robinson, & Tanaka, 2016).|$|E
