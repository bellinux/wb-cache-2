40|$|Military ground {{vehicles}} {{fires are}} a significant cause of system loss, equipment damage, and crew injury in both combat and non-combat situations. During combat, the ability to successfully fight an internal fire, without losing fighting and mobility capabilities, is often the key to crew survival and mission success. In addition to enemy hits in combat, vehicle fires are initiated by <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> <b>failures,</b> fuel line leaks, munitions mishaps and improper personnel actions.

40|$|Abstract — The {{reliability}} of the grid connected photovoltaic system is primarily and strongly depends on the {{reliability of}} the <b>electrical</b> protection <b>systems,</b> <b>failure</b> of which may lead to fire. So a fire detection system is the crucial component in a grid connected PV system. So its reliability is directed related to the overall {{reliability of the}} PV system. A literature review of reliability data of fire detection system was made resulting to rough estimates of some failure frequencies. No theoretical or technical articles on the structure of reliability models of these installations were found. In this paper the classifications of failure severity were made from the system point of view by counting failures of components when possible. Since there are no established fault tree structures available for fire detection system in photovoltaics, these component failure frequencies are intended {{to be used in the}} first round of iteration in the fault trees suggested here. The analysis leads to the necessity of the estimation of reliability of fire detection system for the assessment of {{the reliability of the}} grid connected photovoltaic power system...|$|R
40|$|The Delfi-C 3 {{nanosatellite}} successor, Delfi-n 3 Xt, {{is currently}} under development at Delft University of Technology. This nanosatellite {{based on a}} three-unit CubeSat form factor has been improved through {{the implementation of a}} high-speed downlink, three-axis active attitude control and a single-point-failure free implementation of batteries in the <b>electrical</b> power <b>system.</b> <b>Failure</b> of the batteries will therefore not lead to failure of the primary mission as has, in the past, been the case with many other nanosatellite missions. The functional analysis and design of the command and data handling system (CDHS) of Delfi-C 3 and the improved CDHS architecture of Delfi-n 3 Xt are presented in this paper. The main design drivers for the CDHS of Delfi-C 3 were the available technology and the absence of batteries. These design drivers enforced specific hardware components which, however, resulted in undesired behavior during integration and testing. In particular low-speed devices on the bus were suppressing the performance of the CDHS and the high-speed systems of Delfi-C 3. Delfi-n 3 Xt requires a higher performance since much more data will be produced by the five payloads, stored and sent down with a high-speed downlink. The architecture presented in this paper complies with this, while {{it is based on the}} architecture of Delfi-C 3. Space EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{pathology}} {{of sudden}} infant death syndrome (SIDS) is poorly understood. Many risk factors, including hypoxia, have been identified. Prolongation of the ECG QTc interval is associated with elevated risk of SIDS but its aetiology in most cases remains unknown. We have characterised ECG changes in the newborn mouse in the hours and days following birth. There was a steady increase in heart rate alongside significant decreases in QTc interval, QRS duration and QTc dispersion over the first 10 postnatal days. Birth into hypoxia (10 % FiO 2) prevented electrocardiac maturation, downregulated cardiac ion-channel expression and led to neonatal death. We found that risk of death decreased with increasing age of exposure to hypoxia. Genetic elevation of cardiac hypoxia-signalling after birth in αMHC-Cre::VHLfl/fl mice also prevented electrocardiographic maturation, leading to arrhythmia and death before weaning. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed internalisation and dephosphorylation of Connexin 43. We conclude that increased ambient oxygen concentration after birth drives maturation of the cardiac <b>electrical</b> conduction <b>system,</b> <b>failure</b> of which leads to aberrant ion channel and Connexin 43 expression and predisposes to arrhythmia and sudden death. This is consistent with known risk factors of SIDS and provides a link between neonatal hypoxia, ECG abnormalities and sudden death...|$|R
40|$|Incipient fault {{detection}} in the Transformer Rectifier Unit (TRU) can prompt early preparedness for replacement of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) {{thereby reducing the}} downtime of the aircraft. This paper describes a novel incipient {{fault detection}} and fault localization method of TRU {{in the context of}} an aircraft <b>electrical</b> <b>system.</b> Results from <b>Failure</b> Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) study identified diode failure as the primary reason for failure of TRU. The incipient fault detection of TRU is done by applying data fusion algorithm. The algorithm uses Hilbert transform as one of the computing tools to derive Health Index Parameter (HIP). Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and wavelet transforms were used for fault localization of the component within the TRU. The developed incipient fault detection method is validated on a TRU test rig.

40|$|Electrical energy {{plays an}} {{indispensable}} {{role in our}} contemporary society. However, we mostly realize its position in agriculture in a situation which often already entails irreversible consequences. Therefore, the thesis aims to assess the consequences of power blackout on agricultural farming. In connection with the selected objective, a question arises whether long-term power blackouts also constitute {{a serious threat to}} agricultural farms of South Bohemia? The theoretical part briefly describes electrical energy, its production and method of transmission. It also includes basic elements of the power system including its stability and safety. The chapter also acquaints the reader with the critical infrastructure of the Czech Republic and its legislative base. Then, it globally analyzes the term blackout. Given the topic of the thesis, it is necessary to mention the valuable work of the integrated rescue system which in addition to the basic obligations to ensure the protection of human life and property is required to provide missions to rescue animals in emergency situations. Finally, this chapter deals with the application of electrical energy in agriculture, including the characteristics of surveyed farms and a high degree of automation used in farming. The research part is based on the search of the current state of selected agricultural farms. The research was focused on the South Bohemian Region which makes no exception in relation to this issue. Used for the research was a qualitative method of data collection with the information obtained through the techniques of controlled interviews and the secondary analysis of data provided by competent employees of farms in South Bohemia. The results are then outlined in two planes. During recent years, breeding stations have been completely renovated, especially in the section of technological processes. Modern electronic devices which include e. g. automated milking, feeding, suction and washing equipment, heating of service water and heating, should ensure trouble-free operation in such farms. However, what the vast majority of farms is not adequately prepared for is to ensure their smooth operation even during a <b>failure</b> of the <b>electrical</b> <b>system.</b> A number of farms do not have an alternate source of electrical energy. The percentage of self-sufficient farms having on its premises a pumping station that can supply the local diesel-aggregate, is also negligible. Moreover, in case of a diesel-aggregate failure, no alternative source is available. A crucial problem arises in the category of poultry. The animals are situated in large-volume halls where all processes are controlled by fully automated control systems. An alternative source of electrical energy is a crucial element needed to ensure normal operation of the farms. Unless the established criteria are in compliance (ventilation, lighting, etc.), reaction of the animals becomes evident within tens of minutes. Any deviation results in rapid loss of animals. It is assumed that the resulting data will be used both for research purposes in the area of secondary impacts in case of <b>electrical</b> <b>system</b> <b>failures</b> and for objective assessment of the effectiveness in farming security within the current methods.
