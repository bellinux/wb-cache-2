50|$|Paste {{reservoir}} dispenses {{a measured}} amount of specified resin paste onto a plastic <b>carrier</b> <b>film.</b> This <b>carrier</b> <b>film</b> passes underneath a chopper which cuts the fibers onto the surface. Once these have drifted through {{the depth of}} resin paste, another sheet is added on top which sandwiches the glass. The sheets are compacted and then enter onto a take-up roll, {{which is used to}} store the product whilst it matures. The <b>carrier</b> <b>film</b> is then later removed and the material is cut into charges. Depending on what shape is required determines the shape of the charge and steel die which it is then added to. Heat and pressure act on the charge and once fully cured, this is then removed from the mould as the finished product. Fillers both reduce weight and change the physical properties, typically adding strength. Production challenges include wetting the filler, which could consist of glass microspheres or aligned fibers rather than random chopped fibers; adjusting die temperature and pressure to provide the proper geometry; and adjusting chemistry to end use.|$|R
