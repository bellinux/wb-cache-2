Hero threw herself from the tower in grief and died as well. The name Maiden's Tower might also have its origins in this ancient story.|$|E

On the other hand, though, the weather conditions were harsher than they had been up at No. 2 Section, and the Ottoman troops were more active in their attempts at sabotage and air raids were common.|$|E

25|$|General MacArthur {{wanted to}} fight his way with Allied troops to {{liberate}} Java in 1944–45 but was ordered not to by the joint chiefs and President Roosevelt. The Japanese occupation thus officially ended with Japanese surrender in the Pacific and two days later Sukarno declared Indonesian Independence. However Indonesian forces would spend {{the next four years}} fighting the Dutch for independence. American restraint from fighting their way into Java certainly saved many Japanese, Javanese, Dutch and American lives. On the other hand, Indonesian independence would have likely been achieved more swiftly and smoothly had MacArthur had <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> American troops occupied Java. A later UN report stated that four million people died in Indonesia {{as a result of the}} Japanese occupation. About 2.4 million people died in Java from famine during 1944–45.|$|E
