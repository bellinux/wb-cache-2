40|$|This study {{investigated}} the surface hardening of steels via experimental tests using a multi-kilowatt fiber laser as the laser source. The influence of laser power and laser power density on the hardening effect was investigated. The microhardness analysis of various laser hardened steels was done. A thermodynamic model was developed to evaluate the thermal process of the surface treatment of a wide thin steel plate with a Gaussian laser beam. The effect of laser linear oscillation hardening (LLOS) of steel was examined. An as-rolled ferritic-pearlitic steel and a tempered martensitic steel with 0. 37 wt% C content were hardened under various laser power levels and laser power densities. The optimum power density that produced the maximum hardness {{was found to be}} dependent on the laser power. The effect of laser power density on the produced hardness was revealed. The surface hardness, <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> and required laser power density were compared between the samples. Fiber laser was briefly compared with high power diode laser in hardening medium-carbon steel. Microhardness (HV 0. 01) test was done on seven different laser hardened steels, including rolled steel, quenched and tempered steel, soft annealed alloyed steel and conventionally through-hardened steel consisting of different carbon and alloy contents. The surface hardness and <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> were compared among the samples. The effect of grain size on surface hardness of ferritic-pearlitic steel and pearlitic-cementite steel was evaluated. In-grain indentation was done to measure the hardness of pearlitic and cementite structures. The macrohardness of the base material was found {{to be related to the}} microhardness of the softer phase structure. The measured microhardness values were compared with the conventional macrohardness (HV 5) results. A thermodynamic model was developed to calculate the temperature cycle, Ac 1 and Ac 3 boundaries, homogenization time and cooling rate. The equations were numerically solved with an error of less than 10 - 8. The temperature distributions for various thicknesses were compared under different laser traverse speed. The lag of the was verified by experiments done on six different steels. The calculated thermal cycle and <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> were compared with measured data. Correction coefficients were applied to the model for AISI 4340 steel. AISI 4340 steel was hardened by laser linear oscillation hardening (LLOS). Equations were derived to calculate the overlapped width of adjacent tracks and the number of overlapped scans in the center of the scanned track. The effect of oscillation frequency on the <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> was investigated by microscopic evaluation and hardness measurement. The homogeneity of hardness and <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> with different processing parameters were investigated.

Experimental analysis aims at clarifying effect of different laser processing parameters on properties and performance of laser surface treated specimens. Numerical analysis is concerned with analytical approaches that provide efficient tools for estimation of surface temperature, surface hardness and <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> {{as a function of}} laser surface hardening parameters. Results indicated that optimization of laser processing parameters including laser power, laser spot size and processing speed combination is of considerable importance for achieving maximum surface hard ness and deepest hardened zone. In this concern, higher laser power, larger spot size and lower processing speed are more efficient. Hardened zone with 1. 25 mm depth and 996 HV surface hardness was obtained using 1800 W laser power, 4 mm laser spot size and 0. 5 m /min laser processing speed. The obtained maximum hardness of laser surface treated specimen is 23 % higher than that of conventionally heat treated specimen. This in turn has resulted in 30 % in crease in wear resistance of laser surface treated specimen. Numerical analysis has been carried out for calculation of temperature gradient and cooling rate based on Ashby and Easterling equations. Then, surface hardness and <b>hardened</b> <b>depth</b> have been numerically estimated based on available Design-Expert software. Numerical results indicated that cooling rate of laser surface treated specimen is high enough to be beyond the nose of the CCT diagram of the used steel that in turn resulted in a hard/martensitic structure.
