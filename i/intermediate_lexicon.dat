30|$|The lexicon {{extension}} and filtering experiment is conducted by taking each entry of initial seed cache and performing boot-strap operation to expand it over its synonyms by searching them in web-lexicon (WL). As {{there could be}} number of redundant words, we filter them using co-reference PMI score. Resultantly, we get <b>intermediate</b> <b>lexicon,</b> namely HL- 2. A partial list of entries of <b>intermediate</b> <b>lexicon</b> is shown in Table  5.|$|E
30|$|The boot-strapping {{component}} aims at {{acquiring a}} large collection of opinion words from a manually compiled seed list of medical terms (HL- 1). In first iteration, we expand the seed list over a web lexicon, expanded list is passed through filtering module tod is card the irrelevant entries {{on the basis}} of Co-reference PMI measure with user-defined threshold. It results in <b>intermediate</b> <b>lexicon,</b> namely HL- 2. In next phase, each of the filtered word is searched in medical lexicon, namely Unified Modelling Language (UMLS) (Bodenreider 2004). The matched words are tagged with the corresponding UMLS-ID.|$|E
40|$|Since {{its first}} edition was {{published}} in 1843, Liddell and Scott's Greek-English lexicon has reigned supreme in the English-speaking world. It has gone through nine editions and is now flanked by supplements, an abridged lexicon (1843) and an <b>intermediate</b> <b>lexicon</b> (1889). The lexicon has been criticised and commented on by classical scholars and enthusiastic amateurs {{for more than a}} century, and over the same period has become an institution, an authoritative companion to learners and the learned alike. The survival of correspondence, editorial files and production data in the archives of Oxford University Press make it possible to trace a history of revision in which the scholarly concern for accuracy and the reader's desire for clear exposition have often been in tension with the logistics and economics of printing and publishing...|$|E

The paper first gives {{a brief overview of}} the main difficulties with defining and classifying particle verbs in Estonian (the difference between noun-verb combinations and adverb-verb combinations; verbal particle (afiksaaladverb) as a separate word class in Estonian, etc.). The second part of the paper presents the results of a prosodic study. The study has two primary aims: 1. To ascertain whether we can use prosody to investigate the grammatical status of verb-particle combinations, and 2. to contribute to the discussion of the lexical vs. syntactic nature of compositional verb-particle combinations in Estonian. The results of the study suggest that complex predicates and syntactics phrases are prosodically different, and, consequently, that prosodic analysis {{can be used as a}} method to study the lexical vs. phrasal status of verb-particle combinations. As to the status of compositional verb-particle combinations, the results support their treatment as complex predicates rather than phrases. The results further suggest that elements that are <b>intermediate</b> between <b>lexicon</b> and syntax may also be in some sense located on a prosodic continuum...|$|R
40|$|We {{address in}} this paper some {{problems}} related to the reuse for NLP of LADL's Lexicon-Grammar (LG). This major source of French verbs lexical knowledge has been publicly available on the Internet for several years. However, {{it has not been}} used by the NLP community, mainly because of its format: ASCII files each of them containing a table with binary values (+/Γ). The interpretation of these tables is non trivial because large parts of the linguistic informations they contain are neither explicit nor represented in a uniform manner. The paper presents 3 aspects of the research: (1) The translation of LG into a PATR-II <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Lexicon</b> (IL). The aim of this translation is to normalize and to represent explicitly the lexical properties encoded in LG tables. IL representations are independent of any particular linguistic theory. (2) IL is used to generate lexicons for NLP applications based on unification grammars. We have build an HPSG lexicon used within the ALEP system to parse French, and a TAG lexicon used for French text generation. These lexicons are dual of one another since, for a each entry, the first represents the properties that hold while the later represents the ones that do not hold. The generation of these lexicons raises interesting questions regarding the lexicon organization in these theories. (3) The evaluation of LG coverage on a corpus. This evaluation uses a French shallow parser able to recognize quite precisely the constituents that the verbs take as arguments. The lexical descriptions of the verbs can then be saturated in order to recognize the phrases headed by these verbs...|$|E
40|$|Document {{design and}} {{typeface}} design: A typographic specification {{for a new}} <b>Intermediate</b> Greek-English <b>Lexicon</b> by CUP, accompanied by typefaces modified for the specific typographic requirements of the text. The Lexicon is a substantial (over 1400 pages) publication for HE students and academics intended to complement Liddell-Scott (the standard reference for classical Greek since the 1850 s), {{and has been in}} preparation for over a decade. The typographic appearance of such works has changed very little since the original editions, largely to the lack of suitable typefaces: early digital proofs of the Lexicon utilised directly digitised versions of historical typefaces, making the entries difficult to navigate, and the document uneven in typographic texture. Close collaboration with the editors of the Lexicon, and discussion of the historical precedents for such documents informed the design at all typographic levels to achieve a highly reader-friendly results that propose a model for this kind of typography. Uniquely for a work of this kind, typeface design decisions were integrated into the wider document design specification. A rethinking of the complex typography for Greek and English based on historical editions as well as equivalent bilingual reference works at this level (from OUP, CUP, Brill, Mondadori, and other publishers) led a redefinition of multi-script typeface pairing for the specific context, taking into account recent developments in typeface design. Specifically, the relevant weighting of elements within each entry were redefined, as well as the typographic texture of type styles across the two scripts. In details, Greek typefaces were modified to emphasise clarity and readability, particularly of diacritics, at very small sizes. The relative weights of typefaces typeset side-by-side were fine-tuned so that the visual hierarchy of the entires was unambiguous despite the dense typesetting. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the article {{is an attempt to}} analyze the meaning and scope of the term "periechontology" and to show how it affects the whole philosophy of Karl Jaspers. In order to do this I concentrate on determining the basic feature of the whole of Jaspers' philosophy, which will allow me to demonstrate how the term and the whole philosophy interact with each other. This analysis will show the mutual relation between part and the whole as a kind of dialectic discourse which can lead us to a conclusion that no part of the dialectic relationship exists in isolation from the other. When we apply these methodological observations to Jaspers' philosophy of existence, it appears that the fusion of the part and the whole which we find at the core of a dialectical relationship, is not only a methodological but also a substantive feature of Jaspers' concept of human being. Man is necessarily related to the world and this makes them two sides of one dialectic process. Therefore, whenever we make a distinction between the subject and the object of knowledge, we break the original unity which resides at the basis for all human-world relationships. The analysis of this original unity shows that the basis itself is not something to be known. As an origin of all objectivity or subjectivity it eludes cognition and is not to be reached directly. This unknowability causes a need for indirect knowledge which can be achieved with the help of “philosophical faith” and by exceeding the subject- -object relationship in the direction of its basis. This indirect approach (“philosophical faith” and description of the all-encompassing being) is a characteristic feature that is the first clue on the way to determine the meaning and scope of “periechontology”. The second part of the article will include the ways of understanding of the term “periechontology” itself: from Elżbiata Wolicka's interpretation included in her introduction to the Polish translation of Der philosophische Glaube angesichts der Offenbarung, to the meanings of the term stated in An <b>Intermediate</b> Greek-English <b>Lexicon</b> and prepared {{on the basis of the}} seventh edition (1882) of LSJ. This part also discusses the semantic references of the term “periechontology” and its divine origins. Finally, a summary of the two previous parts will allow us to identify two main aspects of the term and its meaning. The first aspect which refers to meta-philosophical sources of Jaspers' philosophy, shows us “periechontology” as an attempt to revitalize philosophy and re-direct it to its source – the all-encompassing being. The second aspect of the term can be determined by the comparison with the other, historically grounded terms for “knowledge of being”. Names like “ontology” or “metaphysics” refer to a certain kind of knowledge of being which cannot (as knowledge) be achieved on the basis of Jaspers' philosophy. Insufficiency of historically grounded terms makes it necessary for Jaspers to create his own name and theory for knowledge of all-encompassing being. In the end, “periechontology” is Jaspers' response to this need. Zeszyty Naukowe TDU...|$|R
