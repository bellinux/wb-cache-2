2500|$|The {{forests of}} the {{district}} abound {{in a variety of}} animals and birds and are excellent wildlife habitats. Elephants, bison, monkeys and rare species of reptiles have the place of prominence in them. The Neyyar reservoir and nearby areas abound in wild life. Nestled in the lap of the Western Ghats, a wildlife sanctuary is quickly growing over an area of nearly [...] around this reservoir. The forest under the Kulathupuzha range is the habitat of rare species of snakes and lizards. Mammals are well represented in the district. Nilgiri langur, the lion-tailed macaque, the Nilgiri <b>brown</b> <b>mongoose</b> and the Malabar civet are characteristic to this region. Carnivores include: tiger, wild cat, jackal, leopard and wild dog. Sloth bear, gaur, a few species of deer and elephants are also seen. Reptiles include snakes, lizards, crocodiles and tortoises.

40|$|Different {{varieties}} of finger millet (Eleusine coracana Gaertn.) were screened for esterase activity colorimetrically and electrophoretically using 1 -naphthyl acetate and acetylthiocholine chloride as substrates. The <b>Indian</b> <b>brown</b> seed coat variety (Purna), the Indian white seed coat variety (Hamsa), hybrids of these designated as HPB (brown) and HPW (white), African varieties (brown) and Indian-African hybrid varieties (brown) all exhibited 1 -naphthyl acetate hydrolysing activity and showed 6, 5, 6, 5, 8 and 8 esterolytic bands respectively on gel electrophoresis. The white seed coat varieties, both parental (Hamsa) and hybrid (HPW), did not possess any acetylthiocholine chloride hydrolysing activity {{while all the}} brown seed coat varieties did, the African varieties having greater activities than <b>Indian</b> <b>brown</b> seed coat varieties.

It most closely resembles the mongooses with its long snout and low body, though its colouration is plain and <b>brown</b> (most <b>mongooses</b> have colouring schemes such as striping, banding, or other variations on the hands and feet).|$|R

40|$|Bivalves are {{constantly}} exposed to {{different kinds of}} stressors as {{they live in a}} habitat with frequent changes in environmental parameters. The xenobiotic pollutants also contribute to the stressful routine of bivalves. Studies on the genes which mediate and contribute to the physiological plasticity of bivalves in stressful situations, induced by natural and anthropogenic agents are gaining importance. Among the stress related genes, HSP family genes {{play an important role in}} managing stress induced by various factors. Recent reports underline the role of heat shock proteins in thermo tolerance, host defense and even in aging. Here we report the molecular expression and detection of heat shock protein genes (Hsp 70) from the Indian edible oyster Crassostrea madrasensis and the <b>Indian</b> <b>brown</b> mussel Perna indica with unique distribution in Indian waters. The c- DNA reverse transcribed from the total RNA of gill was used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify Hsp 70 gene segments with primers designed from the conserved nucleotide sequences of Crassostrea gigas and Perna viridis. PCR products were sequenced, and the similarity search in NCBI-BLAST confirmed the molecular identity of targeted genes. Phylogenetic analysis of the Hsp gene sequence data reveals the unique position of the Indian edible oyster and <b>Indian</b> <b>brown</b> mussel among the other counterparts inhabiting rest of the world. This stands out as the first report on the expression and PCR amplification of stress related genes from Indian bivalves...|$|R
