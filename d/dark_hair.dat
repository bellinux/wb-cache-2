5|$|The {{art critic}} Hugh Davies has {{suggested}} that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross. Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has an elongated neck, heavily rounded shoulders, and a thick mop of <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> Like its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Scientists also {{view the}} ability to grow very long hair {{as a result of}} sexual selection, since long and healthy hair is a sign of {{fertility}} and youth. An evolutionary biology explanation for this attraction is that hair length and quality can act as a cue to youth and health, signifying a woman's reproductive potential. As hair grows slowly, long hair may reveal 2–3 years of a person's health status, nutrition, age and reproductive fitness. Malnutrition and deficiencies in minerals and vitamins due to starvation causes loss of hair or changes in hair color (e.g. <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> turning reddish).|$|E

5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, Kai and Martin {{became known}} as The Glamour Girls, and she {{underwent}} an image change that involved bleaching her <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> platinum blonde {{at the suggestion of}} their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face the Fabulous Moolah's team. Martel's team—Martel, the Glamour Girls, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christanello—lost to The Fabulous Moolah's team—Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin' Robin, and the Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women's Tag Team Championship. The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988, with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold. Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women's division.|$|E
5|$|The {{way this}} man's <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> grows, with the sharp {{dip in the}} middle of his high forehead, as though concentrating there all the energy of the {{masculine}} M, makes his face different from all the others. His coal-black eyes are rigidly focused in a gaze that expresses compelling force. The nose is unusually long and boldly curved. The mouth is wide and sensual, but the lips are firmly shut in a straight line, the corners strongly marked and tightened into final points, and this strengthens the impression — already suggested by the eyes — of a strong controlling will. It is an extraordinarily fascinating face, reminding us of faces of famous men, especially of Machiavelli's; and indeed the whole aspect of the head suggests something Mediterranean, as though this man had acquired his frank, searching, superior air at Italian academies.|$|E
50|$|The nymphs have <b>dark</b> <b>hairs</b> and {{thickened}} basal antennal segments. They are reddish or pinkish-white-coloured.|$|R

5|$|When {{drawing the}} manga series, Kubo commented that Rukia Kuchiki, the first Bleach {{character}} he introduced, was {{originally intended to}} be the protagonist. Through subsequent development of the series, however, Kubo decided to make her a valued ally and instead introduced Ichigo as the central character. Initial design sketches show Ichigo wearing glasses, and having <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and softer eyes. When designing Rukia, however, Kubo modified Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair, a trademark scowl, and removing the glasses. During the series' first chapter, Ichigo's wristwatch was based on one Kubo himself wore at the time. In later chapters, his wristwatch was based on Naoto Fukasawa's W11K cellphone. According to Kubo, Ichigo, along with Orihime Inoue, are the most arduous characters to sketch. While illustrating one of Ichigo's scenes, Kubo found it awkward to draw him with a cheerful smile.|$|E

25|$|Alan George Hurst (born 15 July 1950 at Altona, Victoria) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in twelve Tests and eight ODIs between 1975 and 1979. A muscular, broad-shouldered man with a shock of <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and a big moustache, Alan Hurst fit the {{archetype}} of Australian fast bowler, 1970s style.|$|E
25|$|In the American {{mass media}} {{as well as}} popular culture, Hispanic is often {{incorrectly}} used to describe a subject's race or physical appearance. In general, Hispanics are assumed to have traits such as <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and eyes, and brown or olive skin. Many others are viewed as physically intermediate between whites, blacks and/or Amerindians.|$|E
25|$|The Gilbert and Sullivan {{operetta}} Patience pokes {{fun at the}} Aesthetic movement, and {{the lead}} character of Reginald Bunthorne is often identified as a send-up of Oscar Wilde, though Bunthorne is more likely an amalgam of several prominent artists, writers, and Aesthetic figures. Bunthorne wears a monocle and has prominent white streaks in his <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> as did Whistler.|$|E

50|$|Adult size is 7.5 - 8.0 mm. The {{species have}} {{longitudinal}} furrow between the eyes, and are yellowish-green. Their prothorax is unpunctured and smooth, with dense <b>dark</b> <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Black <b>hair</b> is the <b>darkest</b> <b>hair</b> color. It has {{large amounts}} of eumelanin and is less dense than other hair colors. It can range from brown-black, blue-black, red-black, or jet-black.|$|R
25|$|The {{narcissus}} {{is perceived}} in the West {{as a symbol}} of vanity, in the East {{as a symbol of}} wealth and good fortune (see Eastern cultures). In classical Persian literature, the narcissus is a symbol of beautiful eyes, together with other flowers that equal a beautiful face with a spring garden, such as roses for cheeks and violets for shining <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
25|$|Melanie Chisholm: Chisholm (also called Mel C) {{was called}} Sporty Spice because she usually wore a {{tracksuit}} paired with athletic shoes, wore her long <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> {{in a high}} ponytail, and sported a tough girl attitude as well as tattoos on both of her arms. She also possessed true athletic abilities, her signature being her ability to perform back handsprings.|$|E
25|$|This dance {{has evolved}} into several {{variations}} to tell stories of other combat such as David vs. Goliath, but the most common alternative relates to the Conquest of Mexico called Dance of the Marquis, Tastoanes or Comanches. In general, those playing the Spanish wear masks, while those playing the indigenous do not. Cortes is usually portrayed with abundant masses of <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and beard due to the historical descriptions of the first Europeans seen by the indigenous.|$|E
5000|$|Anna Weding, 24 years old, Cornelia's elder sister. Has the <b>darker</b> <b>hair</b> {{and skin}} than Cornelia. Brave, {{straightforward}} and outspoken. Her and a lieutenant Sofus Hallgren are seeing each other.|$|R
5000|$|Unrelated {{patterns}} may {{be confused}} with Bend-Or spots. Some roan horses have patches of <b>darker</b> <b>hairs</b> called [...] "corn marks" [...] or [...] "corn spots." [...] While these resemble Bend-Or spots, they are linked to solid-colored hair growing in over minor cuts or scratches to the skin, and thus the underlying genetic cause appears to be unrelated. Another pattern seen primarily in some gray horses is dappling, the presence of <b>darker</b> <b>hairs</b> in round shapes against a lighter hair coat. However, dapples are an intermediate stage of the graying process, and will only last a few years.|$|R
50|$|Assail, son of Assail, is {{the size}} of a Brother, has <b>darker</b> <b>hair</b> than Vishous’ black, and looks like a dangerous, sensual vampire. He speaks with a high-class Old Language accent and enjoys Cuban cigars.|$|R
