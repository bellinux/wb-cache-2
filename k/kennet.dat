5|$|The <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal is a canal in {{southern}} England. The name may refer {{to either the}} route of the original <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Company, which linked the River <b>Kennet</b> at Newbury to the River Avon at Bath, or to the entire navigation between the River Thames at Reading and the Floating Harbour at Bristol, including the earlier improved river navigations of the River <b>Kennet</b> between Reading and Newbury and the River Avon between Bath and Bristol.|$|E
5|$|The River <b>Kennet</b> is navigable from Newbury {{downstream}} to {{the confluence}} with the River Thames at <b>Kennet</b> Mouth, in Reading.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, trade {{along the}} canal commenced; goods {{initially}} {{had to be}} unloaded at Foxhangers {{at the bottom of}} what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a horse-drawn railway, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £29s6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £63s to £7 per ton, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Company bought the <b>Kennet</b> Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at <b>Kennet</b> Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the <b>Kennet</b> Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.|$|E

5|$|Some 700 metres below Pulteney weir, {{the river}} is joined by the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal which connects through Bath Locks. Together with the <b>Kennet</b> Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading, this {{provides}} a through route for canal boats from Bristol to London. From this point downstream {{the river is}} known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 August 1906 Leopard {{collided}} with a buoy in the Hamoaze, but not before she hit the destroyer [...] in {{trying to avoid the}} buoy. Leopard was holed below the waterline, requiring the ship to be docked for repair, while <b>Kennets</b> rudder was damaged. Leopard had her boilers retubed again at Portsmouth Dockyard in July 1908, missing that year's Naval Manoeuvres. In 1910 Leopard formed part of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, tendered to the depot ship [...] at Devonport, and was still part of that Flotilla in 1912. A reorganisation of the Royal Navy's destroyer force took place in 1912, with older destroyers, no longer suitable for fleet use, being used to equip Patrol Flotillas, with Leopard forming part of the 7th Flotilla at Devonport.|$|R
5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} survey was {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of the}} canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17April 1794 the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.|$|E
5|$|The 18th century saw the {{beginning}} of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the brewing trade for which Reading was to become famous. Reading's trade benefited from better designed turnpike roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to Oxford and the West Country. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the <b>Kennet</b> Navigation opened the River <b>Kennet</b> to boats as far as Newbury. Opposition stopped when it became apparent that the new route benefited the town. After the opening of the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal in 1810, one could go by barge from Reading to the Bristol Channel. From 1714, and probably earlier, the role of county town of Berkshire was shared between Reading and Abingdon.|$|E

In 1922, she married Edward Hilton Young, later Lord <b>Kennet</b> (rendering her Lady <b>Kennet),</b> and remained a doughty defender of Scott's reputation until her death, aged 69, in 1947.|$|E
5000|$|The earlier medieval {{house on}} the site belonged to the Blakiston Family from c.1400 to 1600, and {{afterwards}} to the <b>Kennets</b> and the Earls of Seaforth. John Burdon, responsible for rebuilding the house, also created the landscape gardens at Hardwick Hall, near Sedgefield. The house was bought by the East Hetton Colliery Company in 1938 and was used to house Italian and German prisoners-of-war in WW2. The hall was condemned as unsafe by the National Coal Board and demolished in 1956, leaving the ground plan and service yard still visible. Cellars are now filled with rubble and appear to contain much decorative plaster work from the demolished structure. The drive and gate posts still remain, as does a walled garden to the north-east which is now much overgrown.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{books in}} the English language to mention numbers of dog types are from the [...] "Cynegetica" [...] (hunting literature), namely [...] The Art of Venery 1327 by the Anglo-French Master of game, Twiti (Twici), a treatise which describes hunting with the limer (a leashed bloodhound type), the pack of running hounds (scent hounds) greyhounds, and alaunts. More significantly in recording the use and description of various dog types, The Master of Game circa 1406 by Edward of York [...] a treatise which describes dogs and their work, such as the alaunt, greyhound, pack scent hounds, spaniel, and mastiff used by the privileged and wealthy for hunting purposes. [...] "The Master of Game" [...] {{is a combination of}} the earlier Art of Venery and the famous French hunting treatise Livre de Chasse by Gaston Phoebus circa 1387. The Boke of St. Albans, published in 1486 a [...] "school" [...] book about hawking, hunting, fishing, and heraldry, attributed to Juliana Berners (Barnes), lists dogs of the time mainly by function: [...] " [...] First there is a greyhound, a bastard, a mongrel, a mastiff, a limer, a spaniel, raches (small-to-medium sized scenthounds), <b>kennets</b> (small hunting dogs), terriers, butcher's hounds, dung-heap dogs, trundel tails (lapdogs?) and prick-eared curs, and small ladies puppies that bear away the fleas and diverse small sorts".|$|R

5000|$|Rhythm guitarist Bruce <b>Kennet's</b> {{father knew}} {{the owner of}} Pixie records in Dayton, Ohio and it was {{arranged}} for the band {{to go there and}} record for the label. [...] Pixie had also released records by garage bands such as the Bittervetch and the Stone Hearts. [...] In early spring 1965, the group travelled to Dayton and taped their first single, [...] "I Don’t Want to Try It Again", a raucous number written by bassist Geoff Robinson. [...] The lead vocal and lyrics are hard to make out, but the song is apparently about not wanting to be lure back into a bad relationship. [...] Before John Bardi's guitar solo, one of the other members can be heard shouting, [...] "Play it J.B.!" [...] That song appeared on the A-side and was backed with a ballad, [...] "Now that Summer's Gone", written by band member Bruce Kennett. The initial pressing run for promotional copies of the record accidentally printed the name of the group as [...] "the Joy Boys", and [...] "Fencoe" [...] as the label name. [...] The manufacturer compensated for these errors by pasting new labels on top of the old ones. [...] Several hundred of these errant promo copies were pressed, before the standard copies went into production. [...] After band bassist and lead vocalist Geoff Robinson and rhythm guitarist Bruce Kennett {{graduated from high school in}} the spring of 1965, they departed and were replaced by new personnel. [...] John Bardi’s younger brother, Julian, joined on bass and Jon Rowzie on rhythm guitar. [...] The group needed a lead vocalist, so they added Jimmy Musgrove to the band's roster. [...] In the summer of 1965 the band auditioned in a talent search for Heigh Ho Records, a label run by Ron Barnett. [...] John Bardi described Barnett as [...] "a beatnik looking character probably in his mid-20’s, maybe a few years older". [...] Bardi and his brother applied on behalf of the band and, flowing a successful audition, they landed a contract with Heigh Ho. [...] Barnett had initially wanted the group to change their names to the Howling Wolves and have a trained wolf to appear with the group during their performances. According to Bardi: ...|$|R

5|$|The soil in {{the parish}} is high in clay. Due to the parish's {{location}} within the <b>Kennet</b> Valley {{there is a high}} concentration of alluvium, with the content largely determined by the London Clay Formation, the Bagshot Formation, and the Bracklesham Beds.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} 105 locks on the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal from Bristol to the River Thames, {{including}} 6 on the navigable section of the River Avon from Bristol to Bath and 9 on the navigable section of the River <b>Kennet</b> to its confluence with the Thames near Reading. The remaining 90 locks lie along the 57miles (92km) of canal. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as Bradford on Avon. The ornate Bath Locks lead to a stretch through Limpley Stoke valley with few locks. The flight of locks at Devizes, including the Caen Hill Locks, raises the canal to its longest pound, which then ascends the 4 Wooton Rivers locks to the short summit pound which includes the Bruce Tunnel. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the rural landscape of Wiltshire and Berkshire before joining the River <b>Kennet</b> at Newbury and becoming a navigable river to Reading, where it flows into the River Thames.|$|E
5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} <b>Kennet</b> at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal is very close to the River <b>Kennet,</b> which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the <b>Kennet</b> Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River <b>Kennet</b> floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} survey was {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of the}} canal was altered to take a more southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Company, chaired by Charles Dundas, and the company started to take subscriptions from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17 April 1794 the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began. The Newbury to Hungerford section was completed in 1798, and was extended to Great Bedwyn in 1799. The section from Bath to Foxhangers was finished in 1804, and Devizes Locks were completed in 1810.|$|E
5|$|Near to the {{settlement}} is Southcote Junction, where the Great Western Main Line diverges into the Reading to Taunton {{line and the}} Reading to Basingstoke line. The railways were preceded by the <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal, which passes south of {{the settlement}}. Southcote lends {{its name to the}} 104th lock on the canal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal at Southcote {{is still}} used for {{pleasure}} boating; moorings for narrowboats are located between Southcote Lock and Burghfield Bridge. The canal is accessible from footpaths near Burghfield Bridge, Southcote Mill and Fobney Lock, and the towpath through Southcote is a designated portion of National Cycle Route 4.|$|E
5|$|The River <b>Kennet</b> {{was made}} navigable to Newbury in 1723, and the River Avon to Bath in 1727. The <b>Kennet</b> and Avon Canal between Newbury and Bath was built between 1794 and 1810 by John Rennie, to convey {{commercial}} barges carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes. and is 57miles (92km) long. The two river navigations and the canal total 87miles (140km) in length. The section from Bristol to Bath is {{the course of the}} River Avon, which flows through a wide valley and has been made navigable by a series of locks and weirs. In the later 19th century and early 20th century the canal fell into disuse following competition from the Great Western Railway, who owned the canal. Between 1970 and 1990 the canal was restored, largely by volunteers, and today is a popular heritage tourism destination, for boating, canoeing, fishing, walking and cycling. It is also important for wildlife conservation.|$|E
5|$|The canal {{today is}} a {{heritage}} tourism destination. Boating, with narrowboats and cruisers, is a popular tourist attraction particularly in the summer months. It is a favourite haunt of several famous canal enthusiasts including canal boat veterans and original <b>Kennet</b> and Avon restoration supporters, Prunella Scales and Timothy West.|$|E
