5000|$|On 27 June 1997, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Saint Petersburg Mining Institute, {{guided by}} rector Vladimir Litvinenko, Putin defended his Candidate of Science {{dissertation}} in economics, titled [...] "The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations". This exemplified the custom in Russia for a rising young official {{to write a}} scholarly work in mid-career. When Putin later became president, the dissertation became a target of plagiarism accusations by <b>fellows</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution; although <b>the</b> dissertation was referenced, <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> fellows asserted it constituted plagiarism albeit perhaps unintentional.

In his dissertation, and in a later article published in 1999, Putin advocated the idea of so-called National champions, a concept that would later become central to his political thinking.|$|R
25|$|Johns Hopkins awarded Price a PhD in {{political}} science in 1933, and published his book, The Russo-Japanese Treaties of 1907-1916 Concerning Manchuria and Mongolia that same year. The book chronicled the remorseless efforts of Japan and Russia to carve up northeast Asia. In 1935, Price visited Manchukuo, Japan's puppet state in Northeast China, and met with the last Manchu emperor, Pu Yi. His book along {{with a number of}} academic articles published in the mid-nineteen thirties when he was a <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution highlighted the threat of Japanese imperialism in Manchuria and China. Price warned that Japan’s aggressive policies could lead to a serious international conflict. His writing helped initiate the public debate over the “China question” in the years leading up to World War II. His warnings proved to be both prophetic and timely.|$|E

50|$|Between 1931-1933 Abrams was a {{research}} <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> progressive <b>Brookings</b> Institution in Washington, DC. In 1933 he joined the research department of the London Press Exchange, one of Britain's leading advertising agencies. Here Abrams began developing his pioneering work in social investigation, market research, and opinion polling by conducting large-scale statistical surveys into consumer behaviour. His national newspaper readership surveys, which included over 20,000 participants between 1934-38, were landmarks in survey research and helped initiate the ABC1 system of social classification. Abrams's contacts with other social scientists working abroad during this period led to his work retrieving refugees from Nazi Europe (in 1939 helping Sigmund Freud make his final move to England).|$|R

2500|$|During Hugo Chávez's tenure, {{he seized}} {{thousands}} of properties and businesses while also reducing the footprint of foreign companies. Venezuela's economy was then largely state-run and was operated by military officers that had their {{business and government}} affairs connected. Senior <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution, Harold Trinkunas, stated that involving the military in business was [...] "a danger", with Trinkunas explaining that the Venezuelan military [...] "has the greatest ability to coerce people, into business like they have". According to Bloomberg Business, [...] "y showering contracts on former military officials and pro-government business executives, Chavez put a new face on the system of patronage".|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the court}} stated {{clearly that the}} {{decision}} {{is limited to the}} contraceptive mandate (Syllabus p.4-5), the ruling is seen to have consequences extending far beyond contraception. Walter Dellinger, former acting solicitor general said, [...] "for the first time, commercial enterprises could successfully claim religious exemptions from laws that govern everyone else." [...] Fifteen states had filed a brief arguing that businesses would be able to deny coverage for transfusions, stem cell treatments, and psychiatric care. In line with the dissenting opinion, The American Prospect asked, [...] "ill the taxpayers have to send a check to employees if employers feel that minimum wage laws violate their religious beliefs?" [...] Jonathan Rauch, a senior <b>fellow</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Brookings</b> Institution, said that objections to paying health benefits for same-sex spouses will get traction. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLT) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights withdrew their support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed by the Senate, saying that its religious exemptions would allow companies to fire or refuse to hire LGBT workers in light of the Hobby Lobby ruling. NGLT executive director Rea Carey said, [...] "We do not take this move lightly. We've been pushing for this bill for 20 years." ...|$|E
