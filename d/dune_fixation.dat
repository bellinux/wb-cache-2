40|$|Inland dune {{ecosystems}} are harsh environment for long-lived woody plants {{because of poor}} water and nutrient availability and frequent sand. As a result, long-lived woody plants have {{a high risk of}} being killed by sand movement or a long period of drought and this may occur even before they reach reproductive size. As dunes become more fixed, the increased coverage of annual plants with shallow root systems and the formation of microbiotic crusts reduces water percolation to deeper soil. Woody plants which typically possess deep rooting systems may then suffer from water shortage. Finally, growth of woody plants may be strongly impeded by herbivores (browsers) which can remove a large share of a plant’s seasonal growth in these habitats. Thus, long-lived woody species can only maintain populations in such a dune environment if they possess particular life history strategies that enable to overcome these stresses. In this thesis, I studied the demography of three dominant shrubs in Mu Us Sandland, in Inner Mongolia, China, to investigate how woody plants manage to colonize (semi-) mobile sand dunes, to maintain populations across different <b>dune</b> <b>fixations</b> stages and to cope with grazing activities of large herbivores. I analyzed the differences in life history traits and demographic adaptations of my study species and discuss these differences in relation to the ecology of woody plants in dune ecosystems in general.

40|$|The ‘Conseil Général du Département du Nord’ is {{the manager}} of 480 ha of Flemish dunes located at the far North of France. These spaces, {{initially}} preserved {{by the action of}} the ‘Communauté Urbaine de Dunkerque’ are now the property of the ‘Conservatoire de l’Espace Littoral et des Rivages Lacustres’. Characterised by an aelian dynamism and by the winter flooding of their damp depressions, these systems had represented a very high patrimonial richness before man, by these actions (the pumping of the aquifers, the parcelling out of <b>dune</b> massifs, the <b>fixation</b> of sand by plantations, the destruction of rabbits), reduced to nothing the natural expression of perturbations (storms, floods, important sandbanks) and made dune massifs become wastelands and low marshes and dry lawns disappear. The first step for preservation was the in extremis safeguard and the maintenance by secateurs (1989) then by motor scythes (1992) of micro-habitats with a high richness over a 2 ha total surface lost in very important pre-forested systems. Rapidly, the objectives of preservation obliged us to put into practice the restoration of natural environments by stripping and clearing the ground (1994 and 1997). But these operations of a large scale (10 ha) were always based on a ‘fixist’ and ‘museographical’ approach to the environment (the maintenance of a representative sample of habitats). The management which consists of stopping certain pioneer and post-pioneer stages of vegetation can in fact correspond to a counter-natural step as these dune systems make the proof of a very high dynamism and permanent evolution. Today the management of dune space is done by bulldozers: first the pre-forested vegetation is totally destructed (16 ha in 2004) leaving systems of bare sand freely evolving and accepting their spontaneous wastelanding over more than 50 % of their surfaces. The return to uncontrolled vegetal dynamism is only accepted if perturbations are periodically created in order to regularly produce the starting or reappearance conditions of the different series of vegetation. The last stage of our managing operations would consist, with a middle-term effect, in reducing the stability of the edging dune row and in favouring the development of wind passages with their devastation or saving effects on the dune we intend to preserve...|$|R
40|$|Vegetation {{patterns}} are {{strongly influenced by}} sand mobility in desert ecosystems. However, {{little is known about}} the spatial patterns of Artemisia ordosica, a dominant shrub in the Mu Us desert of Northwest China, in relation to sand fixation. The aim of this study was to investigate and contrast the effects of sand dune stabilization on the population and spatial distribution of this desert shrub. Spatial autocorrelation, semi-variance analysis, and point-pattern analysis were used jointly in this study to investigate the spatial patterns of A. ordosica populations on dunes in Yanchi County of Ningxia, China. The results showed that the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity declined gradually, and the distance between the clustered individuals shortened following sand <b>dune</b> <b>fixation.</b> Seedlings were more aggregated than adults in all stage of dune stabilization, and both were more aggregated on shifting sand dunes separately. Spatial associations of the seedlings with the adults were mostly positive at distances of 0 - 5 m in shifting sand dunes, and the spatial association changed from positive to neutral in semi-fixed sand dunes. The seedlings were spaced in an almost random pattern around the adults, and their distances from the adults did not seem to affect their locations in semi-fixed sand dunes. Furthermore, spatial associations of the seedlings with the adults were negative in the fixed sand dune. These findings demonstrate that sand stabilization is an important factor affecting the spatial patterns of A. ordosica populations in the Mu Us desert. These findings suggest that, strong association between individuals may be the mechanism to explain the spatial pattern formation at preliminary stage of <b>dune</b> <b>fixation.</b> Sand dune stabilization can change the spatial pattern of shrub population by weakening the spatial association between native shrub individuals, which may affect the development direction of desert shrubs...|$|E

40|$|Situated at the {{southeast}} magrin of the Mu Us Desert, the Milanggouwan stratigraphical {{section in the}} Salawusu River Valley records 27 depositional sequences of the aeolian dune layers alternating with the fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosols from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. Grain-size analysis and measurements of the susceptibility of the section show that their changes in the section may be well correlated with the variations of the aeolian dune layers, fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosols. Usually, the particles of aeolian dunes are coarser and well sorted with lower susceptibility values (Sv), their Mx (mean particle diameter), σ(standard deviation) and Sv being 2. 33 ∼ 3. 48 Φ, 0. 26 ∼ 0. 90 and 2 ∼ 10 (10 - 8 m 3 /kg SI) respectively: Whereas the particles of the fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosols are finer, moderately to poorly sorted with higher susceptibility values, their Mx, σ and Sv falling {{within the range of}} 3. 04 ∼ 5. 06 Φ, 0. 61 ∼ 1. 77 and 10 ∼ 20 (10 - 8 m 3 /kg SI) respectively. Hereby it is considered with reference to the study results obtained by previous researchers that the above-mentioned alternately evolutionary sequences were, in fact, mainly induced by the climatic changes. The aeolian sand dune was deposited chiefly during the "desert period", formed under dry and cold climatic conditions; the fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosol are chiefly the product during the "inter-desert period", accumulated under warm humid climatic conditions. Thereby, the dune layers in the Milanggouwan section and its overlying fluvio-lacustrine facies or/and palaeosol may be regarded as a sedimentary cycle. A total of 27 cycles are recorded in the section. Each cycle represents a complete process from the cold dry to warm humid climate, and the region has experienced 27 climatic cycles of alternating cold dry and warm humid. Based on the understanding of the regional climate of the wind-drifting sands and the dust haze, induced by the southward stretch of the Sibrian-Mongolian anticyclones in the present winter and spring seasons in northern China and the space-time regularity of the summer monsoons, it is suggested that the 27 periods of aeolian sand dune accumulations in the Milanggouwan section should be a result of many times' dynamic processes of wind sands and dusts in the past geologic time, which were {{similar to those of the}} present winter and spring seasons in question, in the monsoon sandy region and even in the whole deserts of China; while the fluvio-lacustrine facies and palaeosoils sandwiched in between the dune layers were related to activities of the summer monsoon in the region. During the cold stages (glacial periods) in the Northern Hemisphere since the Late Pleistocene, the Sibrian -Mongolian anticyclones raced off towards the middle altitudes of China, the monsoon sandy region was in a desert period, the winter monsoons prevailed in the region, the climate became dry and cold, wind erosion and deposition were violent, the deserts were active intensely and expanded, and the sediments were mainly aeolian sand dunes. During the warm stages (interglacial periods) in the Northern Hemisphere, the frequencies of the winter monsoon occurring southwards decreased greatly; the monsoon sandy region was in an inter-desert period; the summer monsoon prevailed; the climate became warm and humid; rivers, lakes and swamps were well developed; a series of soil-forming processes occurred on the ground. As a result, the fluvio-lacustrine facies accumulated in depressions between the dunes and palaeosols formed on mobile dunes, thereby making the dunes fixed. Multiple alternation of glacial and interglacial periods in the Northern Hemisphere from the Late Pleistocene to Holocene caused the confrontation and antipathetic changes of the winter monsoons and the summer monsoons and the alternating desert period and inter-desert period, and the activation of mobile sand <b>dunes</b> and <b>fixation</b> experienced a series of normal and reverse commutative processes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 ’s, the {{south-east}} of Niger {{has benefited from}} several development projects directed at <b>dune</b> <b>fixation.</b> As a first step, these techniques rely on mechanical fixation using wind barriers to stabilize the dune, after which shrub species are planted. The growth of these shrubs is generally slow due to low soil fertility and the mechanical barriers have a limited life span. Hence the spontaneous recovery of the herbaceous ground cover could adequately supplement the wind barriers and planted shrubs in reducing sediment fluxes, especially during {{the first years of}} <b>dune</b> <b>fixation</b> when shrub cover is low. Little is known, however, about the effectiveness of wind barriers at promoting the recovery of the grass cover in terms of total biomass and biodiversity. The objective of this study was therefore {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a mechanical windbreak on eolian sediment flows and the recovery of the natural herbaceous cover. Palisades of Leptadenia pyrotechnica were planted according to a regular 20 x 10 m grid, covering a total area of 200 x 20 m on a mobile dune in the area of Gouré, South-Eastern Niger (300 mm annual rainfall). Measurements of sediment flow were taken during the Harmattan period (December-March) in 2005, 2006 and 2007 using Modified Wilson and Cooke sand catchers aligned along 8 transects parallel to the Harmattan winds. On each transect, a MWAC was placed at 3 m upwind and 2 m, 5 m, 9 m and 18 m downwind from the first palisade. Sediment fluxes were measured at 5 heights between 0. 05 and 1 m above ground. A spatiotemporal monitoring was carried out in order to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative recovery of the herbaceous cover. Most of the sediment fluxes occurred between mid-February and mid-March each year. In the first year (2005), sediment fluxes downwind of the first palisade were reduced by more than 98 % compared to the fluxes observed 3 m upwind. In 2006 and 2007 the effectiveness was nearly 100 % as a result of the recovery of the herbaceous cover. In its immediate surroundings, the windbreak induced large sediment deposits, which were enriched in coarse particles upwind and in fine particles, organic carbon and total N downwind of the barrier. Available P content remained very low. The restoration of the herbaceous cover was evidenced by the presence, at the end of the rainy season, of 13 species in 2005, 29 species in 2006 and 59 species in 2007, belonging, respectively, to 8, 18 and 20 families. The specificity index increased from 3. 6 in 2005 to 6. 8 in 2007 and the dominant species were Aristida adscenionis and Cenchrus biflorus. The dry herbaceous biomass behind the windbreak exceeded 200 g/m 2.

40|$|The use of {{vegetation}} as a bio-engineering tool for land reclamation, erosion control and slope stabilization {{have been implemented}} for centuries and its popularity has increased remarkably in the last decades. This {{is partly due to}} the fact that more knowledge and information on vegetation are now available for application in engineering designs, but also partly due to the cost-effectiveness and environment-friendliness of this “soft”, bio-engineering approach. Vetiver, a fast growing grass, possesses some unique features of both grasses and trees by having profusely grown, deep penetrating root system that can offer both erosion prevention and control of shallow movement of surface earth mass. Experiments revealed that vetiver grass roots are very strong with an average tensile strength of 75 MPa or one-sixth of ultimate strength of mild steel. The massive root system also increases the shear strength of soil, thereby appreciably enhances slope stability. In addition to its unique morphological characteristics, vetiver is also highly tolerant to adverse growing conditions such as extreme soil pH, temperatures and heavy metal toxicities. Vetiver Grass Technology (VGT), or Vetiver System (VS), involves the correct application of this unique grass in erosion and sediment control, land reclamation, rehabilitation and stabilization etc. Having been introduced into Vietnam in 1999 by The International Vetiver Network (TVN) and the World Bank and since actively promoted by the Vietnam Vetiver Network (VNVN), the grass has become widely known throughout the country with numerous successful applications for road cut-slope stability enhancement, erosion/flood control of embankments, dykes, riverbanks, sand <b>dune</b> <b>fixation</b> as well as waste and leachate control etc. 1...|$|E
40|$|Herbivory is a {{major factor}} {{affecting}} both the performance and the fitness of the species composing a plant community and, ultimately, conditioning its temporal and spatial dynamics. Coastal dunes are a typical example of primary succession where different biotic and abiotic factors determine plant species occurrence; however, the effect of insect herbivory herein has remained little explored. To address this matter, we combined an observational study along a successional gradient with a green-house experiment to determine the occurrence and the impact of plant-aphid interactions. We focused on the species Schizaphis rufula, a widespread and abundant aphid associated with dune grasses in early stages of primary succession in Europe. Firstly, we studied aphid infestation rates on the dune grass Ammophila arenaria along a succession gradient in three locations of the North Sea coast to address the relationship between plant community composition and aphid occurrence; secondly, we tested the effect of aphid herbivory on a set of dune species typical for the different stages of succession. We found that the degree of aphid infestation was inversely correlated with the degree of <b>dune</b> <b>fixation.</b> The results of the experiment showed that aphid multiplication was significantly higher and its effect more pronounced on two early successional grass species, i. e. A. arenaria and Leymus arenarius. Here aphid multiplication resulted in a severe decrease in plant biomass; in late successional grass species, there was limited multiplication and no effect on biomass. The results of the field survey and the green-house experiment indicate that aphids show a clear preference for plants from early successional stages and, moreover, they have a greater impact on these plant species. All this supports the hypothesis of aphid herbivory as a driving factor of primary succession in coastal dunes...|$|E
40|$|The {{quicksand}} {{phenomenon is}} one of the big factors of desertification. This report introduced straw net method which {{is one of}} the effective methods for stabilizing quick-sands. This method is to cover the sand dune with straw nets with square circumference of about 1 m. Height of straw fence is about 10 - 20 cm from soil surface and the depth is about 10 - 30 cm. Grass seeds are sprayed after construction of the nets. In some cases, young trees such as pine and yellow willow are planted. At first this method was adopted as the way of protecting a road, a railway from the flow dune in Horquin arid land. Nowadays this method has become popular and widely used for the fixation of the flow sand and for recovering the vegatation, in arid area China. The merits of straw nets on protecting desertification can be pointed as follows. First, the flow sand can be stabilized by the wind-proof effects. Second, the natural material of straw which are an agricultural by-product can be produced in the farm village in the spot. Third, the technique to construct nets is easy. Fourth, the prompt effect afterestablishment can be expected. Fifth, grass and trees are fixed at the short time by harvesting the snow and rainfall as natural water to the root zone. The new evaluation of straw nets is effects on the microclimate modification such as lowering air temperature, increasing the air humidity and lowering soil temperature. These environmental modifications are effective for the prompt germination of the seed and nursing vegatation growing.

In dealing with the blown sand phenomenon, the sand movement in dune sand of wind dry condition as its base and also the relation of the threshold velocity of blown sand with the grain diameter distribution of sand dune are considered to be unclear in the conventional researches, and therefore the blown sand quantity formula in consideration of the grain diameter of sand dune was determined through demensional analysis and wind tunnel experiment. From this formula the writer could present the method of objectively judging the blown sand limit, ascertain its effectiveness, thereby making clear the interrelation between the grain diameter of dune sand and the blown sand limit. Furthermore, from on-the-spot survey and analysis of the relation of geographical features mainly in artificial sand dune with grain diameter distribution, and also from the wind tunnel experiment between errosion and grain diameter change, it was made clear that wind erosion and coarseness of grain diameter of dune sand are conspicuous in the land behind high artificial sand dune and that the land just behind artificial sand dune becomes the starting point of new blown sand toward internal land. As both the sand movement of size-group and the threshold shear velocity of size-group, which are the cause of coarseness of grain diameter, have not been illucidated as to the subject of blown sand, the dimensionless equation for it has been looked for and obtained. In order to clarify the influcence of water content of sand surface layer on the blown sand quantity and the threshold velocity of blown sand regarding the blown sand in the moistured sand surface condition, the influence of water content ratio was grasped as the change of coefficients respectively of the blown sand quantity equation in wind dry condition and of the dimensionless equation in threshold shear velocity, and its relation with water content ratio was obtained through experiments. The influcence of water content ratio on vertical distribution of blown sand was also expressed by the relation of dimensionless coefficient with water content ratio, thereby making it clear that the blown sand quantity, while being uniformed in vertical direction, takes a special reduction configuration in inverse proportion to the increment of water content ratio, which attributes mainly to the saltation of blown sand. The relation of water content ratio with grain diameter of blown sand was clarified by an index called the blown sand ratio of size-group in which both the median diameter of blown sand and the standard deviation tend to get bigger in proportion to water content ratio, and also the sand of larger size-group tends to occupy a large portion of sand composition. Based on the aforementioned respective results, it was discussed as its conclusion that contriving 2 ̆ 2 uniformity of grain diameter and surface uniformity of geographical features 2 ̆ 2 is effective as a conceptive guidance relating to the blown sand control...|$|E
