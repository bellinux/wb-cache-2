5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes <b>her</b> <b>gun.</b> Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Deutschland and Admiral Scheer were deployed to the Spanish coast on 23 July 1936 to conduct non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. During the deployment, <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> turrets were painted with large black, white, and red bands to aid in identification from the air and indicate her neutral status. Her duties during the deployment included evacuating refugees fleeing from the fighting, protecting German ships carrying supplies for Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and gathering intelligence for the Nationalists.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909, at the {{launching}} ceremony for Danton, socialist activists prevented the ship from leaving the stocks. The ship was eventually launched on 4 July 1909. A week {{after she was}} completed, she {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom in honour of the Coronation of George V in 1911. Upon her return to France, Danton was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, along with her sister ships and the two powerful dreadnoughts Courbet and Jean Bart. In 1913, while off Hyères in the Mediterranean, Danton suffered an explosion in one of <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> turrets, which killed three men and injured several others.|$|E

The watch stopped at 6:47, the moment Willis died after the bank shooting.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing {{the bullet}} from his shoulder, Wesley realises that Cross used a {{traceable}} bullet(as his previous kills were all untraceable).Wesley traces it {{to a man}} named Pekwarsky. Wesley and Fox capture Pekwarsky, who arranges a meeting with Cross. When Wesley faces Cross alone on a moving train, Fox crashes a car into the train, causing a derailment. After Cross saves Wesley from falling, Wesley fatally shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this, and explains that Wesley was recruited {{because he was the}} only person Cross would not kill. Fox points <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> at Wesley, but he shoots the window below,falling into the river.|$|E
5|$|Brodeur visits Speranza in his cell, {{and offers}} {{to have his}} death {{sentence}} commuted in exchange for stopping the murders. Speranza takes the offer. That night, Parmelly visits Danielle, who has become agitated since Mulder and Scully have begun staking out her house. The agents now suspect Parmelly to be behind the murders and leave to notify Brodeur, who asks that Parmelly be arrested. Soon afterward, Danielle wakes up to see Neech standing by her room door. She grabs <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> and confronts Parmelly, thinking he is Neech's resurrected form. The agents and a police task force arrive to see her shoot and kill Parmelly. Meanwhile, Brodeurassuming that Charez and Parmelly were on the listthinks Speranza has reneged on their deal and has him taken to the showers. Before Brodeur kills him, Speranza claims that one person remains on the list.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{successful}} operations off North Africa, Massachusetts {{was taken}} in for an overhaul in the Boston Navy Yard. After the refitting, the ship sailed for the Pacific theater, and arrived in Nouméa on 4 March. The battleship supported operations in the South Pacific over the next months, including guarding convoy lanes, escorting aircraft carriers, and bombarding Japanese positions on various islands, including Nauru (8 December 1943) and Kwajalein (30 January 1944). Returning to carrier protection after the latter bombardment, Massachusetts provided anti-aircraft defense while Allied air attacks were sent against Saipan, Tinian and Guam; she also supported later invasions of the Caroline Islands and Hollandia. After bombarding Ponape Island on 1 May, the ship set course for the Puget Sound Navy Yard for an overhaul and to have <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> barrels relined, as they had worn out.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 1890s, Saetta was {{frequently}} reduced to reserve, in part to reduce maintenance on the vessel. Folgore made a temporary return to active service in 1895, when she joined Saetta for the annual maneuvers. In 1897, she was withdrawn from front-line service and employed with the gunnery school; <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> armament was accordingly increased in 1902 to provide a variety of weapons for gunnery trainees to practice operating. In the meantime, Folgore was stricken from the naval register in 1900 and broken up for scrap. Saetta continued in her service with the gunnery school until 1908, when she too was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with <b>her</b> <b>gun,</b> announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E

5|$|The Barracudas were {{targeted}} by heavy, but inaccurate, anti-aircraft gunfire as they arrived over Kaafjord. Aside {{from the two}} aircraft whose pilots sighted Tirpitz, the 35 other dive bombers attempting to attack the ship were forced to aim at <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> flashes. These bombing attacks took 25 minutes to complete; seven near misses were achieved but no damage was inflicted on Tirpitz. One of the other Barracudas attacked an anti-aircraft battery, another attempted to bomb a destroyer and a third scored a near miss on the tanker Nordmark. Three of the remaining four Barracudas {{did not find any}} targets and jettisoned their bombs into the sea; the fourth was unable to drop its bombs due to a faulty release mechanism.|$|E
5|$|The British {{decision}} to strike Kaafjord {{was motivated by}} fears that the battleship, upon re-entering service, would attack strategically important convoys carrying supplies to the Soviet Union. Removing {{the threat posed by}} Tirpitz would also allow the Allies to redeploy the capital ships which had to be held in the North Sea to counter her. After four months of training and preparations, the British Home Fleet sailed on 30 March 1944 and aircraft launched from five aircraft carriers struck Kaafjord on 3 April. The raid achieved surprise, and the British aircraft met little opposition. Fifteen bombs hit the battleship, and strafing by fighter aircraft inflicted heavy casualties on <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> crews. Four British aircraft and nine airmen were lost during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the fires of the burning destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} Europe at 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which intermittently replied with <b>her</b> available <b>guns.</b> Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of <b>her</b> <b>guns</b> dismounted {{and a number of}} her crew wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, Féretier next attacked Streatham, which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham came under heavy fire at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in <b>her</b> crew, <b>her</b> <b>guns</b> all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|R
5|$|Wesley {{attacks the}} base using {{explosive}} rats (a tactic {{he learned from}} the Exterminator), killing surviving Fraternity assassins,including The Repairman and the Butcher (who he kills in a knife fight) in a massive shootout. Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan reveals that {{the names of those}} present had legitimately come up in the Loom, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world. As the others choose the latter, Fox curves a bullet around the room, choosing to follow the code and kill everyone, including herself, but not before throwing <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> to Wesley. Sloan escapes in the mayhem.|$|E
5|$|After Skinner and Scully {{find and}} {{retrieve}} Praise, Skinner takes {{him to the}} nearest hospital, where his friend Thea visits him, {{closing the door behind}} her. In search for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which she thinks is a spaceship, but which is later revealed to be a helicopter. The helicopter lands and Doggett insists Scully travel with him to the hospital; she reluctantly accepts. At the hospital, two other FBI agents assure the two agents that nothing has happened to Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise, while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch the intruder. He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Meanwhile, Scully finds Praise, along with Skinner, who claims to be protecting the boy. Skinner, who is actually the Alien Bounty Hunter, attempts to kill her but Scully grabs <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> and shoots him in the neck, killing the Bounty Hunter. After Doggett reports the case to Kersh, he is assigned to the X-File division with Scully. The episode ends showing Mulder still held in captivity as six Alien Bounty Hunters look on.|$|E
5|$|Langsdorff {{thought the}} two light cruisers {{were making a}} torpedo attack, and turned away under a smokescreen. The respite allowed Exeter to {{withdraw}} from the action; by now, only one of <b>her</b> <b>gun</b> turrets was still in action, and she had suffered 61 dead and 23 wounded crew members. At around 07:00, Exeter returned to the engagement, firing from her stern turret. Admiral Graf Spee fired on her again, scored more hits, and forced Exeter to withdraw again, this time with a list to port. At 07:25, Admiral Graf Spee scored a hit on Ajax that disabled her aft turrets. Both sides broke off the action, Admiral Graf Spee retreating into the River Plate estuary, while Harwood's battered cruisers remained outside to observe any possible breakout attempts. In the course of the engagement, Admiral Graf Spee had been hit approximately 70 times; 36 men were killed and 60 more were wounded, including Langsdorff, who had been wounded twice by splinters while standing on the open bridge.|$|E
