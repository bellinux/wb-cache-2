40|$|This {{dissertation}} examined auditors 2 ̆ 7 knowledge {{structures of}} <b>financial</b> statement <b>errors.</b> Two different experiments involving data sorting exercises and reaction time tests were conducted. In the sorting experiment, auditors {{were asked to}} sort <b>financial</b> statement <b>errors</b> as they thought the errors should go together. In the reaction time experiment, auditors {{were asked to identify}} <b>financial</b> statement <b>errors</b> after being first prompted with either an audit objective or a transaction cycle cue. All subjects participated in both experiments in order to strengthen the case for determining whether the knowledge structure exhibited varies depending on the methodology used. ^ There were three primary findings. First, the sorting methodology results provided support for the theory that the dominant knowledge structure utilized by experienced auditors is an audit objective structure. This result was consistent with other studies using a sorting methodology. Conversely, the second finding was that experienced auditors exhibited a transaction cycle structure when tested under the reaction time method. The third finding was that both experienced and novice auditors were more accurate in identifying <b>financial</b> statement <b>errors</b> after being prompted with transaction cycle cues than after being prompted with audit objective cues. ^ There are two primary contributions of this dissertation. First, it provides support for the theory that the more dominant knowledge structure of experienced auditors is the transaction cycle structure. This is an important contribution because a series of audit training recommendations and assumptions regarding accounting research have been made {{based on the assumption that}} experienced auditors have audit objective dominant knowledge structures. Consequently, these findings may lead to a reconsideration of these recommendations and assumptions and also prompt future researchers to reexamine this issue. ^ This dissertation also demonstrates that the reaction time method is a methodology well-suited for studying issues in accounting and auditing domains. The fact that the reaction time method found different results than the sorting experiments related to an issue that was considered “resolved” may lead to further use of this and other new methodologies. The use of new and innovative research techniques could also possibly improve the quality of future accounting research. ...|$|R

The cabinet did, in fact, contain {{as many as}} five men who were {{at one time or another}} chancellors of the exchequer, and its chief was {{recognised}} through Europe as the most successful financier of the age. No trailing cloud of glory, as in 1853 or 1860, attended the great ministry, but sound and substantial results were achieved, testifying to a thrifty and skilful management, such as might have satisfied the ambition of a generation of chancellors. The head of the new government promised retrenchment as soon as the government was formed. He told his constituents at Greenwich (Dec. 21, 1868) that he was himself responsible for having taken the earliest opportunity of directing the public mind to the subject of expenditure at an opening stage of the late election; for “although there may be times when the public mind may become comparatively relaxed in regard to the general principles of economy and thrift, it is the special duty of public men to watch the very beginnings of evil in that department.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of oil in}} the world economy explains why considerable effort has been devoted to the development of different types of econometric models for oil price forecasting. Several specifications have been proposed in the economic literature. Some are based on financial theory and concentrate on the relationship between spot and futures prices ("financial" models). Others assign a key role to variables explaining the characteristics of the physical oil market ("structural" models). The empirical literature is very far from any consensus about the appropriate model for oil price forecasting that should be implemented. Relative to the previous literature, this paper is novel in several respects. First of all, we test and systematically evaluate the ability of several alternative econometric specifications proposed in the literature to capture the dynamics of oil prices. Second, we analyse the effects of different data frequencies on the coefficient estimates and forecasts obtained using each selected econometric specification. Third, we compare different models at different data frequencies on a common sample and common data. Fourth, we evaluate the forecasting performance of each selected model using static and dynamic forecasts, as well as different measures of forecast errors. Finally, we propose a new class of models which combine the relevant aspects of the financial and structural specifications proposed in the literature ("mixed" models). Our empirical findings can be summarized as follows. Financial models in levels do not produce satisfactory forecasts for the WTI spot price. The <b>financial</b> <b>error</b> correction model yields accurate in-sample forecasts. Real and strategic variables alone are insufficient to capture the oil spot price dynamics in the forecasting sample. Our proposed mixed models are statistically adequate and exhibit accurate forecasts. Different data frequencies seem to affect the forecasting ability of the models under analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether the {{introduction}} of International Financial Reporting Standard No: 8 (IFRS 8) - "Operating Segments" has had a significant effect in improving the financial analysts’ forecasting abilities of earnings per share in New Zealand (NZ), Australia, Hong Kong (HK) and China. The extent of compliance with the standard was checked using a disclosure index based on segment reporting requirements of IFRS 8 while the forecasting errors were inferred by comparing forecasts of EPS with actuals. This paper specifically investigates whether the financial forecasts accuracy during the post-implementation period of IFRS 8 had improved compared to pre-implementation of IFRS 8. The <b>financial</b> analysts’ forecast <b>errors</b> were also compared between code law country (China) and common law countries (NZ, Australia and HK) after the implementation of IFRS 8. Using a sample of 190 companies, including 26 NZ companies, 63 Australian companies, 70 HK companies and 31 Chinese companies, analysed by repeated measures ANOVA and the paired-sample t-test, the results indicate that the disclosure level of segment reporting of companies in NZ, Australia, HK and China increased after the implementation of IFRS 8, however, the analysts forecasts errors of post implementation periods were not statistically significantly different to those of pre implementation of IFRS 8. The results also show that the disclosure level of China (code law country) is significant lower when countries are pooled together (NZ, Australia and HK, i. e. common law countries) and compared with HK separately after the implementation of the IFRS 8. However, the <b>financial</b> analysts’ forecast <b>errors</b> of Chinese companies were not significantly higher than them during the same period. The results of this paper suggest that the standard has not been perceived as beneficial by the financial analysts’ for forecasting. Although a number of papers have attempted to review the success of the implementation of IFRS 8 in Europe, this dissertation serves to address a gap by statistically testing the <b>financial</b> forecasts <b>errors</b> of earnings per share of companies from New Zealand (NZ), Australia, Hong Kong (HK) and China of which there is little known...|$|R
