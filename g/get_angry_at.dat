25|$|The final affective {{response}} or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger (Johnson, 2017). Anger is {{an emotion}} that is felt in {{all stages of}} infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In {{the initial stages of}} infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and resentment. When a partner is suspicious of another’s intentions and actions they become frustrated with that partner and tend to <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> them more easily and feel that the anger is not anticipated. In turn, the suspected unfaithful partner will be confused and become angry at the other starting fight. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one’s actions and feelings before doing so.|$|E

In 1990, Houphouët-Boigny legalised opposition parties. On 28 October, {{a presidential election}} was held. [...] For the first time, Houphouët-Boigny actually faced an opponent: Gbagbo. He highlighted the President's age, suggesting {{that he was too}} old for a seventh five-year term. Houphouët-Boigny countered by broadcasting television footage of his youth, and he was re-elected to a seventh term with 2,445,365 votes to 548,441—an implausible 81.7 percent of the vote.|$|E

During that period, Rand Paul criticized the [...] "Make Chai Not War" [...] initiative during Congressional hearings on the Benghazi controversy. Kondabolu responded in a Totally Biased segment, observing that the approximately $800 million USD that the State Department spends yearly sending artists to perform worldwide is far less than the US spends on war: [...] "apparently after you spend trillions starting wars, people <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> you." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry's {{last day}} as a wiseguy was {{the hardest part of}} the film for Scorsese to shoot, because he wanted to {{properly}} show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia, and racing thoughts caused by cocaine and amphetamines intoxication. Scorsese said to movie critic Mark Cousins in an interview the reason for Pesci shooting at the screen {{at the end of the}} film: [...] "well that's a reference right to the end of The Great Train Robbery, that's the way that ends, that film, and basically the plot of this picture is very similar to The Great Train Robbery. It hasn't changed, 90 years later, it's the same story, the gun shots will always be there, he's always going to look behind his back, he's gotta have eyes behind his back, because they're gonna get him someday." [...] The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy, about which Scorsese said, [...] "I think the audience should <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> him and I would hope they do—and maybe with the system which allows this." ...|$|E

2500|$|Josephus also {{mentions}} {{several people}} named Jesus (Jesus son of Ananias, Jesus son of Damneus, Jesus son of Onias and Jesus {{the brother of}} John) as well as various prophets, being avidly against calling any of them Messiahs, even describing them as [...] "having evil or dishonorable intentions" [...] and sometimes calling them [...] "charlatans" [...] (the Egyptian, the Samaritan, Theudas and an unnamed [...] "impostor"), but providing for each more information and explanations than the Jesus passage. Some myth proponents also speculate that when Josephus called James the [...] "brother" [...] of Jesus of Nazareth in the Antiquities, {{he was referring to}} another Jesus when read in context (more specifically Jesus son of Damneus, who is mentioned at the end of [...] ). For instance, Richard Carrier argues that the words [...] "the one called Christ" [...] likely resulted from the accidental insertion of a marginal note added by some unknown reader. Carrier proposes that the original text referred to a brother named James of the high priest Jesus son of Damneus mentioned in the same narrative, in which James (the brother of Jesus) is executed by Ananus and the Jews <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> this, therefore complaints and demands are made, the king removes Ananus from being high priest and Jesus is then made high priest. Others speculate that he was referring to a mythic Christ that had already been historicized, or to fraternal brotherhood rather than a literal sibling. This is dismissed by some in mainstream academia on the grounds that {{there is no evidence of}} a supposed [...] "Jerusalem brotherhood".|$|E

He first threw a plate at my Brother's head, who ducked out of the way; he then let fly another at me, which I avoided in like manner. A hail-storm of abuse followed these first hostilities. He rose into a passion against the Queen; reproaching her with the bad training she gave her children; and, addressing my Brother: 'You have reason to curse your Mother,' said he, 'for it is she that causes your being an ill-governed fellow (UN MAL GOUVERNE). I had a Preceptor,' continued he, 'who was an honest man. I remember always a story he told me in my youth. There was a man, at Carthage, who had been condemned to die for many crimes he had committed. While they were leading him to execution, he desired he might speak to his Mother. They brought his Mother: he came near, as if to whisper something to her;--and bit away a piece of her ear. I treat you thus, said he, to make you an example to all parents who take no heed to bring up their children in the practice of virtue!--Make the application,' continued he, always addressing my Brother: and getting no answer from him, he again set to abusing us till he could speak no longer. We rose from table. As we had to pass near him in going out, he aimed a great blow at me with his crutch; which, if I had not jerked away from it, would have ended me. He chased me for a while in his wheel-chair, but the people drawing it gave me time to escape into the Queen's chamber." [...] [Wilhelmina, i. 159.] ...|$|E
60|$|Well, {{but taking}} {{the world as}} it is—and this is one way we must take it when we want to find out how it can be improved—no society is made up of a single class: society stands before us like that {{wonderful}} piece of life, the human body, with all its various parts depending on one another, and with a terrible liability to get wrong because of that delicate dependence. We all know how many diseases the human body is apt to suffer from, and how difficult it is even for the doctors to find out exactly where the seat or beginning of the disorder is. That is because the body is made up of so many various parts, all related to each other, or likely all to feel the effect if any one of them goes wrong. It is somewhat the same with our old nations or societies. No society ever stood long in the world without getting to be composed of different classes. Now, it is all pretence {{to say that there is}} no such thing as class interest. It is clear that if any particular number of men get a particular benefit from any existing institution, they are likely to band together, in order to keep up that benefit and increase it, until it is perceived to be unfair and injurious to another large number, who get knowledge and strength enough to set up a resistance. And this, again, has been part of the history of every great society since history began. But the simple reason for this being, that any large body of men is likely to have more of stupidity, narrowness, and greed than of farsightedness and generosity, it is plain that the number who resist unfairness and injury are in danger of becoming injurious in their turn. And in this way a justifiable resistance has become a damaging convulsion, making everything worse instead of better. This has been seen so often that we ought to profit a little by the experience. So long as there is selfishness in men; so long as they have not found out for themselves institutions which express and carry into practice the truth, that the highest interest of mankind must at last be a common and not a divided interest; so long as the gradual operation of steady causes has not made that truth a part of every man’s knowledge and feeling, just as we now not only know that it is good for our health to be cleanly, but feel that cleanliness is only another word for comfort, which is the under-side or lining of all pleasure; so long, I say as men wink at their own knowingness, or hold their heads high because they have got an advantage over their fellows; so long class interest will be in danger of making itself felt injuriously. No set of men will get any sort of power without being in danger of wanting more than their right share. But, on the other hand, it is just as certain that no set of men will <b>get</b> <b>angry</b> <b>at</b> having less than their right share, and set up a claim on that ground, without falling into just the same danger of exacting too much, and exacting it in wrong ways. It’s human nature we have got to work with all round, and nothing else. That seems like saying something very commonplace—nay, obvious; as if one should say that where there are hands there are mouths. Yet, to hear a good deal of the speechifying and to see a good deal of the action that go forward, one might suppose it was forgotten.|$|E
