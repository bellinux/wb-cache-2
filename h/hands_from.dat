5|$|The {{following}} day, Voss signed {{himself out}} on leave on his authority as Staffelführer. His first stop was Berlin, {{where he was}} honored receiving an autographed photograph of Kaiser Wilhelm II from the emperor's own <b>hands.</b> <b>From</b> the 15th to the 17th, {{he was at the}} Fokker factory in Schwerin; he was accompanied by his girlfriend Ilse. His leave authorization also cleared him for Düsseldorf and his hometown of Krefeld, but it is unknown if he visited them. In any case, he returned to duty on 22 September 1917.|$|E
5|$|During Middleton's {{tenure at}} LSU the {{presidency}} of the university changed <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> President Atkinson to President James Monroe Smith, the latter an appointee of Governor Long. Towards the end of Middleton's fourth year on campus President Smith asked him if he would stay on for an additional year and also become Dean of Men. Middlteon responded that he would accept, but it had to be cleared through the War Department. Smith's request to the War Department for both the extension and the deanship for Middleton were approved. Toward the end of the fifth year Smith went a step further, suggesting that Middleton retire from the army and become a permanent member of the LSU staff. Middleton would not even consider retirement, but accepted a sixth year with the ROTC program. As he began his sixth year on campus, on 1 Aug 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.|$|E
5|$|Worcestershire had {{an unusually}} large number of exclaves (see Fig 1), which were {{cut off from the}} main county and {{completely}} surrounded by the nearby counties of Warwickshire, Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Shropshire (Detached) and Oxfordshire. This relationship with neighbouring counties mirrored the confusing and fragmented layout of parishes within Worcestershire's own hundreds (See images and table below). The most notable islands were Dudley, Evenlode, Blockley and the area around Shipston-on-Stour. Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Shropshire had their own exclaves within the main part of Worcestershire at Rochford, Broome, Clent, Tardebigge (Tutnall and Cobley) and Halesowen respectively. Tardebigge's history outside the county is even more colourful, changing <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> Worcestershire to Staffordshire and Warwickshire, before returning to Worcestershire at differing times over the centuries. The southern boundary of the county was also complex, with parish boundaries penetrating deep into Gloucestershire and vice versa.|$|E

5|$|After {{an armored}} car leaves a bank with ten million dollars, it is {{attacked}} en route by Diabolik who manages {{to steal the}} money and escape with his partner Eva Kant. Leaving the money in their underground hideout, Diabolik and Eva attend a press conference held by the Minister of the Interior which they disrupt by releasing laughing gas. Due to {{the high level of}} crime, the death penalty is brought back. The police cannot find Diabolik, and gang leader Valmont suffers at their <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> a clampdown because of his actions. Realising things can only get worse because of Diabolik's crime spree, Valmont contacts Inspector Ginko and makes a deal to catch him for the police. At his hideout, Diabolik decides to steal the famous Aksand emerald necklace from the Saint Just Castle for Eva's birthday. Valmont builds up an identikit picture of Eva and circulates it as a means of capturing Diabolik. Diabolik scales the walls of Saint Just Castle where he finds the police lying in wait. He manages to steal the necklace by fooling the police officers with mirrors on the road and dummy decoys of himself.|$|E

25|$|Later, Reese {{made use}} of the growing library of <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> {{international}} competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. Famous <b>Hands</b> <b>from</b> Famous Matches {{was the first of}} these, followed by Famous Bidding Decisions and Famous Play Decisions, all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and instructive hands. What Would You Bid? was the result.|$|E
25|$|Gloves protect <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> {{the rope}} and from hits with the wall. They are mainly used by {{recreational}} abseilers, industrial access practitioners, adventure racers and military as opposed to climbers or mountaineers. In fact, they can {{increase the risk of}} accident by becoming caught in the descender in certain situations.|$|E
25|$|Gloves: Paintball impacts to the hands, {{knuckles}} {{and fingers}} {{can be extremely}} painful and temporarily debilitating. In addition, this being an outdoor sport, players are often prone or crawling which can cause scrapes to the hands. Padded or armored gloves help reduce the potential for injury to the <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> these things.|$|E

25|$|Handle: The handle is {{long enough}} for a two-handed grip and is far enough from the socket to give enough {{leverage}} to wind the paddle up or down. There may be a freely rotating sleeve around the handle to protect the <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> the friction of rough iron against skin.|$|E
25|$|Almost all authors {{agree that}} where a player {{sits in the}} order of play (known as position) is an {{important}} element of Texas hold 'em strategy, particularly in no-limit hold'em. Players who act later have more information than players who act earlier. As a result, players typically play fewer <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> early positions than later positions.|$|E

The Victorian ATMOEA experienced parallel changes, with control of the state branch swinging from its old guard Maoist leadership to a moderate-leaning ticket around this time.|$|E

25|$|More specifically, wudu is {{performed}} by Muslims by washing the hands, mouth, nose, arms, face, hair (often washing {{the hair is}} merely drawing the already wet <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> the fringe to the nape of the neck), ears, and feet three times each in that order. (It is not obligatory to wash the hair three times, once is sufficient, and men must also wash their beard and mustache when washing the face).|$|E
25|$|The Le Touret Commonwealth War Graves Commission {{cemetery}} and memorial is sited at Richebourg. It was begun in November 1914 by the Indian Corps (in particular by the 2nd Battalion, Leicestershire Regiment), remaining in use {{until the end}} of the war (barring a time in German <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> April–August 1918); the Le Touret Memorial is part of the cemetery.

25|$|Goalkeepers {{must also}} wear a {{different}} coloured kit from the outfielders and officials. Common colours include yellow, green, grey, black and shades of blue. Since the 1970s, goalkeepers have also typically worn specialised gloves. They provide better {{grip on the}} ball and protect their <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> hard shots and headers, as well {{making it easier to}} punch or push the ball away. Caps were common between the 1910s and 1960s, as well as woolly jumpers, but these are not worn in any professional or semi-professional context today.|$|E
25|$|This {{novel is}} notable for its overt use of coincidence, such as Mrs Oliver {{going into a}} café that happens to contain the girl she is seeking, and having a key piece of {{evidence}} literally fall into her <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> a drawer as furniture is being removed from a dead woman's flat. This very obvious use of coincidence is known as open authorial manipulation and {{is often used to}} draw the reader's attention to the artificiality of the plot. It is highly appropriate to a detective novel in which a central character writes detective fiction and is an example of metafiction.|$|E
25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the <b>hands</b> <b>from</b> those surfaces.|$|E
