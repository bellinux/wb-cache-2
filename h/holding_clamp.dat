40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a deep drawing die (1) with a top die and a bottom die (2, 3), wherein the top die (2) has a <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) and the bottom die (3) has a die plate (3 a), and wherein at least one device (6), with which {{the distance between the}} <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) and the die plate (3 a) can be modified in portions or partially, is arranged in a flange region. The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a deep drawing die (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a top die and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) and die plate (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the die plate (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between die plate (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and <b>holding</b> down <b>clamp</b> (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{structure}} of the E. coli β clamp polymerase processivity factor has been solved in complex with primed DNA. Interestingly, the clamp directly binds the DNA duplex and also forms a crystal contact with the ssDNA template strand, which binds into the protein-binding pocket of the clamp. We demonstrate that these clamp-DNA interactions function in clamp loading, perhaps by inducing the ring to close around DNA. Clamp binding to template ssDNA may also serve to <b>hold</b> the <b>clamp</b> at a primed site after loading or during switching of multiple factors on the clamp. Remarkably, the DNA is highly tilted as it passes through the β ring. The pronounced 22 ° angle of DNA through β may enable DNA to switch between multiple factors bound to a single clamp simply by alternating from one protomer of the ring to the other...|$|R

5000|$|The clover clamp, also {{referred}} to as a [...] "butterfly clamp", is of Japanese design and provides increasing tension if pulled. The clamp itself is flat, about 5 cm by 10 cm (2 by 4 in) in size. The clamp is applied to the nipple and the spring tension <b>holds</b> the <b>clamp</b> in place. The clamp usually provides a very high pain level, and is usually only used by more advanced users. To increase tension on the nipples, small weights such as fishing line sinkers can be attached {{to the ends of the}} clamp. As increased pulling tension is applied to the clamp, it will cause the jaws of the clamp to close tighter, depending on the amount of pull pressure. Another method is to use the clamps to keep a person in one place. If cord is tied from the clamp to a fixed place, the wearer of the clamps cannot move away because the clamps will tighten as they move. Eventually the clamps would be pulled off the nipples but not before considerable pain is felt. If left on for too long can cause nipple irritation.|$|R

Choline is not impermeant and partially substitutes for Na; the slope of Vrev vs. log Nao is 20 mV/decade (mean for three cells). Vrev does not change when Na is replaced by Li. Decreases in the bath concentrations of Ca, Mg, Cl, or K do not affect Vrev. When Nao = 212 mM, Vrev becomes more positive when Ko is increased.
