5|$|Anatomical dissections of two brown {{pelicans}} in 1939 {{showed that}} pelicans have {{a network of}} subcutaneous air sacs under their skin situated across the ventral surface including the throat, breast and undersides of the wings, as well as having air sacs in their bones. The air sacs {{are connected to the}} airways of the respiratory system, and the pelican can keep its air sacs inflated by closing its glottis, {{but it is not clear}} how air sacs are inflated. The air sacs serve to keep the pelican remarkably buoyant in the water and may also cushion the impact of the pelican's body on the water surface when they dive from flight into water to catch fish. Superficial air sacs may also help to round body contours (especially over the abdomen where surface protuberances may be caused by viscera changing size and position) to enable the overlying feathers to form more effective <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> and also to enable feathers to be held in position for good aerodynamics.|$|E

25|$|Heat in a {{solar thermal}} system {{is guided by}} five basic principles: heat gain; heat transfer; heat storage; heat transport; and <b>heat</b> <b>insulation.</b> Here, heat is {{the measure of the}} amount of thermal energy an object {{contains}} and is determined by the temperature, mass and specific heat of the object. Solar thermal power plants use heat exchangers that are designed for constant working conditions, to provide heat exchange. Copper heat exchangers are important in solar thermal heating and cooling systems because of copper’s high thermal conductivity, resistance to atmospheric and water corrosion, sealing and joining by soldering, and mechanical strength. Copper is used both in receivers and in primary circuits (pipes and heat exchangers for water tanks) of solar thermal water systems.|$|E

25|$|The Bombardier ART {{model has}} {{undergone}} several redesigns {{from the original}} UTDC ICTS model, and the Mark II design has been updated by Bombardier, with this newest offering being the Innovia Metro 300. Dimensions {{are similar to the}} Mark II, with capacity improvements offered over the outgoing model through redesigned car layout. TransLink ordered 28 Mark III cars, which began delivery in 2015, and went into service beginning in August 2016. The vehicles appear sleeker, with larger windows {{on the sides of the}} train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars. The interior is largely similar to the second generation of Mark II cars, with the some seats removed to better accommodate bicycles and strollers. TransLink has claimed that the interior of the Mark III offers better sound and <b>heat</b> <b>insulation.</b> TransLink ordered the cars for the Evergreen Extension in a 4-car articulated configuration, with two centre cars, to allow full length train movements by passengers. However, due to a shortage of trains, the Mark IIIs are being used on the Expo Line, while 2-car Innovia 200 (Mk2) serve the Millennium Line. On December 16, 2016, TransLink ordered 28 more Mark III cars, which will bring the total number of Mark III cars to 56 once they go into service in early 2019.|$|E

[...] The rise in air and temperature ratio means compression {{does not follow}} a simple pressure to volume ratio. This is less efficient, but quick. Adiabatic compression or expansion more closely model real life when a compressor has good insulation, a large gas volume, or a short time scale (i.e., a high power level). In practice {{there will always be}} a certain amount of heat flow out of the compressed gas. Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect <b>heat</b> <b>insulation</b> of all parts of the machine.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of research work on the effective use of solar collectors which was realized in the solar energy testing polygon at the Institute of Physical Energetics. A certain proportion of the energy generated by solar thermal system is spent as the heat losses in pipelines between the solar energy absorbing device and the heat-accumulation tank. Insulation of solar thermal system’s pipelines is necessary for both outdoor and indoor pipes. Outdoor <b>heat</b> pipes <b>insulation</b> reduces systems <b>heat</b> losses outside, while, indoor <b>heat</b> pipe <b>insulation</b> reduces value of unnecessary energy distribution inside in the summer period.
