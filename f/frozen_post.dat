40|$|Ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} syndrome (OHSS) {{remains a}} major complication of IVF. Triggering ovulation with human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) (as a surrogate to LH) {{is a major}} factor in the initiation of OHSS. The pathological process usually intensifies if pregnancy is achieved, as the rising endogenous HCG overstimulates the corpora lutea. Decreasing HCG trigger dose does not prevent OHSS. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) induce endogenous LH and FSH surges that reliably trigger ovulation, even if a GnRH antagonist is used during ovarian stimulation. Moreover, such a trigger quickly and irreversibly induces luteolysis, thereby preventing OHSS. Contrasting reports regarding clinical outcome probably reflect different approaches to luteal phase support. Zygotes or embryos <b>frozen</b> <b>post</b> GnRHa trigger give excellent clinical outcome post thaw. In summary, GnRHa trigger is the key for complete OHSS prevention...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The mucosal {{immune system}} {{undergoes}} extensive changes {{in early childhood}} in response to environmental stimuli. Dendritic cells (DC) {{play a major role}} in the development of the immune system. However, few data exist on the influence of continuous environmental stimulation on the distribution and phenotype of human airway DC. METHODS: Human tissue samples are mostly paraffin embedded which limits the use of several antibodies, and respiratory tissue for cryopreservation is difficult to obtain. Human <b>frozen</b> <b>post</b> mortem tracheal tissue was therefore used for this study. Only samples with epithelial adherence to the basement membrane were included (n = 34). Immunohistochemical staining and sequential overlay immunofluorescence were performed with DC-SIGN and a panel of leucocyte markers co-expressed by DC. RESULTS: DC detected in the human tracheal mucosa using DC-SIGN correlated with the expression of HLA-DR, co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules. Higher cell densities were found at the ventral tracheal site of patients older than 1 year than in infants in the first year of life. CONCLUSION: The increasing population of mucosal DC with age could reflect immunological maturation...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} induced {{pluripotent}} stem cells (iPSCs) 1 revolutionized Human Genetics by allowing us to generate pluripotent cells from easily accessible somatic tissues. This technology can have immense implications for regenerative medicine, but iPSCs also represent a paradigm shift in the study of complex human phenotypes, including gene regulation and disease 2 - 5. Yet, an unresolved caveat of the iPSC model system {{is the extent to which}} reprogrammed iPSCs retain residual phenotypes from their precursor somatic cells. To directly address this issue, we used an effective study design to compare regulatory phenotypes between iPSCs derived from two types of commonly used somatic precursor cells. We show that the cell type of origin only minimally affects gene expression levels and DNA methylation in iPSCs. Instead, genetic variation is the main driver of regulatory differences between iPSCs of different donors. Research on human subjects is limited by the availability of samples. Practical and ethical considerations dictate that functional molecular studies in humans can generally only make use of <b>frozen</b> <b>post</b> mortem tissues, a small collection of available cell lines, or easily accessible primary cell types (such as blood or skin cells). The discovery that human somatic cells can b...|$|E
40|$|Nurses {{constitute}} the largest professional group in South Africa's health care services. Factors contributing to South African nurses' emigration were studied qualitatively by analysing expatriate nurses' responses to open-ended questions, and quantitatively by analysing newly registered nurses' responses to structured questionnaires. These results were contextualised within Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory, revealing that nurses' inability {{to meet their}} physiological needs, due to inadequate remuneration, was the major factor contributing to nurses' emigration potential. While improved salaries might enable more nurses to remain in South Africa, expatriate nurses would not return to South Africa unless certain esteem and self-actualisation needs could also be satisfied. Improving nurses' salaries is essential to address South African nurses' emigration potential. However, improved working conditions, enhanced workplace security, improved levels of job satisfaction and the appointment of nurses into currently <b>frozen</b> <b>posts</b> are also necessary, as is governmental and public recognition {{of the value of}} the profession. The South African nursing profession, health care services, Government and society should urgently address factors contributing to South African nurses' emigration potential; otherwise a serious shortage of nurses could cause the collapse of this country's health care services.

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the role of two different harvest protocols on the post mortem physiology of Chinook salmon, and associated deteriorative processes that occur during frozen storage of the white muscle tissue. The two different harvest methods employed, termed 'rested' and 'exercised', were selected because of the contrasting levels of activity of the animal prior to, and upon, slaughter. While the latter represents conventional harvest techniques Rested and exercised harvesting protocols produced tissue in significantly different physiological states. Immediately post harvest, rested tissue maintained high metabolic energy stores of ATP and glycogen within the tissue, with low concentrations of tissue and plasma lactate. Exercised tissue exhibited near depleted concentrations of ATP and glycogen and a marked metabolic acidosis and lactate accumulation. When <b>frozen</b> immediately <b>post</b> harvest, rested white muscle tissue stored at - 19 ℃ showed no significant changes in these metabolite concentrations over a six month period of profiling. However, during storage of rested tissue at - 9 ℃, hydrolysis of ATP and glycogen with no coincident increase in lactate was observed. No significant changes in metabolite levels were observed within exercised tissue stored at - 19 and - 9 ℃, owing to the lack of metabolic energy stores. Transfer of tissue from frozen (- 80 and - 19 ℃) to chilled (- 1 and + 4 ℃) temperatures witnessed a rapid depletion of tissue ATP and glycogen stores, with rapid increases in tissue lactate concentrations. This metabolic activity was more significant in rested tissue owing to the larger concentrations of metabolic energy stores. This metabolic activity was identified to occur between the temperatures of - 3 and - 1. 5 ℃ and occurred abruptly (i. e. ATP concentrations depleting in less than one hour) in time. During frozen storage (- 19 ℃ and - 9 ℃), harvest treatment had no significant effect on lipid oxidation processes. However, rested tissue showed a significant ability to retard lipid oxidation processes once removed from frozen storage and placed at chilled temperatures. Throughout six months storage at - 19 ℃ storage, harvest treatment had a significant effect on the rate of protein denaturation as rested tissue consistently held higher concentrations of soluble protein over the storage period. No significant effect was observed between treatments in the rate of protein denaturation during one month frozen (- 19 ℃) then chilled (+ 4 ℃) storage. In a supplementary frozen (- 80 ℃) then chilled (- 1 ℃) storage experiment, post mortem storage of rested, whole fish, at chilled (+ 5 ℃) temperatures prior to white muscle excision and freezing, was compared to rested and exercised tissue in which the white muscle had been excised and then <b>frozen</b> immediately <b>post</b> harvest. In this experiment rested tissue exposed to a 6 or 24 hour post mortem chilled storage period demonstrated significant retardation of lipid oxidation processes when compared to rested white muscle tissue that was excised and <b>frozen</b> immediately <b>post</b> harvest. Further comparison of the six and 24 hour post mortem stored tissue showed a significant increase in lipid oxidation products after 21 and 24 days chilled storage, respectively. Comparison of results from the six and 24 hour post mortem storage experiment were bordering on significance (p= 0. 083), warranting further investigation on the effect of post mortem storage of rested tissue on lipid oxidation processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background While {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) and {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) are primarily inflammatory and degenerative disorders respectively, there is increasing evidence for shared cellular mechanisms that may affect disease progression, particularly glial responses. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) inhibition prolongs survival and cannabinoids ameliorate progression of clinical disease in animal models of ALS and MS respectively, but the mechanism is uncertain. Therefore, three key molecules known to be expressed in activated microglial cells/macrophages, COX- 2, CB 2 and P 2 X 7, which {{plays a role in}} inflammatory cascades, were studied in MS and ALS post-mortem human spinal cord. Methods <b>Frozen</b> human <b>post</b> mortem spinal cord specimens, controls (n = 12), ALS (n = 9) and MS (n = 19), were available for study by immunocytochemistry and Western blotting, using specific antibodies to COX- 2, CB 2 and P 2 X 7, and markers of microglial cells/macrophages (CD 68, ferritin). In addition, autoradiography for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites was performed on some spinal cord sections using [3 H] (R) -PK 11195, a marker of activated microglial cells/macrophages. Results of immunostaining and Western blotting were quantified by computerized image and optical density analysis respectively. Results In control spinal cord, few small microglial cells/macrophages-like COX- 2 -immunoreactive cells, mostly bipolar with short processes, were scattered throughout the tissue, whilst MS and ALS specimens had significantly greater density of such cells with longer processes in affected regions, by image analysis. Inflammatory cell marker CD 68 -immunoreactivity, [3 H] (R) -PK 11195 autoradiography, and double-staining against ferritin confirmed increased production of COX- 2 by activated microglial cells/macrophages. An expected 70 -kDa band was seen by Western blotting which was significantly increased in MS spinal cord. There was good correlation between the COX- 2 immunostaining and optical density of the COX- 2 70 -kDa band in the MS group (r = 0. 89, P = 0. 0011, n = 10). MS and ALS specimens also had significantly greater density of P 2 X 7 and CB 2 -immunoreactive microglial cells/macrophages in affected regions. Conclusion It is hypothesized that the known increase of lesion-associated extracellular ATP contributes via P 2 X 7 activation to release IL- 1 beta which in turn induces COX- 2 and downstream pathogenic mediators. Selective CNS-penetrant COX- 2 and P 2 X 7 inhibitors and CB 2 specific agonists deserve evaluation in the progression of MS and ALS. </p...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in using wild animals to monitor the real-life cocktail effect of environmental chemicals on male reproduction. However, practical difficulties, such as long distances to the laboratory, generally prolong the time between euthanisation and specimen handling. For instance, tissue fixation is often performed on frozen material or on material where deterioration has started, which may affect tissue morphology. This study examined the effect of pre-fixation delay and freezing on mink testicular endpoints {{in order to determine}} robust endpoints in suboptimally handled specimens. Sexually mature farmed mink (n= 30) selected at culling were divided into six groups and subjected to different time intervals between euthanisation and fixation or freezing: 0 hours (fixed immediately post mortem), 6 hours, 18 hours, 30 hours, 42 hours, or <b>frozen</b> 6 hours <b>post</b> mortem and thawed overnight. Unaffected endpoints when pre-fixation storage was extended to 30 hours included: area and diameter of the seminiferous tubules, length and weight of the testes, and acrosomes marked with Gata- 4. Epithelial height, Sertoli cells marked with Gata- 4 and cell morphology were affected endpoints after 6 hours of storage. Freezing the tissue prior to fixation severely altered cell morphology and reduced testicular weight, tubular diameter and area. Morphological changes seen after 6 hours included shredded germ cells and excess cytoplasm in seminiferous tubular lumen, chromatin rearrangements and increased germ cell death. Extended delay before fixation and freezing affected many endpoints in the mink testicular tissue. Some of these endpoints may mimic chemically induced effects, which is important to consider when evaluating specimens from wild animals for environmental toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Constant {{strain rate}} {{uniaxial}} compressive strength {{tests were conducted}} on saturated samples of six fine-grained <b>frozen</b> soils. The <b>post</b> peak compressive strength behavior of the frozen soils {{with respect to the}} variation in total water content, dry unit weight and the temperature conditions are studied. Test results indicated a ductile type of deformation for the frozen soils with generally low total water contents and at Fmperature conditions close to freezing. A brittle type of failure was observed for the frozen soils with high total water contents. The residual compressive strength of the frozen soils are found to be independent of the dry unit weight. However, for all the frozen soils the ratio of peak compressive strength to residual strength is found to decrease with increasing dry unit weight. An empirical relationship has been developed to express this behavior, which is also relatively temperature independent.
