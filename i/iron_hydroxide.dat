5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

During the dechlorination process, Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + deposit on the surfaces of Fe NPs, leading {{to the formation of}} <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and thickening the iron oxide shell. In the presence of PGA, Fe ions coming from the dechlorination reaction would form complexes with PGA and restrain the formation of <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides,</b> thus preventing the precipitate of Fe hydroxide on the surface, preserving the active sites of the Fe-Pd NPs and providing a favorable microenvironment for retaining dechlorination reactivity.

30|$|All of the {{nanostructures}} of {{the present}} study have started from the identically prepared as-cast films. Since the precursor solution has been stirred in air for 5  h, {{it is likely that the}} Fe 3 + ions are condensed into <b>iron</b> oxide <b>hydroxide</b> particles, probably sub-nanometer in size. Therefore, the as-cast films are mainly composed of <b>iron</b> oxide <b>hydroxide</b> particles and F 127. Most of the solvent ethanol would have been lost by evaporation before the as-cast films were placed in the aging chamber. However, there must be some ethanol left in the film, at least, for a while so that the film materials (<b>iron</b> oxide <b>hydroxide</b> particles and F 127) can move around to attain a self-assembly structure. From the morphology of the FN(80  °C, 0  %) sample, which has not experienced the effect of water and thus is expected to maintain the structure of the as-cast film, we can infer that the self-assembly structure of the as-cast film is composed of rod-like micelles whose inside is filled with removable organics and outside is occupied by <b>iron</b> oxide <b>hydroxide</b> particles. Therefore, in the as-cast film state, the hydrophobic PO blocks of F 127 are segregated into micelle rods and the hydrophilic EO blocks are associated with the <b>iron</b> oxide <b>hydroxide</b> particles forming hydrophilic domains.|$|R
40|$|A multisurface {{model is}} used to {{evaluate}} the contribution of various sorption surfaces to the control of heavy metal activity in sandy soil samples at pH 3. 7 - 6. 1 with different sorbent contents. This multisurface model considers soil as a set of independent sorption surfaces, i. e. organic matter (NICA-Donnan), clay silicate (Donnan), and <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> (DDL, CD-MUSIC). The activities of Cu 2, Cd 2, Zn 2, Ni 2, and Pb 2 in equilibrium with the soil have been measured using a Donnan membrane technique. The metal activities predicted by the model agree with those measured reasonably well over a wide concentration range for all the metals of interest except for Pb. The modeling results suggest that soil organic matter is the most important sorbent that controls the activity of Cu 2, Cd 2, Zn 2, and Ni 2 in these sandy soils. When metal loading is high in comparison with soil organic matter content, the contribution of clay silicates to metal binding becomes more important. Adsorption to <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> is found not significant in these samples for Cu, Cd, Zn, and Ni. However, for Pb the model estimates strong adsorption on <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides.</b> The model predicts that acidification will not only lead to increased solution concentrations but also to a shift toward more nonspecific cation-exchange type binding especially for the metals Cd, Zn, and Ni.

50|$|In some ores, {{particularly}} those that are partially sulfidized, aeration (prior {{to the introduction of}} cyanide) of the ore in water at high pH can render elements such as iron and sulfur less reactive to cyanide, therefore making the gold cyanidation process more efficient.

40|$|A {{plume of}} pyrite cinder {{leachate}} originates in an aquifer {{in the vicinity}} of a canal. Besides being slightly acidic, the plume carries dissolved concentrations of As, Zn and Ni. The canal has a variable stage, either leading the aquifer to drain into the canal or canal water infiltration into the aquifer. In order to assess to what extent sorption to <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> combined with seasonal reductive dissolution could be responsible for contaminant patterns observed in the field, a 2 D reactive transport model using MODFLOW and PHT 3 D was setup. The model is a cross-section to the canal, and a time-dependent river boundary is used to simulate the varying stage of the canal. The model incorporates diffuse double layer sorption on <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> and cation exchange. It maximizes the potential reductive dissolution of <b>iron</b> <b>hydroxides</b> that could ensue from the oscillatory infiltration drainage patterns.

Through {{the way in which they}} affect the flow field, conductivity and temporal discretization of the canal stage boundary condition are seen to affect redox and acidity sensitive reactions. Effects of the flow field on dilution are also apparent.
