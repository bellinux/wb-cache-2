5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When <b>deflated,</b> {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a knapsack, and when <b>deflated</b> served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|The Patrie {{was then}} <b>deflated</b> for {{alterations}} {{that included the}} addition of a 500cubic metre (17,660ft³) cylindrical section to the gas-bag, a change to the empennage (as mentioned above) and provision of new propellers.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the Wake Forest kickoff, however, Georgia Tech's hopes were quickly <b>deflated</b> by three plays {{that resulted in}} negative yardage or no gain. Georgia Tech was forced into its final punt of the game, and Wake Forest received the ball and ran out the remaining time on the clock. Wake Forest won the 2006 ACC Championship Game by a 96 score.|$|E
25|$|When {{compressing}} ZIP or gzip files, 7-Zip {{uses its}} own <b>DEFLATE</b> encoder, which may achieve higher compression, but at lower speed, {{than the more}} common zlib <b>DEFLATE</b> implementation. The 7-Zip <b>deflate</b> encoder implementation is available separately {{as part of the}} AdvanceCOMP suite of tools.|$|R
5000|$|<b>DEFLATE</b> - Standard {{algorithm}} {{based on}} 32 kB LZ77 and Huffman coding. <b>Deflate</b> {{is found in}} several file formats including ZIP, gzip, PNG and PDF. 7-Zip contains a from-scratch <b>DEFLATE</b> encoder that frequently beats the de facto standard zlib version in compression size, but {{at the expense of}} CPU usage.|$|R
25|$|PNG uses <b>DEFLATE,</b> a non-patented {{lossless}} {{data compression}} algorithm {{that uses a}} combination of LZ77 and Huffman coding. Permissively-licensed <b>DEFLATE</b> implementations, such as zlib, are widely available.|$|R
5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} moderate Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after traveling to the Midwest to gain delegates. Dirksen's support further <b>deflated</b> the Stop Goldwater movement, as the Senator had criticized Goldwater's earlier vote against the Civil Rights Act, but concluded upon further review {{that he was only}} being consistent with his views. Richard Nixon followed suit and endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E
5|$|The artwork for 808s & Heartbreak {{followed}} the minimalist {{style of the}} album. The cover art features a <b>deflated</b> heart-shaped baloon. It was photographed by Kristen Yiengst and designed by Virgil Abloh and Willo Perron, and the deluxe edition's artwork was made by pop artist Kaws. The album's artwork also include photographs of West, taken by Willy Vanderperre, and a photograph of West kissing his mother on the cheek, taken by Danny Clinch. In 2013, Complex named it the best rap album cover {{of the past five}} years.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules <b>deflated,</b> and started to dry up, forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} about {{a parallel}} {{implementation of the}} <b>deflate</b> loss less compression program is described. The performance of the parallel implementation is compared to the sequential <b>deflate</b> program running on Intel Quad Core processor. The parallel <b>deflate</b> algorithm works by taking the input data and running them through the ZIV-Lempel algorithm simultaneously on multiple cores using threads. The results show that a speedup is achieved by using the parallel <b>deflate</b> program on systems with multiple cores. This will greatly reduce the time taken to compress large amounts of data...|$|R

5|$|Thorpe and the Liberals were <b>deflated</b> by {{the outcome}} of the October 1974 election. Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a {{distinctive}} identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well {{to the left of the}} official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, his days as leader might be numbered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deflated</b> by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau {{to appeal}} for French aid, and allowed Pigneau {{to take his}} son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him {{as a sign of}} good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had {{considered}} enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh's original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh's royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.|$|E
5|$|Ferrari's {{strategy}} for {{staying in the}} championship battle saw them introduce upgrades to the F2012 at every remaining race in the season, starting with an extensive revision for the Indian Grand Prix, but whatever advantage they offered was still not enough for Fernando Alonso to catch Sebastian Vettel. Vettel dominated the weekend, setting the fastest time in every practice session before qualifying on pole, and leading every lap of the sixty-lap race, though he was denied his third Grand Chelem when Jenson Button set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap. Fernando Alonso finished second, conceding another seven championship points to Vettel. The Ferrari driver rounded up both McLaren drivers {{at the start of}} the race and proceeded to chase down Mark Webber for second, only overtaking the Australian on the long back straight when his car developed a KERS fault fifteen laps from the end that it never recovered from. Webber held off a late challenge from Lewis Hamilton to complete the podium. Further down the order, Kimi Räikkönen finished seventh after spending most of the race trapped behind Felipe Massa, and later claimed that mistakes on Saturday had robbed him of a podium on Sunday, while Pedro de la Rosa retired from the race when he suffered a brake failure that saw him spin into the barriers at Turn 4. The race was marked by a series of explosive punctures after cars made light contact with one another; Michael Schumacher's right-rear tyre <b>deflated</b> on the first lap when he made contact with Jean-Éric Vergne at the first corner; Sergio Pérez suffered a puncture under similar circumstances when he glanced Daniel Ricciardo's front wing, with the loose rubber damaging the floor of Pérez's car enough that he was forced into retirement; and Pastor Maldonado also had a tyre punctured when he and Kamui Kobayashi touched at speed on the approach to Turn 5, forcing the Venezuelan to run wide onto the tarmac run-off, but suffering no lasting damage.|$|E
50|$|AdvanceCOMP {{works with}} files using the LZ/Huffman-based {{compression}} algorithm known as <b>DEFLATE,</b> {{the most widely}} used compression encoding systems in use. A large number of file-formats include <b>DEFLATE</b> as part of their specification, most notably PNG, gzip and ZIP.|$|R
50|$|Zopfli can output {{either a}} raw <b>DEFLATE</b> data stream or <b>DEFLATE</b> data {{encapsulated}} into gzip or zlib formats. It can be configured {{to do more}} or less iterations than the default 15 to trade processing time for compression efficiency.|$|R

The first chute, which blocked the forward right exit, nearly suffocated a flight attendant and was <b>deflated</b> by a pilot with a fire axe from the cockpit. The second chute expanded {{toward the center of}} the aircraft near the fire. It trapped a second flight attendant until a co-pilot <b>deflated</b> it with a dinner knife.|$|E
25|$|After the {{manoeuvres}} {{the crew}} which was assigned {{the task of}} returning the République to Chalais-Meudon decided to fly her back, rather than have her <b>deflated</b> and dismantled for the return journey by rail. On the morning of 25 September 1909 while near the Château of Avrilly, one of the metal propeller blades sheared off its shaft and pierced the envelope, which <b>deflated</b> catastrophically, causing the République to crash into ground at high speed, killing all four crew members: Capt. Marchal, Lt. Chauré, and the 'Adjudants mecaniciens', Vincenot and Réau.|$|E
5000|$|PXR24 (24 bit data {{conversion}} then <b>deflate</b> compression): This form of compression from Pixar converts data to 24 bit then uses <b>deflate</b> compression. It is lossless for half and 32bit integer data and slightly lossy for 32bit float data.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]ZIP File Format Specification {{documents}} the following compression methods: Store (no compression), Shrink, Reduce (levels 1-4), Implode, <b>Deflate,</b> Deflate64, bzip2, LZMA (EFS), WavPack, and PPMd. The {{most commonly used}} compression method is <b>DEFLATE,</b> which is described in IETF RFC 1951.|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of PNGOUT {{is to reduce}} the size of image data contained in the IDAT chunk. This chunk is compressed using the <b>DEFLATE</b> algorithm. <b>Deflate</b> algorithms can vary in speed and compression ratio, with higher compression ratios generally implying lower speed. Ken Silverman wrote a <b>DEFLATE</b> compressor for PNGOUT that is slower than the ones used in most graphics software, but produces smaller files. PNGOUT also performs automatic bit depth, color, and palette reduction where appropriate.|$|R

5000|$|... zlib {{compressed}} data are typically written with a gzip or a zlib wrapper. The wrapper encapsulates the raw <b>DEFLATE</b> data {{by adding a}} header and trailer. This provides stream identification and error detection that are not provided by the raw <b>DEFLATE</b> data.|$|R
5000|$|... gzip {{is based}} on the <b>DEFLATE</b> algorithm, which is a {{combination}} of LZ77 and Huffman coding. <b>DEFLATE</b> was intended as a replacement for LZW and other patent-encumbered data compression algorithms which, at the time, limited the usability of compress and other popular archivers.|$|R
2500|$|... zopfli and the LZMA SDK employ <b>DEFLATE</b> {{implementations}} {{that produce}} higher compression ratios than the zlib reference implementation {{at the cost}} of performance. AdvanceCOMP's advpng and advdef can use either of these libraries to re-compress PNG files. Additionally, PNGOUT contains its own proprietary <b>DEFLATE</b> implementation.|$|R
25|$|On November 19, 1981, a rapid {{accumulation}} of over {{a foot of}} snow caused the roof to collapse, requiring it to be re-inflated. It <b>deflated</b> the following winter on December 30, 1982, again because of a tear caused by heavy snow. This was four days before the Vikings played the Dallas Cowboys in the last regular-season game of the 1982 NFL season. In the spring following that same winter, on April 14, 1983, the Metrodome roof <b>deflated</b> because of a tear caused by a late-season heavy snow, and the scheduled Twins' game with the California Angels was postponed. On April 26, 1986, the Metrodome roof suffered a slight tear because of high winds, causing a nine-minute delay {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning versus the Angels; however, the roof did not deflate.|$|E
