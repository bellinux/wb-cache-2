2500|$|UV ozone {{generators}} use ambient air for ozone production, no air prep systems are used (air dryer or oxygen concentrator), therefore these generators {{tend to be}} less expensive. [...] However UV {{ozone generators}} usually produce ozone with a concentration of about 0.5% or lower which limits the potential ozone production rate. Another disadvantage of this method is that it requires the ambient air (oxygen) to be exposed to the UV source for a longer amount of time, and any gas that is not exposed to the UV source will not be treated. This makes UV generators impractical for use in situations that deal with rapidly moving air or water streams (<b>in-duct</b> air sterilization, for example). Production of ozone is one of the potential dangers of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation. VUV ozone generators are used in swimming pool and spa applications ranging to millions of gallons of water. VUV ozone generators, unlike corona discharge generators, do not produce harmful nitrogen by-products and also unlike corona discharge systems, VUV ozone generators work extremely well in humid air environments. There is also not normally a need for expensive off-gas mechanisms, and no need for air driers or oxygen concentrators which require extra costs and maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} (PCO) is {{an emerging}} {{technology in the}} HVAC industry. In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs. As of May 2009 {{there was no more}} disputable concern raised by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data that PCO may significantly increase the amount of formaldehyde in real indoor environments. As with other advanced technologies, sound engineering principles and practices should be employed by the HVAC designer to ensure proper application of the technology. Photocatalytic oxidation systems are able to completely oxidize and degrade organic contaminants. For example, Volatile Organic Compounds found low concentrations within a few hundred ppmv or less are the most likely to be completely oxidized.(PCO) uses short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC), commonly used for sterilization, to energize the catalyst (usually titanium dioxide (TiO2)) and oxidize bacteria and viruses. PCO <b>in-duct</b> units can be mounted to an existing forced-air HVAC system. PCO is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles. It is sometimes coupled with other filtering technologies for air purification. UV sterilization bulbs must be replaced about once a year; manufacturers may require periodic replacement as a condition of warranty. Photocatalytic Oxidation systems often have high commercial costs.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{several studies}} have sought to develop a {{generalised}} prediction method for flow-generated noise that is produced by the interaction of multiple elements in the air flow duct of an air-conditioning system. The prediction methods for single or multiple <b>in-duct</b> discontinuities {{are based on the}} assumption that there is a constant of proportionality between the fluctuating drag force and the steady drag force that acts on the flow spoilers. To develop a prediction method for multiple <b>in-duct</b> discontinuities, the concept of partially coherent sound fields is adopted to formulate the sound powers that are produced by the interaction of multiple <b>in-duct</b> elements at frequencies both below and above the cut-on frequency of the lowest transverse duct mode.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{measurement}} of broadband fan noise, which due to reductions in tonal and jet noise, is now the dominant source at approach, and a major contributor at takeo. This thesis proposes three new <b>in-duct</b> measurement techniques for the characterisation and measurement of broadband fan noise. A complete characterisation of broadband noise involves determining the sources of sound, their location, and the sound eld they generate. The rst new <b>in-duct</b> measurement technique uses inverse methods to determine the noise source strengths on a ducted fan. The novel aspect of this technique {{is that it allows}} source strengths to be determined both in the rotating (or rotor-bound) reference frame and stationary (stator-bound) reference frame. The second technique is the development of an <b>in-duct,</b> rotating focus beamformer that allows beamforming in both rotating and stationary reference frames using an <b>in-duct</b> microphone array. The ability of the beamformer to determine the strengths of the rotor-based and stator-based sources is demonstrated using numerical simulations, with particular emphasis on the determination of the relative contributions of the rotor and the stator to overall broadband noise. The third measurement technique is designed to allow radiated directivity patterns to be predicted from <b>in-duct</b> measurements. This technique allows the prediction of radiated directivity from hollow no-ow ducts, fan inlets and annular exhaust ducts from <b>in-duct</b> measurements. The technique is also validated using experimental data acquired from a no-ow duct rig. Finally, an in-situ phase calibration method for <b>in-duct</b> axial arrays is proposed. This technique allows the rapid calibration of microphone arrays used in the three measurement techniques presented in the thesis. The technique is validated using experimental data.

This fan {{can be used}} both to investigate active noise control and for more general fan aeroacoustics research. Several of the features and the design philosophies are presented. The most important feature is the installation of two mode measuring systems that enable the complete modal structure (all circumferential and radial orders) of both the inlet and exhaust ducts to be determined.

Computational fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to systematically improve the performance of <b>in-duct</b> UVC air sterilisation systems.

The new method also distinguishes between sound power transmitted in and against the direction of flow. It can be performed using wall-flush installed pressure sensors as well as radial sensor rakes in the flow. The method is mathematically derived based on the analytical solution of the wave equation describing sound propagation in ducts with superimposed static mean flow.

40|$|One {{method for}} deducing the {{strength}} of an acoustic source distribution from measurements of the radiated field involves the inversion of the matrix of frequency response functions relating the field measurement points to the strengths {{of a number of}} point sources used to represent the source distribution. This method uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) as the primary analysis tool and has shown some promise. In the transformation process associated with the SVD, {{the strength of}} the discretized point source can be simply represented by the pressure field and the inversion of corresponding matrix of the frequency response function and the transformed pressures and source distribution are related by single real numbers only (i. e., the singular values). Therefore, the resolution and the accuracy of the reconstruction produced by such inversion methods will be highly dependent on how these small singular values are treated during the inversion process. In the present work, the emphasis is placed on the description of the inverse method for the investigation of the characteristics of acoustic sources within a circular duct.

40|$|<b>In-duct</b> {{devices are}} {{commonly}} installed in flow ducts for various flow management purposes. The structural construction {{of these devices}} indispensably creates disruption to smooth flow through duct passages so they exist as structural discontinuities in duct flow. The presence of these discontinuities provides additional possibility of noise generation. In real practice, <b>in-duct</b> devices do not exist alone in any duct system. Even though each <b>in-duct</b> device would generate its own noise, {{it might be possible}} that these devices could be properly arranged so as to strengthen the interference between individual noise; thus giving rise to an overall reduction of noise radiation in the <b>in-duct</b> far field. This concept of passive noise control is investigated by considering different configurations of two structural discontinuities of simple form (i. e., a cavity) in tandem in an unconfined flow and in opposing setting within a flow duct. It is known that noise generated by a cavity in unconfined domain (unconfined cavity) is strongly dependent on flow-resonant behavior within the cavity so the interference it produces is merely aeroacoustic. The objective of the present study is to verify the concept of passive noise reduction through enhancement of aeroacoustic interference due to two cavities by considering laminar flow only. A two-dimensional approach is adopted for the direct aeroacoustic calculations using a direct numerical simulation (DNS) technique. The position and geometries of the cavities and the Mach number are varied; the resultant aeroacoustic behavior and acoustic power are calculated. The numerical results are compared with a single cavity case to highlight the effect of introducing additional cavities to the aeroacoustic problem. Resonant flow oscillations occur when two unconfined cavities are very close and the associated acoustic field is very intense with no noise reduction possible. However, for duct aeroacoustics, it is found that a 7. 9 db reduction of acoustic power in the downstream side of the duct or a total reduction of ∼ 6 db is possible with opposing cavities having an offset of half a cavity length. In addition, the reduction is shown to be free from lock-on with trapped modes of the ducts with cavities. Department of Building Services EngineeringDepartment of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Sound {{generation}} and propagation in circular ducts for frequencies beyond the cut-on frequencies of several higher order acoustic modes is investigated. To achieve this, experimental and numerical set-ups are designed {{and used to}} research aeroacoustic interactions between <b>in-duct</b> components and to conceive noise mitigation strategies. Describing <b>in-duct</b> sound for frequencies with a moderate number of propagating modes is important, for example, for improving the noise emission from mid-size ventilation systems. Challenges that are largely unacknowledged in the literature involve efficient test rig design, quantification of limits in the methods, numerical modelling, and development of effective noise mitigation strategies for higher order modes. In this thesis, <b>in-duct</b> sound is mapped {{on a set of}} propagating pressure eigenmodes to describe aeroacoustic components as multi-ports with sound scattering (passive properties) and a source strength (active properties). The presented analysis includes genetic algorithms and Monte Carlo Methods for test rig enhancement and evaluation, multi-port network predictions to identify model limitations, and scale resolving (IDDES) and Linearized Navier Stokes computations for numerical multi-port eduction and the silencer design. It is first shown that test rig optimization improves the quality of multi-port data significantly. Subsequently, measurements on orifice plates are used to test the network prediction model. The model works with high accuracy for two components that are sufficiently separated. For small separations, strong coupling effects are observed for the source strength but not for the scattering of sound. The measurements are used for numerical validation, which gives reliable results for coupled and uncoupled systems. The total acoustic power of tandem orifices is predicted with less than 2 dB deviation and the passive properties for most frequencies with less than 5 % difference from the measurement. The numerical (FEM) models are also used to design a completely integrated silencer for spinning modes that is based on micro-perforated plates and gives broadband attenuation of 3 - 6 dB per duct diameter silencer length. The multi-port method is a powerful tool when describing aerodynamically decoupled <b>in-duct</b> components in the low- to mid-frequency range. Due to a robust passive network prediction, multi-port methods are particular interesting for the design of silencer stages. Furthermore, the demonstrated applicability to numerical data opens novel application areas. QC 20170522 IdealVen...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} sound absorption by an <b>in-duct</b> orifice {{with and without}} flow was carried out using a sixth-order finite difference direct numerical simulation (DNS) scheme with explicit fourth-order time marching to solve the governing Navier-Stokes equation. The DNS scheme has previously been validated against benchmark aeroacoustic problems and good agreement was obtained. Thus, it was applied to simulate the acoustic impedance of a circular orifice with different openings and a laminar flow through the same orifice. Both discrete frequency and broadband excitations were studied. When the <b>in-duct</b> orifice is exposed to discrete frequency sound wave {{in the absence of}} flow, alternate vortex shedding {{on both sides of the}} orifice is observed. The strength of shed vortices is stronger at low frequencies and thus the reduction of sound energy is higher. These vortices dissipate while moving away from the orifice. Therefore, the process provides a mechanism for adsorption of incident sound. The numerical results of broadband excitation indicate that small orifice opening is a more efficient sound absorber whereas a large opening is more or less transparent to the incident wave. The absorption, reflection and transmission coefficients of the <b>in-duct</b> orifice are calculated by a transfer function method. It is found that the sound coefficients are strongly dependent on the orifice opening size and frequency. In the presence of a flow, only alternate vortex shedding on one side of the orifice is observed.

Results show that using this new 3 S-Array technique with two of the <b>in-duct</b> sensors and the focused beamformed signal as the third one, provides a better estimator of combustion noise than the 3 -signal coherence technique alone, or the Coherence-Output Power Spectra (COP), both of which are reported in the literature as methods for the extraction of combustion noise from the radiated noise spectrum...|$|E
40|$|If {{the inlet}} flow to a fan is non-uniform, {{as is often the}} case for {{aircraft}} engines, then undesirable tonal noise can be generated. A number of authors have suggested using active cancellation to reduce the noise. The secondary field can either be generated by loudspeakers or by the fan itself if secondary non-uniformities are deliberately introduced into the flow. In the research reported here rods inserted radially into the duct were used to generate the secondary field. The distance by which each rod protrudes into the duct was adaptively adjusted in response to an array of <b>in-duct</b> microphones so as to minimise the radiated sound power, whereas previously only fixed rods have been considered. The ability of the steepest-descent algorithm to minimise <b>in-duct</b> sound power under suitable conditions, and hence reduce radiated sound power is demonstrated in both simulations and low Mach number experiments. It is shown how the ability of such a system to control noise depends on the number and position of the controller rods, and the number of acoustic duct modes to be controlled. Thus at low fan speed, when only one mode was present just two controllers achieved an <b>in-duct</b> noise reduction of 25 dB at the blade passing frequency, whereas at a higher fan speed with three modes present six controllers only achieved 2 dB. To implement such a scheme in practice, where large numbers of modes are typically present, it would be necessary to develop controller arrays with many actuators, but with low aerodynamic penalty. Such a system might also be useful in HVAC applications, or in wind-tunnel testing...|$|E
40|$|Finite Element {{methods are}} {{presented}} for predicting fan noise radiation from turbofan aero-engines. Fan noise {{is a major}} contributors to whole aircraft noise for current High-Bypass-Ratio (HBR) aero-engines. The work reported here seeks to develop robust prediction methods for forward and aft-radiated noise {{which can be used}} to study and optimize the acoustic design of engine ducts. The current article focusses on propagation through the by-pass duct. Two hybrid methods are described in which <b>in-duct</b> propagation is predicted by using two different Finite Element approaches. Both are designed to model the effects of non-axisymmetric liners within such ducts. In both cases, radiation is dealt with by matching an <b>in-duct</b> finite element solution at the exhaust plane to an analytic radiation model which takes into account refraction through the shear layer and reflection from a acoustically hard centrebody. Results will be presented to illustrate the capabilities of such models and a simple benchmark problem is presented in which the predictions obtained from each methods are compared for acoustic scattering by hard rectangular patch in a lined annular duct...|$|E
40|$|Flow-{{generated}} noise {{generated on}} the quiet {{side of the}} primary attenuators of a ventilation system {{is the result of}} interaction between air flow and duct discontinuities. It is of engineering importance to predict the flow-generated noise caused by air duct elements in ventilation systems at the design stage. However, all prediction methods are based upon an isolated <b>in-duct</b> element that is very different from a real ventilation system. Until recently, Mak and Yang have produced a prediction method for flow-generated noise produced by the interaction of two elements in air ducts. In this paper, an attempt has been made to modify their equations so that their predictive equations can possibly be used to predict noise produced by "real" duct discontinuities. By comparing their predictive values with the experimental results of Oldham and Ukpoho, their validity can be proved. The modified Mak-Yang predictive equations, therefore, provide a basis for permitting a more accurate prediction of flow-generated noise produced by various configurations of two <b>in-duct</b> elements and duct dimensions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the prediction of flow noise from <b>in-duct</b> spoilers using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Previous work conducted by Mak [Mak CM. A prediction method for aerodynamic sound produced by multiple elements in air ducts. J Sound Vib 2005; 287 : 395 - 403] and Mak et al. [Mak CM, Wu J, Ye C, Yang J. Flow noise from spoilers in ducts. J Acoust Soc Am 2009; 125 : 3756 - 65] provides a method for such a prediction based on experimental data. In this work, the advanced Large-eddy Simulation turbulence model (LES) is used to compute the mean pressure drop across spoilers and the fluctuating drag forces acting on them. The predictions of the numerical simulation agree well with those based on experimental data and the actual, measured levels. With the aid of CFD simulation, engineers {{are now able to}} use the prediction method developed by the authors to predict the flow noise from <b>in-duct</b> spoilers using the LES turbulence model.

Though incomplete, these experimental data should prove useful for comparisons with theoretical predictions in testing analytical procedures and prediction techniques...|$|E
