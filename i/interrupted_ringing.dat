A pure spin current is generated by the interplay of breaking spin reversal symmetry, due to AC effect, and time-reversal symmetry breaking, intrinsic in parametric pumping procedure.

40|$|The {{structure}} {{of the top of}} the ascus in live and fixed Sarcoscypha coccinea has been studied with different methods of light microscopy. Electron micrographs have been made of median sections of asci first fixed in 1. 5 % KMnO 4, then postfixed with OSO 4. Light and electron microscopy give somewhat different but supplementary information on the lateral wall and the top of the ascus in Sarcoscypha. In the ascoplasm a funnel and a funiculus have been found. The ascus wall consists of three layers. (1) An outer layer, which after different stainings is visible with the light microscope, corresponds with the two outer strata of the stratified electron-transparent layer, and is very thin in the top. (2) A middle layer, which is formed by the inner stratum of the electron-transparent layer, continues with about the same thickness in the top. (3) An inner layer, which is anisotropic and electron-dense, is deposited {{on the inside of the}} wall after meiosis. This layer becomes very thick in the top.

40|$|AbstractDistinctive {{features}} of the flux mode regime in the Anderson-Josephson potential are analyzed using both semiclassical path-integral and instanton techniques. This potential governs {{the behavior of a}} superconducting <b>ring</b> <b>interrupted</b> by a weak Josephson junction. After establishing the relation between WKB and functional-integral approximations, semiclassical expansions are derived from a discretized version of the Feynman propagator. The physical meaning of instantons is extended to the condensed matter problem of “energy spectrum” for weak-link ring states localized near the minimum energy regions. Under certain circumstances, an improved WKB approximation enables us to find expression for the decay rates of metastable states, performing the reduction of the original Anderson-Josephson shape to a double-hump structure. Although we have not discussed here the temperature dependence of the Josephson plasma frequency, our calculations are consistent with recent theories for systems at finite temperatures with two metastable states separated by a potential energy barrier...|$|R

An rf superconducting quantum {{interference}} device (SQUID) {{consists of}} a superconducting <b>ring</b> <b>interrupted</b> by a Josephson junction (JJ). When driven by an alternating magnetic field, the induced supercurrents around the ring are determined by the JJ through the celebrated Josephson relations. This system exhibits rich nonlinear behavior, including chaotic effects. We study the dynamics of a pair of parametrically-driven coupled SQUIDs arranged in series. We take advantage of the weak damping that characterizes these systems to perform a multiple-scales analysis and obtain amplitude equations, describing the slow dynamics of the system. This picture allows us to expose the existence of homoclinic orbits in the dynamics of the integrable part of the slow equations of motion. Using high-dimensional Melnikov theory, we are able to obtain explicit parameter values for which these orbits persist in the full system, consisting of both Hamiltonian and non-Hamiltonian perturbations, to form so-called Silnikov orbits, indicating a loss of integrability and the existence of chaos...|$|R
