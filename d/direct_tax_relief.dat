40|$|The employer`s payroll {{contribution}} for {{pension system}} relief {{has been one}} of the most important topic on the debate about social security. Some advocates that the traditional source of funds for pension system tends to undergo a process of erosion. And there are critics, who argue that there is not a <b>direct</b> relationship between <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> and elevation of formality or wages paid, among others. The main objectives of this work are: to evaluate the rationality of proposals for payroll taxation relief; to check for the fiscal and income distribution short-run impacts of these proposals (as well as suggest what need to occur in the formal labour market to offset this release); and to present the arguments against the current <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> proposals and compensation through another tribute. One of the conclusions reached is that the impact of release on the level of formality, income, income inequality and social security revenues is controversial. It also concludes that linear release without compensation can be detrimental to pension system fiscal equilibrium. Thus, the proposal of focused release has the advantages of being less costly and still have positive impacts on income inequality...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs,</b> {{focusing}} on <b>direct</b> <b>taxes</b> in the Czech Republic.

Furthermore, the thesis examines the <b>tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> in more detail {{in terms of their}} objectives, utilization, and efficiency conditions. This is achieved with using various tax load indicators and effective taxation, comparing costs and additionally also the views of experts. Generally, however, this issue lacks a comprehensive study and analysis, and thus also the particular data. <b>Tax</b> <b>reliefs</b> along with social benefits constitute a redistribution system. Their costs and impacts are different. At the beginning of the writing of this thesis, I thought that the tax system should primarily be transparent, simple, focusing on its primary fiscal function and should therefore be free of social politics. I have, however, changed my opinion, because it has turned out that the social tax elements have their positive specifics that are difficult and expensive to transport to the system of direct benefits...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} and {{investigates the}} future growth {{potential of the}} state’s wagering taxes. Gaming markets in many states that legalized casino gaming in the 1990 s have matured, so the days of extremely robust annual revenue growth {{may be on the}} wane. Revenue growth looms large in Indiana as the wagering tax has become a major source of funding for the state’s property <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> program. In 2008, about $ 486. 3 million in revenue from the riverboat wagering <b>tax</b> was <b>directed</b> to property <b>tax</b> <b>relief.</b> What’s more, all revenue from the separate racetrack casino wagering tax is dedicated to property <b>tax</b> <b>relief.</b> Note that all years referenced in this article are fiscal years unless otherwise noted. 1 We first examine the historical growth patterns in attendance and wagering at Indiana’s riverboat casinos. By analyzing the win—the base for the wagering tax—instead of wagering tax revenue, we eliminate problems with measuring tax rates and the impact of changes in tax rates over time. 2 Analyzing casino attendance helps to delineate growth in the win that’s attributable to income growth versus growth attributable to capacity expansion and market share growth. This is critical because if the markets in Indiana have matured, the annual growth in the wagering tax base will come from the underlying growth in the average win per gambling patron. In addition, this article examines the response of the wagering tax base to economic change and how casino gaming in bordering states could affect business at Indiana casinos. Both are critical issues in and of themselves relating to the future growth in gaming revenue...|$|R

40|$|Policies to cap {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2), such as the recently announced agreement among seven northeastern states, are expected to have important effects on the electricity industry and on the market value of firms that own electricity generation assets. The economics literature finds large efficiency advantages for initial distribution of tradable emissions allowances through an auction so as to <b>direct</b> revenues to <b>tax</b> <b>relief</b> or other public investments. However, an auction raises the costs for the regulated firms. This paper identifies rules for an initial distribution that satisfy a compensation goal for firms that is achieved through free distribution of a portion of the allowances, while maximizing the value of allowances that can be directed to public purposes. The paper employs a detailed simulation model to calculate numerical results for the market value of generation assets under the CO 2 cap-and-trade program in the northeastern United States. emissions trading, allowance allocations, electricity, air pollution, auction, grandfathering, output-based allocation, cost-effectiveness, greenhouse gases, climate change, global warming, carbon dioxide, asset value...|$|R
