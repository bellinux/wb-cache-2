40|$|A useful {{strategy}} {{to deal with}} complex classification scenarios is the "divide and conquer" approach. The mixture of experts (MOE) technique makes use of this strategy by joinly training a set of classifiers, or experts, that are specialized in {{different regions of the}} input space.

40|$|Highway deep {{neural network}} (HDNN) {{is a type of}} depth-gated {{feedforward}} neural network, which has shown to be easier to train with more hidden layers and also generalise better compared to conventional plain {{deep neural network}}s (DNNs). Previously, we investigated a structured HDNN architecture for speech recognition, in which the two <b>gate</b> <b>functions</b> were tied across all the hidden layers, {{and we were able to}} train a much smaller model without sacrificing the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we carry on the study of this architecture with sequence-discriminative training criterion and speaker adaptation techniques on the AMI meeting speech recognition corpus. We show that these two techniques improve speech recognition accuracy on top of the model trained with the cross entropy criterion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two <b>gate</b> <b>functions</b> that are tied across all the hidden layers are able to control the information flow over the whole network, and we can achieve considerable improvements by only updating these <b>gate</b> <b>functions</b> in both sequence training and adaptation experiments.

40|$|A {{molecular}} dyad {{consisting of}} a photochromic dihydroindolizine unit covalently linked to a porphyrin performs, when illuminated through a third-harmonic-generating crystal, the functions of both an AND and a NAND Boolean logic gate with shared all-optical inputs.

The functions of the AND and the NAND gates rely on changes in absorption and emission of the dyad in the visible spectral region upon isomerization of the photochromic unit.

40|$|State-of-the-art speech {{recognition}} systems typically employ neural network acoustic models. However, compared to Gaussian mixture models, {{deep neural network}} (DNN) based acoustic models often have many more model parameters, making it challenging {{for them to be}} deployed on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of the recently proposed highway deep neural network (HDNN) for training small-footprint acoustic models. HDNNs are a depth-gated feedforward neural network, which include two types of <b>gate</b> <b>functions</b> to facilitate the information flow through different layers. Our study demonstrates that HDNNs are more compact than regular DNNs for acoustic modeling, i. e., they can achieve comparable recognition accuracy with many fewer model parameters. Furthermore, HDNNs are more controllable than DNNs: the <b>gate</b> <b>functions</b> of an HDNN can control the behavior of the whole network using {{a very small number of}} model parameters. Finally, we show that HDNNs are more adaptable than DNNs. For example, simply updating the <b>gate</b> <b>functions</b> using adaptation data can result in considerable gains in accuracy. We demonstrate these aspects by experiments using the publicly available AMI corpus, which has around 80 hours of training data. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures.

The method employed a coaxial slotted line system terminated by the device under test. The basic transmission line theory was extended to include the phenomena of multiple reflections along and resonance of, the line.
