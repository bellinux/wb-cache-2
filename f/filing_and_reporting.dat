40|$|In this paper, {{we argue}} that {{individuals}} are affected in their compliance behavior by the behavior of their “neighbors”, or those about whom they may have information, whom they may know, or with whom they may interact on a regular basis. Individuals seem more likely to file and to report their taxes when they believe that other individuals are also <b>filing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> their taxes; conversely, when individuals believe that others are cheating on their taxes, they may well become cheaters themselves. We use experimental methods to test the role of such information about peer effects on compliance behavior. In one setting, we inform individuals about the frequency that their neighbors submit a tax return. In a second setting, we inform them {{about the number of}} their neighbors who are audited, together with the penalties that they pay. In both cases, we examine the impact of information on filing behavior and also on subsequent reporting behavior.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the variables of tax compliance analysed by researchers from various countries and adapting them to the Romanian conditions to create a model to include factors that influence decision of tax compliance. Tax compliance has been studied in economics by analysing the individual decision of a representative person between paying taxes and evading taxes. In the research of tax compliance have been done many empirical studies that emphasized the impact of a wide variety of potential determinants of voluntary compliance with individual income/profit tax <b>filing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> obligations. The most important determinants identified are: economic factors as the level of income, audit probabilities, tax audit, tax rate, tax benefits, penalties, fines and other non-economic factors as attitudes toward taxes, personal, social and national norms, perceived fairness etc...|$|E
40|$|For many years, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has {{believed}} that its activities promote better income tax compliance {{in the general}} population—both through deterrence and taxpayer service—but we {{had never been able}} to quantify this impact, or even verify that it exists. Two recent research studies at the IRS, however, have produced estimates of at least some of these effects, providing an empirical basis for choosing the best combination of major IRS activities to improve the voluntary <b>filing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> compliance of taxpayers. The first study was an econometric analysis of data aggregated by state and by year, which included variables for seven IRS activities in addition to a wide variety of tax policy, opportunity, and economic/demographic determinants of voluntary compliance. Five of the IRS activities were found to have a statistically significant impact on compliance, including audits and criminal investigations. The second study was more qualitative, eliciting the consensus judgment of senior IRS operations executives as to the relative magnitudes of the indirect effects of a much broader range of IRS activities. Together, the results of these studies will help IRS to allocate its resources so as to promote greater voluntary compliance. More research is planned t...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Tax-exempt organizations seeking to influence political elections [...] called Section 527 organizations [...] are estimated to {{spend millions of dollars}} annually in federal elections. These organizations use unregulated "soft money" for issue advocacy, such as sponsoring an advertisement that supports or opposes a candidate's position on an issue. Although all states require these groups to publicly release data on their finances and activities, no central source for such data exists. In July 2000, Congress passed legislation requiring Section 527 organizations to provide data on their purposes, officers, contributors, and expenses to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for public disclosure. IRS has established a website for this purpose, but GAO found that the website is difficult to use, and most of the disclosed data are not electronically searchable and downloadable [...] which can inhibit timely analysis of the relationship between political organizations and the influence of soft money on federal campaigns. IRS has done little to oversee Section 527 organizations' compliance with the law's <b>filing</b> <b>and</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements. As a result, IRS can provide four assurances that the data it disclosed on its website are timely, complete, and correct. IRS officials said that oversight has been limited because of (1) competing demands for resources, (2) the focus on educating Section 527 organizations and on publicly disclosing the data, and (3) having the lack of electronic data on Section 527 organizations. IRS has not developed a strategic plan to ensure that the law's requirements are met. ...|$|E

Interviews were conducted with probation officers <b>and</b> <b>files</b> <b>and</b> pre-sentence <b>reports</b> read {{with the aim of}} exploring the construction of masculinities within the probation service. Tensions about gender were found within and between the three areas of professional rhetoric, practice and internal relations. The most significant finding is a gap between rhetoric and practice. While most officers interviewed spoke of an interest in focusing either directly or indirectly on their clients' identity as men, the <b>files</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> found only a very small amount of direct work on this. There was a larger amount of evidence of work that could be seen as indirectly challenging masculinites, but another significant part of the <b>files</b> <b>and</b> <b>reports</b> on men reflected a tendency towards ignoring gender or even colluding with oppressive masculinities.... it is as least as important to deal with these offenders as men as it is to deal with these men as offenders (Newbum and Mair, 1996, p. 3). These words exemplify a growing awareness of the importance of questioning and challenging masculinities in work with offenders. This paper describes a study of what probation officers say and write about their work with men. The research was conducted in the context of some recent discussion amongst criminologists and probation officers about crime and masculinities and about making masculinities explicit in work with offenders...|$|R
