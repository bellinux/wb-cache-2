40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new object {{descriptor}} for three dimensional data named the Global Structure Histogram (GSH). The GSH encodes {{the structure of}} a local feature response on a coarse global scale, providing a beneficial trade-off between generalization and discrimination. Encoding the structural characteristics of an object allows us to retain low local variations while keeping the benefit of <b>global</b> <b>representativeness.</b> In an extensive experimental evaluation, we applied the framework to category-based object classification in realistic scenarios. We show results obtained by combining the GSH with several different local shape representations, and we demonstrate significant improvements to other state-of-the-art global descriptors. I...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, {{researchers}} have developed methods and models to reconstruct time series of irregularly spaced observations from satellite remote sensing, among which the widely used Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) method. Many studies based on time series reconstructed with HANTS documented the excellent performance of this method. While some limitations of HANTS have been noticed in these applications, {{there is no}} dedicated study on a systematic evaluation {{on the performance of}} the HANTS method. In this study, we evaluated the impact of gaps on the time series reconstruction of NDVI by HANTS. For <b>global</b> <b>representativeness,</b> a simulated NDVI time series dataset was constructed for four generic patterns and was applied as a reference dataset. Then random gaps were introduced into the reference series and both the reference and gapped series were reconstructed by harmonic analysis. The deviations between the two reconstructed results were used to evaluate statistically the accuracy of harmonic analysis under different gap conditions. The size of maximum gap (MGS), the number of loss (NL) and the number of gaps (NG) were selected to parameterize the gap distribution. The results showed that MGS, NL and NG were significant factors in the process of reconstruction and the two terminals and the peak of the series are crucial positions. MGS and NL should not be too large in the time series for all seasonal or non-seasonal case; otherwise the reconstructed series is not reliable. These conclusions can be taken as a reference to indicate the reliability of HANTS for particular cases towards the definition of a quality indicator of any time series...|$|E
40|$|The ARM {{sites and}} the ARM Mobile Facility (AMF) were {{constructed}} to make {{measurements of the}} atmosphere and radiation system in order to quantify deficiencies in the simulation of clouds within models and to make improvements in those models. While the measurement infrastructure of ARM is well-developed and a model parameterization testbed capability has been established, additional effort is needed to develop statistical techniques which permit the comparison of simulation output from atmospheric models with actual measurements. Our project establishes a new methodology for objectively comparing ARM measurements to the outputs of leading global climate models and reanalysis data. The quantitative basis for this comparison is provided by a statistical procedure which establishes an exhaustive set of mutually-exclusive, recurring states of the atmosphere from sets of multivariate atmospheric and cloud conditions, and then classifies multivariate measurements or simulation outputs into those states. Whether measurements and models classify the atmosphere into the same states at specific locations through time provides an unequivocal comparison result. Times and locations in both geographic and state space of model-measurement agreement and disagreement will suggest directions for the collection of additional measurements at existing sites, {{provide insight into the}} <b>global</b> <b>representativeness</b> of the current ARM sites (suggesting locations and times for use of the AMF), and provide a basis for improvement of models. Two different analyses were conducted: One, using the Parallel Climate Model, focused on an IPCC climate change scenario and clusters that characterize long-term changes in the hydrologic cycle. The other, using the GISS Model E GCM and the ARM Active Remotely Sensed Cloud Layers product, explored current climate cloud regimes in the Tropical West Pacific...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} focused on the radiooxidative {{degradation}} of polymeric insulation of electric cables used in Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). In order to investigate the degradation mechanisms of the insulation, model composites with ATH (Aluminium TriHydrate) filler and blends (without filler) based on a cross-linked mixture of EVA (Ethylene Vinyl Acetate) and EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer) were submitted to gamma-rays. In normal operating conditions of a NPP, the dose rate which electric cables are exposed to is around 0. 1 Gy h− 1. In this work, artificial accelerated ageing test process has been applied at a relatively low dose rate of 7 Gy h− 1. Gamma-irradiations at higher dose rates typically used to accelerate the ageing, in the range 0. 2 – 1 kGy h− 1, were also carried out. The first part of the study {{is focused on}} irradiations performed at relatively low dose rate and is devoted to the highlighting of the radiooxidative degradation mechanisms of EVA/EPDM blend with and without ATH filler. Correlations between the evolutions of the chemical, morphological and mechanical/electrical properties of the materials occurring after the ageing process are presented. It is shown that the degradation process is governed by radical oxidation mechanism involving chain scissions leading to the formation of carboxylic acids as end-groups. One of the main effects of the ATH filler is the progressive loss of the mechanical properties of the composite upon radiooxidation whereas they are maintained {{in the case of the}} unfilled sample. Despite the oxidation of the polymer, no change in the electrical properties of the blend and of the composite could be observed. The second part of the study focuses on the dose rate effect. It is shown that one of the main consequences of an increase of the dose rate from 7 Gy h− 1 to 0. 2 – 1 kGy h− 1 is a reduction of the chain scission process yield by a factor of about 20. Therefore, an important and consistent finding is that there are some limits that must not be exceeded in terms of dose rate to ensure a <b>global</b> satisfactorily <b>representativeness</b> of the accelerated ageing process...|$|R
40|$|Both {{the amounts}} of data {{describing}} the site-scale carbon flux at a high temporal and spatial resolution collected in China {{and the number of}} eddy covariance flux towers have been increasing during the last decade. To correctly upscale these fluxes to the regional and <b>global</b> level, the <b>representativeness</b> of the current network of flux towers must be known. The present study quantifies the representativeness of the flux network for the regional carbon exchange. This analysis combined the total solar radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure and the enhanced vegetation index to indicate the environmental characteristics of each 1 -km pixel cell and flux tower. Next, the Euclidean distance from each pixel to the tower was calculated to determine the representativeness of the existing flux towers. To improve the regional representativeness, additional tower locations were pinpointed by identifying and clustering the underrepresented areas. The existing network of flux towers performed well in representing the environmental conditions of the middle and the northeastern portions of China. The well-represented areas covered 60. 9 % of the total areas. The towers in croplands and grasslands represented the vegetation types well, but the wetlands and barelands were poorly represented. The representativeness of the flux network increased with the addition of nine towers located in forests, grasslands, wetlands and barelands. The representativeness of 27. 5 % of the land areas improved. In addition, the well-represented areas were enlarged by 15. 2 %. Substantial gains in representation were achieved by adding new towers on the Tibet Plateau. The representativeness of the northwest and southwest was improved less significantly, suggesting that more towers are required to capture certain ecosystem behaviors. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|To {{understand}} global {{changes in}} the Earth system, scientists must generalize globally from observations made locally and regionally. In land change science (LCS), local field-based observations are costly and time consuming, and generally obtained by researchers working at disparate local and regional case-study sites chosen for different reasons. As a result, global synthesis efforts in LCS tend {{to be based on}} non-statistical inferences subject to geographic biases stemming from data limitations and fragmentation. Thus, a fundamental challenge is the production of generalized knowledge that links evidence of the causes and consequences of local land change to global patterns and vice versa. The GLOBE system was designed to meet this challenge. GLOBE aims to transform global change science by enabling new scientific workflows based on statistically robust, globally relevant integration of local and regional observations using an online social-computational and geovisualization system. Consistent with the goals of Digital Earth, GLOBE has the capability to assess the global relevance of local case-study findings within the context of over 50 global biophysical, land-use, climate, and socio-economic datasets. We demonstrate the implementation of one such assessment - a representativeness analysis - with a recently published meta-study of changes in swidden agriculture in tropical forests. The analysis provides a standardized indicator to judge the <b>global</b> <b>representativeness</b> of the trends reported in the meta-study, and a geovisualization is presented that highlights areas for which sampling efforts can be reduced and those in need of further study. GLOBE will enable researchers and institutions to rapidly share, compare, and synthesize local and regional studies within the global context, as well as contributing to the larger goal of creating a Digital Earth.
