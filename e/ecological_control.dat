2500|$|A central {{question}} in the trophic dynamic literature {{is the nature of}} control and regulation over resources and production. Ecologists use simplified one trophic position food chain models (producer, carnivore, decomposer). Using these models, ecologists have tested various types of <b>ecological</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms. For example, herbivores generally have an abundance of vegetative resources, which meant that their populations were largely controlled or regulated by predators. This is known as the top-down hypothesis or 'green-world' hypothesis. Alternatively to the top-down hypothesis, not all plant material is edible and the nutritional quality or antiherbivore defenses of plants (structural and chemical) suggests a bottom-up form of regulation or control. Recent studies have concluded that both [...] "top-down" [...] and [...] "bottom-up" [...] forces can influence community structure and the strength of the influence is environmentally context dependent. These complex multitrophic interactions involve more than two trophic levels in a food web.|$|E

These measures included sealing the Lax Lands, contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants, under a cap of clay; landscaping Bayfront Park and Pier 4 Park; and keeping common carp from entering Cootes Paradise. The visible and measurable improvement in water quality in Burlington Bay was showcased in 1994 by the very public swim of Sheila Copps, a local MP and federal cabinet minister.

Social and economic developments {{in the modern world}} require a new system combining ecological needs and traditional flood <b>control</b> system. <b>Ecological</b> flood <b>control</b> systems were put forward and defined as flood control systems with full consideration of ecological demands for sustainable development. In such systems, four aspects are promoted: connectivity of water system, landscapes of river and lakes, mobility of water bodies, and safety of flood control. In Phoenix Island, Huzhou, needs for <b>ecological</b> flood <b>controls</b> were analyzed from the four aspects above. The Water system layout was adjusted with the water surface ratio, which is the ratio of water surface area (including rivers, lakes, and other water bodies) to the total drainage area, and connectivity as controlling indicators. The designed water levels provided references for landscape plant selection. Mobility of the adjusted water system was analyzed, including flow direction and residence time. On the bases mentioned above, <b>ecological</b> flood <b>control</b> projects were planned with comprehensive consideration of the ecological requirements.

40|$|There {{has been}} recent concern {{regarding}} the regeneration and recruitment of aspen (Populus tremuloides) {{in the western}} United States. Forest management techniques have been employed {{in order to promote}} the regeneration and recruitment of aspen. We quantified aspen regeneration treatments in southern Utah, USA to better understand the factors driving aspen recruitment. Driving factors were identified by addressing two major research themes: (1) identify the primary <b>ecological</b> <b>controls</b> on aspen regeneration success; (2) assess the relative importance and influence of these controls on successful regeneration. Our definition of successful aspen regeneration requires the satisfaction of two criteria relating to height and density, respectively: (1) regeneration that has attained heights above the ungulate browsing threshold (e. g. 3 ̆e 2 m); and (2) regeneration that is occurring at a density that represents desired conditions for future stocking (e. g. ≥ 10, 000 stems ha⁻¹). The primary <b>ecological</b> <b>controls</b> on regeneration success were identified using nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and Random Forests analysis was used to assess the relative importance and influence of regeneration controls. These analyses identified three primary factors that are responsible for regeneration success. These factors were (1) contemporary herbivory pressure, (2) site preparation technique, and (3) advance reproduction. Herbivory is the leading predictor of regeneration success, and has integral impacts on other primary regeneration drivers. We suggest considerations that can be made regarding regeneration drivers in order to enhance the effectiveness of aspen management in the future...|$|R
50|$|After flowering, {{the bamboo}} dies and regenerates from the seeds. The rodents feast on these seeds which are {{available}} in plenty. In consequence, there is a sudden boom in the rat population. The action of the rats {{is thought to be}} an <b>ecological</b> <b>control</b> mechanism. The seeds of any culm of bamboo that might flower off-cycle are all eaten up by rodents, thus reinforcing the rhythm of this extreme version of a mast year. Some experts believe that the flower has a positive effect on the fertility of the rats, as well as on increasing the viable size of a rat litter. All available explanations point {{to the fact that the}} increase in their numbers during the peak year is a natural after-effect of the flowering of the bamboos. However, once they exhaust this temporarily abundant food supply, the rats turn their attention to cultivated crops.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{long-term}} {{diversification of}} life probably cannot be modelled {{as a simple}} equilibrial process: the time scales are too long, the potential for exploring new ecospace is too large and {{it is unlikely that}} <b>ecological</b> <b>controls</b> can act at global scales. The sum of many clade expansions and reductions, each of which happens according to its own dynamic, probably approximates more a damped exponential curve when translated into a global-scale species diversification curve. Unfortunately, {{it is not possible to}} plot such a meaningful global-scale species diversification curve through time, but curves at higher taxonomic levels have been produced. These curves are subject to the vagaries of the fossil record, but it is unlikely that the sources of error entirely overwhelm the biological signal.

Two main approaches have dominated the field: the first ap-proach has emphasized <b>ecological</b> <b>controls</b> of biodiversity, and has sought to explain static biodiversity patterns, often referred to as macroecolog-ical patterns; the second approach has emphasized historical controls of biodiversity, and has sought to explain more dynamic, evolutionary pat-terns of biodiversity, often referred to as macroevolutionary patterns.

40|$|Identification of the {{functional}} groups of microorganisms that are predominantly {{in control of}} fluxes through, and concentrations in, microbial networks would benefit microbial ecology and environmental biotechnology: the properties of those controlling microorganisms could be studied or monitored specifically or their activity could be modulated in attempts to manipulate the behaviour of such networks. Herein we present <b>ecological</b> <b>control</b> analysis (ECA) as a versatile mathematical framework that allows for the quantification of the control of each functional group in a microbial network on its process rates and concentrations of intermediates. In contrast to current views, we show that rates of flow of matter are not always limited by a single functional group; rather flux control can be distributed over several groups. Also, control over intermediate concentrations is always shared. Because of indirect interactions, through other functional groups, the concentration of an intermediate can also be controlled by functional groups not producing or consuming it. <b>Ecological</b> <b>control</b> analysis is illustrated by a case study on the anaerobic degradation of organic matter, using experimental data obtained from the literature. During anaerobic degradation, fermenting microorganisms interact with terminal electron-accepting microorganisms (e. g. halorespirers, methanogens). The analysis indicates that flux control mainly resides with fermenting microorganisms, but can shift to the terminal electron-accepting microorganisms under less favourable redox conditions. Paradoxically, halorespiring microorganisms do not control the rate of perchloroethylene and trichloroethylene degradation even though they catalyse those processes themselves. © 2006 The Authors...|$|E
