In sharp contrast to the existing literature, our small open economy exhibits distinctly different economic behaviour depending on whether the country is importing the protected good, exporting it or refraining from trade in it. The domestic price of the protected good exceeds the world price in import and no-trade regions, even when the quota is underutilized - in contrast, existing work predicts no economic effects of a quota unless it is binding. Within a general equilibrium world economy consisting of one quota-constrained and one unconstrained country, under logarithmic preferences, the constrained country becomes wealthier {{at the expense of the}} unconstrained.

In addition to an input-output model, preliminary econometric testing was also conducted to capture the effects of other structural and cyclical factors that may have also affected employment during the same period. In this regard, an OLS model was constructed that examined the relationship between employment and the following variables: exchange rates, Canadian gross domestic product, US gross domestic product, and tariff rates. The main finding of the study was that tariff liberalisation had a minimal impact on employment, but that the extent of the impact varied across industries. Moreover, the employment effects were found to be dependent on the specific production requirements of industries rather than trade sensitivity, as is commonly argued in the economic literature. It was also established that, in conjuction with tariff liberalisation, other macro-economic factors also affected the level of employment during the same period...|$|E
