40|$|The authors {{investigate}} {{whether there was}} an international linkage of interest rates between the United States, West Germany, and Switzerland {{during the period of}} flexible exchange rates, 1974 - 84. <b>Euro-market</b> rates and bond-market rates are considered during the two subperiods of falling and increasing U. S. Dollar/DM exchange rates, 1974 to 1978 and 1979 to 1984. Spectral analysis and Granger causality tests are applied and trivariate autoregressive models are estimated. It is shown that a strong linkage exists during the second period, but during the first subperiod there was no, or only a weakly-pronounced, linkage. Copyright 1987 by MIT Press. ...|$|E

50|$|The Werner-Cravatte {{years were}} {{important}} {{from an economic}} point of view as they saw the flourishing of the Luxembourgish financial centre. However, the birth of {{what would become the}} main pillar of the Grand Duchy's economy was not due to the government's policy. At its origin was a measure of the American government to slow the emission of international loans on the financial markets of New York, the Interest Equalization Tax. The reorientation of financial flows which resulted from this {{led to the creation of}} the international Eurodollars market. However, Luxembourg, which did not have a central bank, and where banking and tax laws were very flexible, found itself in a favourable position, while the traditional financial centres such as London, Zurich or Amsterdam were burdened by restrictive regulation. The Grand Duchy's capital gradually became one of the main centres for the <b>Euro-markets,</b> and foreign banks started establishing themselves in Luxembourg. The number of banking institutions grew from 15 in 1960 to 37 in 1970. In this boom phase, the government of the day had little involvement, even though, on occasion it defended the financial centre against European plans for fiscal harmonisation. The financial centre profited from both positive external factors, as well as legislation from 40 years previous, prepared under the then-Minister for Finances Pierre Dupong.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{investigation}} {{based on}} consumer-price-index-based real interest rates {{is used to}} conclude that real interest rate parity is not supported. In this paper, the authors employ three panel-based unit-root tests, provided by Andrew Levin and Chien-Fu Lin (1992), Kyung So Im, Hashem M. Pesaran, and Yongcheol Shin (1995), and G. S. Maddala and Shaowen Wu (1996), to examine the stationarity of real interest differentials. Using monthly observations on <b>Euro-market</b> rates, they support the mean-reverting property of real interest differentials and, hence, the real interest rate parity. This {{finding is consistent with}} the observation that international integration of financial markets has increased dramatically since 1979. ...|$|E
40|$|The Euro-currency {{markets have}} {{expanded}} very rapidly since 1966. This rapid development has drawn the attention {{not only of}} those who are responsible for monetary policy, but also of economists who are by no means in agreement concerning what takes place on the market for Euro-loans. The present work analyses the <b>Euro-market</b> in order to draw some concrete conclusions. A description of the Euro-dollar market is provided and analogies at the national level are made. The author then considers the effect of the Euro-dollar market on the volume of credit before looking at the American balance of payments and Euro-dollar loans. Finally, the determination of interest rates on the Euro-dollar market is examined as well as the issue of control. JEL: E 44, E 51, E 52 </p...|$|E

In this context, this paper aims to make a foray in time, starting with the issue of de-industrialization of Romania and subsequently with the transformation of Romanian economy into a tertiary one, accompanied by the simultaneous development of the economy based on consumption. In other words, the role {{of this paper is to}} present (using statistical data), the causes of de-industrialization of Romania, elements on the evolution of the tertiary industry, and some features and pitfalls of consumer-based economy.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the European policy {{in the field of}} research, development, innovation reflects the maturity process of the European construction, through the very understanding of the particular role of knowledge in economy. An important aspect is the connection with the acknowledgment of the professional’s diplomas, which is based on the principle of automatism, on the mutual trust of the Member States in the qualifications obtained within the territory of any of them, on the tradition regarding the existence of a democratic and elitist education system. The improvement of the quality of education and the avoidance of sideslips are required. For the existence of a functional <b>Euro-market</b> in the field of research, development, innovation the differences between the European Union Member States have to be reduced, before attempting {{to catch up with the}} United States of America, Japan or China. Because knowledge is the inexhaustible resource of mankind in general, of the European Union, in particular, we should talk about a Union of Research, as we talk about the Monetary Union, for example. The strategy of economic growth in Romania was based on encouraging the consumers to spend money, but they didn’t consider a coherent policy based on innovations. research, development, innovation, education, knowledge Romania...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four empirical essays, all dealing with return volatility of financial assets and/or time-varying risk premia. In the first essay, Changing Risk Premia: Evidence from a Small Open Economy, the relation between risk and return is investigated for Swedish stocks. Little {{is known about the}} differences in the risk-return relationship in large economies compared with smaller, less studied, markets. In the paper, Sweden is used as a representative for small open economies. The price of risk on the Swedish stock market is estimated using a conditional asset pricing model that allows for time-variation in the risk. The results of the econometric analysis show that the estimates of the price of risk are invariably positive and significant, and that there are only minor differences in the preferences towards risk of representative investors in small and large economies. The second essay, Time-Varying Risk Premia in Swedish Treasury Bonds, models time-varying risk premia at the long end of the Swedish term structure using a GARCH-M approach. Two measures of risk are used to model the premia; the conditional variance of the excess holding return, and the conditional covariance with the market portfolio return. The results show that there is evidence of time-varying risk premia of a conditional CAPM type in excess holding period returns of Swedish treasury bonds. Furthermore, it is found that the estimated premia can be of substantial magnitude during periods of great uncertainty. In the third essay, Forecasting Variance Using Stochastic Volatility and GARCH, various GARCH and stochastic volatility specifications are compared with respect to their in-sample characteristics and their ability to accurately predict volatility, using daily Swedish OMX-index returns. The analysis shows that the stochastic volatility models are superior to the GARCH/EGARCH models in their ability to capture the features of the data, and that the asymmetric and seasonal effects are important. The forecasting ability of the models is evaluated using a bootstrap technique for forecast horizons between 2 and 100 days. The main result is that the stochastic volatility models produce significantly more accurate volatility forecasts than the GARCH/EGARCH models, but that there are only minor differences between the various stochastic volatility specifications. The fourth essay, Stochastic Volatility and the Estimation of Short Term Interest Rate Dynamics, estimates a two-factor stochastic volatility model for the default-free short-term interest rate, using <b>Euro-market</b> data for eight different currencies. The results show that there is a highly persistent stochastic volatility component present in the short-term interest rate which is captured by the model. In addition, there is evidence of a level effect in the volatility of the short rate, i. e. that the volatility of the short term interest rate depends on the level of the short rate itself. The two-factor model clearly outperforms a model that only allows for a level effect, in terms of its ability to capture the features of the data. Furthermore, the two-factor model gives theoretical call option values that can differ substantially from those obtained by other models. This is especially true for short-maturity out-of-the-money options...|$|E
