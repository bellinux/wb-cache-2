40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{children}} <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care {{have focused on}} the deficits that result from participating <b>in</b> the <b>foster</b> care system, such as the prevalence of developmental delays, instances of abuse, and difficulties that arise in the schooling systems. This study examines children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care from a perspective that looks for skills they have, and seeks strategies that can better support children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care <b>in</b> the acquisition of early literacy skills. Data was gathered using qualitative interviews of teachers, social workers, foster parents, a school psychologist, and a Foster Care Liaison. The voices of the participants were essential in uncovering qualities that children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care possess, a perspective that is often left out in prior quantitative research. Common challenges facing children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care that has been documented in previous research is confirmed in this study. This includes frequent moving that causes gaps in learning, a lack of educational accountability, discussion of confidentiality as a barrier to providing academic supports, and the prevalence of emotional trauma. This study found that the biological household of children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care may be impoverished, and does not reflect values that prepare children for success in early literacy experiences at school. Strategies recommended to fill in the learning gaps included implementing a clear and consistent routine, holding high educational expectations, exposing children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care to literacy experiences with literature, and the use of assessment and tutoring. This study recommends that educational law protecting children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care be expanded to include platforms for participants to communicate and share resources, {{such as the use of}} an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). The results indicate the use of the Foster Care Liaison should be expanded to better meet the needs of children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care. Traditional teaching methods were not found to be effective for use with children <b>in</b> <b>foster</b> care, and this study recommends exploring more student-centered approaches to literacy instruction. The expansion of resources and change in teaching methods calls for changes in district and public policy, as well as increased funding. CSU, Chic...|$|R

5|$|The MHS {{continued}} the MHIS' role of facilitating {{the production of}} high-quality paper records and photographs {{of the war and}} collecting the resulting documents and images. The section had two field teams in April 1943 (one in Australia and the other in New Guinea), and was expanded to nine teams by the end of 1944. Treloar also focused on the official war artist program, and succeeded <b>in</b> <b>fostering</b> a high-quality collection from a range of artistic styles. He placed a relatively low emphasis on collecting artefacts, however, and did not visit New Guinea even though it was the main Australian battlefield for most of the Pacific War. This concerned Bean, who wrote an unanswered letter to Treloar in July 1943 offering to help organise the collection of more items. In August 1943 Treloar's son Ian was reported missing while serving as a Royal Australian Air Force warrant officer attached to the Royal Air Force. It was determined after the war that he had been killed in action. Treloar's other son, Alan, served in the Second AIF and won a Rhodes Scholarship after the war.|$|E
