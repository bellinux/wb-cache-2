40|$|Starting {{from the}} present {{knowledge}} society with its social overvaluing of cognition and white-collar jobs {{at the expense of}} manual labour, this article examines whether school type—academic versus technical/vocational schools—relates to students’ sense <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> It assesses the schools’ culture <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> and investigates the explanatory value <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> and culture <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> in the relation of school type with study involvement and study culture. Multilevel analyses of data from 6, 373 students in 44 Flemish schools (2004 – 2005) show that students in technical/vocational schools share higher feelings <b>of</b> <b>futility,</b> suggesting the existence <b>of</b> cultures <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> The students’ study involvement relates to their sense <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> The schools’ futility culture affects the students’ study involvement independent of their sense <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> Finally, futility culture explains the association between school type and study involvement, and is responsible for less study-oriented cultures in technical/vocational schools...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} reason for students to exert little effort in school, is the feeling that working hard at school is useless for people like them. On average, boys display a higher level <b>of</b> sense <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> than girls. This study examines whether the gender difference in sense <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> {{is related to the}} proportion of girls attending a school. We argue that the more progressive gender role culture in schools with a higher proportion of girls might influence especially boys’ sense <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> Multilevel analyses <b>of</b> data gathered in 2014 from 5162 2 th grade students in 57 secondary schools in Flanders confirm a small but significant difference between boys and girls in sense <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> The more girls, the less feelings <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> boys manifest. This impact can be explained by boys’ traditional gender role attitudes. For girls the impact of gender composition, that is higher feelings <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> in schools with more girls, is buffered by girls’ progressive gender role attitudes. In schools with more girls, boys display lower levels <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> than girls. Finally, this impact of gender composition can be ascribed to the students’ educational track...|$|R
5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E

5|$|Waugh had {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew hostility from some Catholic quarters. He did not introduce overtly religious themes into A Handful of Dust, but later {{explained that he}} intended the book to demonstrate the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> humanist, as distinct from religious, especially Catholic, values. The book has been dramatised for radio, stage and screen.|$|E

40|$|This article assesses whether social-ethnic {{composition}} influences students’ school misconduct. Based {{on general}} strain theory, {{we expect to}} find that individual sense <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> acts as an intermediate mechanism. Starting from cultural deprivation and oppositional culture theory, however, we hypothesize that a shared school culture <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> acts as mediator. Multilevel analyses of data from the Flemish Educational Assessment, consisting of 11, 872 students in 85 schools, showed that ethnic composition {{has an impact on}} school misconduct: there is more deviancy in ethnically mixed schools than in ethnic concentration schools due to a greater student sense <b>of</b> <b>futility.</b> The presence <b>of</b> a culture <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> did not affect the probability of being deviant. These results were true only for natives: school factors did not affect migrants’ deviancy. We conclude that, although a dispersal of ethnically diverse students across all schools is favorable, this can yield negative side effects...|$|R

5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Aachen says William's second {{desertion}} {{occurred in}} June 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, {{a relative of}} Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined Stephen of Blois, another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled back towards Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.|$|E

40|$|Purpose : To explore anesthesiologists’ {{perceptions}} of the reasons underlying why physicians continue to provide care that they consider futile. Methods : A qualitative study was conducted utilizing a grounded theory approach. Four sepa rate focus groups (2 resident physician groups and 2 attending physician groups) were conducted over a three week span. An interview guide was used consisting of a proposed definition <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> and five open-ended questions. Re sponses to the five open-ended questions were used to guide follow up questions. Transcribed audio recordings were then analyzed. Results : With data reduction, {{we were able to}} separate responses into definitions <b>of</b> <b>futility,</b> stories <b>of</b> cases where futile care was provided, and opinions as to the underlying causes of continuing to provide futile care. A variety of opinions was obtained, suggesting the possibility that different groups (surgeons, anesthesiologists, family members) view questions <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> differently. Conclusions : Complete agreement on a definition <b>of</b> <b>futility</b> does not exist. Even when some agreement exists, there is great difficulty in predicting outcomes in individual cases. Future quantitative studies may provide more evidence of trends in underlying reasons for providing futile care. Focused edu cation efforts may then lead to more agreement between all involved. </p...|$|R
5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking {{much of the}} drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the second}} son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where {{he spent much of}} the rest of his life. He became heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, Horrocks {{visited the}} Polish {{positions}} at Driel {{to see the}} front for himself.

In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred, {{it was decided that}} another crossing would be attempted that night. When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day though, it seems Horrocks realised the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the situation and plans were drawn up to withdraw the 1st Division.|$|E

She also had felt profoundly, coming from far away across the grey distances of the sea, the faint boom of the big guns at work on the coast of Flanders--shaping the future.|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly {{realized}} the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E

5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend to invent problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 12th century a French verse romance, Le roman de Thèbes, was {{composed}} {{by an unknown}} author, probably at the court of Henry II of England. Here the Thebaid {{is transformed into a}} chivalric epic. Giovanni Boccaccio, the 14th-century Italian poet and author best known for his Decameron, also borrowed heavily from the Thebaid when composing his Teseida (which, in turn, was used heavily by Chaucer when composing [...] "The Knight’s Tale" [...] for the Canterbury Tales). Of particular importance is a scene in which Mercury is sent to the realm of Mars. All three of these works (as well as Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene) contain large tracts of allegorical figures that are housed in War’s realm and which represent the various <b>futilities</b> <b>of</b> war and violence.|$|R
60|$|But I {{remember}} one dancer {{who was really}} a great artist. She was ill-favoured, of middle age, thin; but every part of her was imbued with grace, expressive, from {{the tips of her}} toes to the tips of her fingers. The demands of the public sometimes forced upon her odious ballet-skirts, sometimes she wasted her talent on the <b>futilities</b> <b>of</b> skirt-dancing; but chiefly she loved the national measures, and her phenomenal leanness made her only comfortable in the national dress. She travelled from place to place in Spain with another woman whom she had taught to dance, and whose beauty she used cleverly as a foil to her own uncomeliness; and so wasted herself in these low resorts, earning hardly sufficient to keep body and soul together. I wish I could remember her name.|$|R
5|$|Although the reaction, which {{included}} punishment, new regulations, SRM institutional reform, fewer Vietnamese serving in France, increased specialisation – were considerable, {{military and civilian}} authorities in both Vietnam and France did not believe them sufficient for the reassertion of control over their colonised troops. A further four decisions were implemented, aimed at striking the a stable racial balance among the troops in French Indochina. The number of ethnic Vietnamese soldiers was perceived to be too great and thus threatening {{in the wake of}} the mutiny. A safer proportion aimed at reducing the overall ratio among Indochina's colonial troops of 1:1 ethnic Vietnamese to European and indigenous ethnic minorities (Montagnards) was implemented. This demonstrated French distrust of Vietnamese troops and the apparent belief that the fidelity of Vietnamese soldiers was maximised by creating a racial balance within the army that was tilted towards showing all Vietnamese soldiers – and thereby the Vietnamese population at large – the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> attempting insurrection and mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attempt to}} reach the bridge began at 03:45 on the third day, 19September when the 1st and 3rd Battalions were joined by the 11th Parachute Battalion and the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment. By dawn, under intense fire from the German defenders, the attack had faltered whereupon the 11th Parachute Battalion, until then held in reserve, was ordered {{to carry out a}} left {{flanking}} assault on the German line. This last attempt {{to reach the}} defenders at the bridge was subsequently stopped on the orders of General Urquhart when he realised the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> the battle. By this time the 1st Parachute Battalion had been reduced to forty men and the 3rd Parachute Battalion to around the same number.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared defensible {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the <b>futility</b> <b>of</b> throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
