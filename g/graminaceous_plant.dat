40|$|Nicotianamine (NA) is a non-protein {{amino acid}} {{involved}} in fundamental aspects of metal uptake, transport and homeostasis in all plants and constitutes the biosynthetic precursor of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) in <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> species. Nicotianamine synthase (NAS) genes, which encode enzymes that synthesize NA from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), are differentially regulated by iron (Fe) status in most plant species and plant genomes {{have been found}} to contain anywhere from 1 - 9 NAS genes. This study describes the identification of 21 NAS genes in the hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome and their phylogenetic classification into two distinct clades. The TaNAS genes are highly expressed during germination, seedling growth and reproductive development. Fourteen of the clade I NAS genes were up-regulated in root tissues under conditions of Fe deficiency. Protein sequence analyses revealed the presence of endocytosis motifs in all of the wheat NAS proteins as well as chloroplast, mitochondrial and secretory transit peptide signals in four proteins.

30|$|Whilst this {{diurnal pattern}} of the Fe {{deficiency}} response in rice is less distinct than that of other graminaceous plants, the peak time of DMA secretions by rice {{is consistent with the}} peak time of PS secretions observed under Fe deficiency in barley (Marschner et al. 1986; Mori et al. 1987; Takagi et al. 1984; Walter et al. 1995), wheat (Oburger et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 1991), maize (Ueno et al. 2009), and red fescue (Ma et al. 2003). Consistent with other <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> species, a major aspect of the rice Fe deficiency response appears to involve re-establishing Fe homeostasis via increased PS mediated Fe uptake and internal translocation with the time of peak secretions occurring 3 – 5 h after the onset of light.|$|E
30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> solubilize soil Fe by secreting Fe(III) chelators called MAs {{from their}} roots (Takagi 1976; Takagi et al. 1984). The resulting Fe(III)–MA complexes are then {{absorbed into the}} roots by Fe(III)–MA transporter.|$|R
30|$|In {{calcareous}} soils, {{the strategy}} II mechanism {{is more efficient}} than that of strategy I [33]. Tolerance to Fe deficiency is divergent among <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> and {{is thought to be}} dependent on the amount and kinds of MAs that they secrete. Rice, sorghum, and maize secrete only small amounts of 2 ’-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) among the MAs and thus are susceptible to low Fe availability. In contrast, barley secretes large amounts of MAs, including mugineic acid (MA), 3 -epihydroxy- 2 ’-deoxymugineic acid (epiHDMA), and 3 -epihydroxymugineic acid (epiHMA), in addition to DMA, under Fe deficiency; therefore, it is more tolerant to Fe deficiency than other <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> [32, 37, 52, 59].|$|R
30|$|In <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants,</b> NA is the {{precursor}} of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), which are natural Fe(III) chelators used in Fe acquisition from the rhizosphere (Mihashi and Mori 1989; Takagi 1976). Under Fe-deficient conditions, <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> synthesize and secrete MAs into the rhizosphere where they form Fe(III)–MAs complexes that are {{absorbed into the}} root via YS 1 -like transporters (Curie et al. 2001). Rice produces 2 ′-deoxymugineic acid (DMA), which chelates Fe(III) and contributes to Fe uptake from the soil and internal transport (Kobayashi et al. 2008). Therefore, increased NA concentrations would also be expected to increase DMA concentrations in rice plants, with subsequent improvements in Fe uptake and transport.|$|R

The indirect method was more rapid, resulted in higher protoplast viability, and was less subject to contamination than the direct-contact method. Gene expression of approximately equal magnitude resulted when the CAT gene was fused to either the 35 S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus or the copia long terminal repeat promoter of Drosophila.

For these reasons, we studied the effect of the saline stress on the activity of some antioxidative enzymes at this <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant.</b> As biological material, we used seeds of three wheat cultivars (Faur, Fundulea and Iaşi 2) which were treated with different NaCl concentrations. Simultaneously, three controls not exposed at treatment were prepared. The dynamics of catalase and peroxidase activities was determined at 96 h, 168 h and 240 h, namely in early stages of ontogeny. The results evidenced that the saline stress determined modifications of seedlings enzyme activities, at the three moments of analysis, depending on wheat variety and tested concentration of NaCl solutions...|$|E

Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides L.), a perennial <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant,</b> is commonly distributed in salt-affected regions, but {{little is known about the}} mechanism of its adaptation to salinity. In this study, we examined the salt tolerance of a wild and fertile ecotype of vetiver grass in southern China in terms of plant growth and physiological responses after exposure to a range of NaCl levels for 18  days. We found that this vetiver ecotype was highly tolerant to salinity with little adverse effect on plant growth at 100, 150  mM NaCl, which was probably achieved by a combination of Na exclusion and elevated activities of antioxidant enzymes in leaves.|$|E
40|$|Nicotianamine aminotransferase (NAAT), the {{key enzyme}} {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs), catalyzes the amino transfer of nicotianamine (NA). MAs are found only in <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants,</b> although NA has been detected in every plant so far investigated. Therefore, this amino transfer reaction {{is the first step}} in the unique biosynthesis of MAs that has evolved in <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants.</b> NAAT activity is dramatically induced by Fe deficiency and suppressed by Fe resupply. Based on the protein sequence of NAAT purified from Fe-deficient barley (Hordeum vulgare) roots, two distinct cDNA clones encoding NAAT, naat-A and naat-B, were identified. Their deduced amino acid sequences were homologous to several aminotransferases, and shared consensus sequences for the pyridoxal phosphate-binding site lysine residue and its surrounding residues. The expression of both naat-A and naat-B is increased in Fe-deficient barley roots, while naat-B has a low level of constitutive expression in Fe-sufficient barley roots. No detectable mRNA from either naat-A or naat-B was present in the leaves of either Fe-deficient or Fe-sufficient barley. One genomic clone with a tandem array of naat-B and naat-A in this order was identified. naat-B and naat-A each have six introns at the same locations. The isolation of NAAT genes will pave the way to understanding the mechanism of the response to Fe in <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants,</b> and may lead to the development of cultivars tolerant to Fe deficiency that can grow in calcareous soils...|$|R
30|$|Iron (Fe) is {{essential}} for most living organisms including plants. Although abundant in mineral soils, Fe is sparingly soluble under aerobic conditions at high soil pH, especially in calcareous soils, which account for about 30 % of the world’s cultivated soils. Fe deficiency is a widespread agricultural problem that reduces plant growth and crop yields [33, 36]. To take up and utilize Fe from the rhizosphere, higher plants have evolved two major strategies [34]: reduction (strategy I) and chelation (strategy II). The strategy I mechanism, utilized by nongraminaceous plants, includes induction of ferric-chelate reductase to reduce Fe at the root surface to the more soluble ferrous form and transport the ferrous ions generated across the root plasma membrane. In contrast, the strategy II mechanism, which is specific to <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants,</b> is mediated by natural Fe chelators, the mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs). <b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> synthesize and secrete MAs from their roots to solubilize Fe(III) in the rhizosphere [59], and the resulting Fe(III)–MAs complexes are taken up by roots through a specific transporter in the plasma membrane [5, 59].|$|R
50|$|Although {{there is}} {{sufficient}} iron in most soils for plant growth, plant iron deficiency {{is a problem in}} calcareous soil, due to the low solubility of iron(III) hydroxide. Calcareous soil accounts for 30% of the world's farmland. Under such conditions <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> (grasses, cereals and rice) secrete phytosiderophores into the soil, a typical example being deoxymugineic acid. Phytosiderophores have a different structure to those of fungal and bacterial siderophores having two α-aminocarboxylate binding centres, together with a single α-hydroxycarboxylate unit. This latter bidentate function provides phytosiderophores with a high selectivity for iron(III). When grown in an iron -deficient soil, roots of <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> secrete siderophores into the rhizosphere. On scavenging iron(III) the iron -phytosiderophore complex is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane using a proton symport mechanism. The iron(III) complex is then reduced to iron(II) and the iron is transferred to nicotianamine, which although very similar to the phytosiderophores is selective for iron(II) and is not secreted by the roots. Nicotianamine translocates iron in phloem to all plant parts.|$|R
30|$|Vetiver grass (Vetiveria zizanioides L.) is a {{perennial}} <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> native to tropical and subtropical areas (Ghotbizadeh and Sepaskhah 2015). This species is distinguished by its strong and extensive root system which can descend 5  m under tropical conditions.

In rain-fed agriculture the deep-rooted perennial grasses in rotation with annual crops may help recover the balance between water use and rainfall, therefore, preventing rising water tables taking salts to the surface (Munns and Tester 2008). Vetiver grass is already widely used for saline land rehabilitation (Datta et al. 2011; Donjadee and Tingsanchali 2012).|$|E
30|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{mechanisms}} to increase Fe uptake {{in response to}} conditions of limited Fe bioavailability. Dicots and non-graminaceous monocots employ Strategy I uptake, involving proton (H+) secretion to the rhizosphere and reduction of soil Fe 3 + to Fe 2 +. Secretion of H+ reduces soil pH and promotes the solubility of Fe ions and reduction of Fe 3 + to the more bioavailable Fe 2 + promotes increased uptake of Fe 2 + through iron-regulated transporters (IRT) in the plasma membrane of plant root cells (Lee & An 2009; Scholz et al. 1992). <b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> species (grass family Gramineae) utilize Strategy II uptake involving secretion of mugineic acid (MA) family phytosiderophores (PS) into the rhizosphere to chelate and solubilise the soil Fe 3 +, allowing for subsequent uptake of Fe 3 +-PS complexes through yellow stripe 1 -like (YSL) transporters in the plasma membrane of plant root cells (Inoue et al. 2009; Nagasaka et al. 2009).|$|E

Steudel), a <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> of cosmopolitan nature, has been extensively studied especially for the mitigation of environmental contamination. The capability of common reed to grow well at extreme environmental conditions such as elevated CO 2 and high temperature is conferred by several factors such as change of carbon trapping mechanism (from C 3 to C 4 and vice versa), microbial association and biochemical adaptations.

30|$|Higher {{plants have}} evolved two main {{strategies}} for Fe acquisition from the rhizosphere: Fe reduction (Strategy I) or Fe chelation (Strategy II). Strategy I is employed by all plant species, {{with the exception}} of <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants,</b> and involves pumping protons by H+-ATPases to acidify the rhizosphere and increase Fe solubility in the soil. A ferric chelate reductase (FRO) reduces Fe 3 + to Fe 2 +, and Fe 2 + transporters (IRTs - Iron Reduced Transporters) carry Fe into cells (Kim and Guerinot 2007). The Strategy II Fe-uptake system is limited to <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants,</b> which release mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) from their roots to solubilize the sparingly soluble Fe 3 + in the soil (Takagi 1976; Takagi et al. 1984; Ishimaru et al. 2006). Exceptionally, in addition to a chelation strategy, rice possesses an Fe-uptake system that directly absorbs Fe 2 + (strategy I) (Ishimaru et al. 2006). This is advantageous for growth in submerged conditions because, unlike other grasses, rice is well adapted to grow in flooded conditions where Fe 2 + is more abundant than Fe 3 + (Ishimaru et al. 2006).|$|R

Methionine {{has been identified as}} the precursor of MAs (Figure  1) (Mori and Nishizawa 1987). In graminaceous plants including rice, DMA is synthesized from NA by NAAT and DMAS (Figure  1), and in barley and some graminaceous species, other types of MAs are synthesized from DMA by Fe deficiency-specific clones no. 2 (IDS 2) and no. 3 (IDS 3, mugineic acid synthase) (Nakanishi et al. 2000; Kobayashi et al. 2001). <b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> roots secrets MAs, which chelate insoluble Fe(III) in the rhizosphere.

40|$|<b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> species acquire soil iron by {{the release}} of phytosiderophores and {{subsequent}} uptake of iron(III) -phytosiderophore complexes. As plant species differ in their ability for phytosiderophore hydroxylation prior to release, an electrophoretic method {{was set up to}} determine whether hydroxylation affects the net charge of iron(III) -phytosiderophore complexes, and thus chelate stability. At pH 7. 0, non-hydroxylated (deoxymugineic acid) and hydroxylated (mugineic acid; epi-hydroxymugineic acid) phytosiderophores form single negatively charged iron(III) complexes, in contrast to iron(III) -nicotianamine. As the degree of phytosiderophore hydroxylation increases, the corresponding iron(III) complex was found to be less readily protonated. Measured pKa values of the amino groups and calculated free iron(III) concentrations in presence of a 10 -fold chelator excess were also found to decrease with increasing degree of hydroxylation, confirming that phytosiderophore hydroxylation protects against acid-induced protonation of the iron(III) -phytosiderophore complex. These effects are almost certainly associated with intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl and amino functions. We conclude that introduction of hydroxyl groups into the phytosiderophore skeleton increases iron(III) -chelate stability in acid environments such as those found in the rhizosphere or the root apoplasm and may contribute to an enhanced iron acquisition...|$|E

Although several RBSDV proteins have been studied in detail, functions of the nonstructural protein P 6 are still largely unknown. Results In the current study, we employed yeast two-hybrid assays, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and subcellular localization experiments to show that P 6 can self-interact to form punctate, cytoplasmic viroplasm-like structures (VLS) when expressed alone in plant cells. The region from residues 395 to 659 is necessary for P 6 self-interaction, whereas two polypeptides (residues 580 - 620 and 615 - 655) are involved in the subcellular localization of P 6. Furthermore, P 6 strongly interacts with the viroplasm-associated protein P 9 - 1 and recruits P 9 - 1 to localize in VLS. The P 6 395 - 659 region is also important for the P 6 -P 9 - 1 interaction, and deleting any region of P 9 - 1 abolishes this heterologous interaction. Conclusions RBSDV P 6 protein has an intrinsic ability to self-interact and forms VLS without other RBSDV proteins or RNAs. P 6 recruits P 9 - 1 to VLS by direct protein-protein interaction. This is the first report on the functionality of RBSDV P 6 protein. P 6 may be involved in the process of viroplasm nucleation and virus morphogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|Arabinoxylans (AXs) {{are major}} {{components}} of <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plant</b> cell walls, {{including those in}} the grain and straw of economically important cereals. Despite some recent advances in identifying the genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes {{for a number of}} other plant cell wall polysaccharides, the genes encoding enzymes of the final stages of AX synthesis have not been identified. We have therefore adopted a novel bioinformatics approach based on estimation of differential expression of orthologous genes between taxonomic divisions of species. Over 3 million public domain cereal and dicot expressed sequence tags were mapped onto the complete sets of rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes, respectively. It was assumed that genes in cereals involved in AX biosynthesis would be expressed at high levels and that their orthologs in dicotyledonous plants would be expressed at much lower levels. Considering all rice genes encoding putative glycosyl transferases (GTs) predicted to be integral membrane proteins, genes in the GT 43, GT 47, and GT 61 families emerged as much the strongest candidates. When the search was widened to all other rice or Arabidopsis genes predicted to encode integral membrane proteins, cereal genes in Pfam family PF 02458 emerged as candidates for the feruloylation of AX. Our analysis, known activities, and recent findings elsewhere are most consistent with genes in the GT 43 families encoding β- 1, 4 -xylan synthases, genes in the GT 47 family encoding xylan α- 1, 2 - or α- 1, 3 -arabinosyl transferases, and genes in the GT 61 family encoding feruloyl-AX β- 1, 2 -xylosyl transferases...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic organisms have {{developed}} diverse mechanisms for {{the acquisition of}} iron, which is required for their survival. <b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> use a chelation strategy. They secrete phytosiderophore compounds, which solubilize iron in the soil, and then take up the resulting iron-phytosiderophore complexes. Bacteria and mammals also secrete siderophores to acquire iron. Although phytosiderophore secretion is crucial for plant growth, its molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we show that the efflux of deoxymugineic acid, the primary phytosiderophore from rice and barley, involves the TOM 1 and HvTOM 1 genes, respectively. Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM 1 or HvTOM 1 released 14 C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not 14 C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM 1 and HvTOM 1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters. Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM 1 and HvTOM 1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency. In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM 1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM 1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid. We have also identified two genes encoding efflux transporters of nicotianamine, ENA 1 and ENA 2. Our identification of phytosiderophore efflux transporters has revealed the final piece in the molecular machinery of iron acquisition in <b>graminaceous</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|This review {{covers the}} history on Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) in <b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plants</b> grown in Brazil, and {{describes}} research progress {{made over the}} last 40 years, most of whichwas coordinated by Johanna Döbereiner. One notable accomplishment during this period was the discovery of several nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as the rhizospheric (Beijerinckia fluminensis and Azotobacter paspali), associative (Azospirillum lipoferum, A. brasilense, A. amazonense) and the endophytic (Herbaspirillum seropedicae, H. rubrisubalbicans, Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, Burkholderia brasilensis and B. tropica). The role of these diazotrophs in association with grasses, mainly with cereal plants, has been studied {{and a lot of}} progress has been achieved in the ecological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic aspects. The mechanisms of colonization and infection of the plant tissues are better understood, and the BNF contribution to the soil/plant system has been determined. Inoculation studies with diazotrophs showed that endophytic bacteria have a much higher BNF contribution potential than associative diazotrophs. In addition, {{it was found that the}} plant genotype influences the plant/bacteria association. Recent data suggest that more studies should be conducted on the endophytic association to strengthen the BNF potential. The ongoing genome sequencing programs: RIOGENE (Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus) and GENOPAR (Herbaspirillum seropedicae) reflect the commitment to the BNF study in Brazil and should allow the country to continue in the forefront of research related to the BNF process in <b>Graminaceous</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
