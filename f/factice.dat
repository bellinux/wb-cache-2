Although rubber seed is rich in nutrients, it also contains cyanogenic glycosides which will release prussic acid {{in the presence of}} enzymes or in slightly acidic conditions.Oil from the rubber seed is also of commercial importance. Hitherto, rubber seed has largely been allowed to waste with very little used for raising root stock seedlings for propagation purposes. [...] The useful properties of the rubber seed oil make it similar to well-known linseed and soybean oil. Rubber seed oil also could be used for the paint industry as a semidrying oil, in the manufacture of soap, for the production of linoleum and [...] alkyd resin; in medicine as antimalaria oil; and in engineering as core binder for <b>factice</b> preparation, and the cake left after oil extraction is used in fertilizer preparation and as feed for cattle and poultry.

Foaming SBR was made up by machinery and observed by stereoscopic microscope.

Introuction At first, ointment was used as rubber substitute but as the development of technology, it has become one processing aid with special functions and technique. Now ointment has been used widely in the processing of rubber, but it is seldom used as blowing promoter. Ointment has many kinds which includes black <b>factice,</b> white <b>factice,</b> sulfur chloride <b>factice,</b> <b>factice</b> used in specialty rubber, unique <b>factice</b> without sulfur and chlorine and others. Ointment can promote processing characteristics, vulcanization characteristics and physical and mechanical characteristics of the materials. Besides, processing techniques such as foaming temperature, the amount of foaming agent has great effects on the structure of foaming rubber. The purpose of the article is to study the application of ointment to foaming SBR, and to explore the effects of ointment variety, ointment amounts and vulcanization temperature on the foaming SBR.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the increased output of Queer documentary film in France and Italy from 2000 onwards, an increase which is seen to form part of a wider committed cinema. The impetus comes from a need to recognise the contribution of this output in marking a shift away from the categorisation of representations within set frameworks and identities to the deployment of the intricacies of documentary performance in creating an alternative and more complex sense of place and identity. In considering this shift I develop {{the notion of the}} lieu <b>factice,</b> which I offer as an original way of approaching the complexities of both the process of documentary representation and the context in which this takes place in France and Italy where ‘difference’ is generally subsumed in universal principles. The lieu <b>factice</b> is a temporary site of agency and resistance which allows identity and place to be explored in different ways, reflecting the position of Queer lives in contexts where the universal predominates and the interplay between visibility and invisibility is a complex phenomenon. As I progress through each chapter, providing detailed analysis of the selected films, I appropriate a range of Queer theoretical concepts to support my notion, which draws on the work of Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Leo Bersani and Nicholas de Villiers. The lieu <b>factice</b> is shaped by a range of representational and spatial dynamics in the foregrounding of ‘difference’ and is marked by shifts between local, national, and global spaces, both physical and imagined. The notion of ‘Queer documentary’ in France and Italy is seen to defy definition and centres on a notable challenge to the hegemony of the family as a heteronormative space within national narratives...|$|E

30|$|Hevea brasiliensis (rubber) is {{the source}} of natural rubber latex which can be used to produce {{surgical}} gloves, tires, conveyor belts, windshield wipers, toys and various other rubber goods. Rubber is cultivated as large plantations, in many countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, China and Congo Free State in Africa. Rubber seeds were originally considered as a waste product but now they are used to feed livestock (Abdullah and Salimon 2009). Rubber seed contains a relatively higher oil content of 40 – 50  % (Junaid et al. 2014) and the rubber seed oil (RSO) was found to have properties similar to soya bean oil and linseed oil which are widely used in industrial applications. Therefore, RSO has now become an important raw material for many industries; as semidrying oil in the paint industry (Joseph et al. 2004), in soap manufacturing (Ohikhena 2006), as anti-malaria oil in medicines (Thomas et al. 1998) and as a core binder for <b>factice</b> preparation in engineering (Fernando 1971).|$|E

By the analysis of the 314 examinees, including control group, special educators and rehabilitators and parents, we determinate that the knowledge about sexual development, characteristics and sex relationships the examinees with disabilities at most acquire by the mediums and peers conversations.
