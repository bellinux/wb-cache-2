5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from southern Finland south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial collar of variable extent.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{best known}} work in {{economics}} concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly {{the relations between}} religion and capitalism, which he explored in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism {{as well as in}} his other works on the sociology of religion. He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of ancient capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state. Other contributions include his early work on the economic history of Roman agrarian society (1891) and on the labour relations in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> (1892), his analysis of the history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages (1889), his critique of Marxism, the discussion of the roles of idealism and materialism in the history of capitalism in his Economy and Society (1922) and his General Economic History (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.|$|E

40|$|Since <b>Eastern</b> <b>Germany's</b> {{conversion}} {{to a market}} economy wages have remained considerably below the West German wage level. This article looks at the role of establishment-specific factors—such as sectoral affiliation and size of the labour force—in this process. A non-parametric decomposition that has played a prominent role in the gender wage gap literature is applied to breakdown the East-West wage gap into its constituent components. Using establishment data from German employment statistics, the article demonstrates that the catching-up process of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Germany's</b> wage level is hindered by the shift in its economic structure towards lower-paying types of companies, which has caused the lagging behind in the adjustment of wages. ...|$|R

5|$|Wolf {{populations in}} Poland have {{increased}} to about 800–900 individuals since being {{classified as a}} game species in 1976. Poland plays {{a fundamental role in}} providing routes of expansion into neighbouring Central European countries. In the east, its range overlaps with populations in Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and Slovakia. A population in western Poland expanded into <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> and in 2000 the first pups were born on German territory. In 2012, an estimated 14 wolf packs were living in Germany (mostly in the east and north) and a pack with pups has been sighted within 15 miles of Berlin; the number increased to 46 packs in 2016. The gray wolf is protected in Slovakia, though an exception is made for wolves killing livestock. A few Slovakian wolves disperse into the Czech Republic, where they are afforded full protection. Wolves in Slovakia, Ukraine and Croatia may disperse into Hungary, where the lack of cover hinders the buildup of an autonomous population. Although wolves have special status in Hungary, they may be hunted with a year-round permit if they cause problems.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, marked {{differences}} between the regions of the former West Germany and East Germany: significantly more children are {{born out of wedlock}} in <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> than in western Germany: in 2012, in <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> 61.6% of births were to unmarried women, but in western Germany only 28.4%.|$|E

25|$|Immigrants from Pakistan, India, China and Vietnam perform {{exceptionally}} well. In <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany,</b> Vietnamese and Chinese of lower-class backgrounds outperform {{students from}} European backgrounds {{despite the fact}} that in most cases their parents are poorer and less educated than the parents of their European-born peers. Teachers in <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> have also been shown to be more motivated than teachers in western Germany. That might be another reason for this Asian achievement.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of social class on educational achievement {{is much greater}} in western Germany {{than it is in}} <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> (former GDR). An analysis of PISA data on Gymnasium pupils for the year 2000 showed that, while in western Germany the child of an academic was 7.26 times as likely as that of a skilled worker to attend, in <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> a child from an academic family was only 2.78 times as likely as a working class child to attend. The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed that immigrants were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than in <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.|$|E

25|$|Around 2950 BCE {{there was}} a {{transition}} from the Funnelbeaker farming culture to the Corded Ware pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, {{that is associated with}} the advance of Indo-European languages.

25|$|In {{many other}} cases the Germanised {{versions}} {{are out of}} etymological context. Examples include the Danish ending -næs (isthmus) being replaced by -nitz, a Slavic ending which is common in <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany.</b> Such arbitrary translations were often made by the central Prussian government after the whole of Slesvig was ceded to Prussia after the war of 1864.|$|E
25|$|The Tower pound {{was also}} called the Moneyers' Pound (referring to the Saxon moneyers before the Conquest), the easterling pound, which may refer to traders of <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany,</b> or to traders {{on the shore of}} the eastern Baltic sea, or dealers of Asiatic goods who settled at the Steelyard wharf; and the Rochelle Pound by French writers, because it was also in use at Rochelle.

25|$|Faced with {{opposition}} from the general public the regime took brutal measures against any form of resistance. After the general strike of 1942, Gustav Simon proclaimed {{a state of emergency}} and introduced the German Standgerichte. Thousands were arrested and tortured. Hundreds died in the concentration camps. Whole families were deported to <b>eastern</b> <b>Germany</b> and replaced by German families, mainly from South-Tyrol and Eastern Europe. The headquarters of the Gestapo, the Villa Pauly, became the symbol of this terror.|$|E
