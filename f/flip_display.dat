40|$|The {{generalized}} hybrid Monte Carlo (GHMC) method combines Metropolis corrected constant energy simulations with {{a partial}} random refreshment {{step in the}} particle mo-menta. The standard detailed balance condition requires that momenta are negated upon rejection of a molecular dynamics proposal step. The implication is a trajectory reversal upon rejection, which is undesirable when interpreting GHMC as thermostated molecular dynamics. We show that a modified detailed balance condition {{can be used to}} implement GHMC without momentum flips. The same modification {{can be applied to the}} gener-alized shadow hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method. Numerical results indicate that GHMC/GSHMC implementations with momentum <b>flip</b> <b>display</b> a favorable behavior in terms of sampling efficiency, i. e., the traditional GHMC/GSHMC implementations with momentum flip got the advantage of a higher acceptance rate and faster decorrelation of Monte Carlo samples. The difference is more pronounced for GHMC. We also numeri-cally investigate the behavior of the GHMC method as a Langevin-type thermostat. We find that the GHMC method without momentum flip interferes less with the underlying stochastic molecular dynamics in terms of autocorrelation functions and it to be preferred over the GHMC method with momentum flip. The same finding applies to GSHMC. ...|$|E
50|$|Vane {{displays}} {{have been}} used in game shows and on scoreboards in sports arenas and stadiums. Like eggcrate displays, they are not washed out by bright lights such as those found in a television studio. Another benefit of the vane display is that if the power supply is lost, the display will continue to show whatever the last value was before power was cut. However, like flip-disc displays, if a large number of elements must be changed at the same time, the <b>flipping</b> <b>displays</b> may present a significant amount of noise.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} zero-temperature {{persistence}} {{phenomenon in the}} random bond ± J Ising model on a square lattice via extensive numerical simulations. We find strong evidence for ` blocking regardless of the amount disorder present in the system.

The peak is identified {{with the onset of}} the zero-temperature spin glass transition in the model. The residual persistence is found to decay algebraically and the persistence exponent θ (p) ≈ 0. 9 over the range 0. 1 < p< 0. 9.

50|$|Early {{computer}} installations {{were designed}} only {{to support a}} single writing system, typically for left-to-right scripts based on the Latin alphabet only. Adding new character sets and character encodings enabled {{a number of other}} left-to-right scripts to be supported, but did not easily support right-to-left scripts such as Arabic or Hebrew, and mixing the two was not practical. Right-to-left scripts were introduced through encodings like ISO/IEC 8859-6 and ISO/IEC 8859-8, storing the letters (usually) in writing and reading order. It is possible to simply <b>flip</b> the left-to-right <b>display</b> order to a right-to-left display order, but doing this sacrifices the ability to correctly display left-to-right scripts. With bidirectional script support, it is possible to mix scripts from different scripts on the same page, regardless of writing direction.|$|R

40|$|Objective: The goal of {{this study}} was to test whether central {{mechanisms}} of scratching-induced itch attenuation can be activated by scratching the limb contralateral to the itching limb when the participant is made to visually perceive the non-itching limb as the itching limb by means of mirror images. Methods: Healthy participants were asked to assess the intensity of an experimentally induced itch at their right forearm while they observed externally guided scratch movements either at their right (itching) or left (non-itching) forearm which were either mirrored or not mirrored. In the first experiment, a mirror placed between the participant’s forearms was used to create the visual illusion that the participant’s itching (right) forearm was being scratched while in fact the non-itching (left) forearm was scratched. To control visibility of the left (non-mirrored) forearm, a second experiment was performed in which unflipped and <b>flipped</b> real-time video <b>displays</b> of the participant’s forearms were used to create experimental conditions in which the participant visually perceived scratching either on one forearm only, on both forearms, or no scratching at all. Results: In both experiments, scratching the non-itching limb attenuated perceived itch intensity significantly and selectively in the mirror condition, i. e., when the non-itching forearm was visually perceived as the itching limb. Discussion: These data provide evidence that the visual illusion that an itching limb is being scratched while in fac...|$|R
40|$|The inelastic light {{scattering}} spectrum of Pb[(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) 1 −xTix]O 3 (PMN-xPT) single crystals with x= 0 – 0. 55 due to longitudinal-acoustic (LA) waves {{was investigated in}} a wide temperature range by using a Brillouin scattering technique. The acoustic frequency of LA modes of all PMN-xPT crystals showed a significant softening upon cooling in the high-temperature range where the deviation from the high-temperature linearity starts from ∼ 750  K. In addition, hypersonic damping exhibited a remarkable increase upon cooling toward the freezing or ferroelectric phase-transition temperature. These acoustic anomalies were attributed to the polarization fluctuations due to the displacive polarization component arising from the condensation of transverse-optic mode, flipping of polar nanoregions, and, for PMN-xPT with large x, correlated polar nanometer-sized regions (PNRs) as ordering units. The application of the modified superparaelectric model to the measured acoustic properties revealed that the activation energy for the <b>flipping</b> of PNRs <b>displayed</b> a sharp increase upon crossing the composition of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of PMN-xPT. This change was attributed to the appearance of order-disorder polarization component, i. e., polar clusters in PMN-xPT with large x beyond MPB, which indicated PNRs are correlated and oriented along the same direction. These results may suggest a crossover in the mechanism of phase transition with increasing x: disordered glass state with random directions of PNRs in PMN, comparatively abrupt growth of PNRs at the ferroelectric phase transition without changing the directions of their dipole moments at small x, and order-disorder type ferroelectric transition through alignment of PNRs into single direction via order-disorder mechanism at large x. These {{results are consistent with}} broadband dielectric and quasielastic scattering data that show critical slowing down for PMN-xPT with large x...|$|R
