40|$|Study of 41 species {{provided}} information as follows: (a) a setigerous lobe {{is located at}} the costal margin in every species in the subf. Staphylininae; (b) a setal comb occupies the same margin in Xantholinini and O maliinae; (c) one or more spinulae do line the anal fi eld of all O maliinae and most O xytelinae, Tachyporinae and A leocharinae; (d) number of these spinulae in A leocharinae ranges from 1 up to about 100 and is null in two species. Hypothetically, a functional importance may be attributed to both the setigerous lobe, which suggests a mechanical receptor for wing folding control, and to the f﻿﻿labellum-like anal fi eld of the Aleochara, which looks as a device affecting the <b>flying</b> <b>trim...</b>|$|E

50|$|Under the Taliban regime, Sharia law was {{interpreted}} to ban {{a wide variety}} of activities hitherto lawful in Afghanistan: employment, education and sports for women, movies, television, videos, music, dancing, hanging pictures in homes, clapping during sports events, kite <b>flying,</b> and beard <b>trimming.</b> One Taliban list of prohibitions included: pork, pig, pig oil, anything made from human hair, satellite dishes, cinematography, and equipment that produces the joy of music, pool tables, chess, masks, alcohol, tapes, computers, VCRs, television, anything that propagates sex and is full of music, wine, lobster, nail polish, firecrackers, statues, sewing catalogs, pictures, Christmas cards.|$|R
5000|$|On {{military}} aircraft during wartime, trim tabs often served as unintentional backup control systems for aircraft with damaged controls. Since trim tabs are usually controlled {{by their own}} dedicated system of control cables, rods, and/or hydraulic lines, aircraft that had suffered loss of primary controls could often be flown home [...] "on the trim tabs", or by using trim adjustment {{as a replacement for}} the non-working primary controls. Such control is effective, if slower and more limited than primary controls, but it does allow the aircraft to be controlled and directed. In other cases, such as an engine being shot out, or damage causing asymmetric drag, trim tabs were invaluable for allowing the pilot to fly the aircraft straight without having to apply a constant force on the stick or rudder to keep the aircraft <b>flying</b> straight. <b>Trim</b> tabs were also important for aircraft such as bombers, who often underwent rapid changes in center-of-gravity when the bombload was dropped, requiring a hand ready on the trim-adjusting wheel to counteract the tendency of the aircraft to pitch up or down. Undertaking high-speed dives or deploying flaps also generally necessitated pitch trim adjustment, as aircraft of the era had different pitch tendencies at different airspeeds, and flaps could change the center of lift. Even burning fuel off could require periodic trim adjustment during a long flight, as it was difficult to ensure that all fuel tanks were equally near the center of gravity (careful selection of various fuel tanks to ensure even consumption from all tanks helped negate this as well). An extreme example would be later P-51 Mustangs, which were given a large long-range fuel tank behind the cockpit to allow long range missions to Berlin. Since the aircraft was not designed to carry this weight so far back in the fuselage, the trim had to be adjusted far forward during the first leg of the flight, and slowly adjusted back as the fuel was used, to avoid causing excess drag, and thus excessive fuel consumption, due to a nose-high attitude on the many-hour flight to Berlin.|$|R
