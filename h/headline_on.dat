500|$|Although {{the battle}} had been {{fought in the}} name of Serbian defence and unity, {{reactions}} in Serbia were deeply divided. The JNA, the state-controlled Serbian media and Serbian ultra-nationalists hailed the victory as a triumph. The JNA even erected a triumphal arch in Belgrade through which its returning soldiers could march, and officers were congratulated for taking [...] "the toughest and fiercest Ustaša fortress". The Serbian newspaper Politika ran a front-page <b>headline</b> <b>on</b> 20 November announcing: [...] "Vukovar Finally Free". In January 1992, from the ruins of Vukovar, the ultranationalist painter Milić Stanković wrote an article for the Serbian periodical Pogledi ("Viewpoints"), in which he declared: [...] "Europe must know Vukovar was liberated from the Croat Nazis. They were helped by Central European scum. They crawled from under the papal tiara, as a dart of the serpent's tongue that protruded from the bloated Kraut and overstretched Eurocommunal anus." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight {{explained}} that several options had been brought up, such as [...] "one of the versions in the comics where {{when he was a kid}} people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having Ben Urich give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper <b>headline.</b> <b>On</b> why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would [...] "get a little bit silly.... we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!'," [...] and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.|$|E
500|$|Her first {{magazine}} cover appearance {{was on the}} December issue of an irreverent political magazine, Veintitrés where Telpuk appeared under the headline [...] "The Bombshell Behind the Suitcase" [...] standing behind a suitcase. She wore little other than a police cap, and another <b>headline</b> <b>on</b> the cover read, [...] "Is She the Key Piece of a Plot Designed by Washington?" [...] She then appeared on the February issue of the Argentine edition of Playboy magazine next to the headline [...] "Corrupción Al Desnudo" [...] (translated as [...] "Corruption Laid Bare"). Subsequently, she appeared on the March 2008 issue of the Venezuelan edition of Playboy magazine. She posed with a red suitcase decorated with both the Argentine and Venezuelan flags while wearing a scarf, black leather gloves and black-and-white boots for her Playboy cover appearance. Within the magazine in her pictorial, she posed with fewer clothes and with various props: the ubiquitous suitcase, dollar bills, including the propeller blades of a single-engine airplane. She decided to pursue an appearance on the Argentine variety show [...] "Bailando por un sueño", after Marcelo Tinelli visited her at the airport to congratulate her.|$|E
500|$|The film shows novel {{techniques}} in film production {{that were used}} to assist the viewer in understanding the narrative. In the beginning of the film, when Harry and the thief struggle, a closeup shot is used to show the thief placing the purse into Harry's pocket. While the two struggle in the previous scene, the close-up shot has both men standing still. Charlie Keil, author of Early American Cinema in Transition, cites this as an attempt to improve the narrative by allowing a complex sequence of events to be examined intelligibly by the viewer. Keil also states that shot may have been done to lessen trade press objections to the close-up views by showing the value to the narrative development. When Harry is in jail, he imagines his mother, and this is shown by an inset at the upper right of film. Months after the film had been released, Robert Grau wrote a column in the Moving Picture World which praised the attention to detail in the production for a newspaper which was shown on camera for only a few seconds. Grau states, [...] "I was unable to discern in the few seconds the effect was on view, what means were taken to create the illusion ... and it is consoling to know that the producers of photoplays are aspiring to reach great heights in such matters." [...] An analysis of the frame shows that it was not so much an illusion as pasting the <b>headline</b> <b>on</b> the edition of August 27, 1910 of the New York City Herald Tribune. The film also shows a real and dangerous stunt executed by Crane, where he is seen [...] "sliding 40 feet down a washline to liberty in a scene that couldn't have been faked." ...|$|E

The last occasion when that historical theater had staged any one-man shows had been when Al Jolson had performed there in the 1920s and the 1930s. The small (approximately 1,600-seat) Broadway venue provided an intimate concert setting not common at the time, with every performance reportedly sold out.
