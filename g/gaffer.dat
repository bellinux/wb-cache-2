5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as <b>gaffer</b> or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene when}} Walter {{approaches}} Gus' house {{with plans to}} kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone {{in the middle of}} the street. MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter's helplessness, insignificance and lack of experience. Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall, MacLaren rented a 180-foot-tall crane specifically for that shot. Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night-time hours, the crane shot was the first one they filmed. It was shot by camera operators Andrew Voegeli, with dolly grip David Jaxx Nagro and <b>gaffer</b> Steven Litecky. Later, for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar, MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered. When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed, the staging involved Mike standing up, then Walter standing up, then Mike suddenly punching him. Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising. The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto, and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves. Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls, and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes.|$|E

25|$|Glassblowing is a glassforming {{technique}} that involves inflating molten glass into a bubble (or parison), {{with the aid}} of a blowpipe (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a glassblower, glassmith, or <b>gaffer.</b> A lampworker (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of borosilicate glass.|$|E

25|$|Mohun Bagan {{had almost}} secured {{a place in}} the final as they went into the semi final away {{encounter}} with a 5–0 advantage against Shillong Lajong. This however did not deter the Bagan <b>gaffer,</b> Sanjoy Sen from fielding his first side in the match. The Mariners however lacked motivation and played a defensive game. They failed to create significant positive moves as their opponents found it easier going in the centre of the field. Shillong Lajong had their best chance of the match when Brazilian striker Fábio Pena found an open net in front of him but still ended up hitting the woodwork. The match was fairly uneventful and ended a 0–0 stalemate guaranteeing Mohun Bagan progress on basis of the 5–0 aggregate scoreline.|$|E

25|$|The {{late night}} scenes caused {{issues with the}} cast. Garlan Wilde, a <b>gaffer</b> for the film, was injured during the scene between Brady and the Shape when he dropped a light and accidentally slit his wrists. He {{was rushed to the}} hospital. In addition, while filming the rooftop scene, Ellie Cornell cut her stomach open on a large nail while sliding down the roof, though she {{continued}} filming the scene despite losing a sizable amount of blood. During most of the night scenes, Donald Pleasence became so cold that he wore a hat for most of the scenes, unbeknownst to the crew. This caused over six hours of footage to be re-shot. The shoot lasted about 41 days and Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris were required to be on set for 36 of those days.|$|E
25|$|A pair of mules {{would be}} manned {{by a person}} called the minder and two boys called the side piecer and the little piecer. They worked barefoot in humid temperatures, the minder and the little piecer worked the minder half of the mule. The minder would make minor {{adjustments}} to his mules {{to the extent that}} each mule worked differently. They were specialists in spinning, and were only answerable to the <b>gaffer</b> and under-gaffer who were in charge of the floor and with it {{the quantity and quality of}} the yarn that was produced. Bobbins of rovings came from the carder in the blowing room delivered by a bobbin carrier who was part of the carder's staff, and yarn was hoisted down to the warehouse by the warehouseman's staff. Delineation of jobs was rigid and communication would be through the means of coloured slips of paper written on in indelible pencil.|$|E
25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, <b>gaffer</b> tape and PVC tape from two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E

500|$|The {{themes of}} the album are {{reflected}} in the album cover designed by Alexander McQueen. Björk approached McQueen explaining to him the person who wrote Homogenics songs was someone who [...] "had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love.

500|$|Scott {{is known}} for his skill at filming with {{multiple}} camera set-ups and Body of Lies used a minimum of three simultaneously. Witt explained the benefits, [...] "Actors like multiple cameras because they’re always on-camera, so they’re always in character and not wasting time off-camera." [...] One shot of DiCaprio alone in the desert, for example, still used three cameras: one hand-held above the actor, a second capturing a three-quarter back profile, and the third photographing a close-up through the first cameraman's legs. Richard Cronn, the <b>gaffer,</b> attributed the success of this difficult approach to Scott's filmmaking intelligence, [...] "Ridley will stand at the monitors and tell you what's he's looking for – he'll look at four monitors and say, 'I'm cutting from this to this to this.' He knows exactly how he will cut it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{creating}} a practical effect, a grid consisting of fluorescent lights was installed onto the set that housed Sterling Cooper's main office.

The shipments arrived {{on the first day of}} filming the pilot. However, examination by the set-lighting crew revealed the lightbulbs used were internally modernized, having been designed to hold T-8 bulbs measuring two feet each. [...] "Getting more than 800 2-foot color-corrected T-8 tubes became a major issue, and none of the regular suppliers had enough in stock," [...] recalled Mike Ambrose, the <b>gaffer</b> for the production team in Los Angeles. [...] "Movietone stopped production of whatever bulbs it was making, retooled the plant and started manufacturing the T-8s we needed. The last shipment arrived the morning of our first day of shooting." ...|$|E
