40|$|BACKGROUND: Insulin {{resistance}} (IR) {{is believed}} to be the underlying mechanism of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Recently, a few studies have demonstrated that phthalates could cause oxidative stress which would contribute to the development of IR. Therefore, we evaluated whether exposure to phthalates affects IR, and oxidative stress is involved in the phthalates-IR pathway. METHODS: We recruited 560 elderly participants, and obtained blood and urine samples during repeated medical examinations. For the determination of phthalate exposure, we measured urinary levels of mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP) and mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) as metabolites of <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalates</b> (DEHP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) as a metabolite of di-butyl phthalate (DBP). Malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress biomarker, was also measured in urine samples. We measured serum levels of fasting glucose and insulin, and derived the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index to assess IR. A mixed-effect model and penalized regression spline were used to estimate the associations among phthalate metabolites, MDA, and IR. RESULTS: The molar sum of MEHHP and MEOHP (∑DEHP) were significantly associated with HOMA (β =  0. 26, P =  0. 040), and the association was apparent among participants with a history of DM (β =  0. 88, P =  0. 037) and among females (β =  0. 30, P =  0. 022). However, the relation between MnBP and HOMA was not found. When we evaluated whether oxidative stress is involved in increases of HOMA by ∑DEHP, MDA levels were significantly associated with increases of ∑DEHP (β =  0. 11, P< 0. 001) and HOMA (β =  0. 49, P =  0. 049). CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that exposure to DEHP in the elderly population increases IR, which is related with oxidative stress, and that participants with a history of DM and females are more susceptible to DEHP exposure...|$|R
40|$|Background: Some {{legacy and}} {{emerging}} environmental contaminants are suspected {{risk factors for}} intrauterine growth restriction. However, the evidence is equivocal, {{in part due to}} difficulties in disentangling the effects of mixtures. Objectives: We assessed associations between multiple correlated biomarkers of environmental exposure and birth weight. Methods: We evaluated a cohort of 1, 250 term (≥ 37 weeks gestation) singleton infants, born to 513 mothers from Greenland, 180 from Poland, and 557 from Ukraine, who were recruited during antenatal care visits in 2002 ‒ 2004. Secondary metabolites of <b>diethylhexyl</b> and diisononyl <b>phthalates</b> (DEHP, DiNP), eight perfluoroalkyl acids, and organochlorines (PCB- 153 and p,p´‑DDE) were quantifiable in 72 ‒ 100 % of maternal serum samples. We assessed associations between exposures and term birth weight, adjusting for co-exposures and covariates, including prepregnancy body mass index. To identify independent associations, we applied the elastic net penalty to linear regression models. Results: Two phthalate metabolites (MEHHP, MOiNP), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and p,p´-DDE were most consistently predictive of term birth weight based on elastic net penalty regression. In an adjusted, unpenalized regression model of the four exposures, 2 -SD increases in natural log–transformed MEHHP, PFOA, and p,p´-DDE were associated with lower birth weight: – 87 g (95 % CI: – 137, – 340 per 1. 70 ng/mL), – 43 g (95 % CI: – 108, 23 per 1. 18 ng/mL), and – 135 g (95 % CI: – 192, – 78 per 1. 82 ng/g lipid), respectively; and MOiNP was associated with higher birth weight (46 g; 95 % CI: – 5, 97 per 2. 22 ng/mL). Conclusions: This study suggests that several of the environmental contaminants, belonging to three chemical classes, may be independently associated with impaired fetal growth.

40|$|Abstract: Plasticizers are {{additives}} {{that are}} used to increase the flexibility of plastic during manufacturing.

The aim of the present project was the scientific preparation of deliberations aiming to find out which concentrations of selected contaminants occurring in secondary raw-material fertilisers (sewage sludge and compost) and farm fertilisers can still be tolerated, which do not have harmful effects on the environment. Information on the occurrence in sewage sludges and soils and their effects on soil organisms were compiled and evaluated for the following substances: linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), nonylphenol (NP), tributyltin (TBT), benzo(a) pyrene (BaP), <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEPH) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). In addition, respective data were searched for polyacrylamide (PAM), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and polycyclic musk compounds. The impact of composts by organic contaminants was described giving examples for <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> and dibutyl phthalate, benzo(a) pyrene and polychlorinated biphenyls. Concerning the farm fertiliser slurry, information about organic pollutants stemming from cleaning agents or disinfectants, NP, LAS and quartenary ammonium compounds were collected. LAS, NP, TBT and DEHP were detected in most of the sewage sludge samples. DBP occurred less frequently and in lower concentrations than DEHP. Single exceedings of the respective limit-values of the 3 "r"d Draft of the EU-Sewage Sludge Directive (LAS, NP, DEHP) or other expert groups (BaP) were observed. In compliance with the respective regulations, {{there seems to be no}} risk potential for terrestrial organisms. To derive reliable environmental standards for TBT, there is a need for more data. In compost, content of organic contaminants is generally dependent on impurities. Compost made of 'green' waste had lowest organic contaminant content.

The effect estimate increased when including cadmium, and mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP) co-exposure. Combining exposures by principal component analysis generated an exposure factor loaded by cadmium and arsenic that was associated with reduced birth weight. MECPP induced gender specific effects. In girls, the effect estimate was doubled with co-exposure of thallium, PFOS, lead, cadmium, manganese, and mercury, while in boys, the mixture of MECPP with cadmium showed the strongest association with birth weight. In conclusion, birth weight was consistently inversely associated with exposure to pollutant mixtures. Chemicals not showing significant associations at single pollutant level contributed to stronger effects when analyzed as mixtures. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Plasticizers are {{additives}} {{that are}} used to increase the flexibility of plastic during manufacturing. However, in injection molding processes, plasticizers cannot be generated with monomers because they can peel off from the plastics into the surrounding environment, water, or food, or become attached to skin. Among the various plasticizers {{that are used}}, 1, 2 -benzenedicarboxylic acid (phthalic acid) is a typical precursor to generate phthalates. In addition, phthalic acid is a metabolite of <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP). According to Gene_Ontology gene/protein database, phthalates can cause genital diseases, cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, etc. In this study, a silanized linker (3 -aminopropyl triethoxyslane, APTES) was deposited on silicon dioxides (SiO 2) particles and phthalate chemical probes were manufactured from phthalic acid and APTES–SiO 2. These probes could be used for detecting proteins that targeted phthalic acid and for protein-protein interactions. The phthalic acid chemical probes we produced were incubated with epithelioid cell lysates of normal rat kidney (NRK- 52 E cells) to detect the interactions between phthalic acid and NRK- 52 E extracted proteins. These chemical probes interacted with a number of chaperones such as protein disulfide-isomerase A 6, heat shock proteins, and Serpin H 1. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software showed that these chemical probes were a practical technique for protein-protein interaction analysis...|$|E
40|$|Bisphenol-A (BPA) and <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP) are estrogenic {{compounds}} {{widely used}} in commercial plastic products. Previous {{studies have shown that}} exposure to such compounds have adverse effects on various aspects of mammalian reproduction including folliculogene-sis. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of BPA and DEHP exposure on pri-mordial follicle formation. We found that germ cell nest breakdown and primordial follicle assembly were significantly reduced when new-born mouse ovaries were exposed to 10 or 100 lM BPA and DEHP in vitro. Moreover, BPA and DEHP exposure increased the number of TUNEL positive oocytes and the mRNA level of the pro-apoptotic gene Bax in oocytes. These effects were associated with decreased expres-sion of oocyte specific genes such as LIM homeobox 8 (Lhx 8), factor in the germline alpha (Figla), spermatogenesis and oogenesis helix-loop-helix (Sohlh 2), and newborn ovary homeobox (Nobox). Interestingly, BPA and DEHP exposure also prevented DNA demethyla-tion of CpG sites of the Lhx 8 gene in oocytes, a process normally associated with folliculogen-esis. Finally, folliculogenesis was severely impaired in BPA and DEHP exposed ovaries after transplantation into the kidney capsules of immunodeficient mice. In conclusion, BPA and DEHP exposures impair mouse primordial follicle assembly in vitro. Environ. Mol. Mutagen...|$|E
40|$|<b>Diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP) is {{considered}} to be an endocrine disruptor, which unlike other chemicals that have either non-specific (e. g., narcotics) or more generalized reactive modes of action, affect the Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and tend to have specific interactions with particular molecular targets within biochemical pathways. Responding to this challenge, a novel method for deriving predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) and probabilistic ecological risk assessment (PERAs) for DEHP based on long-term exposure to potentially sensitive species with appropriate apical endpoints was development for protection of Chinese surface waters. PNECs based on potencies to cause lesions in reproductive tissues of fishes, which ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 20 μg DEHP L− 1, were significantly less than those derived based on other endpoints or other taxa, such as invertebrates. An assessment of risks posed by DEHP to aquatic organisms in surface waters of China showed that 88. 17 % and 78. 85 % of surface waters in China were predicted to pose risks to reproductive fitness of fishes with thresholds of protection for aquatic organisms based on 5 % (HC 5) and 10 % (HC 10), respectively. Assessment of risks of effects based on effects mediated by the HPG-axis should consider effects on chronic, non-lethal endpoints for specific taxa, especially for reproductive fitness of fishes...|$|E
40|$|Hepatic {{carnitine}} palmitoyltransferase (CPT) turnover was {{studied in}} control and in non-ketotic hyperglycaemic streptozotocin-diabetic rats. The degradation constant (kd) and half-life (t 1 / 2) {{did not appear to}} be altered by mild diabetes. The hepatic CPT (micrograms/g of liver) was not increased by the mild, non-ketotic, diabetes. However, the total hepatic CPT (micrograms/liver) was 37 % greater in the diabetic animals, owing to the increased liver weight. This resulted from a 40 % increase in the synthesis constant (ks). Hepatic CPT activity (total detergent-solubilized) and translation rates were measured in fed, starved (48 h), non-ketotic diabetic, ketotic diabetic and <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP) -treated rats. CPT activity (m units/mg of mitochondrial protein) was not significantly increased with non-ketotic diabetes (44 % increase, but non-significant), but was increased approx. 2 -fold with starvation and ketotic diabetes, and 3. 5 -fold with DEHP treatment. CPT expressed as units/liver was increased non-significantly (23 %) in non-ketotic and starved rats, similar to the turnover study, but was significantly increased with ketotic diabetes and with DEHP treatment. mRNA-translation activity for CPT was elevated in all states to a somewhat greater extent than was activity. It was concluded that protein synthesis as a product of increased CPT-mRNA translation activity is a major means of long-term regulation...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{assessed}} {{the health risks}} for children exposed to phthalate through several pathways including house dust, surface wipes and hand wipes in child facilities and indoor playgrounds. Methods: The indoor samples were collected from various children’s facilities (40 playrooms, 42 daycare centers, 44 kindergartens, and 42 indoor-playgrounds) in both summer (Jul-Sep, 2007) and winter (Jan-Feb, 2008). Hazard index (HI) was estimated for the non-carcinogens and the examined phthalates were <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP). The present study examined these four kinds of samples, i. e., indoor dust, surface wipes of product and hand wipes. Results: Among the phthalates, the detection rates of DEHP were 98 % in dust samples, 100 % in surface wipe samples, and 95 % in hand wipe samples. In this study, phthalate levels obtained from floor dust, product surface and children’s hand wipe samples were similar to or slightly less compared to previous studies. The 50 th and 95 th percentile value of child-sensitive materials did not exceed 1 (HI) for all subjects in all facilities. Conclusions: For DEHP, DnBP and BBzP their detection rates through multi-routes were high and their risk based on health risk assessment was also observed to be acceptable. This study suggested that ingestion and dermal exposure {{could be the most}} important pathway of phthalates besides digestion through food...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{contaminants}} {{are suspected}} {{to be involved}} in the epidemic incidence of metabolic disorders, food ingestion being a primarily route of exposure. We hypothesized that life-long consumption of a high-fat diet that contains low doses of pollutants will aggravate metabolic disorders induced by obesity itself. Mice were challenged from preconception throughout life with a high-fat diet containing pollutants commonly present in food (2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyl 153, <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> and bisphenol A), added at low doses in the tolerable daily intake range. We measured several blood parameters, glucose and insulin tolerance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and gene expression in adult mice. Pollutant-exposed mice exhibited significant sex-dependent metabolic disorders in the absence of toxicity and weight gain. In males, pollutants increased the expression of hepatic genes (from 36 to 88 %) encoding proteins related to cholesterol biosynthesis and decreased (40 %) hepatic total cholesterol levels. In females, there was a marked deterioration of glucose tolerance, which may be related to the 2 -fold induction of estrogen sulfotransferase and reduced expression of estrogen receptor α (25 %) and estrogen target genes (> 34 %). Because of the very low doses of pollutants used in the mixture, these findings may have strong implications in terms of understanding the potential role of environmental contaminants in food in the development of metabolic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Phthalates are {{ubiquitous}} {{industrial chemicals}} {{that have been}} associated with altered reproductive function in rodents. Several human studies have reported an inverse association between male testosterone and phthalate levels. Our aim was to investigate time to pregnancy (TTP) according to serum levels of <b>diethylhexyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DiNP) metabolites in both partners. In 2002 - 2004 we enrolled 938 pregnant women and 401 male spouses from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine. Six oxidized metabolites of DEHP and DiNP were summarized for each of the two parent compounds to provide proxies of the internal exposure. We used Cox discrete-time models to estimate fecundability ratios (FR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs) for men and women according to their proxy-DEHP or -DiNP serum levels adjusted for a fixed set of covariates. The FR was slightly elevated among women with high levels of DEHP (FR= 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 00; 1. 30) suggesting a shorter TTP in these women. The FR was unrelated to DiNP in women, whereas the results for men were inconsistent pointing in opposite directions. First-time pregnant women from Greenland with high serum DiNP levels had a longer TTP. This study spanning large contrast in environmental exposure does not indicate adverse effects of phthalates on couple fecundity. The shorter TTP in women with high levels of DEHP metabolites is unexplained and needs further investigation...|$|E
