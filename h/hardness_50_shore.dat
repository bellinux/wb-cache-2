The deformation during cutting at the interface between the tool face and workpiece tends to generate high cutting temperature.

In general, the substitution of any D-genome chromosome had a detrimental effect on grain yield and growth vigour (some lines were sterile). SDS-sedimentation, SE-HPLC and two-gram mixograph procedures were used to measure dough strength of the lines studied. Significant correlations were observed between protein concentration and grain yield and other quality parameters such as SDS-sedimentation value, the proportion of glutenin, dough mix time and peak resistance. Most of the quality characters were highly correlated with each other. Substitution of chromosomes 1 D, 5 D, 2 D and 7 D resulted in positive responses to SDS-sedimentation values, but only chromosome 1 D had positive effects on the proportion of peak 1 (P 1 %), measured by SE-HPLC. Besides the major influence of chromosome 1 D on three major mixograph parameters (mixing time, peak resistance and resistance breakdown), chromosome 5 D also exhibited significant effects on these mixing parameters.
