The mitochondrial-encoded cox 1 and plastid-encoded rbcL has been proposed as potential DNA barcodes for rhodophytes, but are yet to be tested on the commercially important carrageenophytes Kappaphycus and Eucheuma. This study gauges the effectiveness of four markers, namely the mitochondrial cox 1, cox 2, cox 2 - 3 spacer and the plastid rbcL in DNA barcoding on selected Kappaphycus and <b>Eucheuma</b> <b>from</b> Southeast Asia. Marker assessments were performed using established distance and tree-based identification criteria from earlier studies. Barcoding patterns on a larger scale were simulated by empirically testing on the commonly used cox 2 - 3 spacer. The phylogeny of these rhodophytes was also briefly described. In this study, the cox 2 marker which satisfies the prerequisites of DNA barcodes was found to exhibit moderately high interspecific divergences with no intraspecific variations, thus a promising marker for the DNA barcoding of Kappaphycus and Eucheuma. However, the already extensively used cox 2 - 3 spacer was deemed to be in overall more appropriate as a DNA barcode for these two genera. On a wider scale, cox 1 and rbcL were still better DNA barcodes across the rhodophyte taxa when practicality and cost-efficiency were taken into account.

40|$|On Indo-Pacific {{coral reefs}} {{rabbitfishes}} (Perciformes, Siganidae) represent {{one of the}} main families of roving herbivorous fishes. Yet their ecology is little-studied and the exact nature and extent of their role in reef ecosystem processes is currently unknown. This thesis examines the trophic and spatial ecology of abundant species of rabbitfish on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia and considers the implications of this ecology for ecosystem function. Variation in the diet, feeding rate, alimentary tract structure and patterns of digestion of two reef-associated species of rabbitfish, Siganus doliatus and Siganus lineatus were examined in relation to ecosystem function. Despite their similar morphology, the two species exhibited distinct feeding behaviours, with significantly different feeding rates, diets and movements of digesta through the alimentary tract. S. doliatus displayed feeding behaviour typical of a diurnal herbivore, taking an average 9. 7 bites min- 1 over {{the main part of the}} feeding day and had a diet dominated by red thallate algae (primarily Laurencia <b>spp.,</b> <b>Eucheuma</b> sp., Halymenia sp, and Gracilaria sp.), and red and green filamentous algae. In contrast, the stomach contents of S. lineatus were dominated by amorphous organic matter (detritus). S. lineatus could not be observed feeding during diurnal hours and the movement of digesta through the gut suggested that S. lineatus was feeding nocturnally or during crepuscular periods. The observed differences in trophic ecology suggest distinct functional roles for these morphologically similar species, with S. doliatus a grazer of reef turf algae and S. lineatus primarily a sucker of detrital aggregates. With underwater observations unable to resolve the location and extent of the functional impact of Siganus lineatus, acoustic telemetry (manual acoustic tracking) was used to investigate the movement patterns and spatial ecology of S. lineatus. This represented the first time such technology had been used with rabbitfish. Over 550 hours of tracking data were collected on the behaviour of 7 individuals: 4 from a reef habitat and 3 individuals living along a mangrove-shoreline habitat. The average home-range area of S. lineatus was found to be 3. 2 ha (± 0. 35 SE) and, within this total, activity was highly concentrated around core areas (average core area of just 0. 39 ± 0. 07 ha). Remarkably, the temporal distribution of activity pattern for individuals from the two habitats was diametrically opposed. Those S. lineatus inhabiting the mangrove-shoreline site foraged during the day over sandy substrata and remained stationary in rest holes during the night, whereas individuals from the reef-based populations foraged only during nocturnal hours over neighbouring sand-aprons, and remained at the edge of favoured coral bommies during the day. This represents the first documented example of a wholesale intraspecific shift in diel activity rhythm for a tropical marine fish. The results suggest that S. lineatus may be an estuarine or dark-water species whose physiological capabilities enable it to feed nocturnally on reefs. This flexibility may simply represent a temporary "masking" effect of external biological stimuli such as predation or competition, or a permanent evolutionary widening of trophic mode that has enabled a species with the ability to feed in dark conditions to expand its habitat range into nocturnal feeding on coral reefs. Either way, the species may have the potential to provide insights into the impact of biological rhythm plasticity on ecosystem functioning at both the ecological and evolutionary level. The spatial ecology of the most abundant rabbitfish on inshore reefs of the GBR, Siganus doliatus, was also explored in a study of its long-term movement patterns. The degree of mobility and site-attachment displayed by the species was investigated relative to other numerically dominant, so-called "roving" herbivorous fishes, the parrotfishes Scarus rivulatus and Chlorurus microrhinos. Using remote acoustic telemetry (passive tracking), movements of individuals of the three species were tracked along a 3 km stretch of fringing reef on the inner GBR over a period of 12 months. Despite differences in their functional ecology and body size, the three species exhibited similarly small home ranges and high levels of site fidelity over the study period. On average, S. doliatus moved along just a 180 m stretch of reef (± 3 m SE), compared to the 220 m (± 10 m) length of reef covered by the excavating parrotfish C. microrhinos and the 225 m (± 2 m) covered by Sc. rivulatus. Analysing the movement patterns of individuals in terms of organisational network theory revealed that all three species exhibited highly directed movements with "ultra small-world" dynamics of the kind that are characteristically vulnerable to targeted attack. Looking at the movements of reef herbivores through the lens of network topography highlights an inherent vulnerability in the overall process of herbivory, one of the key drivers of coral reef health and resilience. Having found that the spatial dynamics and site-attachment of rabbitfishes was similar to other reef herbivores, the question remained as to whether the reef-dwelling algal-feeding species represent an element of functional redundancy on reefs. The feeding behaviour of three rabbitfish species from the clade most closely tied to coral reef habitats: Siganus corallinus, S. puellus and S. vulpinus, was examined in relation to representative species of the two other main families of roving herbivores (the surgeonfishes and parrotfishes). Observations across four sites showed strong evidence of feeding niche separation at small (< 10 cm) spatial scales, with rabbitfishes foraging to a greater degree in reef crevices and interstices. When substratum accessibility (measured as depth of snout penetration) at this micro spatial scale was taken into account, rabbitfishes occupied a broader feeding niche than either parrotfish or surgeonfish and overlap in feeding location between rabbitfishes and the other two families was less than 70...|$|R
