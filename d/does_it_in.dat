500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan.

He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. He <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against him because I didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E
500|$|Many Victorian critics {{appreciated}} {{the emotion of}} the [...] "Lucy poems" [...] and focused on [...] "Strange fits". John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as [...] "powerfully pathetic". In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym [...] "Parson Frank", remarked that [...] "Strange fits" [...] contained [...] "true pathos. We are moved to our soul's centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and obtrusive, and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But he <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> words as few as may be: how intense their beauty!" [...] A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that [...] "Strange fits" [...] had a [...] "deep but subdued and 'silent fervour'".

While he praised the humour, plot and {{character}} development, he was critical of the Teselecta; though they [...] "score high on the sci-fi kitsch factor" [...] they were [...] "anything but memorable". SFX magazine critic Richard Edwards gave [...] "Let's Kill Hitler" [...] five out of five stars, thinking it [...] "has to rank among the cleverest Who episodes Moffat has ever written". While he praised Kingston's performance, he wrote that [...] "it's Matt Smith who steals the show, in one of his finest performances as the Doctor...he's utterly magnificent, whether acting the joker, or living out 32 minutes (ish) of death scene. The mix of optimism...and sadness is a tricky thing to pull off, yet Smith <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a quintessentially Doctor way". Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club graded the episode as a B+, saying that he was [...] "a bit divided". He praised Moffat's River Song arc, which made [...] "the mind ...in a good way", as well as the dialogue and [...] "big concepts". On the other hand, he did not think the Teselecta's mission was developed and [...] "as characters they seem kind of bland".

He made his debut as a substitute in the 66th minute of a 1–0 victory over Hayes & Yeading United on 8 August 2009, which was followed by his first start in a 1–0 defeat to Salisbury City on 11 August due to Liam Dolman not being fit. He played against Tamworth on 31 August 2009 despite an injury and although he was still suffering this injury {{he was able to}} play in the next match, a 2–0 defeat to Eastbourne Borough. Courtney commented in September 2009 that Kidderminster's defence was taking time to gel, saying [...] "We've all played at a high standard, individually and collectively we are good, but there's something missing. I think it's communication between us, which is why we're making mistakes." [...] His first and only goal for Kidderminster came with a low shot at Kettering Town in a 2–0 victory on 21 November 2009 and manager Mark Yates said [...] "It was a good finish by Duane, he <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> training quite often". He played for Kidderminster in their run to the FA Trophy semi-final, in which they were beaten 5–1 on aggregate by Stevenage Borough. Courtney suffered an ankle injury against Cambridge United on 30 March 2010 and returned in the following match against Altrincham on 3 April, in which he was forced to be substituted due to his ankle. He did not miss any further playing time as he featured in the following match, a 1–1 draw with Rushden & Diamonds on 5 April 2010.
