5|$|Izzie {{supports}} Alex when {{he discovers}} his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces {{him to have}} her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully removes a tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the <b>hospital</b> <b>planning</b> Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry {{in front of all}} their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.|$|E
25|$|Her husband {{left his}} {{engineering}} firm and enrolled at Columbia University in 1971 {{with a major}} in <b>hospital</b> <b>planning.</b> It was his master's degree thesis that provided the framework for the Connecticut Hospice. Wald conducted a two-year research program studying how terminally ill patients fared {{at home or in}} a healthcare facility, and tracked how patients and their families felt throughout the process. After returning to the United States, she organized a team of doctors, clergy and nurses to investigate the needs of dying patients. In 1974, she, along with two pediatricians and a Yale medical center chaplain, founded the first hospice in the United States at the Connecticut Hospice, located in Branford, Connecticut. Initially the program provided home care, and had its first inpatient location in 1980, a 44-bed facility in Branford. Disagreements had been brewing within the board about her vision for the hospice program, and she was forced to resign shortly after its opening.|$|E

50|$|From 1857 onwards, Nightingale was {{intermittently}} bedridden {{and suffered}} from depression. A recent biography cites brucellosis and associated spondylitis as the cause. Most authorities today accept that Nightingale {{suffered from a}} particularly extreme form of brucellosis, the effects of which only began to lift in the early 1880s. Despite her symptoms, she remained phenomenally productive in social reform. During her bedridden years, she also did pioneering {{work in the field}} of <b>hospital</b> <b>planning,</b> and her work propagated quickly across Britain and the world. Nightingale's output slowed down considerably in her last decade. She wrote very little during that period due to blindness and declining mental abilities, though she still retained an interest in current affairs.|$|E
50|$|Charles Fulton {{was a key}} {{practitioner}} {{and teacher}} of the modern trends in architectural design in Queensland during the late thirties and forties. The Masel Residence at Stanthorpe (1938), Nudgee Junior College Indooroopilly (1938) and his own residence all received meritorious architecture awards in the early Royal Australian Institute of Architects Queensland Awards Programs. Aside from their domestic work the practice of Donoghue and Fulton was renowned as hospital architects who combined the latest ideas in <b>hospital</b> <b>planning</b> with recent developments in architectural design. The Townsville General Hospital designed between 1935-39 (built 1951), the Kingaroy General Hospital and Nurses' Quarters (1936-38), Goondiwindi Hospital 1939, Roma Hospital 1940, Nurses' Quarters Nambour 1941-42 (demolished 1999) were all buildings designed in this period.|$|E
50|$|Elsa spots {{a member}} of her troupe, Jimmy Darling (Evan Peters), at a local diner. Jimmy expresses his belief that the show's days are {{numbered}} and his desire to {{live a normal life}} away from the freak show. Later at a tupperware party, Jimmy (who has severe ectrodactyly) uses his fingers to pleasure a curious young party-goer. Elsa returns to see the twins and asks them to explain their mother's murder. They first lie and claim that a man broke into their house. Elsa again confronts them at their home after they escape from the <b>hospital,</b> <b>planning</b> to run away. The twins confess to Elsa that their mother kept them captive and when she refused to let them leave the house, Bette stabbed her to death. Two days later, Dot stabbed Bette non-fatally out of guilt at not preventing the murder.|$|E

50|$|The museum {{started when}} Frances Pew Hayes {{received}} a small M&M's teddy bear from a grandchild. After this, she started collecting teddy bears {{and opened the}} museum six years later, in 1990. The collection expanded to around 5,500 individual bears until the museum closed. Many of the bears were donated from private collectors. In the late 1990s, the Museum was sold to the North Collier Hospital, and the <b>hospital</b> <b>planned</b> to relocate the museum to a new location {{as part of a}} new children's <b>hospital.</b> The <b>plan</b> fell through, and the museum was again separated.|$|R
50|$|Then, in 1993, the {{non-profit}} organization Bluegrass Regional Mental Health-Mental Retardation Board, Inc. became {{concerned about the}} possible closing of the hospital. Many states had implemented health care reform that included cost containment and/or cost reduction features that were realized by rapid closing of inpatient facilities. It appeared that Kentucky could soon be faced with too few inpatient options and limited alternatives to inpatient care. Bluegrass Regional MH-MR pursued the possibility of taking over management of the <b>hospital.</b> <b>Planning</b> sessions with consumers and family members, community members, staff, state officials and other concerned parties provided information that was integral {{to the development of}} a hospital management plan. In September 1995, Bluegrass Regional MH-MR took over management of Eastern State Hospital under a contact with the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Negotiations had taken nearly two years and implementation occurred in just over two months.|$|E
50|$|The {{contagious}} disease hospital comprised 17 pavilions, {{connected with a}} center structural corridor. Each pavilion contained separate hospital functions that could be sealed off from each other. Utilizing the principles espoused by Florence Nightingale nearly 50 years prior to its design, the hospital is a mature example of the pavilion style of <b>hospital</b> <b>planning.</b> The pavilions include: eight Measles wards, three isolation wards/ staff quarters, a power house/ sterilizer/ autopsy theater & staff quarters, mortuary, laboratory & staff quarters, administration building/ staff quarters, kitchen, & staff house. Capacity was 450 beds. There were four operating rooms and an elevator in the Administration Building. The autopsy amphitheater which contained an eight-cadaver refrigerator, became a well-known teaching hall, drawing medical observers from teaching hospitals in the United States and Europe. Eventually, the hospital boasted 28 wards, including separate wards for men, women, children, surgery patients, and the insane.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of where}} {{engineering}} management consulting {{might be used}} include developing and leading a company wide business transformation initiative, or designing and implementing a new product development process, designing and implementing a manufacturing engineering process, including an automated assembly workstation. Management engineers may specialize in the acquisition and implementation of Computer aided design (CAD), Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and Computer-aided engineering (CAE) applications. Services may include strategizing for various operational logistics, new product introductions, or consulting as an efficiency expert. It may include using management science techniques {{to develop a new}} financial algorithm or loan system for a bank, streamlining operation and emergency room location or usage in a <b>hospital,</b> <b>planning</b> complex distribution schemes for materials or products (referred to as Supply Chain Management), and shortening lines (or queues) at a bank, hospital, or a theme park. Management engineering consultants typically use computer simulation (especially discrete event simulation), along with extensive mathematical tools and modeling and computational methods for system analysis, evaluation, and optimization.|$|E
