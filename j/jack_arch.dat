50|$|Unlike regular arches, jack arches are not semicircular in form. Instead, {{they are}} flat in profile {{and are used}} under the same {{circumstances}} as lintels. Unlike lintels, which are subject to bending stress, jack arches are composed of individual masonry elements cut or formed into a wedge shape that efficiently uses the compressive strength of the masonry {{in the same manner}} as a regular arch. Like regular arches, jack arches require a mass of masonry to either side to absorb the considerable lateral thrust created by the <b>jack</b> <b>arch.</b>|$|E

At each end of the abutment is an ornamental square open tower, the brickwork of which is faced with stone from Heddon Quarries near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The viaduct was designed by engineer for the line John Urpeth Rastrick in association with the architect of the London to Brighton railway, David Mocatta. It has been described as [...] "probably the most elegant viaduct in Britain." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Palandomus {{invented in}} 1919 by {{architect}} Mario Palanti, {{consists of a}} cement block of 18x18x36cm made with the vibration system, {{to serve as the}} cellular element of construction, being designed with a particular shape [...] "hermaphrodite", which allows placement in any sense, without the constraints of location if not horizontal. In fact the thin ledge, ribs protrusion allow to leave the walls without plaster, but at the same time, ensure the maximum bonding of the elements. The Palandomus is sufficient to withstand up to safety limit of 70 meters in elevation, allowing, without special precautions, the installation of <b>jack</b> <b>arch</b> to openings doors and windows and of dry archivolt.|$|E
50|$|Box jacking {{is similar}} to pipe jacking, but instead of jacking tubes, a {{box-shaped}} tunnel is used. Jacked boxes can be a much larger span than a pipe jack, with the span of some box jacks in excess of 20 m. A cutting head is normally used {{at the front of}} the box being jacked, and spoil removal is normally by excavator from within the box.Recent developments of the <b>Jacked</b> <b>Arch</b> and <b>Jacked</b> deck have enabled longer and larger structures to be installed to close accuracy. The 126m long 20m clear span underpass below the high speed rail lines at Cliffsend in Kent, UK.|$|R
50|$|The {{fenestration}} plays a {{major role}} in determining the feeling of the facade. The windows are unusually large for the period, some measuring over 6 ft square. The variety of sash types, including 16/1, add to the richness of the design. Consoles and metal ornamentation provide additional embellishment. The consoles are two types - metal under the projecting cornice and limestone above the windows. The Former are decorated with deeply chased acanthus leaves. The latter are classical in style and serve as the keystones in the <b>jack</b> <b>arches</b> above the windows. Other decorative metal details include four types of molding (dentil, egg and dart, ogee, and plain), a large floral frieze, and chamfered metal panels.|$|R
50|$|From 1913 {{until the}} 1927 {{opening of the}} Holland Tunnel, Pershing Road was a {{component}} of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway in the United States. The bridge {{at the foot of the}} road, comprising <b>jack</b> <b>arches,</b> was built in 1927, originally crossing over the West Shore Railroad, later Conrail's River Line, and now the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. A broad public stairway known as the Grauert Causeway met the road at the base of the cliff at a viaduct crossing over a rail right of way.Now abandoned, it has been replaced by a metal stairwell structure which connects to the Port Imperial station. Pershing Road Park along the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is near the foot of the road.|$|R
50|$|Major {{repairs to}} the bridge were {{conducted}} in 1950 and 1974. The timber fenders at the swing-span piers have been reconstructed several times. In 1950 the original concrete <b>jack</b> <b>arch</b> deck was replaced with a reinforced slab and the stringers were encased. In 1974 the truss lower chord was reinforced for its full length, plates were added at the bottom flanges of the end floor beams, and new stringer seat angle connections were added at the floor beams. While the original decorative metal railings were left intact on the approach spans, chain-link fences were placed along the sidewalks on the swing span. While the bridge once had a load-carrying capacity of 20 tons, it was later limited to 3 tons because of rust and corrosion.|$|E
50|$|The Charles Franks House is a {{historic}} house located at 34431 U.S. Route 52 east of Lanark, Illinois. The house was built circa 1950 by Charles Franks, a prominent settler and local landowner. The site of the house had previously been home to Isaac Chambers' tavern and stagecoach stop on the Galena Road; the tavern also became a shelter for troops and a target for warring Native Americans in the Black Hawk War. The house's design is a vernacular implementation of the Federal style, which was prevalent in the United States earlier in the 19th century but had faded from popularity by 1850. While the house features the style's typical hipped roof and <b>jack</b> <b>arch</b> lintels above the windows, it is smaller than most Federal houses and is missing characteristic decorations such as a fanlight above the front door.|$|E
50|$|The Halone House {{reflects}} Alex Halone's artistry in stonework, with {{a variety}} of fanciful masonry treatments. At its core, the house is an approximately square two-story house, built in square sandstone, with a hipped roof. To the front, a porch has been added in very rough travertine stone with a rubble <b>jack</b> <b>arch</b> over the front door. A garage flanks the porch to the left. On {{the east side of the}} house is a stacked and squared chimney extending the height of the first floor, supporting an enclosed balcony. The flue extends between two windows from the main house looking on top the balcony. From the top of the balcony rises a tapering stucco flue studded with rubble. The rear of the house is capped by a second-story addition, clad in shingles. The west side is rough in appearance and was apparently considered a secondary elevation.|$|E
50|$|Architecturally, the Jolly Miller Tavern {{evoked the}} Georgian Survival {{style of the}} 19th century {{buildings}} in Ontario. Constructed of red brick, laid in a common bond pattern, it measures 2½ storeys high {{and is based on}} a rectangular plan. It features a high-pitched gabled roof with boxed eaves. Generous amounts of wall space in relation {{to the size of the}} windows can be noted on most elevations. Elements such as the plinth, belt courses, quoins, <b>jack</b> <b>arches,</b> and ornate pendant frieze (east elevation) are highlighted in buff-coloured brick. The south wall is intact as are the north, east and west walls above the ground floor level. The historic portion of the building has a rubblestone foundation that provides a basement under the west half of the building.|$|R
50|$|The Village Hall is a {{historic}} government building located at 239 South Main Street in Sheffield, Illinois. The building was constructed in 1910 to replace the village's original village hall, which was built in 1887 but had become {{too small for the}} village. Architect George Franklin Barber designed the building; while Barber was nationally known for his mail-order residential designs, the Village Hall was one of his only municipal works. Barber's design used Neoclassical elements extensively, including limestone columns flanking the entrance, a cornice and entablature along the roof line, <b>jack</b> <b>arches</b> on the first-story windows, and Roman grilles above the entrance and second-story windows. The building also features a Romanesque arch surrounding the main entrance and Victorian massing in its central bell tower.|$|R
50|$|This {{building}} lies to {{the west}} of Durbar Hall and opposite to the coffee shop. This is a colonial building, built in 1853 (as per MES records-date of purchase/date of erection), which was used for the treatment and purification of water by chlorination. It is built next to a Sikh period well, which was used as a chlorinating tank. It has two rooms, one of which has a circular pit to house chlorination apparatus (a myth, however, holds it to be a Phasi ghar— hanging place). The structure also has a water tank mounted on the terrace, as part of the water treatment equipment. The building is constructed with modular bricks in mud mortar having cement concrete flooring and terraced on <b>jack</b> <b>arches.</b>|$|R
