40|$|Heterologous {{combinations}} of DNA prime and viral boost immunizations elicit immune responses against {{different types of}} tumors and infectious diseases. Robust cellular immune responses mediating antitumor efficacy are produced following various DNA + virus prime-boost immunization regimens. However, mechanisms underlying this synergy remain incompletely defined. Here, we utilized the colorectal cancer (CRC) associated antigen guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY 2 C) to explore the synergy of <b>DNA-Ad</b> 5 (adenovirus type 5) prime-boost immunizations. GUCY 2 C is selectively expressed on the apical surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells and CRC cells through all stages of tumorigenesis. The compartmentalized expression of GUCY 2 C, normally in the mucosa but extending systemically in metastases, makes GUCY 2 C a target for CRC immunotherapy. In previous studies, Ad 5 expressing GUCY 2 C (Ad 5 -GUCY 2 C) was a safe and effective vaccine in mice. However, it cannot be employed in homologous prime-boost immunization regimens due to Ad 5 vector-specific immunity. Therefore, heterologous prime-boost strategies {{may be required to}} maximize antitumor efficacy targeting GUCY 2 C in CRC. In that context, DNA vaccines not only elicit both cellular and humoral immunity and but also are advantageous in heterologous prime-boost strategies due to their lack of vector-specific immunity. However, low transfection rates and poor immunogenicity restrict the utility of DNA vaccine strategies. Here, plasmids expressing CCL 20 and CCL 21 as chemokine adjuvants to recruit dendritic cells and naïve T cells were used to increase DNA vaccine immunogenicity. Further, electroporation (EP) of GUCY 2 C-expressing plasmids increased transfection rates, optimizing GUCY 2 C immune responses. Heterologous prime-boost regimens of DNA vaccine and Ad 5 vaccine not only elicited robust primary and memory immune responses, but also produced curative antitumor responses, compared to each immunization alone and other combination regimens. Interestingly, DNA priming followed by Ad 5 boosting (<b>DNA-Ad</b> 5) produced only a modest increase (3 ̆c 2 -fold) in the magnitude of GUCY 2 C-specific CD 8 + T cell responses without significant changes in polyfunctionality, compared to other immunizations. However, <b>DNA-Ad</b> 5 dramatically improved target sensitivity of GUCY 2 C-specific CD 8 + T cells by increasing T cell receptor (TCR) functional avidity (∼ 20 -fold). Thus, enhanced CD 8 + T cell functional avidity, rather than CD 8 + T cell quantity or polyfunctionality, mediated antitumor efficacy of <b>DNA-Ad</b> 5 in CRC. The synergistic GUCY 2 C <b>DNA-Ad</b> 5 prime-boost strategy inducing robust CD 8 + T cell responses and anti-CRC activity may be translated to patients at risk for metastatic CRC. ...|$|R

5000|$|These are plant viruses {{which have}} {{single-stranded}} circular DNA genomes encoding genes that diverge {{in both directions}} from a virion strand origin of replication (i.e. geminivirus genomes are ambisense). According to the Baltimore classification, they {{are considered to be}} class II viruses. The genome can either be a single component between 2500 and 3100 nucleotides, or, in the case of some begomoviruses, two similar-sized components each between 2600 and 2800 nucleotides. They have elongated, geminate capsids with two incomplete T=1 icosahedra joined at the missing vertex. The capsids range in size from 18-20 nm in diameter with a length of about 30 nm.Geminiviruses constitute a large family of phytopathogens (Geminiviridae). The family geminiviridae have been classified into four genera, namely Begomovirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus and Mastrevirus, depending on their genomes, mode of transmission and host range. Geminiviridae are transmitted by white flies, scientifically known as Bamesia tabacci. The genus begomoviridae generally comprises bipartite (two components, namely DNA- ‘A’ and ‘B’) genome, which replicates via rolling circle (RCR) model with the help of few viral and several host factors. Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) is a representative of the genus begomovirus / Begomoviridae, which is prevalent in northern part of Indian subcontinent causing yellow mosaic disease (YMD). MYMIV possesses bipartite ssDNA genomes named as <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B, both being ~2.7 kb in size. Both components share a common region (CR) of about 200 bp containing the important cis-elements for viral DNA transcription and rolling circle replication (RCR).|$|E

40|$|Most whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses possess bipartite DNA genomes, {{and this}} feature may {{facilitate}} viral evolution through pseudorecombination and/or recombination. To test this hypothesis, the <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B {{components of the}} geminiviruses bean dwarf mosaic virus (BDMV) and tomato mottle virus (ToMoV) were exchanged, and the resultant pseudorecombinants were serially passaged through plants. Both pseudorecombinants were infectious in Nicotiana benthamiana but induced attenuated symptoms and had reduced DNA-B levels. Serial passage experiments revealed that the BDMV <b>DNA-A</b> plus ToMoV DNA-B pseudorecombinant could not be maintained beyond three passages. In contrast, the ToMoV <b>DNA-A</b> plus BDMV DNA-B pseudorecombinant was maintained during serial passage through N. benthamiana and Phaseolus vulgaris and, after three to five passages, became highly pathogenic.

40|$|Abstract Background Viruses of {{the genus}} Begomovirus (family Geminiviridae) have genomes {{consisting}} of either one or two genomic components. The component of bipartite begomoviruses known as <b>DNA-A</b> is homologous to the genomes of all geminiviruses and encodes proteins required for replication, control of gene expression, overcoming host defenses, encapsidation and insect transmission. The second component, referred to as DNA-B, encodes two proteins with functions in intra- and intercellular movement in host plants. The origin of the DNA-B component remains unclear. The study described here was initiated to investigate {{the relationship between the}} <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components of bipartite begomoviruses with a view to unraveling their evolutionary histories and providing information on the possible origin of the DNA-B component. Results Comparative phylogenetic and exhaustive pairwise sequence comparison of all <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components of begomoviruses demonstrates that the two molecules have very distinct molecular evolutionary histories and likely are under very different evolutionary pressures. The analysis highlights that component exchange has played a far greater role in diversification of begomoviruses than previously suspected, although there are distinct differences in the apparent ability of different groups of viruses to utilize this "sexual" mechanism of genetic exchange. Additionally we explore the hypothesis that DNA-B originated as a satellite that was captured by the monopartite progenitor of all extant bipartite begomoviruses and subsequently evolved to become the integral (essential) genome component that we recognize today. The situation with present-day satellites associated with begomoviruses provides some clues to the processes and selection pressures that may have led to the "domestication" of a wild progenitor of the DNA-B component. Conclusions The analysis has highlighted the greater genetic variation of DNA-B components, in comparison to the <b>DNA-A</b> components, and that component exchange is more widespread than previously demonstrated and confined to viruses from the Old World. Although the vast majority of New World and some Old World begomoviruses show near perfect co-evolution of the <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components, {{this is not the case}} for the majority of Old World viruses. Genetic differences between Old and New World begomoviruses and the cultivation of exotic crops in the Old World are likely factors that have led to this dichotomy. </p...|$|E
40|$|A virus (HY 12) {{isolated}} from honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica Thunb.) collected in Kobe, Hyogo prefecture, Japan, showing symptoms of yellow vein mosaic, was characterized. HY 12 was transmitted to Nicotiaua benthamiana by sap inoculation {{while the other}} honeysuckle isolates could not. The complete <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA- ~ like molecules of the isolate were deter-mined and found to comprise 2763 and 1262 nucleotides (nt), respectively, with a typical bego-movirus genome organization. The DNA ~ molecule had the conserved ORF (~ C 1) and satellite conserved region (SCR) typical of the Geminiviridae family containing a 5 '-TMTATTAC- 3 ' motif in the stem loop and the adenine-(A) rich region. Additionally, its entire sequence was interrupted at intervals wlth sequences that were not viral and whose ori-gin was unknown. A comparison of the <b>DNA-A</b> sequences revealed that HY 12 shared 740 / 0 with four other honeysuckle begomoviruses but 88 - 890 / 0 with tobacco begomoviruses found in Japan. The isolate shared up to 920 / 0 of the IR sequences with the honeysuckle begomoviruses but only 60 - 880 / 0 with those of tobacco.

40|$|Background: Viruses of {{the genus}} Begomovirus (family Geminiviridae) have genomes {{consisting}} of either one or two genomic components. The component of bipartite begomoviruses known as <b>DNA-A</b> is homologous to the genomes of all geminiviruses and encodes proteins required for replication, control of gene expression, overcoming host defenses, encapsidation and insect transmission. The second component, referred to as DNA-B, encodes two proteins with functions in intra- and intercellular movement in host plants. The origin of the DNA-B component remains unclear. The study described here was initiated to investigate {{the relationship between the}} <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components of bipartite begomoviruses with a view to unraveling their evolutionary histories and providing information on the possible origin of the DNA-B component. Results: Comparative phylogenetic and exhaustive pairwise sequence comparison of all <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components of begomoviruses demonstrates that the two molecules have very distinct molecular evolutionary histories and likely are under very different evolutionary pressures. The analysis highlights that component exchange has played a far greater role in diversification of begomoviruses than previously suspected, although there are distinct differences in the apparent ability of different groups of viruses to utilize this “sexual ” mechanism of genetic exchange. Additionally we explore the hypothesis that DNA-B originated as a satellite that was capture...|$|E
40|$|Sunflower leaf curl disease {{caused by}} begomovirus {{is one of}} the newly {{emerging}} viral diseases in Nothern Karnataka, Southern India. The disease has attracted lot of attention of the pathologists, as it affects the productivity of sunflower an important oilseed crop in the country. The present study was conducted to characterize the begomovirus causing sunflower leaf curl disease by cloning and sequencing the major genomic components. The Complete <b>DNA-A</b> and betasatellite components of begomovirus isolated from sunflower leaf tissue infected with leaf curl virus collected from Main Agricultural Research Station, Raichur, Karnataka, India was cloned and sequenced. The virus contained the <b>DNA-A</b> and the associated satellite beta DNA components of 2761 and 1373 nucleotides (nt) in length, respectively. The <b>DNA-A</b> molecule shared maximum identity with tomato leaf curl karnataka virus clone IKH 12 (ToLCKV-[IKH 12]) (HM 803118) (97. 13 %) and clone IKB 3 (ToLCKV-[IKB 3]) (HM 851186) (96. 95 %) from India. The betasatellite shared a high nucleotide identity (93. 6 - 94. 07 %) with Potato apical leaf curl betasatellite (PoLCB-[IN-CHI: 05]) and Papaya leaf curl betasatellite (PaLCuB-[IN-CHI: 05]) associated with tomato leaf curl disease from India.

40|$|The genome {{components}} of the Melon chlorotic leaf curl virus (MCLCuV) were cloned from symptomatic cantaloupe leaves collected in Guatemala during 2002. The MCLCuV <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components shared their closest nucleotide identities among begomoviruses, at ∼ 90 and 81 %, respectively, with a papaya isolate of MCLCuV from Costa Rica. The closest relatives at the species level were {{other members of the}} Squash leaf curl virus (SLCV) clade, which is endemic in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Biolistic inoculation of cantaloupe seedlings with the MCLCuV <b>DNA-A</b> and -B components resulted in the development of characteristic disease symptoms, providing definitive evidence of causality. MCLCuV experimentally infected species within the Cucurbitaceae, Fabaceae, and Solanaceae. The potential for interspecific reassortment was examined for MCLCuV and its closest relatives, including the bean-restricted Bean calico mosaic virus (BCaMV), and three other cucurbit-infecting species, Cucurbit leaf crumple virus (CuLCrV), SLCV, and SMLCV. The cucurbit viruses have distinct but overlapping host ranges. All possible reassortants were established using heterologous combinations of the <b>DNA-A</b> or DNA-B components. Surprisingly, only certain reassortants arising from MCLCuV and BCaMV, or MCLCuV and CuLCrV, were viable in bean, even though it is a host of all of the “wild-type” (parent) viruses. The bean-restricted BCaMV was differentially assisted in systemically infecting the cucurbit test species by the {{components of}} the four cucurbit-adapted begomoviruses. In certain heterologous combinations, the BCaMV <b>DNA-A</b> or -B component was able to infect one or more cucurbit species. Generally, the reassortants were less virulent in the test hosts than the respective wild-type (parent) viruses, strongly implicating adaptive modulation of virulence. This is the first illustration of reassortment resulting in the host range expansion of a host-restricted begomovirus...|$|E

40|$|Samples of Emilia sonchifolia leaves showing con-spicuous yellow veins were {{collected}} in the Chinese province of Fujian. A specific 500 bp product was con-sistently amplified from total DNA extracts from symp-tomatic leaves with universal primers designed to ampli-fy portions of the intergenic region and AV 2 gene of be-gomoviral <b>DNA-A</b> component. Comparison of partial DNA sequences revealed that these samples were in-fected by the same virus, thus an isolate denoted Fz 1 was selected for further sequence analysis. The com-plete sequence of Fz 1 comprised 2725 nucleotides with typical genomic organization of begomoviral <b>DNA-A.</b> Fz 1 was most closely related to Vernonia yellow vein virus (VeYVV-[IN:Mad: 05], AM 182232), with 76. 7 % nucleotide sequence identity.

40|$|Abstract Background Begomoviruses {{have emerged}} as serious problem for {{vegetable}} and fiber crops in the recent past, frequently in tropical and subtropical region of the world. The association of begomovirus with eggplant yellow mosaic disease is hitherto unknown apart from one report from Thailand. A survey in Nagpur, Central India, in 2009 - 2010 showed severe incidence of eggplant yellow mosaic disease. Here, we have identified and characterized a begomovirus responsible for the newly emerging yellow mosaic disease of eggplant in India. Results The complete <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B genomic components of the causative virus were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis of <b>DNA-A</b> showed that it shared highest 97. 6 % identity with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus -India[India:Udaipur:Okra: 2007] and lowest 87. 9 % identity with Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus -India[India:NewDelhi:Papaya: 2005], while DNA-B showed highest 94. 1 % identity with ToLCNDV-IN[IN:UD:Ok: 07] and lowest 76. 2 % identity with ToLCNDV-India[India:Lucknow]. Thus, it appears that this begomovirus is a variant of ubiquitous ToLCNDV and hence, we suggest the name ToLCNDV-India[India:Nagpur:Eggplant: 2009] for this variant. The pathogenicity of ToLCNDV-IN[IN:Nag:Egg: 09] isolate was confirmed by agroinfiltraion and dimeric clones of <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B induced characteristic yellow mosaic symptoms in eggplants and leaf curling in tomato plants. Conclusion This is the first report of a ToLCNDV variant moving to a new agriculturally important host, eggplant and causing yellow mosaic disease. This is also a first experimental demonstration of Koch's postulate for a begomovirus associated with eggplant yellow mosaic disease. </p...|$|E
40|$|Hibiscus leaf curl disease (HLCuD) occurs {{widely in}} India. Infected {{hibiscus}} plants show vein thickening, upward curling {{of leaves and}} enations on the abaxial leaf surface, reduction in leaf size and stunting. The commonly occurring weeds (Ageratum conyzoides, Croton bonplandianum and Euphorbia geniculata), Nicotiana benthamiana, Nicotiana glutinosa and Nicotiana tabacum (var. Samsun, Xanthi), cotton and tomato were shown to be susceptible to HLCuD. One of the four species of hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis) and 75 of the 101 commercial hybrids/varieties grown in the Bangalore area of southern India were also susceptible. Two virus isolates associated with HLCuD from Bangalore, South India (Ban), and Bhubaneswar, North India (Bhu), were detected serologically and by PCR-mediated amplification of virus genomes. The isolates were characterised by sequencing a fragment of <b>DNA-A</b> component (1288 nucleotides) and an associated satellite DNA molecule of 682 nucleotides. Phylogenetic analyses of these <b>DNA-A</b> sequences clustered them with Old World cotton-infecting begomoviruses and closest to Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMV) at 95 – 97 % <b>DNA-A</b> nucleotide identities. The 682 -nucleotide satellite DNA molecules associated with the HLCuD samples Ban and Bhu shared 96. 9 % sequence identity {{with each other and}} maximum identity (93. 1 – 93. 9 % over positions 158 – 682) with; 1350 -nucleotide DNA-b satellite molecules associated with cotton leaf curl disease in Pakistan and India (accession nos AJ 298903, AJ 316038). HLCuD in India, therefore, appears to be associated with strains of CLCuMV, a cotton-infecting begomovirus from Pakistan, which is transmitted in a persistent manner by Bemisia tabac...|$|E
40|$|Three {{isolates}} of the bipartite begomovirus Pepper golden mosaic virus (PepGMV) {{were characterized}} for genomic and biological properties. The complete nucleotide sequences of the <b>DNA-A</b> and DNA-B components were determined from infectious clones of PepGMV-Serrano (PepGMV-Ser), PepGMV-Mosaic (PepGMV-Mo), and PepGMV-Distortion (PepGMV-D). Nucleotide sequence identity among PepGMV components ranged from 91 to 96 % for <b>DNA-A</b> and from 84 to 99 % for DNA-B, with each PepGMV component most {{closely related to}} the corresponding component of Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCV). However, phylogenetic relationships among begomovirus components were incongruent because <b>DNA-A</b> of PepGMV and CaLCV share an inferred evolutionary history distinct from that of DNA-B. The cloned components of PepGMV-Ser, -Mo, and -D were infectious by biolistic inoculation to pepper but differed in symptom expression: PepGMV-Ser exhibited a bright golden mosaic, PepGMV-Mo produced a yellow-green mosaic, and PepGMV-D caused only a mild mosaic and foliar distortion followed by a “recovery” phenotype in which leaves developing after initial symptom expression appeared normal. Differences in symptoms also were observed on tomato, tobacco, and Datura stramonium. Progeny virus derived from clones of PepGMV-Ser and -Mo were transmitted from pepper to pepper by the B biotype of Bemisia tabaci; progeny virus derived from PepGMV-D clones was not transmissible by the B biotype. Reassortant genomes derived from heterologous DNA components of the three isolates were infectious in all possible pairwise combinations, with symptom phenotype in pepper determined by the DNA-B component. Collectively, these results indicate that the three virus isolates examined may be considered distinct strains of PepGMV that have the capacity to exchange genetic material...|$|E
40|$|Bean golden mosaic geminivirus (BGMV) causes major {{losses on}} beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) in the {{tropical}} and subtropical Americas and the Caribbean Basin. Infectious <b>DNA-A</b> and -B components of BGMV isolates from the Dominican Republic (BGMV-DR) and Guatemala (BGMV-GA) were sequenced, and their genome organizations {{were similar to those}} of other whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses from the Western Hemisphere. Whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) transmitted BGMV from beans infected by particle-gun inoculation with clones of BGMV-DR or -GA. Infectious pseudorecombinants gave symptoms typical of wild-type infections when mixtures of BGMV-GA <b>DNA-A</b> and BGMV-DR DNA-B were used. Delayed and attenuated symptoms were obtained when mixtures of BGMV-DR <b>DNA-A</b> and BGMV-GA DNA-B were used. Phylogenetic analyses using the common region and four open reading frames placed 20 geminiviruses in eight clusters for the Western Hemisphere and at least five clusters for the Eastern Hemisphere viruses. BGMV-DR and -GA are in the BGMV type II cluster with the BGMV isolate from Puerto Rico. The BGMV type II cluster is clearly distinct from the BGMV type I cluster, which contains the BGMV isolate from Brazil. Bean dwarf mosaic geminivirus is in the Abutilon mosaic virus cluster, and bean calico mosaic geminivirus is in the squash leaf curl geminivirus cluster. Conserved nucleotide sequences of the common regions of members of these clusters were identified, and the presence of amino acid motifs with putative functions were identified in the derived amino acid sequences of the replication-associated proteins of BGMV-DR and -GA. The availability of sequenced, infectious clones of BGMV-DR and -GA provides opportunities for the study of genome functions and for the engineering of beans for resistance to these viruses.
