5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) {{standing}} in front of the funeral pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Monier, a French {{gardener}} {{and known}} {{to be one of}} the principal inventors of reinforced concrete, was granted a patent for reinforced flowerpots by means of mixing a wire mesh to a mortar shell. In 1877, Monier was granted another patent for a more advanced technique of reinforcing concrete columns and girders with iron rods placed in a grid pattern. Though Monier undoubtedly knew reinforcing concrete would improve its inner cohesion, it is less known if he even <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> reinforcing actually improved concrete's tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of Venona decryption became {{known to the}} Soviets {{within a few years}} of the first breaks. It is not clear whether the Soviets <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of the message traffic or which messages had been successfully decrypted. At least one Soviet penetration agent, British Secret Intelligence Service representative to the U.S. Kim Philby, was told about the project in 1949, as part of his job as liaison between British and U.S. intelligence. Since all of the duplicate one-time pad pages had been used by this time, the Soviets apparently did not make any changes to their cryptographic procedures after they learned of Venona. However, this information allowed them to alert those of their agents who might be at risk of exposure due to the decryption.|$|E

25|$|Flaccus was a {{perceptive}} politician, {{who looked}} for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato's martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. He <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. He {{also knew that}} distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Finally, Flaccus knew too that for a stranger like Cato, {{the only way to}} the magisterial honors was success in the Roman Forum. For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the fruitful field of Roman politics. The advice was keenly followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy.|$|E

500|$|As September {{passed into}} October {{it became clear}} that Clinton was not coming to help Burgoyne, who put the army on short rations on October 3. The next day, Burgoyne called a war council in which several options were discussed, but no {{conclusive}} decisions were made. When the council resumed the next day, Riedesel proposed retreat, in which he was supported by Fraser. Burgoyne refused to consider it, insisting that retreat would be disgraceful. They finally agreed to conduct an assault on the American left flank with two thousand men, {{more than one-third of the}} army, on October 7. [...] The army he was attacking, however, had grown in the interval. [...] In addition to the return of Lincoln's detachment, militiamen and supplies continued to pour into the American camp, including critical increases in ammunition, which had been severely depleted in the first battle. The army Burgoyne faced on October 7 was more than 12,000 men strong and was led by a man who <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> trouble Burgoyne was in. Gates had received consistent intelligence from the stream of deserters leaving the British lines and had also intercepted Clinton's response to Burgoyne's plea for help.|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. While analyzing [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] and [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that [...] "their titles suggesting vulgarity, their execution flinty and knowing," [...] and also picked [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{as one of}} the album's highlights. Kitty Empire of The Guardian noted that the songs on Rebel Heart with the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the title [...] "bode well", expressing that [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] is even better than [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", where [...] "Diplo lays Madonna down over some dancehall. Santigold was doing similar things in ’08, but the method remains sound." [...] Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club also noticed that it [...] "resembles watered-down Santigold." [...] Amy Pettifer of The Quietus applauded the line, [...] "you never really <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you loved me till you lost me", calling it [...] "the killer nugget of this track," [...] which she labelled [...] "icked good," [...] while Time's Jamieson Cox thought that it was [...] "fun to hear Madonna deliver a line like, 'It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is' because she has three’ decades worth of unapologetic bitchiness in her back pocket. It’s an easy score, sure, but it’s effective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy called it [...] "brilliant", while Lee DeVito [...] of Metro Times called it [...] "one of the more enjoyable tracks" [...] on the album.|$|E

2500|$|Kubrick {{had already}} written a {{detailed}} treatment, and Kubrick and Herr got together at Kubrick's home every day, {{breaking down the}} treatment into scenes. From that, Herr wrote the first draft. The filmmaker worried that the book's title might be misread by audiences as referring to people who only did half a day's work and changed it to Full Metal Jacket after discovering the phrase while going through a gun catalogue. After the first draft was completed, Kubrick phoned in his orders, and Hasford and Herr mailed their submissions to him. Kubrick read and edited them, and then the team repeated the process. Neither Hasford nor Herr <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he had contributed to the screenplay, {{which led to a}} dispute over the final credits. Hasford remembers, [...] "We were like guys on an assembly line in the car factory. I was putting on one widget and Michael was putting on another widget and Stanley {{was the only one who}} knew that this was going to end up being a car."

2500|$|Rabbi Isaac {{taught that}} when a king administers an oath to his legions, he does so with a sword, {{implying}} that whoever transgressed the oath would have the sword pass over his neck. Similarly, at Sinai, as [...] reports, [...] "Moses took half of the blood" [...] (thus adjuring them with the blood). The Midrash asked how Moses <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> was half of the blood. Rabbi Judah bar Ila'i taught that the blood divided itself into halves on its own. Rabbi Nathan said that its appearance changed; half of it turned black, and half remained red. Bar Kappara told that an angel in the likeness of Moses came down and divided it. Rabbi Isaac taught that a Heavenly Voice came from Mount Horeb, saying that this much is half of the blood. Rabbi Ishmael taught in a Baraita that Moses was expert in the regulations relating to blood, and by means of that knowledge divided it. [...] goes on to say, [...] "And {{he put it in}} basins ( [...] , aganot)." [...] Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Avin that [...] writes the word in a form that might be read aganat ("basin," [...] singular) indicating that neither basin was larger than the other. Moses asked God what to do with God's portion. God told Moses to sprinkle it on the people. ( [...] reports, [...] "And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people.") Moses asked what he should do with the Israelites' portion. God said to sprinkle it on the altar, as [...] says, [...] "And half of the blood he dashed against the altar." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rav Bardela bar Tabyumi {{taught in}} Rav's name that to whomever [...] "hiding of the face" [...] {{does not apply}} {{is not one of}} the Children of Israel, and to whomever [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] does not apply is also not one of them. The Rabbis confronted Rava, saying [...] "hiding of the face" [...] and [...] "they shall be devoured" [...] did not apply to Rava. Rava asked the Rabbis whether they <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he was forced to send {{secretly}} to the Court of King Shapur of Persia. Even so, the Rabbis directed their eyes upon Rava in suspicion. Meanwhile, the Court of King Shapur sent men who seized Rava's property. Rava then said that this bore out what Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel taught, that wherever the Rabbis direct their eyes in suspicion, either death or poverty follows. Interpreting [...] "I will hide My face," [...] Rava taught that God said although God would hide God's face from them, God would nonetheless speak to them in a dream. Rav Joseph taught that God's hand is nonetheless stretched over us to protect us, as [...] says, [...] "And I have covered you in the shadow of My hand." [...] Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania was once at the Roman emperor Hadrian's court, when an unbeliever gestured to Rabbi Joshua in sign language that the Jewish people was a people from whom their God had turned His face. Rabbi Joshua ben Hanania gestured in reply that God's hand was stretched over the Jewish people. Emperor Hadrian asked Rabbi Joshua what unbeliever had said. Rabbi Joshua told the emperor what unbeliever had said and what Rabbi Joshua had replied. They then asked the unbeliever what he had said, and he told them. And then they asked what Rabbi Joshua had replied, and the unbeliever did not know. They decreed that a man who does not understand what he is being shown by gesture should hold converse in signs before the emperor, and they led him forth and executed him for his disrespect to the emperor.|$|E
