40|$|This report {{describes}} a pressure-measuring device especially adapted {{for use in}} mapping indicator diagrams of high-speed internal combustion engines. The cards are obtained by a point-to-point method giving the average {{of a large number}} of engine cycles. The principle involved is the balancing of the engine cylinder pressure against a measured pressure on the opposite side of the metal a diaphragm of negligible stiffness. In its application as an engine indicator the phase of the engine cycle to which a pressure measurement corresponds is selected by a timing device. The report discusses briefly the errors which must be avoided in the development of an indicator for light high-speed engines, where vibration is serious, and outlines the principles underlying the design of this instrument in order to be free of such errors. A detailed description of the <b>instrument</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> follows together with operating directions...|$|R

50|$|NACA Report 107 {{describes}} a pressure-measuring device that was adapted {{for use in}} mapping indicator diagrams of high-speed internal combustion engines. The cards are obtained by a point-to-point method giving the average {{of a large number}} of engine cycles. The principle involved is the balancing of the engine cylinder pressure against a measured pressure on opposite sides of a metal diaphragm of negligible stiffness. In its application as an engine indicator the phase of the engine cycle to which a pressure measurement corresponds is selected by a filming device. Thereport discusses errors to be avoided in the development of an indicator for light high-speed engines, where vibration is serious, and outlines the principles underlying the design of this instrument in order to be free of such errors. A description of the <b>instrument</b> <b>and</b> <b>accessories</b> follows, together with operating directions. Specimen indicator diagrams are appended. The indicator has been used successfully at speeds up to 2,600 rpm, the highest speed available for trial. Its sensitivity is approximately that of a standard 6-inch dial gauge of the Bourdon tube type.|$|R
