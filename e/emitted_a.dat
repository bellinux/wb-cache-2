5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} channel {{approaching the}} Fox River in Green Bay was changed {{a number of}} times in order to accommodate vessels of increasing draft. The Army Corps of Engineers also modified the channel in the mid 1920's. The Green Bay Harbor Entrance buoy was established in 1927 to mark this point until the Bureau of Lighthouses could obtain funds for a more permanent solution. The acetylene buoy <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> flash of 0.3 seconds duration every 3 seconds and had a wave-activated bell. The light {{is one of the few}} on the Great Lakes still powered by submarine cable. It is issued from a pair of 300mm Tideland Signal ML300 acrylic optics mounted on the gallery railing. Because the light is too far out to be seen well from shore, the only good view of it is from a boat.|$|E
5|$|The train {{master on}} No. 616 {{received}} complaints from passengers at about 9:10am that the women’s toilet in cabin No. 11 contained {{two pieces of}} luggage which <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> strange odor. THSRC informed the High Speed Rail Police Division, which later boarded the train when it stopped at Hsinchu station. The traffic control center decided to evacuate passengers after the train stopped at Taoyuan station at 9:45 am. More than 600 people were asked to disembark and continue their journey on another train. All passengers affected by the incident would be given a coupon allowing them to purchase a high-speed ticket for their next journey at half price, even though the train company was not {{to blame for the}} incident.|$|E
50|$|They {{were named}} Banshee {{because of the}} sound their {{spacecraft}} made. When hovering they <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> low throbbing sound akin to baaaan-baaaan-baaaan, and when they take-off they <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> sound like a whooshing sheeeeee. Hence the name Baaan-sheee.|$|R
5|$|In a {{gas-filled}} tube, xenon <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> blue or lavenderish glow when {{excited by}} electrical discharge. Xenon <b>emits</b> <b>a</b> band of emission lines that span the visual spectrum, {{but the most}} intense lines occur {{in the region of}} blue light, producing the coloration.|$|R
50|$|Water {{deer are}} capable of <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> number of sounds. The main call is a bark, and this has more of a growl tone when {{compared}} with the sharper yap of a muntjac. The bark is used as an alarm, and water deer will bark repeatedly at people and at each other for reasons unknown. If challenged during the rut, <b>a</b> buck will <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> clicking sound. It is uncertain how this unique sound is generated, although it is possibly by using its molar teeth. During the rut a buck following a doe will make a weak whistle or squeak. The does <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> soft pheep to call to their fawns, whilst an injured deer will <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> screaming wail.|$|R
25|$|March 31 – April 4 Mount Redoubt <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> nearly {{continuous}} {{plume of}} steam, ash and gas at low levels. This was {{a continuation of}} the March 31 event and not new activity.|$|E
25|$|The Question's {{specialized}} belt-buckle, which {{releases a}} binary gas that binds his mask to {{his skin and}} temporarily recolors his garb and hair, {{is similar to that}} of the Spider-Man villain Chameleon. In his initial appearances, which were drawn by Steve Ditko, the Chameleon had used a device in a belt buckle which <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> transformation-enhancing gas. The binding element is adjusted to Sage's specific body chemistry.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{possibly}} {{as the result}} of a landslide, Lake Nyos suddenly <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> large cloud of , which suffocated 1,746people and 3,500 livestock in nearby towns and villages. Though not completely unprecedented, it was the first known large-scale asphyxiation caused by a natural event. To prevent a recurrence, a degassing tube that siphons water from the bottom layers of water to the top allowing the carbon dioxide to leak in safe quantities was installed in 2001, and two additional tubes were installed in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the time}} domain, while mode-locked lasers almost always <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> series of short pulses, Kerr {{frequency}} combs generally do not. However, a special sub-type of Kerr frequency comb, {{in which a}} [...] "cavity soliton" [...] forms in the microresonator, does <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> series of pulses.|$|R

50|$|Indium-111 decays by {{electron}} capture to cadmium-111, <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> 0.1713 and 0.2454 MeV gamma rays with a 2.8047 day radioactive half-life. The parent isotope of indium-111 is tin-111, with a decay mode of {{electron capture}}. Indium-111 also undergoes isomeric transition, <b>emitting</b> <b>a</b> 0.537 MeV gamma ray with a 7.7 minute half-life.|$|R
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of secondary emission (the ability of electrons {{in a vacuum}} tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an electrode) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked photosensitivity). In 1899 the effect was first reported by Villard. In 1902, Austin and Starke reported that the metal surfaces impacted by electron beams <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> larger number of electrons than were incident. The application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after World War I by Westinghouse scientist Joseph Slepian in a 1919 patent.|$|E
25|$|Once healthy, she {{set about}} {{preparing}} herself for redemption. In the singles final at Wimbledon the following year, she defeated Mallory in only 26 minutes, winning 6–2, 6–0, reputedly the fastest Ladies' major tournament match on record. The two met again {{later that year}} at a tournament in Nice where, with Lenglen showing her complete mastery of the sport, Mallory failed to win even one game. Mary K. Browne relates that she asked Lenglen how she greeted Mallory at the net after the game when they met to shake hands. She said that Lenglen told her that after shaking hands she <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> couple of gentle 'coughs'.|$|E
25|$|For {{nearly two}} centuries a farming community, San Jose {{produced}} {{a significant amount}} of fruits and vegetables until the 1960s, and many past and current names of teams, streets, buildings, and so on reflect its agricultural beginnings. Prunes, grapes, and apricots were some of the major crops. In 1922, the first commercial farming of broccoli in the U.S. was started in San Jose, by brothers Stephano and Andrea D'Arrigo. The Del Monte cannery in Midtown was the largest employer in the city for many years. There were so many orchards in the Santa Clara Valley, which <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> delightful smell of ripening fruit, that a common nickname for the Santa Clara Valley was The Valley of Heart's Delight.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view of {{the process}} is that vacuum fluctuations cause a particle–antiparticle pair to appear close to the event horizon of a black hole. One of the pair falls into the black hole while the other escapes. In order to preserve total energy, the particle that fell into the black hole {{must have had a}} negative energy (with respect to an observer far away from the black hole). This causes the black hole to lose mass, and, to an outside observer, {{it would appear that the}} black hole has just <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> particle. In another model, the process is a quantum tunnelling effect, whereby particle–antiparticle pairs will form from the vacuum, and one will tunnel outside the event horizon.|$|E
25|$|The {{currents}} were {{predicted in}} 1908 by Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland, who undertook expeditions {{north of the}} Arctic Circle to study the aurora. He rediscovered, using simple magnetic field measurement instruments, that when the aurora appeared the needles of magnetometers changed direction, confirming the findings of Anders Celsius and assistant Olof Hjorter {{more than a century}} before. This could only imply that currents were flowing in the atmosphere above. He theorized that somehow the Sun <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> cathode ray, and corpuscles from what is now known as a solar wind entered the Earth’s magnetic field and created currents, thereby creating the aurora. This view was scorned by other researchers, but in 1967 a satellite, launched into the auroral region, showed that the currents posited by Birkeland existed. In honour of him and his theory these currents are named Birkeland currents. A good description of the discoveries by Birkeland is given in the book by Jago.|$|E
25|$|Seismic {{activity}} {{continued to}} be strong in October. The eruption continued apace, subsidence of the caldera continued at about 40cm per day and the earthquakes continued with regular M5 tremors around the caldera rim and smaller tremors at the eruption site. Larger volumes of sulphur dioxide were <b>emitted.</b> <b>A</b> crater named Baugur and a new lava flow to the east formed at the eruption site in Holuhraun. Geothermal heat was on the increase and the depression in the caldera was 40 metres, subsidence continued at a similar rate to previous weeks. A cauldron in the south-east corner of Bárðarbunga deepened 25 metres in one month and was considered by scientists at the site {{to be linked to}} the depression in the caldera. Seismic activity continued in the dyke although at a reduced rate. GPS measurements around the area of activity showed minor changes. Air quality {{continued to be}} affected by the eruption.|$|E

50|$|Ion {{thrusters}} <b>emit</b> <b>a</b> beam {{of positive}} charged xenon ions only. To avoid charging up the spacecraft, another cathode is placed near {{the engine to}} <b>emit</b> <b>an</b> electron current into the ion beam with net neutral electrostatic charge. This prevents the beam of ions from being attracted (and returning) to the spacecraft, cancelling the thrust.|$|R

[...] One source said it did not emit any excessive odours that seemed out of the normal. However, the French commission said that the sewer outside {{at least one of}} the houses in the road <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> very bad smell ("une très mauvaise odeur").|$|E
500|$|A [...] {{length of}} the {{original}} roof structure, comprising the two end bays at {{the south of the}} station, and part of the western wall collapsed at 3:57p.m. on 5 December 1905. A gang of men were employed at the time in repairing, glazing and painting the section of roof which fell. Shortly after 3:45p.m, the roof <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> loud noise, which was when someone noticed that one of the main tie rods had broken and was hanging down. Part of the roof began to sag and the western wall began to crack.|$|E
500|$|A {{year after}} their arrival, the cubes start to activate, {{scanning}} information networks {{and act in}} self-defense. The Doctor fears this was a [...] "slow invasion", and goes with Amy to UNIT while Rory and Brian help at the hospital. All the cubes are now showing the same countdown timer. When they reach zero, the cubes open, but appear empty; however, massive numbers of cardiac arrest cases are reported, killing {{about a third of}} humanity, and the Doctor finds one of his own hearts has stopped. As Amy helps him to restart his heart, Kate finds the boxes <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> signal traced to seven sites across the globe, including the hospital Rory works at.|$|E

500|$|The first {{prototype}} Beckman spectrophotometer, the Model A, {{was created}} at National Technologies Laboratories in 1940. [...] It used a tungsten light source {{with a glass}} Fery prism [...] as a monochromator. Tungsten was used for incandescent light filaments because it was strong, withstood heat, and <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> steady light. Types of light sources differed {{in the range of}} wavelengths of light that they emitted. [...] Tungsten lamps were useful in the visible light range but gave poor coverage in the ultraviolet range. However, they had the advantage of being readily available because they were used as automobile headlamps. An external amplifier from the Beckman pH meter and a vacuum tube photocell were used to detect wavelengths.|$|E
500|$|In his biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as [...] "physically {{short and}} stout... with {{sparkling}} eyes, a firm, brisk manner, and effective, sometimes inspired, public speaking". She had the self-confidence to exist and thrive in a male-dominated world, deriving inspiration from a childhood that, though materially impoverished, her obituarist has described as [...] "of great spiritual and mental wealth". She inherited a strong nonconformist faith, {{which became a}} key element throughout her later career, and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life. After her death The Times praised her [...] "unusually wide human sympathies... her generous nature and real sense of humour". Skidelsky, however, describes her unsympathetically as [...] "a humourless and somewhat priggish person, with long black skirts and a voice that <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> harsh cascade of sound".|$|E
500|$|In 1953, {{they made}} their first {{attempts}} {{using one of the}} large reactors at the Hanford nuclear site in what is now known as the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment. Their detector now included [...] of scintillating fluid and 90 photomultiplier tubes, but the effort was frustrated by background noise from cosmic rays. With [...] encouragement from John A. Wheeler, they tried again in 1955, this time using one of the newer, larger 700 MW reactors at the Savannah River Site that <b>emitted</b> <b>a</b> high neutrino flux of 1.2 x 1012 / cm2 sec. They also had a convenient, well-shielded location [...] from the reactor and [...] underground. On June 14, 1956, they were able to send Pauli a telegram announcing that the neutrino had been found.
