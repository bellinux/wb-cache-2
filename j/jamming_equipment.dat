The first of these aircraft flew on 15 January 1966 and they began arriving in Southeast Asia in May, flying their first mission on 6 June 1966, with five assigned to the 13th TFS at Korat RTAFB and six more to the 354th TFS at Takhli RTAFB.|$|E
5|$|The zenith of B-52 {{attacks in}} Vietnam was Operation Linebacker II (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Christmas Bombing), conducted from 18 to 29 December 1972, which consisted of waves of B-52s (mostly D models, but some Gs without <b>jamming</b> <b>equipment</b> and with a smaller bomb load). Over 12 days, B-52s flew 729 sorties and dropped 15,237tons of bombs on Hanoi, Haiphong, and other targets. Originally 42 B-52s were committed to the war; however, numbers were frequently twice this figure. During Operation Linebacker II, fifteen B-52s were shot down, five were heavily damaged (one crashed in Laos), and five suffered medium damage. A total of 25 crew men were killed in these losses. North Vietnam claimed 34 B-52s were shot down.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ECM {{equipment}} which initially saw {{use on the}} Victor, such as {{the original}} chaff dispenser and Orange Putter tail warning radar, had been developed for the earlier English Electric Canberra bomber and were already considered to be near-obsolete {{by the time the}} Victor had entered service. Significant improvements and alterations would be made to the avionics and ECM suites, as effective ECMs had been deemed critical to the Victor's role; for example, the introduction of the more capable Red Steer tail warning radar. The introduction of the Victor B.2 was accompanied by several new ECM systems, including a passive radar warning receiver, a metric radar jammer and communications <b>jamming</b> <b>equipment.</b> Streamlined fairings on the trailing edges of the wings that could house large quantities of defensive chaff/flares were also new additions. While trials were conducted with terrain-following radar and a side scan mode for the bombing and navigation radar, neither of these functions were integrated into the operational fleet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Controlling {{single pulse}} energy of pulse power, {{is one of}} the key factors to improve the {{processing}} ability of micro electrical machining, because of high frequency and small energy of single pulse, high-frequency periodic square wave power is the ideal power for micro electrical machining. High-frequency periodic square wave is composed of multiple frequency signals, vulnerable to be <b>jammed</b> by <b>equipment</b> noise and environmental noise, making the waveform deformation seriously, weakening the micro machining capability. In this paper, the detailed spectral analysis of the high frequency cycle square wave was made by the discrete Fourier transform, with the help of MATLAB, to extract the effective frequency components, determining the corresponding amplitude and the frequency equation. It provides a theoretical basis to suppress the interference signal, so as to achieve the ideal square wave signal, to provide protection for the precisio...|$|R

25|$|During the Vietnam War, the A-3 attack {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} KA-3B tankers while some were modified into a multimission tanker variant, the EKA-3B, {{that was a}} real workhorse for the carrier air wing. Electronic <b>jamming</b> <b>equipment</b> was added without removing tanker capability so the EKA-3B could jam enemy radar while waiting to refuel tactical aircraft. Eventually, the EKA-3B was replaced by the smaller dedicated Grumman KA-6D Intruder tanker, which although it had less capacity and endurance, was deployed in greater numbers within the carrier's air wing. Two additional Naval Reserve units were established in the early 1970s as air refueling squadrons, VAQ-208 and VAQ-308, at NAS Alameda, California. Both units operated aircraft with electronic warfare equipment removed and were redesignated as KA-3Bs. VAK-208 and VAK-308 were decommissioned in the early 1990s.|$|E
25|$|On 27 December 1944 No. 462 Squadron was {{relocated}} to RAF Foulsham and {{became part of}} No. 100 Group RAF. This group specialised in electronic warfare and No. 462 Squadron's aircraft were modified to radar <b>jamming</b> <b>equipment</b> and other countermeasures. Until {{the end of the}} war the squadron used its special equipment and mounted small diversionary attacks to deceive the Germans as to the location of the raids conducted by Bomber Command. While the squadron maintained a high rate of operations at times, its losses were relatively light as the countermeasures carried by the aircraft also protected them from attack. No. 462 Squadron continued to operate until almost {{the end of the war}} in Europe, and was the only Australian squadron in Bomber Command to either fly a higher number of sorties in April 1945 than March or operate in May. The squadron flew its final operation of the war on the night of 2/3 May.|$|E
500|$|As the {{operation}} progressed, newer technologies (low-light television cameras, infrared vision devices, side-looking radars, radar <b>jamming</b> <b>equipment,</b> and computer-directed fire control systems) were also fielded {{to improve the}} performance of these aircraft. The apex of these developments was reached by the deployment of the AC-130E Spectre, a conversion of the venerable C-130 Hercules cargo transport, in February 1968. By 1970 the Spectre had become the most formidable weapon platform fielded by the Air Force in its war against trucks.The PAVN 377 Air Division's history notes [...] "Just one hour when AC-130s did not operate over our chokepoints was both precious and rare." ...|$|E
5000|$|The concept {{can be used}} in {{wireless}} data {{networks to}} disrupt information flow. It is a common form of censorship in totalitarian countries, in order to prevent foreign radio stations in border areas from reaching the country. [...] Jamming is usually distinguished from interference that can occur due to device malfunctions or other accidental circumstances. Devices that simply cause interference are regulated under different regulations. Unintentional 'jamming' occurs when an operator transmits on a busy frequency without first checking whether it is in use, or without being able to hear stations using the frequency. Another form of unintentional <b>jamming</b> occurs when <b>equipment</b> accidentally radiates a signal, such as a cable television plant that accidentally emits on an aircraft emergency frequency.|$|R

He runs back toward the scanner room, bluffing his way past [...] "Benton" [...] by posing as his duplicate. Sarah climbs up the rocket towards the real Harry and Faraday. The android Doctor is about to shoot the original when Crayford enters, saying that Styggron promised no killing. The android Doctor calls him a fool and tells him about the virus.

Realising the truth, Crayford rushes out, distracting the android long enough for the Doctor to make his move. In the struggle, the Doctor manages to activate the power to the radar, jamming all the androids in mid-step. In the rocket, Sarah unties Harry and Faraday. Styggron enters, holding a ray gun on them, but Crayford appears and attacks him. The two grapple, and Styggron shoots Crayford. The Doctor makes his own entrance, punching the Kraal, who falls on the vial of virus, cracking it open. Styggron shoots the Doctor before he dies. Sarah is horrified, but the real Doctor appears, revealing he had programmed his duplicate to distract Styggron.|$|R
