40|$|Cutting tool {{parameters}} such as edge-sharpness {{and speed}} of cut directly influence the shape of final samples and the required cutting force and specific energy for slicing or cutting operations. Cutting force and specific energy studies on different vegetables help to design the appropriate slicing or cutting devices. Peak cutting force and specific energy requirements for the transverse cutting of nine vegetables, differing in their textural characteristics of rind and flesh, were determined at cutting speeds of 20, 30, 40 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and single-cut knife-edge angles of 15, 20 and 25 ° using a Universal Testing Machine. Low speed (20 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1) cutting with a sharper knife-edge angle (15 °) required less peak force and specific energy than that of high-speed cutting (40 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1) with a wider knife-edge angle (25 °). The vegetables with the maximum and minimum variation in the average peak cutting force were aubergine, at 79. 05 (for knife speed 20 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and edge angle 15 0) to 285. 1 N (40 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and 25 0), and cucumber, at 11. 61 (20 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and 15 0) to 21. 41 N (40 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1 and 25 0), respectively. High speed (40 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1), with a large knife-edge angle (25 °), required the highest force and specific energy to cut the vegetables, however, low speed (20 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1), with a small knife-edge angle (15 0), is preferred. Effects of cutting speed and knife-edge angle on peak force and specific energy responses were found significant (p< 0. 05). Linear or quadratic regressions gave a good fit of these variables.  </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{modification}} of raindrops by {{the canopy of}} olive trees increases the kinetic energy of the rain per unit area. The kinetic energy computed from the measured drop size distribution under the tree canopy in simulated rainfall experiments is greater than that received in the open, 17. 1 J mm - 1, as against 15. 7 J mm - 1. This causes higher soil detachment and loss than that observed outside the canopy. Tillage treatments of the soil modify its erodibility, accelerate soil detachment and reduce, simultaneously, the velocity of runoff.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to the derived datafiles held in the Leicester database in the directory /rjb/malet/*. *. These data on seventeenth century French revenues and expenditure supplied by the Project Director, Professor Richard Bonney, draw upon J-R Malet, 'Comptes rendus de l'administration des finances du royaume de France, (London, 1789). For a discussion of this source in English, cosult Bonney, R. J., 'Jean-Roland Malet: historian of the finances of the French monarchy', French History, 5 (1991), 180 - 233.

5000|$|Tongues are {{pierced with}} {{straight}} barbell style jewelry. Because of the frequent {{movement of the}} tongue, jewellery size and comfort is especially important. Barbells that are too thin are prone to migration, causing discomfort and irritation. Tongue piercings can often be easily stretched to accommodate larger jewellery. The initial piercing is often at 14 <b>g</b> (1.6 <b>mm),</b> but to avoid one or two stretching steps {{it is possible to}} pierce immediately at 12 <b>g</b> (2.0 <b>mm)</b> or even 10 <b>g</b> (2.4 <b>mm).</b> Some people later choose to stretch their piercing to 12 <b>g</b> (2 <b>mm),</b> 10 <b>g</b> (2.4 <b>mm),</b> 8 <b>g</b> (3.2 <b>mm)</b> or 6 <b>g</b> (4.0 <b>mm)</b> to protect against possible migration and to have a more stable 'snug' fit. It is possible to stretch further to diameters beyond 10 mm. The beads {{at the end of the}} barbell can be made of many decorative materials. [...] "No-see-um beads", flat beads matching the color of the tongue, are sometimes worn to conceal this piercing, often in places of employment. Using appropriate colored and styled jewellery, and taking care while talking/laughing, it is possible to conceal the piercing.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus is}} the {{experimental}} assessment of in-situ flow vectors in a hillslope soil. We selected a 100 m 2 trenched hillslope study site. During prescribed sprinkling an obliquely installed TDR wave-guide {{provides for the}} velocity of the wetting front in its direction. A triplet of wave-guides mounted {{along the sides of}} an hypothetical tetrahedron, with its peak pointing down, produces a three-dimensional vector of the wetting front. The method is based on the passing of wetting fronts. We analysed 34 vectors along the hillslope at distributed locations and at soil depths from 11 cm (representing top soil) to 40 cm (close to bedrock interface). The mean values resulted as follows v x = 16. 1 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1, v y =- 0. 2 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1, and v z = 11. 9 <b>mm</b> <b>min</b> - 1. The velocity vectors of the wetting fronts were generally gravity dominated and downslope orientated. Downslope direction (x-axis) dominated close to bedrock, whereas no preference between vertical and downslope direction was found in vectors close to the surface. The velocities along the contours (y-axis) varied widely. The Kruskal-Wallis tests indicated that the different upslope sprinkling areas had no influence on the orientation of the vectors. Vectors of volume flux density were also calculated for each triplet. The lateral velocities of the vector approach are compared with subsurface stromflow collected at the downhill end of the slope. Velocities were 25 - 140 times slower than lateral saturated tracer movements on top of the bedrock. Beside other points, we conclude that this method is restricted to non-complex substrate (skeleton or portion of big stones) ...|$|R
