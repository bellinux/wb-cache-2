5|$|On September 10, 2013, the <b>iPhone</b> 4S {{name was}} re-stylised as <b>iPhone</b> 4s, using a lower case 's' {{to reflect the}} names of the newly {{announced}} <b>iPhone</b> 5s and <b>iPhone</b> 5c. This was unusual for Apple as an upper case 'S' had been used since the introduction of the <b>iPhone</b> 3GS in 2009.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 2015, {{with the}} release of the <b>iPhone</b> 6S and <b>iPhone</b> 6S Plus, the <b>iPhone</b> 6 and 6 Plus were moved to the {{mid-range}} of the <b>iPhone</b> lineup. The 128GB versions of the <b>iPhone</b> 6 and <b>iPhone</b> 6 Plus was discontinued along with the gold version of both phones, but the 16GB and 64GB versions of the <b>iPhone</b> 6 and <b>iPhone</b> 6 Plus in silver and space gray remain available for sale at a reduced price.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iPhone</b> 5 is a {{smartphone}} {{designed and}} marketed by Apple Inc. It is the sixth {{generation of the}} <b>iPhone,</b> succeeding the <b>iPhone</b> 4S and preceding the <b>iPhone</b> 5S and <b>iPhone</b> 5C. Formally unveiled {{as part of a}} press event on September 12, 2012, it was released on September 21, 2012. The <b>iPhone</b> 5 is the first <b>iPhone</b> to be announced in September and setting a trend for subsequent <b>iPhone</b> releases, the first <b>iPhone</b> be completely developed under the guidance of Tim Cook and the last <b>iPhone</b> to be overseen by Steve Jobs.|$|E
50|$|In APPLE Inc. <b>iPhones</b> {{released}} with iOS version 7.0 and higher, multipeer connectivity APIs (application programmable interfaces) are enabled {{and provided}} to allow APPLE <b>iphones</b> {{to operate in}} peer-to-peer ad hoc mesh networking mode. This means <b>iphones</b> can now {{talk to each other}} without using a cellular signal or connection. Currently, APPLE uses multipeer to allow one to send photos and large files (up to GB) to peers. This application is called AirDrop and has been gaining popularity. With 700+ millions of <b>iPhones</b> being used globally, ad hoc peer-to-peer networks will gain pervasive presence almost instantly.|$|R

The <b>iPhone's</b> can be triggered during routine use, by an owner's sweat, steam in a bathroom, and other light environmental moisture. Criticism led Apple to change its water damage policy for <b>iPhones</b> and similar products, allowing customers to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.|$|R
5|$|The <b>iPhone</b> 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the <b>iPhone</b> 5S and the <b>iPhone</b> 5C. The <b>iPhone</b> 5 has the shortest lifespan of any <b>iPhone</b> ever produced with only twelve months in production, breaking with Apple's standard practice of selling an existing <b>iPhone</b> model at a reduced price upon {{the release of a}} new model, being replaced as a midrange and then an entry-level device by the <b>iPhone</b> 5C; the 5C internal hardware specifications are almost identical to the 5 albeit having a less expensive polycarbonate exterior. The <b>iPhone</b> 5 supports 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, but not iOS 11 which was released on September 19, 2017. The <b>iPhone</b> 5 is the second <b>iPhone</b> to support five major versions of iOS after the <b>iPhone</b> 4S.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iPhone</b> 5S is {{the third}} <b>iPhone</b> to support five major {{versions}} of iOS after the <b>iPhone</b> 4S and <b>iPhone</b> 5. The 5S supports 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, being the oldest <b>iPhone</b> to support iOS 11 since it was the earliest to have incorporated a 64-bit SoC processor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iPhone</b> 6 and <b>iPhone</b> 6 Plus are {{smartphones}} {{designed and}} marketed by Apple Inc.

5|$|Hardware {{benchmarking}} {{conducted using}} Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and {{mentioned at the}} unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the <b>iPhone</b> 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 {{times higher than the}} <b>iPhone</b> 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the <b>iPhone</b> 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the <b>iPhone</b> 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the <b>iPhone</b> 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the <b>iPhone</b> 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the <b>iPhone</b> 5 battery outlasts the <b>iPhone</b> 4S.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Cisco Systems and Apple {{negotiated}} over allowing Apple {{rights to}} use Cisco's Linksys <b>iPhone</b> trademark, but the negotiations stalled when Cisco {{pushed for the}} two products to be interoperable. Following the public unveiling of the Apple <b>iPhone</b> at the 2007 Macworld Expo, Cisco {{filed a lawsuit against}} Apple in January 2007, alleging Apple's <b>iPhone</b> name infringed on Cisco's <b>iPhone</b> trademark. Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way, while Apple countered {{that there would be no}} likelihood of confusion between the two products, because Apple's <b>iPhone</b> product was the first cell phone with such a name, while Cisco's <b>iPhone</b> was a VoIP phone. Bloomberg reported Cisco's <b>iPhone</b> as a product marketed for less than $100 and part of the Linksys home routers, enabling internet-based calls through Skype and Yahoo! Messenger, and contrasted it with Apple's <b>iPhone</b> as a mobile phone which sold for around $600. In February 2007, Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the <b>iPhone</b> name worldwide.|$|E

5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the <b>iPhone</b> 5S over the <b>iPhone</b> 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued <b>iPhone</b> 5, while the <b>iPhone</b> 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the <b>iPhone</b> 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both <b>iPhone</b> 5S and <b>iPhone</b> 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} <b>iPhone</b> range, respectively; the <b>iPhone</b> 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the <b>iPhone</b> 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the <b>iPhone</b> 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} device was {{generally}} positive, with some outlets considering {{it to be the}} best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. Some criticized the <b>iPhone</b> 5S for keeping the design and small display of the <b>iPhone</b> 5, and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system. Nine million units of the <b>iPhone</b> 5S and <b>iPhone</b> 5C were sold on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. The <b>iPhone</b> 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.|$|E

5|$|Six {{months after}} the release of the <b>iPhone</b> 5S, on March 25, 2014, Apple {{announced}} that sales of the <b>iPhone</b> brand had exceeded 500 million units. By May 2014, despite having been on the market for eight months, the <b>iPhone</b> 5S reportedly outsold the newly released Samsung Galaxy S5 by 40%, with 7 million <b>iPhone</b> 5S units versus 5 million Galaxy S5 units. The Galaxy S5's failure to oust the <b>iPhone</b> 5S from the top selling spot was a major setback for Samsung Mobile, as the preceding Samsung Galaxy SIII and Samsung Galaxy S4, {{in the first quarter of}} their releases, had outsold the <b>iPhone</b> 4S and <b>iPhone</b> 5 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iPhone</b> 5 {{was officially}} {{discontinued}} by Apple on September 10, 2013 with {{the announcement of}} its successors, the <b>iPhone</b> 5S and the <b>iPhone</b> 5C. While the 5C shared almost the same internal hardware as the <b>iPhone</b> 5, the 5C used a lower-cost poly-carbonate plastic case {{in place of the}} original 5's aluminum form. The introduction of the 5C deviated from Apple's previous market strategy, where the previous <b>iPhone</b> model would remain in production, but sold at a lower price point below the new model.|$|E
5|$|The <b>iPhone</b> 5S was succeeded as Apple's {{flagship}} smartphone by {{the larger}} <b>iPhone</b> 6 in September 2014.
