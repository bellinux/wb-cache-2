We test a model in which the supply of capable <b>entrants,</b> localized knowledge, and production externalities influence where <b>entrants</b> originated and located. Entry clustered around existing tire producers and in more populated regions, which we attribute mainly to the supply of capable <b>entrants.</b> Production externalities influenced the profitability of operating in a region, but their effect was limited by the localized knowledge of <b>entrants.</b> Entry fueled agglomeration mainly through an endogenous process governing the supply of capable <b>entrants.</b> Entry Location Agglomeration Spinoffs...|$|R
5|$|On 5 November 2013, TROS {{announced}} that they would publish {{the name of the}} Dutch <b>entrant</b> on 25 November. On the same day, various news media reported that DeLange, well known in the Netherlands for several pop and country hits and as a juror on The Voice of Holland, had been selected by the broadcaster. Also reported was that Waylon, runner-up in the first series of Holland's Got Talent in 2008, would represent the Netherlands with a song written by DeLange. Waylon had previously competed in the Dutch selection for Eurovision 2005, but had failed to qualify for the final.

40|$|The {{influence}} of innovative <b>entrants</b> on incumbents is considered important for technological change. We analyze this influence {{for the global}} transition towards alternative technology vehicles (ATVs). Our results indicate that entrants' ATV-related knowledge accumulation stimulates average incumbent's ATV-related research. Regarding global <b>entrants,</b> incumbents with higher ATV patent stocks increased patenting stronger; supporting previous literature on competitive reactions to entry. Responding to domestic <b>entrants,</b> however, incumbents with low ATV patent stocks increased whereas incumbents with high stocks decreased patenting; suggesting that advanced incumbents outsource research or overtake <b>entrants.</b> Further, certain characteristics and not merely the quantity of <b>entrants</b> drive incumbents' responses...|$|R

5|$|The Twenty-Man Gauntlet for the Gold {{to become}} number one {{contender}} to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was held, involving Abyss, Bobby Roode, Zach Gowen, Eric Young, Cassidy Riley, Elix Skipper, Shark Boy, A-1, Chris Sabin, Petey Williams, Sonny Siaki, Lance Hoyt, Michael Shane, Jerrelle Clarke, Mikey Batts, The Outlaw, Trytan, Ron Killings, Apolo, and B.G. James. The first <b>entrant</b> was Roode, {{while the second}} was Gowen, who began the encounter. Abyss was the last <b>entrant.</b> Gowen was the first eliminated by Shark Boy. The Outlaw and James were the lasted eliminated simultaneously by Abyss, before it became a standard bout between Abyss and Killings. Killings bashed a steel chair over Abyss' head to gain a near-fall. Abyss {{went on to win}} after Killings jumped off the top turnbuckle and Abyss countered it into his signature maneuver the Black Hole Slam to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at twenty-six minutes and forty-five seconds.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} the Royal Rumble match. Before the match, Kurt Angle stole Nunzio's {{entrance}} number and replaced {{him in the}} match. The participants divided into their brands and fought against each other, working together to eliminate Muhammad Hassan, the thirteen <b>entrant.</b> Scotty 2 Hotty, the fifteenth <b>entrant,</b> was attacked by Hassan during his entrance and never entered the match. Angle, the twentieth <b>entrant,</b> dominated upon entering until Shawn Michaels eliminated him. Angle came back to eliminate Michaels and attacked him. The final four participants remaining were Batista, United States Champion John Cena, Edge, and Rey Mysterio. Edge fought with Mysterio, executing a spear to eliminate Mysterio. Cena and Batista then eliminated Edge as he was attacking them. Cena tried to perform an FU on Batista but Batista countered. Batista then attempted a Batista Bomb but was countered with a headscissors takedown by Cena, sending both over the top rope and touching the floor at the same time. The referees for the Raw brand believed Batista to be the winner while the SmackDown! referees believed Cena to be winner. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came to the ring, in the process legitimately tearing both his quadriceps muscles, and ordered the match to be restarted with the final two participants. Batista eliminated Cena following a Spinebuster to win the match.|$|E

McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe, aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe. The project was greenlit, and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe to handle this new campaign, now given the working title of The Life.|$|E

40|$|What is {{the impact}} of firm entry {{regulation}} on sustained entry into self-employment? How does firm entry regulation influence the performance of long-living <b>entrants?</b> In this paper, I address these questions by exploiting a natural experiment in firm entry regulation. After German reunification, East and West Germany faced different economic conditions, but fell under the same law that imposes a substantial mandatory standard on entrepreneurs who want to start a legally independent firm in one of the regulated occupations. The empirical results suggest that the entry regulation suppresses long-living <b>entrants,</b> not only <b>entrants</b> in general or transient, short-lived <b>entrants.</b> This effect on the number of long-living <b>entrants</b> is not accompanied by a counteracting effect on the performance of long-living <b>entrants,</b> as measured by firm size several years after entry.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, student {{applications}} declined {{as a result}} of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. During this period the university, like Shimer College and 10 others, adopted an early <b>entrant</b> program that allowed very young students to attend college; in addition, students enrolled at Shimer were enabled to transfer automatically to the University of Chicago after their second year, having taken comparable or identical examinations and courses.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether graduate and non-graduate <b>entrants</b> {{to medical school}} differ in {{their views on the}} first year spent in medical practice as a pre-registration house officer. METHODS: We carried out postal questionnaire surveys of medical qualifiers of 1999, 2000 and 2002 from all UK medical schools, 1 year after qualification. The timing of the study slightly pre-dates the recent major expansion in graduate entry fast-track courses. RESULTS: Differences between graduate and non-graduate <b>entrants</b> were few and, even when statistically significant, were small in scale. Graduate <b>entrants</b> viewed their working hours, pay and living conditions at work, such as hospital accommodation and food, a little less favourably than did non-graduate <b>entrants.</b> Graduate <b>entrants</b> were also less satisfied than non-graduates with time available for family, social and recreational activities. However, graduate <b>entrants</b> were more likely than non-graduate <b>entrants</b> to feel positive about their future career prospects. There were no differences between graduate and non-graduate <b>entrants</b> in whether they felt they had been well prepared by their medical schools for the jobs they undertook as house officers. Levels of job satisfaction expressed by graduate and non-graduate <b>entrants</b> were similar, as were their responses to most other statements about attitudes to clinical work. CONCLUSIONS: 'Quality of life' issues, a sense of being fairly rewarded, and expectations about one's physical working environment seem a little more important to graduate than to non-graduate <b>entrants.</b> Apart from these, the findings suggest that graduate status, at entry to medical school, has no appreciable influence on attitudes to the work of a junior hospital doctor...|$|R
