50|$|Because {{the single}} driving axle {{was behind the}} firebox, Crampton {{locomotives}} usually had outside cylinders. However, some inside cylinder versions were built using indirect drive, then known as a jackshaft. The inside cylinders drove a crankshaft located {{in front of the}} firebox and the crankshaft was connected to the driving wheels by outside rods. Some long-wheelbase 0-4-0 tank locomotives were also built using this crankshaft system. The boiler <b>feed-pump</b> was often driven from the crankshaft as well because many Cramptons were built before the injector was invented.|$|E
50|$|During an {{emergency}} stop in Vineyard Haven Harbor on April 5, 1980, Naushon's anchor broke multiple undersea power cables {{for the island}} of Martha's Vineyard. Naushon had experienced a boiler <b>feed-pump</b> failure and had lost power while traveling from Nantucket to Woods Hole. In order to avoid drifting while repairs were made, the anchor was dropped. Owing {{to a combination of}} factors, including a rock that had jammed the anchor, strong currents, and the extra drag being exerted by a coast guard vessel which had moored to Naushon, the anchor did not hold. After digging a trench across the seafloor for about 700 ft, the anchor apparently snagged the undersea cables. Once repairs were completed, Naushon prepared to resume its journey. At the exact moment the anchor was weighed, power ceased flowing through the cables. The cables were later discovered to have snapped.|$|E
50|$|Recognising {{that the}} pumping station might quickly deteriorate, {{once it was}} no longer used, the Papplewick Pumping Station Trust was formed in 1974, and {{negotiated}} with Nottingham City Council. They obtained a lease which enabled them to open the site as a static museum. Once volunteers started to maintain the site, the idea of steaming the engines was voiced, and a second organisation, the Papplewick Association, was created, with responsibility for operating the machinery. One boiler was certified to be safe in 1975, and work started on refurbishing it. The cooling pond was dry and had to be cleared of leaves and pine needles before refilling could begin on 12 July. There were problems with draughting, and a fan was fitted into the flue. The boiler was lit on 18 September, and this time there were problems with smoke filling the smithy, which required further minor modifications. Steam was raised on 20 September, and the first attempt to run one engine was made the following day, with John Thorlby, who had been superintendent of the pumping station until his retirement, demonstrating the start-up procedure. The boiler <b>feed-pump</b> glands had to be repacked, and the camshaft had to be stripped down to clear the oil ways, but after attention to these items, the engine ran satisfactorily. The second engine was made operational at a later date.|$|E
40|$|Bibliography: p. 132 - 134. ESKOM, {{together}} with Municipalities distribute power at a line-to-line voltage of 400 +/- 10 %. Hence in theory, the user {{ends up with}} a voltage of 340 to 440. In urban areas 2 % voltage unbalance is considered acceptable, while 3 % voltage unbalance is considered acceptable for rural areas. The combined effects of under or overvoltages coupled with "acceptable maximum" voltage unbalance is not understood or documented. This project is a comprehensive study {{of the effects of}} voltage unbalance in combination with under or overvoltages on induction machines (1 M) variable speed drives. In addition the performance with PWM inverters connected to 1 M via long cables is also studied. The project starts by an evaluation of previous work on the subject and related topics. Relevant conclusions are made based on the literature review in Chapter One. The second step of the project was to develop two test beds in the UCT Machine's Laboratory. The test beds are for performance testing of low (up to 15 kW) and medium (up to 75 kW) power 1 M and their VSDs. The test bed losses are determined at 4 different operating points and documented. Several tests such as the blocked rotor and no load tests were undertaken to determine the machine parameters. A PSpice simulation model was developed and tested for the low voltage test bed. The test results compared well to simulation predictions. Furthermore, tests under unbalanced and overvoltage conditions were performed and the results verified with simulations. This proves that the developed PSpice model can reliably simulate the actual test bed for both balanced and unbalanced conditions. Moreover, it can be easily applied to model different size machines and drives. The information required includes: the motor parameters, drive dc-link parameters, modulation ratio (ma) and the switching frequency. The impact of voltage unbalance in drives with long cables between the inverter and motor is examined. A 36 m long, 4 -core, PVC insulated cable is used on the low voltage test bed for a case study. The model used for the cable is a lumped parameter model. The 1 M model is also taken from the literature to include a high frequency branch, to model the reflected voltage wave phenomenon. A basic analysis of energy savings in pumps and fans load associated with the application of variable speed drives is also done. Boiler <b>feed-pumps</b> from Tutuka power station are used as a case study that may be replicated for other applications in utilities or industry. The developed Excel Spreadsheet program to project the value of savings and determine the payback period is compared to an ABB program. The two results agree within an acceptable range. Therefore, the knowledge of the pumping system specifications and the cost of energy in kWh with the Energy Savings Program would enable one to project energy savings...|$|R

Current {{research}} and development investigate small scale and variable heat sources application such as waste heat recovery. Many experimental data on ORC are available. <b>Feed-pump</b> performances achieved are lower than expected and some authors reported cavitation issue. Pump performance has a non-negligible impact over the ORC performance, especially for transcritical cycles. Operations of diaphragm pumps in three different test benches with different fluid and pump size are analyzed. A semi-empirical model of the pump power chain is proposed and validated. Energetic analysis show highlevel of losses in the variable speed drive and electric motor, mainly due to design oversizing. Then a model and analysis of reciprocating pump volumetric efficiency is proposed, taking into account fluid properties. Finally, cavitation limits in different conditions are calculated.

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of an adiabatic tubular plant reactor during the startup is demonstrated, {{together with the}} impact of a <b>feed-pump</b> failure of one of the reactants. A dynamic model of the reactor system is presented, and the system response is calculated as a function of experimentally-determined, time-dependent, manipulated variables. The values of model parameters are estimated by using the SimuSolv (1991) computer program. The data set collected during the reactor start-up is used for the parameter estimation procedure. An excellent agreement is obtained between the experimental and the calculated system response. Many continuously-operated commercial reactors require a complete conversion of one of the main reactants at the reactor exit. It is shown that for an industrial tubular reactor a much higher initial reactor temperature is required during the startup, compared to the reactor inlet temperature during normal steady-state operation, to ensure a complete reactant conversion. Much more research is necessary to determine whether this is a generally valid rule...|$|E

40|$|Most {{industrial}} production processes are performed in fed-batch operational mode. In contrast, the screenings for microbial production strains are run {{in batch mode}} which results in completely different physiological conditions than relevant for production. This may lead to wrong strain selections. Silicone elastomer discs containing glucose crystals were developed to realize fed-batch fermentation based on diffusion in shaken bioreactors. No other device for feeding was required. This “slow-release fed-batch technique” was tested on the metabolism of H. polymorpha, E. coli and G. oxydans in shake flasks. The OTR and RQ were monitored online with a RAMOS device. Biomass formation, synthesis of proteins like GFP or eYFP-IL- 6, pH drift and metabolic dynamics of glucose, ethanol, acetic acid and other organic acids were measured offline. By application of the slow-release fed-batch technique in comparison to regular batch mode, overflow-metabolism of H. polymorpha and E. coli could be reduced, which led {{to an increase in}} biomass yield of up to 85 % and 59 %, respectively. Up to date, 23. 4 g/L cell dry weight of H. polymorpha and 13. 7 g/L of E. coli was achieved. The specific biomass yields of 0. 38 - 0. 47 are in the magnitude of those in laboratory fermentors equipped with a substrate <b>feed-pump.</b> The GFP expression by H. polymorpha RB 11 pC 10 -GFP could be improved in Syn 6 -MES and YNB mineral media up to 35 -fold and 420 -fold, respectively. The synthesized maximum in fed-batch mode was 421 mg/L GFP. In contrast only up to 2. 5 mg/L GFP was received in batch mode. The expression of eYFP-IL- 6 by E. coli BL 21 pLys pRSET eYFP-IL 6 could be increased 4 -fold in optimized Wilms-MOPS mineral medium using the slow-release fed-batch technique. Slow-release fed-batch cultures of G. oxydans DSM 2003 revealed a 2. 6 -fold increase of specific biomass yield in modified Silberbach-MES complex medium. A cell dry weight of 3. 3 g/L was obtained in contrast to 1. 6 g/L in batch mode. Due to glucose feeding a reduction of gluconic acid as well as 2 - and 5 -ketogluconic acid formation was monitored. A mass screening of 265 H. polymorpha RB 11 pC 10 -FMD clones and 267 pC 10 -MOX clones was performed in Syn 6 -MES mineral medium in deep-well plates. A batch with glucose and one with glycerol were performed simultaneously in comparison to a slow-release fed-batch with glucose. One repetition screening was done under the same conditions. These diverse operational modes revealed great differences in strain selection and quality of specific GFP yield. The best strains for a fed-batch would be unlikely found in either batch mode. A dependence on the carbon source and the operational mode was found in relevance to the regulating promoter for gene expression. A fed-batch screening points {{out to be the most}} secure way to select the right strain for a fed-batch production process...|$|E
