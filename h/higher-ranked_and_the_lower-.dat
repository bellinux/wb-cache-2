40|$|In {{this paper}} {{multiple}} atmospheric global circulation model (AGCM) integrations at T 42 spectral truncation and prescribed sea surface temperature {{were used to}} drive regional spectral model (RSM) simulations at 80 -km resolution for the austral summer season (January–February–March). Relative to the AGCM, the RSM improves the ensemble mean simulation of precipitation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> upper-level tropospheric circulation over both tropical and subtropical South America <b>and</b> <b>the</b> neighboring ocean basins. It is also seen that the RSM exacerbates the dry bias over {{the northern tip of}} South America <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Nordeste region, <b>and</b> perpetuates <b>the</b> erroneous split intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) over both <b>the</b> Pacific <b>and</b> Atlantic Ocean basins from the AGCM. The RSM at 80 -km horizontal resolution is able to reasonably resolve the Altiplano plateau. This led to an improvement in the mean precipitation over the plateau. The improved resolution orography in the RSM did not substantially change the predictability of the precipitation, surface fluxes, or upper- and lower-level winds {{in the vicinity of the}} Andes Mountains from the AGCM. In spite of identical convective and land surface parameterization schemes, the diagnostic quantities, such as precipitation and surface fluxes, show significant differences in the intramodel variability over oceans and certain parts of the Amazon River basin (ARB).

40|$|Bidirectional typechecking {{has become}} a popular {{technique}} for advanced type systems. In this paper, I show how to extend past work on bidirectional typechecking to handle parametric polymorphism bidirectionally.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This paper {{explores the}} {{major changes in}} diet and {{physical}} activity patterns around <b>the</b> world <b>and</b> focuses on shifts in obesity. DESIGN: Review of results focusing on large-scale surveys and nationally representative studies of diet, activity, and obesity among adults and children. SUBJECTS: Youth and adults {{from a range of}} countries around the world. MEASUREMENTS: The International Obesity Task Force guidelines for defining overweight and obesity are used for youth <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body mass index Z 25 kg/m 2 and 30 cutoffs are used, respectively, for adults. RESULTS: The nutrition transition patterns are examined from the time period termed the receding famine pattern to one dominated by nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases (NR-NCDs). The speed of dietary and activity pattern shifts is great, particularly in the developing world, resulting in major shifts in obesity on a worldwide basis. Data limitations force us to examine data on obesity trends in adults to provide a broader sense of changes in obesity over time, and then to examine the relatively fewer studies on youth. Specifically, this work provides a sense of change both in the United States, Europe, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, <b>the</b> Middle East, <b>and</b> Latin America.

40|$|Abstract—In this letter, a novel compact {{dual-band}} microstrip {{bandpass filter}} (BPF) with multiple transmission zeros is proposed using the third-order interdigital structure and dual-mode short stub center-loaded resonator (DSLR) for wideband <b>and</b> WLAN applications. <b>The</b> high impedance feedline for the filter with the folded DSLR can {{function as the}} quarter-wavelength resonator (QWR) for the third-order interdigital filter. Meanwhile, the folded DSLR can be adopted without an evident increase {{of the size of}} the compact interdigital filter. Three transmission zeros between two passbands <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> upper-stopbands can be created due to the cross coupling between two high impedance feedlines as well as between <b>the</b> input <b>and</b> output, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic characteristic of the DSLR.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Fisheries, 2012 I {{estimated}} the observer efficiency of spawning surveyors conducting foot surveys for live coho and Chinook salmon in Prairie Creek, Humboldt County, California, during the 2007 - 2008 spawning season, and in Prairie Creek {{and its main}} tributary, Lost Man Creek, during the 2008 - 2009 spawning season. A dual-mark recapture design was utilized whereby adult salmon caught at weirs below the spawning grounds were tagged with both passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags and externally-visible Peterson disc tags. An array of in-stream PIT interrogation antennae was used to monitor movement of tagged individuals {{into and out of}} survey reaches. Individuals that died within survey reaches, and whose exact date of mortality was unknown, were removed from the pool of observable tagged individuals through a process that involved estimating a range of probable dates of mortality from confidence intervals constructed around survey life estimates; the process produced two counts of tagged fish available to be observed ??? one based on removing individuals {{at the beginning of the}} estimated range of mortality, and one based on removing them at the end of the range. Survey life of tagged individuals was estimated as a linear function of date of arrival at the weir, condition upon arriving at <b>the</b> weir, <b>and</b> sex. Surveyors counted the numbers of tagged and untagged fish they observed on each spawning survey. Observer efficiency was calculated in two ways: observer efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the number of tagged fish observed on a given survey to the number of tagged individuals estimated to be present in the survey reach on the survey date from the antenna data (???comparison??? method); the second method involved alternately substituting the weir-based mark-recapture escapement estimate, <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> upper-bounds of its confidence interval, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> upper bounds of the confidence interval of the survey life estimate into the area-under-the-curve escapement estimation formula <b>and</b> solving for <b>the</b> observer efficiency term (???solution??? method). Due to a mid-season funding freeze and resulting lack of data, observer efficiency calculations were not possible for the 2008 - 2009 spawning season. Observer efficiency estimates obtained with the comparison method from the surveys conducted during the 2007 - 2008 spawning season ranged from 0 to 1, with a median value of 0. 167 based on the low count of tagged individuals available to be observed, and 0. 114 based on the high count.

We explore how common bridge jobs are among today’s retirees, and how uncommon traditional retirements have become. Methods: Using data from <b>the</b> Health <b>and</b> Retirement Study (HRS), we explore <b>the</b> work histories <b>and</b> retirement patterns of a cohort of retirees aged 51 to 61 in 1992 over a ten-year time period in both a cross-sectional and longitudinal context. Bridge job determinants are examined using bivariate comparisons and a multinomial logistic regression model of the bridge job decision. Results: We find that one-half to two-thirds of the HRS respondents with full-time career jobs take on bridge jobs before exiting the labor force completely. We also find that bridge job behavior is most common among younger respondents, respondents without defined-benefit pension plans, <b>and</b> respondents at <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> upper-end of <b>the</b> wage distribution.

We examined how serum Mg levels affect the association between serum phosphate levels <b>and</b> <b>the</b> risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. METHODS: A nationwide register-based cohort study was conducted using database of the Renal Data Registry of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy in 2009. We identified 142, 069 patients receiving in-center hemodialysis whose baseline serum Mg and phosphate levels were available. Study outcomes were one-year cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Serum Mg levels were categorized into three groups (lower, < 2. 7 mg/dL; intermediate, ≥ 2. 7, < 3. 1 mg/dL; and higher, ≥ 3. 1 mg/dL). RESULTS: During follow-up, 11, 401 deaths occurred, out of which 4, 751 (41. 7 %) were ascribed to cardiovascular disease. In multivariable analyses, an increase in serum phosphate levels elevated the risk of cardiovascular mortality in <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> intermediate-Mg groups, whereas no significant risk increment was observed in the higher-Mg group. Moreover, among patients with serum phosphate levels of ≥ 6. 0 mg/dL, the cardiovascular mortality risk significantly decreased with increasing serum Mg levels (adjusted odds ratios [95 % confidence intervals] of <b>the</b> <b>lower-,</b> intermediate-, <b>and</b> higher-Mg groups were 1. 00 (reference), 0. 81 [0. 66 - 0. 99], and 0. 74 [0. 56 - 0. 97], respectively.).

Using a panel data regression analysis, our results indicate that while all countries gain revenue from the presence of VAT, it is significantly more in developed countries, although the dummy VAT variable interacted with trade openness enters positively for <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> <b>and</b> upper middle-income groups. This proves the importance of trade for VAT revenues, but also that VAT combined with interaction variables is conducive to higher tax revenues. Economic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract–The {{technique}} of dyadic Green’s function (DGF) {{expressed in terms}} of the normalised cylindrical vector wave functions is adopted in this study for examining the electromagnetic fields excited by one thin circular loop antenna above a (un) grounded multi-layered chiral slabs. The current carried on such a circular loop antenna is expressed in a generalized Fourier series so as to incorporate practical situations. Thereby, exact representations of the radiated fields in both near and far zones are obtained in closed form, in a superposition of the right-and left-handed circularly polarized waves. Furthermore, numerical results are presented to show the radiation characteristics of the loop antenna in different layered chiral slab structures. The contributions of <b>the</b> <b>lower-</b> as well as higher-order current excitations to the far-zon...|$|R
40|$|The Sopelana sea-cliff section exposes a {{continuous}} marl-limestone alternation from the Lower Maastrichtian to the Danian, {{in the deep}} Basque Arc domain. The high-resolution analysis (% CaCO 3) of <b>the</b> <b>Lower-</b> Upper Maastrichtian couplets confirms a simple and regular layout versus a more complex behaviour of the Danian couplets. <b>The</b> marl <b>and</b> limestone mean values of the Upper Maastrichtian point out a continental debris enrichment. The early entry of deep, cold, oxygenated water produces a gradual (grey/ yellowgreenish/ red) change of coloration in the Lower Maastrichtian couplets. It {{is the beginning of}} the Cretaceous oceanic red beds (CORB´s). The “bleaching” around macrofossil nucleus and small fractures in the red facies shows a small diagenetic stage due to the influx of reducing fluid...|$|R
