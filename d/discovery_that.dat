5|$|As Vega {{had long}} {{been used as a}} {{standard}} star for calibrating telescopes, the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric. With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known, this will allow for improved instrument calibrations.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, several {{independent}} {{groups of}} experimenters in the mid-60s {{realized that the}} fringes encoded important information about dimensional changes occurring in the subject, and began intentionally producing holographic double exposures.

5|$|This is a {{timeline}} {{of the events}} relating to the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|After April's failed {{wedding to}} Matthew, Callie and Arizona {{bought a house}} together, a fresh start, away from the {{memories}} of their apartment. They later decided to try again for a second child. However, {{a trip to the}} OB/GYN led to the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus in the years since Sofia's birth, meaning she could not carry any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|Arabic astronomical {{contributions}} include Albatenius' <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> {{the direction}} of the Sun's apogee (the place in the Sun's orbit against the fixed stars where it seems to be moving slowest) is changing. (In modern heliocentric terms, this is caused by a gradual motion of the aphelion of the Earth's orbit). Ibn Yunus observed more than 10,000 entries for the Sun's position for many years using a large astrolabe.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E

Phlox makes the startling <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|Erected at {{the behest}} of the Illinois General Assembly, the University of Illinois Observatory became {{important}} in the development of astronomy due, in large part, to pioneering research by Dr. Stebbins, from 1907 to 1922. Joel Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 but left behind a legacy of <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> helped alter the face of modern astronomy. The building served the University of Illinois astronomy department from its opening until 1979, when the department moved into a new, larger building to house its growing staff.|$|E
5|$|Ferrochromium alloy is commercially {{produced}} from chromite by silicothermic or aluminothermic reactions and chromium metal by roasting and leaching processes followed by reduction with carbon and then aluminium. Chromium metal is of high value for its high corrosion resistance and hardness. A major development was the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> steel {{could be made}} highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration by adding metallic chromium to form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome plating (electroplating with chromium) together comprise 85% of the commercial use.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> the North Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and that the North Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states {{the sun in}} the state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau {{into the history of}} the seal led to the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the wording of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E

5|$|Melbourne spent {{ten weeks}} at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, having her new bow fitted. Following the repairs, Melbourne was {{involved}} in Strategic Reserve deployments and exercises in Southeast Asia from June until September 1964. During this deployment, the carrier visited Subic Bay, where the RAN performed flight deck trials with S-2 Tracker anti-submarine aircraft and A-4 Skyhawk attack fighters. The success of the trials, along with the <b>discovery</b> <b>that</b> Melbourne was able to operate both aircraft with relatively minor modification, led the Australian Government to approve the purchase of these aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Modelling {{the disease}} in various types of animals, such as the {{transgenic}} mouse developed in 1996, enabled larger scale experiments.

These advances have led to increasingly extensive research into the proteins involved with the disease, potential drug treatments, care methods, and the gene itself.|$|E
