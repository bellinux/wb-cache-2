5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> celebrate the success of their patient care and less <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E

5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky {{realized}} that since writing in 2000 the battle scene between {{the armies of}} Mayans and conquistadors, The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Troy, King Arthur, and other films had featured massive battle scenes. He felt less <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> mimic the scale and rewrote the battle to be mainly between Jackman's conquistador character and the Mayans. The director {{realized that}}, with one man against the army, the rewrite was a suitable metaphor for his film's theme of a man defying odds to do the impossible and conquer death.|$|E
5|$|As medical {{professionals}} become better {{informed about the}} interdependent relationship between physical, emotional, social, and spiritual pain, and the demonstrated benefit to physical pain from alleviation of these other forms of suffering, they may be <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> question the patient and family about interpersonal relationships. Unless the person has asked for such psychosocial intervention – or at least freely consented to such questioning – {{this would be an}} ethically unjustifiable intrusion into the patient's personal affairs (analogous to providing drugs without the patient's informed consent).|$|E
5|$|As word {{increased}} of Bayh's intentions, {{political scientists}} opined on the detractions of a run. Citing {{the fact that}} his eight years as governor may be nullified by its distance in time and that his visibility in the Senate was low, critics pondered whether moderate voters may be more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> line with possible candidate Mark Warner of Virginia. However, this criticism subsided once Warner decided against a run in October 2006.|$|E

5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{initially}} <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> {{go along with}} Kennedy's request that nuclear weapons be stationed on Canadian soil as part of NORAD. However, when an August 3, 1961, letter from Kennedy which urged this was leaked to the media, Diefenbaker was angered and withdrew his support. The Prime Minister was also influenced by a massive demonstration against nuclear weapons, which took place on Parliament Hill. Diefenbaker was handed a petition containing 142,000 names.|$|E
5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is the most massive of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance from the Sun) and an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> the ecliptic plane.|$|E

5|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns usually {{were not}} dated, {{although}} some, concerning {{withdrawal of money}} from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period hatt-ı hümayuns and irades had dates. Abdulhamid I was especially <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> date his hatt-ı hümayuns. His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ı hümayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III {{so that he could}} follow up whether his orders were carried out. However, this suggestion was not adopted. Abdulhamid II used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.|$|E
5|$|Henson's {{beliefs on}} {{doctrine}} were still forming, but he <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> high-churchmanship and {{was influenced by}} Charles Gore and the Puseyites, though he was unattracted by more extreme Anglo-Catholic forms of ritualism. With his suspicion of nonconformism he was a proponent {{of the principle of}} establishment– the maintenance of Anglicanism as the official state religion– and in 1886 he became secretary of the new Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church, to counter the threat of disestablishment proposed by politicians such as Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Dilke.|$|E

However Elizabeth Sneyd was not <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> accept Day.|$|E

5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that were {{closely tied to}} the political structure of the city. Some had acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first major group of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established formal and informal political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people in African-American neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white and increasingly Irish-American, seemed little <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> try to stop them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} regular {{planetary}} moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E
