500|$|I often {{experience}} combat as {{it should}} be. I see myself {{in the middle of}} a British [...] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E
500|$|Another {{writer who}} left the show during season two was David Gerrold. He wrote an episode for The Original Series called [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] and came {{on-board}} The Next Generation before the pilot and wrote {{the first version of}} the bible for the series. Rick Berman stated in an early memo that the new series was intended to be an issues-based show in the same mold as the original. Creator Gene Roddenberry concurred, and under questioning from fans at a convention which Gerrold also attended, Roddenberry agreed {{that it was time for}} a homosexual character to appear in Star Trek. Roddenberry told his staff that [...] "Times have changed and we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of it." [...] This resulted in Gerrold pitching a story called [...] "", which included two homosexual crew members and an AIDS allegory. Roddenberry cleared the idea to be produced into a script, and Gerrold went off to appear on a Star Trek cruise having received a telegram telling him that everyone in the office was pleased with the new story.|$|E

It <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> something that <b>has</b> some peculiar quality, which I {{do not know how}} to define, that belongs to logical propositions but not to others." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Marquis of Kingsbury, and Llwddythlw <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Duke of Merioneth. He never forgets {{it for a}} moment." ...|$|R
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2011 CPAC, {{during her}} question-and-answer segment, Coulter {{was asked about}} GOProud and the {{controversy}} over their exclusion from the 2011 CPAC. She boasted how she talked GOProud into dropping its support for same-sex marriage in the party's platform, saying, [...] "The left is trying to co-opt gays, and I don't think we should let them. I {{think they should be}} on our side," [...] and [...] "Gays are natural conservatives." [...] Later that year, Coulter joined advisory board for GOProud. On Logos [...] she told gay Republican Taylor Garrett that [...] "The gays <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pro-life," [...] and [...] "As soon as they find the gay gene, guess who the liberal yuppies are gonna start aborting?" [...] Coulter has referred to Democratic politicians Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and John Edwards as [...] "fag(got)." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{was brought}} {{straight}} to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size {{are you in the}} waist and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> joking'. I {{was the only one in}} the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [...] wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was reasonable in all fairness and I slept.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what has been}} spent so far on {{planning}} and preparing for each pilot cull and who exactly is paying for what, i.e. what taxpayers are paying for and what the farming industry is paying for. Costings of the culls have not factored in socio-economic costs, such as tourism and any potential boycotts of dairy products from the cull zones. Others opposed to the cull argue that for economic reasons the government have chosen the most inhumane approach to disease eradication. Tony Dean, Chairperson of the Gloucestershire Badger Group, warns that some badgers will not be killed outright: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good marksman to kill a badger outright, with one shot... Many of the badgers will be badly injured. They will go back underground after being shot, probably badly maimed. They will die a long lingering death underground from lead poisoning etc. We {{are going to have}} a lot of cubs left underground where their mothers have been shot above ground." [...] He also suggests that domestic pets will be at risk in the cull areas, as some farmers will mistake black and white cats and dogs for badgers.|$|E
