5|$|Perfect Dark {{includes}} a built-in rumble functionality into the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> and supports the Game Boy Printer, Game Link Cable, and Transfer Pak accessories. The Transfer Pak allows certain features within the Nintendo 64 game to alternatively be unlocked. Perfect Dark received generally a mixed reaction from video game critics, who criticized its superficial stealth mechanics and unoriginal mini-games, but praised its graphics and audio.|$|E
5|$|A {{multiplayer}} mini-game {{is included}} and allows two players to compete via the DS' wireless connection, only one player needs an Over the Hedge <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> for two separate DS consoles to play. Stella the skunk {{is available in}} this game mode, alongside the three playable characters from the main game. Players navigate a maze to collect food before the timer runs out. The player with the most food wins the game. A most of five pieces of food can be carried at once, these must be carried to a collection area before more food can be picked up.|$|E
5|$|Iridion began {{development}} as a shooter for the Game Boy Color; when Shin'en decided to drop development and shift their focus to the Game Boy Advance, Iridion was the first game by the developer {{to appear on the}} system. Though billed as a 3D game, Shin'en used realtime encoding and resizing to manipulate the size of 2D sprites instead of creating a true 3D environment. More room on the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> was available for graphics due to the game's use of the GAX Sound Engine, which allowed real-time decoding of song data in a small file size.|$|E
50|$|Nintendo {{licensed}} N.L.S. Industries to {{make two}} types of black wooden system organizers. Both feature a plastic drawer, bearing a Nintendo 64 sticker, with slots designed to hold Nintendo 64 <b>game</b> <b>cartridges,</b> controllers, and controller paks. The larger of these two organizers holds up to 24 <b>game</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and is designed to hold the Nintendo 64 {{on top of the}} organizer. The larger organizer is also designed to work with Super NES consoles, <b>game</b> <b>cartridges,</b> and controllers. The smaller organizer holds up to 12 <b>game</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R

Like ShareData, American <b>Game</b> <b>Cartridges</b> was headquartered in Chandler, Arizona. AGC published three video games for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1990.|$|R
5|$|Wave Race 64 is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Nintendo EAD {{and published by}} Nintendo. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Most of the game involves the player racing on a Jet Ski {{on a variety of}} courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> to another.|$|E
5|$|For Seiken Densetsu 3, Kikuta was {{assisted}} by a sound programmer, Hidenori Suzuki, which {{allowed him to}} compose over three {{times the amount of}} music he had created for Secret of Mana. The move to the PlayStation for Soukaigi allowed Kikuta to focus on creating live music for the soundtrack, rather than tweaking the synthesizer instruments to make the music files fit in the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> as he had to for the Super Nintendo. He used the added audio processing power to expand his musical creativity, including pieces such as songs in unintelligible Thai and Malaysian by Japanese singers. The game itself, however, was not a success, and Kikuta decided that he wanted more direct control over the next project he worked on.|$|E
5|$|Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles were {{originally}} planned {{as a single}} game. However, time was limited and the manufacturing costs of a 34-megabit cartridge with NVRAM would have been prohibitively expensive. Sonic Team split the game in half, giving the developers more time to finish the second part, and splitting the cost between two cartridges. The cartridge has {{a small amount of}} non-volatile RAM built into it, which allows the player to save game progress to the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge.</b> Sega planned to release a single cartridge version of both games titled Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Limited Edition, though it was eventually cancelled for unknown reasons; a prototype ROM image of this version was leaked in 2008.|$|E

5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through without missing, {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> to another.|$|E
5|$|The {{world is}} portrayed from a three-quarters {{overhead}} view. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal panning functions. Pop-up hints will guide the {{player in the}} early stages of the game, and other characters audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final medal ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a ghost copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the game saves to both the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> itself and external storage.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} several modes: Star Trip, Simple, Deluge, and Time Attack. Star Trip is Meteos story mode. Its plot {{centers on the}} evil planet Meteo sending its matter (the meteos) to other planets, killing life and {{destroying}} worlds. After three meteos fuse and launch themselves and other meteos into space, the civilizations on other planets plan a counterattack against Meteo. The player travels from planet to planet on the Metamo Ark, a warship made of metean ore. The story has branching paths, with the last level requiring the player to defeat Meteo itself. The Simple mode allowed a quick {{play of the game}} while letting the player change the rules, such as the difficulty and the number of lives they can have. The Deluge mode meanwhile lasts until the player dies. Time War has two goals: getting the high score in a limited time or launching as many meteos as possible from a set number. The game also has a multiplayer mode, where the player can send up to four other players a demo to play against each other with one <b>game</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E

5|$|Secret of Mana was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES <b>game</b> <b>cartridge,</b> which is much smaller {{than that of a}} CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, Level magazine claimed that Secret of Manas rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.|$|E

Meanwhile, developer Keith Rupp of American <b>Game</b> <b>Cartridges</b> completed a fourth title, Wally Bear and the NO! Gang, but AGC's financial difficulties preempted its release. Frick's new company secured {{the rights to}} the game, and published it in 1992.|$|R
25|$|Dragon Quest IX {{continues}} the Dragon Quest tradition of turn-based combat {{and is considered}} harder than the other Dragon Quest games before it. The game allows players to have a cooperative wireless multi-player experience with up to four players; it does not, however, feature multi-player capabilities via Nintendo Wi-Fi. Multiplayer play requires a <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> for each player. The game includes only one save slot, whereas most have at least three.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the standard digital release, a Sega Genesis-themed collector's edition was also released, containing a 12-inch (30cm) Sonic statue atop a model Genesis, a <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> cast with a golden ring, and a metallic collector's card with a download code for the game. To promote the collector's edition, Sega released a retro-styled infomercial featuring former series art director Kazuyuki Hoshino and social media manager Aaron Webber, based on an American television commercial for Sonic 2.|$|E
25|$|Nishi {{proposed}} MSX as {{an attempt}} to create a single industry standard for home computers. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders, many Japanese electronic manufacturers along with GoldStar, Philips and Spectravideo built and promoted MSX computers. Any piece of hardware or software with the MSX logo on it was compatible with MSX products of other manufacturers. In particular, the expansion cartridge form and function were part of the standard; any MSX expansion or <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> would work in any MSX computer.|$|E

25|$|The central {{processing}} unit is a 32-bit RISC chip, making the Virtual Boy Nintendo's first 32-bit system. The Virtual Boy system uses a pair of 1×224 linear arrays (one per eye) and rapidly scans the array across the eye's field of view using flat oscillating mirrors. These mirrors vibrate back and forth {{at a very high}} speed, thus the mechanical humming noise from inside the unit. Each Virtual Boy <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> has a yes/no option to automatically pause every 15–30 minutes so that the player may take a break before any injuries come to the eyes. One speaker per ear provides the player with audio.|$|E
25|$|In Design mode, {{players can}} edit color {{palettes}} for existing commanding officers (after the player has unlocked the palettes) or {{create their own}} maps. In the map editor, {{the size of the}} map is fixed and the player cannot choose to use any of the new Black Hole buildings introduced in Black Hole Rising. There are also certain rules the player must adhere to in order for the map to be considered playable. Maps created in this mode can be saved on the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> and can be played in multiplayer modes or sent and received to other game cartridges using multiple consoles with a Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable.|$|E
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges were clean and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the <b>game</b> <b>cartridge</b> copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E
