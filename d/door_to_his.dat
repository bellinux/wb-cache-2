5|$|Since Smyth {{still had}} his {{commitments}} at Princeton and Chicago, he could only work on the report part-time. He wrote the report {{in his office in}} Princeton's Palmer Laboratory. Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth's office and the one adjacent to it. The hallway <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office, where there was an armed guard. The guards worked in eight-hour shifts, and one was present around the clock. When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington, D.C., they went by military courier.|$|E
5|$|Farsari {{expanded}} his business interests into commercial photography and taught himself photography in 1883. In 1885 he formed {{a partnership with}} photographer Tamamura Kozaburō to acquire the Stillfried & Andersen studio (also known as the Japan Photographic Association), which had some 15 Japanese employees. The studio's stock included images by Felice Beato that it had acquired along with Beato's studio in 1877. It {{is not clear how}} long the partnership of Tamamura and Farsari lasted, for within a few years they were in competition with each other. Farsari further {{expanded his}} business in 1885 when the Yokohama Photographic Company (owned by David Welsh) folded and Farsari acquired its premises (next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own) and moved in. In addition to his Yokohama studio, Farsari likely had agents in Kobe and Nagasaki. By the end of 1886, Farsari and Chinese photographer Tong Cheong were the only foreign commercial photographers still operating in Japan, and by the following year even Tong Cheong had gone.|$|E

25|$|Then on 24 December, Darlan {{was assassinated}} in mysterious circumstances. On the {{afternoon}} of 24 December 1942, the admiral drove to his offices at the Palais d'Été and was shot down at the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> bureau by a young man of 20, Bonnier de la Chapelle, a monarchist. The young man was tried by court martial under Giraud's orders and executed on the 26th. With the strong backing of the Allies, especially Eisenhower, Giraud was elected to succeed Darlan.|$|E
25|$|Hackett {{lobbied for}} the {{creation}} of an African-American community hospital but was unsuccessful. In 1921, Hackett purchased the residence of former Territorial Governor Joseph Kibbey which was located next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house at 1342 E. Jefferson St.. In 1922, he established the Booker T. Washington Memorial Hospital a private medical in that residence. The hospital didn't have many beds at first and each bed was situated in the screened porch of the house. Hackett purchased three adjoining lots and was, therefore, able to expand the hospital. He also had six cottages built for tuberculosis patients. He charged his patients $12.50 to $35.00 per week for a hospital stay. Hackett opened a pharmacy nearby and recruited Southern African-American nurses with college nursing degrees to join his staff. One of the benefits which the African-American doctors and nurses gained from joining him was the opportunity to gain valuable experience in their chosen field.|$|E

It was expanded gradually, evolving from a square to a T-shaped plan with additions for a lounge, dining room and library. The homestead's doors are notably short, since Buster Estes was short and adapted the <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> dimensions.|$|R

After viewing an exhibition called [...] "Electric Lady" [...] next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> place of work, he went into business with the exhibition's manager and {{began his career as a}} showman of human oddities. He quickly became successful, for his patter as much as his exhibits, and was called the 'Silver King' by the American showman P. T. Barnum.|$|E

[...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.|$|E
500|$|Angus, {{the name}} he preferred, {{was born on}} the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands on the 10 May 1905. [...] His father, Thomas Lyall Paton, was a {{journalist}} and author. His mother, Janet, was the daughter of Easton Gibb, founder of Easton, Gibb & Son, a firm of civil engineering contractors. [...] His uncle on his mother's side, Alexander Gibb, was also a civil engineer; and had founded Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, where Paton would spend his professional career. [...] Paton left Jersey with his family in 1909 and spent a year in England before being sent to school in Boulogne-sur-Mer in France then Lausanne in Switzerland. [...] He returned to England at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914.

500|$|On 5 March 1495, Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a {{modestly}} successful {{cloth and}} silk merchant, becoming {{his third wife}} at age15. Lisa's dowry was 170florins and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, {{a sign that the}} Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and reason to think she and her husband loved each other. The property lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her social status because her husband's family may have been richer than her own. Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an [...] "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until 5March 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.|$|E
500|$|Merriam, scorned by the crew, {{finds that}} {{he can no longer}} lock the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> cabin. Fearing for his life, he tries to steal a gun from the ship's weapons locker, but is confronted by Captain Stone. Stone dares Merriam {{to try to get the}} support of the crew, but Merriam is rebuffed in this effort. This changes when Radioman Winslow (Edmund Glover) {{receives}} a radiogram asking if Merriam is on board, and Captain Stone orders Winslow to lie, replying that Merriam is not aboard. [...] The radioman shows Merriam the captain's reply radiogram and says that he now mistrusts the captain and will send a message to the company expressing his concerns about Stone's mental health. However, as he leaves Merriam's cabin, Winslow encounters the captain. As the two walk side-by-side, Winslow drops the captain's radiogram to the deck, and it is picked up by an illiterate crewman, Finn the Mute (Skelton Knaggs), whose internal monologues serve as a sort of one-man Greek chorus throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|The raiders {{successfully}} sneaked {{past the}} outer garrisons of provincial militia, and were first spotted in the pre-dawn light by a villager. [...] Firing his gun {{to raise the}} alarm, {{he ran for the}} village, with the French and Indians in noisy pursuit. [...] The action quickly became general as the raiders descended on the houses in the village. [...] One of the colonial garrisons was stationed in the home of the minister, Benjamin Rolfe, who had barred the door in an attempt to keep the raiders out. [...] Raiders fired through the door, wounding Rolfe, and then broke the door down. They then slaughtered Rolfe, his wife, infant child, and the colonial militiamen, who, [...] "paralyzed by fear", were begging for mercy. [...] In another house, one baby was thrown through an open window by a raider but suffered no injury. [...] A number of villagers escaped by hiding in cellars whose trapdoors were not discovered by the raiders. [...] Captain Wainwright was preparing to organize a defense when gunfire from the raiders passed through the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> house, killing him instantly.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of such an}} {{armoured}} figure {{appear in}} the 1633 painting attributed to Rembrandt in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and statues by Johann Baptist Straub (1770) and Johann Wilhelm Beyer (1773-80). In the latter she appears with the god Janus, since both {{were associated with the}} Roman ceremonies of declaring war.

500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several head shot photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him. Tom Wolfe characterised Shepard's dual personalities as [...] "Smilin' Al" [...] and the [...] "Icy Commander". [...] "Inside his locker", Wolfe wrote, [...] "he kept Smilin' Al of the Cape!" ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Stewart's lesser-known talents was his {{homespun}} poetry. Once, {{while on}} The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, he read a poem entitled [...] "Beau" [...] {{that he had}} written about his dog.

This was later parodied on a late 1980s episode of the NBC sketch show Saturday Night Live, with Dana Carvey as Stewart reciting the poem on Weekend Update and bringing anchor Dennis Miller to tears. He was also an avid gardener. Stewart purchased the house next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> Beverly Hills home, had it razed, and installed his garden on the lot.|$|E
