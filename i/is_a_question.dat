It <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of whether the {{undertaking}} would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> immediately remunerative concern; it <b>was</b> not <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of whether the railway should pay interest and sinking fund on the capital expended, or even if it would at once pay working expenses. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of preserving the predominance of Hong Kong.

5|$|Evolution {{also does}} not require that organisms become more complex. Although the history of life shows an {{apparent}} trend towards the evolution of biological complexity; there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> if this appearance of increased complexity is real, or if it comes from neglecting {{the fact that the}} majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes. In this view, complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution, but that specific circumstances of evolution on Earth frequently made greater complexity advantageous and thus naturally selected for. Depending on the situation, organisms' complexity can either increase, decrease, or stay the same, and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution.|$|E
5|$|When {{a pattern}} is called digital, this most often {{means that it}} is visibly {{composed}} of computer-generated pixels. The term is sometimes also used of computer generated patterns like the non-pixellated Multicam and the Italian fractal Vegetato pattern. Neither pixellation nor digitization contribute to the camouflaging effect. The pixellated style, however, simplifies design and eases printing on fabric, compared to traditional patterns. While digital patterns are becoming widespread, critics maintain that the pixellated look <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of fashion rather than function.|$|E

25|$|Ramsey's theorem is a {{foundational}} {{result in}} combinatorics. The {{first version of}} this result was proved by F. P. Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions {{for the existence of}} substructures with regular properties.

In that time it educated the engineers and brought the expertise to literally lay the infrastructure for a modern state. This included the fundamental infrastructure of electricity, water supplies and roads.|$|E

It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> whether Chalerm granted the right to Thaksin to establish IBC to benefit his close friend, seeing that the project had been denied by the previous administration. However, it turned out to be a money loser and he eventually merged the company with the CP Group's UTV.|$|E
25|$|AR Games is a {{compilation}} of several augmented reality mini-games and simple tools, which is pre-installed on every Nintendo 3DS, along with 6 paper cards that interact with certain games.

The sixth one <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> mark box from the Super Mario Bros. series. Nintendo has also published downloadable versions of this card in larger sizes.

25|$|We have {{no doubt}} that if the Legislature of this State should {{undertake}} to proscribe for any offense against its laws the punishment of burning at the stake, breaking at the wheel, etc., it would be the duty of the courts to pronounce upon such attempt the condemnation of the Constitution. The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E

25|$|As a {{primitive}} of the theory, {{the status of}} these functions is much different than in some constituency grammars. Traditionally, constituency grammars derive the syntactic functions from the constellation. For instance, the object is identified as the NP appearing inside finite VP, and the subject as the NP appearing outside of finite VP. Since DGs reject {{the existence of a}} finite VP constituent, they were never presented with the option to view the syntactic functions in this manner. The issue <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of what comes first: traditionally, DGs take the syntactic functions to be primitive and they then derive the constellation from these functions, whereas constituency grammars traditionally take the constellation to be primitive and they then derive the syntactic functions from the constellation.|$|E
25|$|Relieved Davis and {{appointed}} D. D. Porter to the Western Flotilla, which is hereafter {{to be recognized}} as a squadron. Porter is but a Commander. He has, however, stirring and positive qualities, is fertile in resources, has great energy, excessive and sometimes not over-scrupulous ambition, is impressed with and boastful of his own powers, given to exaggeration in relation to himself, a Porter infirmity, is not generous to older and superior living officers, whom he is too ready to traduce, but is kind and patronizing to favorites who are juniors, and generally to official inferiors.

25|$|Throughout his {{international}} career, Moin had {{to compete}} with another wicket-keeper, Rashid Latif. Moin kept wickets in the 1992 Cricket World Cup which Pakistan won and the 1999 Cricket World Cup where Pakistan finished runners up. Latif kept wickets in the 1996 Cricket World Cup and the 2003 Cricket World Cup. Despite close rivalries, Moin is mostly remembered as the better player as their performance after the glove-work came onto how they batted. Despite having a significantly similar Test batting average, Moin had a higher ODI average than Latif and scored more runs than Latif in international cricket. However, Moin had the keeping record of 2.14 dismissals per test against Latif 3.51 per test. Moreover, in all time Pakistani XI Latif picks as wicket-keeper and hence 69 test matches of Moin <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> mark in Rashid Latif tenure.|$|E
