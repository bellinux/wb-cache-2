This report describes standard noncommercial software licensing alternatives as defined by U. S. government and Department of Defense (DoD) regulations.

There are three standard license types for noncommercial computer software: Unlimited, Government Purpose, and Restricted. Each of these license types for noncommercial computer software conveys different rights to the agency. This report presents distinguishing characteristics of the three standard license types, a method to develop the supporting rationale or traceability for DoD agency needs, a high-level <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> that fall outside of standard license types, and a discussion of the importance of deliverables as necessary components for implementing license rights...|$|E

40|$|The {{methods for}} {{multiple}} operator deconvolution of Berenstein, Taylor, and Yger are examined {{for the case}} of the addition of a noise signal after each of the multiple convolutions and preceding the deconvolutions. It is shown that for strongly coprime multiple operators there is an obvious choice for optimal deconvolvers. The case of m strongly coprime, parallel convolvers with m independent noise sources is compared to m identical, parallel convolvers with m independent, identically distributed noise sources. A performance criterion is defined. The performance for selected collections of strongly coprime convolvers is shown to be at least as good as that for the corresponding collection of an equal number of identical, parallel convolvers. That is, there is no penalty for the additional frequency response available with deconvolution, at least for the noncompactly supported optimal deconvolvers. Qualitative methods are developed to characterize the properties of strongly coprime configurations. These methods enable the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> in which it is advantageous to use strongly coprime multiple detectors of large support...|$|E

The neglect experience was captured in the overarching theme, "getting the left right," which encompasses the two subthemes of (a) surreal awareness of the left and (b) emergence of a different world. Patients had unclear perceptions of their own body and surroundings, their attention was brittle, and they encountered bewildering reactions from other people. They simultaneously pursued the ineffable neglected space and searched for coherence. The vulnerability, loss, and conflicting perceptions that patients with neglect face should be acknowledged and alleviation sought. Facilitating methods should provide additional opportunities for patients to communicate their experiences. We underscore the importance of readjusting the current approaches of neglect and emphasizing meaningfulness in professional guidance...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to better {{understand}} the triggers of suicide, particularly among the ‎ancient Greek and Persian soldiers and commanders. ‎ Method: ‎‘Herodotus: The Histories’ is a history of the rulers and soldiery who participated in the ‎Greco-Persian wars (492 - 449 BCE). A new translation (2013) of this manuscript was studied. ‎Accounts of suicide were collected and collated, with <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> ‎methods, and probable triggers. ‎ Results: Nine accounts of suicide were identified. Eight of these were named individuals (4 Greeks ‎and 4 Persians); of whom, seven were male. Only one (not the female) appeared to act in ‎response to a mental disorder. Other triggers of suicide included guilt, avoidance of ‎dishonour/ punishment and altruism. Cutting/ stabbing was the most common method; others ‎included hanging, jumping, poison, and burning (the single female). ‎ Conclusion : While soldiers at a time of war do not reflect the general community, they are nevertheless ‎members of their society. Thus, this evidence demonstrates that suicide triggered by ‎burdensome circumstances (in addition to mental disorder) was known to the Greek and ‎Persian people more than two millennia ago. ‎</p...|$|R
