40|$|In {{this paper}} a design method for the tension side of statically loaded, bolted beam-to-column {{connections}} is developed {{based on the}} plastic behaviour of the flanges and the bolts {{under the assumption that}} the plastification is large enough to allow the adoption of the most favourable static equilibrium. Until now bolted beam-to-column connections without stiffening plates welded between the column flanges have been generally avoided. The {{reason for this is that}} the deformations of the connection are considerable and, until now, a formula which allows the determination of the stiffness and strength of a column flange has been lacking. This paper presents the derivation of an "effective" length formula for a column <b>flange</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> without stiffening plates between the flanges. The derivation is based on the analysis of two different collapse mechanisms. One mechanism occurs if bolt failure governs collapse. The other mechanism corresponds to collapse resulting from the full plastification of the column flanges. Tests are discussed that were performed to insure that the developed design rules would lead to connections that would satisfy the limit state of deformations as given in the Dutch regulations for constructional steel work (for both) serviceability and ultimate limit states.

40|$|The current paper {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} an extensive pre-test numerical investigation program carried out with the aim to validate the design procedure for bolted beamto- column connections with haunches. In {{the first part of}} the paper, a description is made with regard to the analytical procedure that was used for the design of full strength and rigid joints. The results from the pre-test numerical simulations are further presented for each beam-to-column joint assembly, in terms of overall response (moment-rotation curve, failure mechanism), as well as local response, particularly the behavior of joint components (stress distribution, plastic strain, force level in the preloaded bolts). Finite element simulations highlighted that plastic deformations occurred in the beam close to the end of the haunch. In addition, minor plastic deformations were observed in the bolts close to the beam <b>flange</b> <b>in</b> <b>tension,</b> and therefore also higher force levels compared to the computed design capacity. As a result, the design procedure was adjusted with the aim of keeping the non-dissipative components of the joints in the elastic range. Additional information is presented with regard to the position of the plastic hinge, the effect of preloaded bolts, the distribution of forces in bolt rows and the change of the lever arm due to the presence of the haunch in compression zone. The main conclusions of the study are finally presented...|$|E

The curved beam approach and manufacturers software were employed to predict strength. Seven remediation techniques were investigated initially, and remediation effectiveness was evaluated based on strength, stiffness, and ease of installation/cost. The oriented strand board (OSB) collar remediation worked very well and returned 8 out of 12 series of joists to a strength statistically equivalent to the “No Hole” condition. The OSB collar was not quite as effective in returning stiffness to the joists, but was easier to install and less expensive than a laminated strand lumber patch...|$|R
40|$|In a simply {{supported}} composite bridge girder the concrete is in compression over {{the full length}} of the bridge, whereas in a continuous multispan bridge some regions of the bridge are subjected to negative bending moment, in which case the concrete goes into tension. With respect to fatigue behavior of stud shear connectors, one key difference between placing studs in the positive and negative moment regions is the stress state of the base metal of the beam flange. The fact that the beam <b>flange</b> is <b>in</b> <b>tension</b> {{at the base of the}} studs in the negative moment region raises questions about whether this affects their fatigue endurance.

A heat-straightening repair of the damaged beams was proposed. Detailed analysis using both hand calculations and the finite-element method confirmed the structural adequacy of the bridge to undergo the heat-straightening process. These checks encompassed the temporary conditions prior to, during and after the heating. The major heat-straightening process was successfully completed on site in ten days. Impact damage to the beams was repaired within acceptable tolerances and the straightened steel was subjected to hardness and magnetic particle investigation testing. The repairs to Brockhampton Road new bridge were concluded without undue disruption to the travelling public or local residents. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate methods to remediate a wood I-joist with a single, circular hole in the web while leaving utilities in place. The methods were experimentally evaluated with a full-scale bending test using four equally spaced point loads. There were three depths of joists with varying flange widths and two span lengths (4. 88 m & 2. 44 m). Failure modes for the long span joists without holes were <b>in</b> the <b>flanges</b> <b>in</b> either <b>tension,</b> compression or lateral buckling; but once a hole was introduced the majority were classified as shear failures. Effectiveness of the remediation was evaluated based on three criteria: strength, stiffness, and ease of installation/cost. The OSB collar patch was effective for 8 out of the 12 series tested. A maximum reduction of load from a joist with no hole to one with a hole was 49 % for the long span and 58 % for the short span. The OSB collar was not as effective in returning stiffness to the joists, but was easier to install and less expensive than the LSL patch...|$|R
40|$|The current {{research}} work investigates the behaviour {{of steel and}} composite beams as well as beam-to-column connections at elevated temperatures. Significant attention is needed to identify the main issues, as the behaviour is profoundly different from that at ambient temperature. Local buckling of the beam flange outstands {{has been found to}} be highly significant in accelerating the development of catenary action in fire, since this action is reliant on hinges forming which may result from local buckling. Local buckling of the beam web, which experiences a non-uniform temperature variation, is also important because the mechanical properties of the steel are degraded non-uniformly from their ambient values. Current formulations for web buckling at ambient temperature therefore need substantial revision at elevated temperatures. Very large compressive forces are developed within the beams initially and these induce large stresses in the column web; hitherto this has not been considered. Developing a formulation representing the mechanics of this potential failure zone in the column web in the compression region of the connection is a useful and needed addition to research in the topic. Predicting the critical temperature in a connection that causes failure of the bolts, end plate and column <b>flange</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tension</b> zone of the connection is considered in this research work. An elastic analysis of a panel zone in a rigid or semi-rigid joint in a steel frame, which is based on simple equilibrium considerations that takes into account the shear and flexural deformations of the panel zone, is developed at elevated temperatures. In order to model the structural response of a composite beam restrained by cooler members in a steel compartment fire in a frame structure at elevated temperature, recourse is needed to a geometric nonlinear formulation, since the beam transverse deflections are not negligible and the axial compressive force in the member is also substantial at the early stages of the fire. This thesis presents such a formulation, which incorporates partial interaction between the concrete slab and steel component, as well as the degradation of the stiffnesses of the components of the composite beam prior to yield at elevated temperature...|$|R

40|$|A refined {{component}} model is proposed {{to predict the}} inelastic monotonic response of exterior and interior beam-to-column joints for partial-strength composite steel–concrete moment-resisting frames.

40|$|International audienceBoth {{experimental}} evidence and 3 D finite element analyses indicate that contact forces between the connected parts influence the behaviour of bolted T-stub and L-stub connections <b>in</b> <b>tension.</b> <b>In</b> the present paper, a mechanical model that predict the elastic behaviour of such connections is developed. The model {{relies on the}} enhanced beam theory, proposed by Baluch et al. [13], to describe the mechanical response of the <b>flanges</b> <b>in</b> both the contact and the non-contact regions.

Furthermore, the length of the contact zone in a non-preloaded connection appears to be independent from the magnitude of the external force. Several simplifications have been proposed to facilitate the determination of the separation length which is the primary unknown of the problem. To validate the analytical and calculation models, a 3 D finite element model has been developed. Analytical and numerical results are in good agreement which demonstrates the validity of the proposed mechanical model.
