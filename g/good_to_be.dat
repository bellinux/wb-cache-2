25|$|This {{initiated}} {{a period of}} active involvement in water policy by the government, {{based on the principle}} that water is a social <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either provided free of charge or subsidised. As a result, water tariffs between 1970 and 1981 were heavily subsidised and in contradiction with the principle of operating cost recovery. Throughout the 1960s, the Environmental Sanitation Programme supported by WHO-UNICEF was carried out in Kenya with the aims of developing water supplies for small rural communities, improving waste disposal methods and providing sanitary education for the rural population.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Lawler {{appeared}} in the movie Man on the Moon, starring Jim Carrey. According to Lawler's autobiography, It's <b>Good</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> The King... Sometimes, an incident involving Jim Carrey forgetting a line led to animosity between the two actors during filming. Between scenes Jim Carrey often remained in character as Andy Kaufman {{and at one point}} spit on Jerry, just as Kaufman had done in 1982. A 'stunned' Lawler reacted by grabbing Carrey by the hair and locked him in a sleeper hold and jerking his neck—supposedly sending Carrey to the hospital.|$|E

Sandé said people didn't know what do with her, it was just her and her piano, which was very stripped, it was completely different from what everyone was used to and different from everything that was currently out. However, she stressed that it is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> different and not predictable.|$|E

50|$|It is {{a common}} feature of most tax systems that taxes are not raised on <b>goods</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exported. <b>To</b> do so would place the goods at a {{disadvantage}} to those from other countries.

In recent years, Falsk has begun a second career as a public speaker, and has been hired in this capacity by many of Norway's largest companies. He has also continued his writing career by releasing the crime novel Elsk din neste in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In economics, many {{problems}} involve multiple objectives along with constraints on what combinations of those objectives are attainable. For example, consumer's demand for various goods {{is determined by}} the process of maximization of the utilities derived from those goods, subject to a constraint based on how much income is available to spend on those goods and on the prices of those goods. This constraint allows more of one <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> purchased only at the sacrifice of consuming less of another good; therefore, the various objectives (more consumption of each good is preferred) are in conflict with each other. A common method for analyzing such a problem is to use a graph of indifference curves, representing preferences, and a budget constraint, representing the trade-offs that the consumer is faced with.|$|E
25|$|There were no {{poor people}} {{in the land of}} Oz, because {{there was no such thing}} as money, and all {{property}} of every sort belonged to the Ruler. Each person was given freely by his neighbors whatever he required for his use, which is as much as anyone may reasonably desire. Every one worked half the time and played half the time, and the people enjoyed the work as much as they did the play, because it is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> occupied and to have something to do. There were no cruel overseers set to watch them, and no one to rebuke them or to find fault with them. So each one was proud to do all he could for his friends and neighbors, and was glad when they would accept the things he produced.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} time in 'Australian Idol' history there were 13 finalists. This came about during the Wildcard Verdict show on 5 September 2005. The judges {{initially}} chose James Kannis and Emily Williams to go through to the final. This left one spot which was chosen by the Australian public. Out of the remaining contestants the two that received the highest votes were Daniel Spillane and Roxane Lebrasse. With only 1% between them, Dan was announced as the final member of the Top 12. This meant Roxane had missed out yet again. The judges decided however that Roxane was too <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left out of the Top 12 so they made it a Top 13. The catch was that two contestants were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the finals.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a similar}} premise to the {{previous}} game, Danganronpa 2 puts players in control of Hajime Hinata, an amnesiac boy who has just become one of Hope's Peak Academy's 'Ultimate' students, alongside fifteen others. The students find themselves taken to the remote tropical Jabberwock Island by their alleged teacher, a small, rabbit-like mascot named Usami, who claims {{it to be a}} simple field trip. However, things turn out to be too <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true as Hope's Peak Academy's notorious principal, Monokuma, announces they are stuck on the island for life unless they can murder another student and get away with it. If the students can determine a murderer in a Class Trial, that culprit is executed, but if they make the wrong assumption, then the killer walks home free whilst everyone else is sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|Whitesnake {{broke up}} in 1991. Three years later, Greatest Hits was {{released}} as the band's first compilation album, reaching number 4 on the UK Albums Chart and being certified gold by the BPI. The band returned with Restless Heart in 1997, which peaked at number 34 in the UK. In 2002 the band returned {{on a permanent}} basis. The 2003 compilation Best of Whitesnake reached number 44 in the UK and was certified gold by the BPI, while the 2006 video release Live... in the Still of the Night reached number 2 on the UK Music Video Chart and was also certified gold. Whitesnake's tenth studio album <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Bad was released in 2008, reaching number 7 in the UK and number 62 in the US. In 2011, the band reached number 33 with Forevermore and number 81 with Live at Donington 1990, in 2013 they reached number 67 with Made in Japan, and in 2015 they reached number 18 with The Purple Album.|$|E

25|$|His {{method was}} the {{deduction}} of {{the propriety of}} certain actions from the consideration of the character and position of rational agents in the universe. He argues that all {{that we see in}} nature is framed so as to avoid and reject what is dangerous to the integrity of its constitution; that the human race would be an anomaly in the world had it not for end its conservation in its best estate; that benevolence of all to all is what in a rational view of the creation is alone accordant with its general plan; that various peculiarities of man's body indicate that he has been made to co-operate with his fellow men and to maintain society; and that certain faculties of his mind show the common <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more essentially connected with his perfection than any pursuit of private advantage. The whole course of his reasoning proceeds on, and is pervaded by, the principle of final causes.|$|E
25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the <b>Good</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E
