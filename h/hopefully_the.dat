5|$|In 1997, {{a studio}} theatre was {{built at the}} rear of the {{building}} on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled <b>Hopefully.</b> <b>The</b> 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe, starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{before and after the}} first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that <b>hopefully</b> <b>the</b> weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate should be left to the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E
25|$|The {{dividend}} is <b>hopefully</b> <b>the</b> payout {{that the}} assignee issues, once all creditors' claims have been vetted {{and all the}} assets have been sold. The assignee hopes to generate enough cash to provide a one for one redemption of a creditor's claims. This is the hope the reality varies vastly, depending on the price the assets fetched when sold. Most dividends are {{in the form of}} cash back to the creditor, but not necessarily all. There may not even be a dividend in certain instance, thus no creditor receives any payment. There is no way to determine the cash value of an asset in the assignment process, regardless of past estimates. Tangible assets cash value can usually, but not always, be reasonably estimated. Intangible assets such as intellectual property or processes are much more difficult to evaluate.|$|E

500|$|Maura O'Malley of Bustle also lauded the {{development}} of the character ahead of season 12 saying, [...] "When the series began, Meredith was just a girl sitting in a bar celebrating the exciting next phase of her life. She had graduated medical school, she was starting her residency at a prestigious hospital, and she was simply looking for a no-strings attached, one night stand. What she got instead was a complicated romantic relationship that rivals Romeo and Juliet — but the key is, she wasn't searching for love. Working and learning were — and continue to be — her priorities, while McDreamy was simply an added perk. <b>Hopefully,</b> <b>the</b> new season of Grey's Anatomy will reflect this change in tone, because Meredith is a strong, independent woman — and she will be just fine." ...|$|E
500|$|Oh said of Yang's {{expressions}} of emotions during season eight: [...] "You see her express her emotions {{with only two}} people: her best friend Meredith and her husband Owen. To see someone being pulled apart so intensely, which honestly most everyone goes through in their life in some ways, if you're lucky you're completely pulled apart {{and then you have}} to pull yourself together, which hopefully will be the exploration within <b>hopefully</b> <b>the</b> next season." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{infantry}} commander was Lieutenant Colonel Freeman E. Franklin. The 34th Ohio Volunteer Infantry {{was also}} known as [...] "Piatt's Zouaves" [...] or the [...] "1st Ohio Zouaves", and typically served as a mounted infantry, including in this expedition. As mounted infantry, Piatt's Zouaves used horses for transportation, but (unlike cavalry) fought dismounted. Their infantry weapons were heavier and had longer range than the light weapons used by cavalry. Colonel Abram S. Piatt, who retired in 1862 after injuries, was their original commander. [...] Piatt's Zouaves wore distinctive caps and uniforms trimmed in red, but did not always have the Asian-style baggy pants with open jackets typical of zouave units. Regiments that dressed as zouaves during the Civil War were copying the look (and <b>hopefully</b> <b>the</b> discipline) of elite French troops that fought successfully during the 1850s in northern Africa.|$|E

500|$|Kesha {{explained}} that she wanted the song to become a pride anthem; [...] "I wanted to inspire people ... to be themselves. It's a celebration of any sort of quirks or eccentricities." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>the</b> song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I just felt like people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E
500|$|Terri Schwartz of IGN {{scored the}} premiere 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, and praising {{the introduction of}} Ghost Rider and subsequent darker tone which [...] "will eventually allow [...] to sit more comfortably beside its corporate cousins over on Netflix". Schwartz was positive about the smaller cast compared to the previous season, which meant that the episode [...] "doesn't feel as overstuffed as it would have", and of Coulson not finding Johnson and asking her to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. straight away after the newly established status quo. Schwartz did feel {{that there were some}} [...] "growing pains" [...] with the transition to more mature material, particularly criticizing the [...] "sexy" [...] opening of the episode with Johnson because [...] "S.H.I.E.L.D. has already done a great job establishing Daisy as a sexy character without needing to depict it in this unsubtle way. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of more overt sexuality in the show feels a bit more organic to the show as it continues".|$|E
500|$|Pat Nason of United Press International (UPI) {{wrote that}} {{marketing}} {{of the book}} [...] "may have been somewhat complicated by the cover art", which shows an actor in a gorilla costume with his middle finger raised, taken from the 1976 film A*P*E. Wilson had originally wanted the gorilla picture {{to appear on the}} back cover of the book; however, Warner Books stated it must appear on the book's front cover. [...] "It might stand as an apt emblem of the Razzies themselves," [...] commented Nason. [...] "We are not PC. We do not pull punches. We do not pay attention to the basic rules of decorum. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>the</b> humor with which it is packaged takes a little of the sting out of it", said Wilson to UPI. Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade described the book as [...] "a merchandising tie-in" [...] to the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson announced the nominees for the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards at a book signing for The Official Razzie Movie Guide at Brentano's in Century City, Los Angeles, California.|$|E

On the same day, Variety announced that the short would be released in early 2015 under the title Frozen Fever, with Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee returning as co-directors, Peter Del Vecho returning as producer and a new song by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez. Olaf the snowman would also make an appearance in the short. On December 3, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Aimee Scribner would be a co-producer and that Frozen Fever would debut in theaters alongside Walt Disney Pictures' Cinderella on March 13, 2015. In late December, the co-directors told the Associated Press [...] "There is something magic about these characters and this cast and this music. <b>Hopefully,</b> <b>the</b> audiences will enjoy the short we're doing, but we felt it again. It was really fun." [...] Around the same time, Dave Metzger, who worked on the orchestration for Frozen, disclosed he was already at work on Frozen Fever.|$|E
500|$|... "We R Who We R" [...] was {{released}} as the EP's lead single on October 22, 2010. Kesha {{said she was}} affected by the recent teenage suicides, in particular the suicide of Tyler Clementi, a young man [...] who committed suicide after being outed as gay by his roommate. She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected [...] having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are." [...] With the release, Kesha stated that she hoped that the song would become an anthem for [...] "weirdos", and said, [...] "Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>the</b> song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are." [...] "We R Who We R" [...] debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, selling over 280,000 digital copies. With this feat, the song became the seventeenth song {{in the history of the}} chart to debut at number one. The song also reached number one in Australia, the United Kingdom and number two in Canada, while charting within the top ten in numerous other countries.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Vulture, Scott Meslow gave [...] "Laws of Nature" [...] 4 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "as the Marvel Cinematic Universe {{has gotten}} bigger and weirder, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has gotten bigger and better, and [...] "Laws of Nature" [...] {{is a strong}} premiere that shows off just how much this TV series has evolved." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B-, with his {{highlights}} the reveal that Simmons is on another planet, which would allow the series interesting story opportunities. Conversely, Sava felt elements of the episode were too procedural and [...] "a surplus of infodumps that drag the pacing," [...] and, unlike Goldman, felt leaving out May and Ward was [...] "a big reason why this premiere is an underwhelming reintroduction to this world." [...] He concluded, [...] "There’s lots of potential for this season to address the moral complications of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s mission, and <b>hopefully</b> <b>the</b> writers will use the themes of Civil War to explore the murky ethics of capturing and holding superpowered people against their will ... the transition into the age of Inhumanity {{may be a little}} rocky, but there’s enough substance in this premiere to suggest a promising season ahead." [...] Meslow and Sava both indicated their pleasure in the introduction of Joey Gutierrez, who Meslow noted appeared to be the first openly gay character in the MCU.|$|E

500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN rated [...] "Stewie Kills Lois" [...] a 9/10, while rating [...] "Lois Kills Stewie" [...] a 9.4/10, saying [...] "For the {{hundredth}} episode of Family Guy, Seth McFarlane and friends tackle {{the subject of}} one of Stewie Griffin's greatest ambitions— his not-so-secret desire to kill his mother. For the disturbed fans waiting for some form of a matricidal manifestation, you can feel comfort knowing, without spoiling too much, that the youngest Griffin absolutely means business and ensures that he doesn't fail this time around. [...] There are some tense courtroom moments, a birthday celebration with the gift of Lionel Richie, a cruise ship, machine guns, and the reappearance of the Kool Aid Man that help round out this carefully crafted and well-told cohesive storyline. With the amount of cheap manatee jokes kept to a reasonable level, this episode also manages to find an excellent balance between comedy and storytelling. It's a fantastic way to celebrate the Family Guy one-hundredth episode milestone. [...] With the writers' strike in full effect, it seems {{that this might be}} the last new episode of Family Guy we'll be seeing for a while. It's a bittersweet way to end the abruptly short season as the quality is reminiscent of the series' brilliance from the early years and it seems like the show was really starting to hit its stride for the season. <b>Hopefully</b> <b>the</b> series will be able {{to live up to the}} high bar set by this two-part classic upon its eventual return." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Creep" [...] has {{not only}} been covered, {{it has also been}} sampled and recreated by many hip-hop and R artists. Two of the notable ones were {{released}} on SoundCloud in 2013 and gained many attention from the public are Haitian-Canadian record producer Kaytranada's remix of the song called [...] "Kaytranada's Creepier Edition" [...] in January and GoldLink's own rap rendition in December. Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately knew I had to at least try to get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with ! Luckily when she heard the record she loved it! <b>Hopefully</b> <b>the</b> fans will too!," [...] Bellinger said in a statement sent to MTV News. In the track, its new content finds Bellinger making promises to never cheat on his lover. The original [...] "Creep" [...] also made its appearance on The Game's [...] "Sex Skit" [...] from his album The Documentary 2.5, released in October 2015. In February 2016, singer Zendaya sampled the song for her single [...] "Something New" [...] with Chris Brown. [...] "Well the song, when I first heard it, already had that TLC sample in it. And that's kind of what I think made me want to record it. That was literally the first thing I heard was 'Do do, do,' , and I was like, 'Oh, yes. Yes, please.'," [...] she shared.
