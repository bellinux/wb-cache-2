40|$|The {{development}} of a thermal imaging device which operates {{on the principle of}} differential evaporation (or condensation) of oil on a thin membrane is described. Section I,A summarizes the requirements of any thermal imaging method and develops the theory as applied to the particular case of the <b>Evaporograph,</b> emphasizing the consideration of scene temperatures near 20 'C. It is shown that the greatest component of irradiance at the membrane is utilized in the evaporation of the oil layer. A presentation system which forms a visible image based on the phenomenon of light interference to detect differences in the thickness of the oil film is described. Theoretical calculations based on this system, assuming a reasonable minimum detectable thickness difference, indicate that a temperature difference of 1 0 C in the scene can be detected with an f = 2 optical system. Experimental results confirm this. The application of the <b>Evaporograph</b> to quantitative measurements is indicated. Section I,B describes experimental work on the three components of the <b>Evaporograph,</b> the infrared optical system, the transducer or cell, and the visual optical system. The two commercial models which have evolved from this work are described. These Evaporographs can detect a temperature difference of 1 0 C from a 20 'C background and have a resolution of 10 lines per mm. Various applications are pictured and described...|$|E
