5|$|Meanwhile, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) {{is forced}} to choose between Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) and a new man, Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not <b>even</b> <b>say</b> he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E
25|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{have seen}} ignosticism as {{a variation of}} agnosticism or atheism, while others have considered it to be distinct. An ignostic maintains that he cannot <b>even</b> <b>say</b> whether he is a theist or an atheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, Jordanes' conversio {{may mean}} that {{he had become a}} monk, or a religiosus, or a member of the clergy. Some manuscripts say that he was a bishop, some <b>even</b> <b>say</b> bishop of Ravenna, but the name Jordanes is not known in the lists of bishops of Ravenna.|$|E

25|$|Canvey {{has its own}} 'lady of the lake' in {{the form}} of a woman who was drowned there many years ago. Local stories are sketchy, some <b>even</b> <b>say</b> it was a man who drowned, but the {{majority}} speak of a female ghost who has wandered the area since her horse-drawn carriage plummeted into the lake. A recent clean-up of the lake found remains of two horses and fragments of a wooden carriage.|$|E
25|$|Episkoposes are the Overseers of sects of Discordianism, {{who have}} presumably {{created their own}} sect of Discordianism. They speak to Eris {{through the use of}} their pineal gland. It is said in the Principia Discordia that Eris says {{different}} things to each listener. She may <b>even</b> <b>say</b> radically different things to each Episkopos but, all of what she says is equally her word (even if it contradicts another iteration of her word).|$|E
25|$|In April 1725, the seven-year-old infanta {{was sent}} back to Madrid — Louis did not <b>even</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to her. A new {{candidate}} was sought urgently because, should Louis die with no heir, and assuming Philippe V of Spain did not seize the throne, then it would pass to the new duc d'Orléans, son of the deceased regent; the House of Orléans and the House of Condé were rivals, so this would cast Monsieur le Duc into the political wastelands.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{scarcely}} a man yet," [...] Rupert said, laughing. [...] "I am just twenty now; {{it is rather}} {{more than four years}} since we parted, without <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye." ...|$|R

25|$|One could <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that in {{the years}} before 1780 the {{prospects}} of the economy were improving: because of the economic growth in the German hinterland there were possibilities of growth in distributional trade in colonial commodities, and industrial products (Dutch or other European). Such possibilities were indeed realized in the 20th century, when the Netherlands again became a major distributional hub. The agricultural sector still enjoyed high productivity, whereas the nearby British markets for dairy products and produce offered opportunities for increased exports (which were indeed soon realized). Only, the high-cost structure of the labor market, high taxes, structural overvaluation of the guilder, all militated against most forms of industrial production, let alone export industries. Without the necessary reforms to remedy these problems the Netherlands were unlikely to participate in the industrial renaissance that Great Britain, and later other neighboring countries, started to experience {{in the latter part of}} the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Product {{placement}} for {{the film}} includes a cookie from the restaurant chain Eat'n Park and Papa John's Pizza. [...] The use of pizza delivery by Papa John's Pizza in the film was regarded by Common Sense Media, a media website for parents, reviewer Heather Boerner, as [...] "overly integrated product placement". [...] She criticized the product placement, writing, [...] "Not only is the pizza delivery guy included {{in more than half}} of the DVD, but the logo is present and the kids are shown munching ecstatically on the pizza at the end of the movie. [...] They <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that the pizza is great, and how the delivery guy was nice. It's enough to make a commercial-conscious parent gag".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship. The lyric [...] "A rubber band is what I call your love for me, cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline" [...] was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, you can <b>even</b> <b>say</b> it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb". Toward the closing moments, she sings, [...] "Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{working for}} Rita and Zedd, Finster is never really an evil character, {{but rather an}} {{eccentric}} artist. He at one point <b>even</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "sometimes it's no fun being a bad guy".|$|R

5000|$|In {{the popular}} {{television}} show ALF, season four, episode five we see ALF {{taking on the}} heavy topic of TA with direct reference to OKness, and <b>even</b> <b>says</b> to Willie, [...] "I'm OK, You're OK." ...|$|R
500|$|The Black Stone plays {{a central}} role in the ritual of istilam, when pilgrims kiss the Black Stone, touch it with their hands or raise their hands towards it while repeating the takbir, [...] "God is Greatest". They perform this in the course of walking seven times around the Kaaba in a {{counterclockwise}} direction (tawaf), emulating the actions of Muhammad. At the end of each circuit, they perform istilam and may approach the Black Stone to kiss it at the end of tawaf. In modern times, large crowds make it practically impossible for everyone to kiss the stone, so it is currently acceptable to point in the direction of the Stone on each of their seven circuits around the Kaaba. Some <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that the Stone is best considered simply as a marker, useful in keeping count of the ritual circumambulations [...] that one has performed.|$|E
500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jenna, {{worn out}} from working on TGS {{during the day}} and on her {{unlicensed}} Janis Joplin biopic at night, visits Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) for help so she can work on both. He gives Jenna a military-grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that he can say anything on television, and he says to Liz, [...] "I can <b>even</b> <b>say</b> what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me." [...] As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show. Meanwhile, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy, desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language. With Liz gone, Jack assigns the TGS writing staff, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), to this task. After their unsuccessful attempts, Kenneth suggests [...] "The Funcooker" [...] which Jack decides is the perfect name.|$|E
6000|$|This time, Mr. Bashwood {{felt the}} sting. Without another word of expostulation or entreaty, without <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "Good-morning" [...] on his side, {{he walked to}} the door, opened it, softly, and left the room.|$|R
50|$|Barakat {{started his}} career back in the 1960s. He participated as an actor and singer {{in many of the}} Rahbani Brothers' musicals and operettas; some Lebanese <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> that he {{established}} himself as one of the strongest voices in the country.|$|R
50|$|Some ex-Malayan {{government}} officials, including Sir Frank Swettenham, criticised the {{way these}} constitutional reforms were brought about in Malaya, <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> that it went against {{the principles of the}} Atlantic Charter. They also encouraged Malay opposition to the Malayan Union.|$|R
500|$|The album {{continued}} to receive praise {{after the release}} of Dopesmoker. Eduardo Rivadavia of online music database AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five stating [...] "Dopesmoker is [...] an instant doom metal classic—some might <b>even</b> <b>say</b> a masterpiece". The British music magazine Mojo gave the album a rating of five out of five stars proclaiming that Dopesmoker is [...] "A benchmark by which all that dares call itself stoner rock must surely be judged." [...] Exclaim! praised Dopesmokers production value and noted that the album was [...] "ultimately better version of 1999's stoner opus Jerusalem." [...] Stylus Magazine's Stewart Voegtlin defined Dopesmoker as [...] "a 60-minute song about the spliff, a monstrous rock ode to stinky buds". Voegtlin pointed out that London Records' refusal to [...] "share Sleep's affection or vision, [...] disbanding in disgust. Matt Pike went on to form High on Fire; Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius contemplate the universe's navel with Om." [...] A New York Times critic wrote: [...] "What seems disorienting and monochromatic at first grows richer and more rewarding upon repeated exposure. It’s like a Mark Rothko painting hitting you over the head with a bag of hammers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suu Kyi {{has also}} called for {{international}} media to monitor the upcoming by-elections, while publicly pointing out irregularities in official voter lists, which include deceased individuals and exclude other eligible voters in the contested constituencies. On 21 March 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "Fraud and rule violations are continuing and we can <b>even</b> <b>say</b> they are increasing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) greatly {{supported}} and funded the Taliban during 1994, some sources <b>even</b> <b>say</b> ISI [...] "created" [...] the Taliban. The I.S.I. used the Taliban {{to establish a}} regime in Afghanistan which would be favorable to Pakistan, as {{they were trying to}} gain strategic depth. Since the creation of the Taliban, the ISI and the Pakistani military have given financial, logistical and military support.|$|E
50|$|Since Reconstruction, the Democratic presidential {{candidate}} always {{won the state}} although, in 1928, Al Smith won by a far more close margin because of his Catholicism and his links with Tammany Hall, with some leaders <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> {{they would vote for}} Hoover.|$|R
50|$|Good Vibes has {{had mixed}} reviews from critics, and mainly {{positive}} reviews from viewers, some <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> it's {{one of the}} best shows to only have 1 season. Despite its reviews, it was cancelled by MTV on February 24, 2012, due to low ratings.|$|R
50|$|Anthony Atkinson later {{qualified}} {{his statement}} to claim {{his father had}} not been in engaged in activity that equated to the scope and scale of Jimmy Savile's alleged activities, <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> he had no evidence that his father ever had relations with anyone underaged.|$|R
2500|$|... 'Schmitti' and Holmer [...] "a Bier" [...] Graap, two of {{the founder}} members, left the band in 2000. They were {{replaced}} in 2001 by Ralph Bach and Wolfram Kellner. Kellner previously played in Fiddler's Green, which is alluded to in the song [...] "Arschloch und Spaß dabei" [...] ('Asshole and enjoying it'): [...] "man sagt sogar, dass Wolfram früher Folk-Musik g'macht hätt" [...] ("They <b>even</b> <b>say</b> that Wolfram used to play folk music") [...]|$|E
2500|$|Faldo had a {{reputation}} for being an insular character who did not engage in any of the usual social courtesies. He generally kept other players at arm's length. Faldo was described as having [...] "an intense focus that peers found less than endearing." [...] In 2002, Faldo's former Ryder Cup colleague Sandy Lyle said: [...] "I've never known Nick. If he walked past me right now, he wouldn't stop to talk. He wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>say</b> hello." ...|$|E
2500|$|NPR critic Bob Mondello {{adds that}} [...] "despite {{working with a}} plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could <b>even</b> <b>say</b> they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a {{character}} check {{the soles of his}} boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in No Country for Old Men that they don't have to show you what he's checking for." ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{accounts}} {{believe that}} she died from being overworked in a Khmer Rouge agricultural camp.

6000|$|... "Oh, but I do!" [...] exclaimed Dorothy. [...] "It's lovely on the outside, but--" [...] Then {{she stopped}} speaking, for the Lonesome Duck had entered his palace through the little door without <b>even</b> <b>saying</b> good-bye.
