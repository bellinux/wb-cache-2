It is the city's finest Stick style house, with bargeboard gable <b>decoration,</b> and alternating <b>sections</b> of horizontal and vertical siding, set off by trim bands. Its gable ends are truncated, the eaves are lined with brackets, and the front porch has a low turned balustrade and posts with large brackets.|$|R

In subsequent years the Wake became a rowdy and alcohol-infused celebration surrounded by bizarre traditions, one of which involved Rector George Rozum, CSC, ‘61, ’80MSA, being carried into the hall's dance inside a coffin.|$|R

40|$|We have {{determined}} the structural organiza-tion and dynamic behavior of actin filaments in entire primary locomoting heart fibroblasts by S 1 <b>decoration,</b> serial <b>section</b> EM, and photoactivation of fluorescence. As expected, actin filaments in the lamellipodium of these cells have uniform polarity with barbed ends fac-ing forward. In the lamella, cell body, and tail {{there are two}} observable types of actin filament organization. A less abundant type {{is located on the}} inner surface of the plasma membrane and is composed of short, overlap-ping actin bundles (0. 25 – 2. 5 m m) that repeatedly alter-nate in polarity from uniform barbed ends forward to uniform pointed ends forward. This type of organiza-tion is similar to the organization we show for actin fila-ment bundles (stress fibers) in nonlocomoting cells (PtK 2 cells) and to the known organization of muscle sarcomeres. The more abundant type of actin filament organization in locomoting heart fibroblasts is mostly ventrally located and is composed of long, overlapping bundles (average 13...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} similarities and differences in the inscriptions of runestones in today's county of Kronoberg, the former county of Värend and, in addition, a part of the former county of Sunnerbo. The study is based on 27 remaining runestones which are analysed through choice of words and runes, orthography and <b>decorations.</b> The <b>section</b> of choice of words and runes are categorised and based on the choice of choosing one particular word over another and of choosing one particular rune over another. Orthography is based on the spelling of five particular words; efter, sten, reste, hjälpe and och. Monophtongisation is discussed and analysed. The <b>section</b> of <b>decorations</b> has two subsections; 1) crucifixes and ”suns”, and 2) other forms of decoration. The study showed that the runestones had some significant numbers of similarities and differences. The study also showed that the option of choosing one word, or rune, over another was probably a conscious choice made by the runic inscriber himself. The spelling of the five words revealed a limited number of spelling choices, and that monophtongisation had occurred in some words. The majority of the runestones had some form of decoration, usually a crucifix, which were categorised. However, attribution could only be made in a few cases, due to the limited amount of criteria used.

5000|$|Much of the façade’s {{surface is}} covered in tezontle a reddish, porous {{volcanic}} rock. The decoration of the main façade {{of the church is}} what is called a “discreet” expression of the Baroque style, meaning not all of the surface {{is covered in}} <b>decoration,</b> but the <b>sections</b> which do have them are done in that style. The work done on this church has been compared to the filigree done by silversmiths. Where the Baroque style really stands out is the profusion of decoration surrounding the niches; one of which holds an image of Saint Bernard and the other a figure of the Virgin of Guadalupe. This figure used to be {{on the opposite side of}} the church/convent, but when it was dismantled, it was moved here. The main architect of the church was Juan Zepeda [...]|$|R
40|$|Elegant (though {{acephalous}} and incomplete) copy of {{the seven}} mas̲navīs of Jāmī (d. 1492) collected under the title Haft awrang. Text mainly continues from central written area into the ruled margins of each opening (in certain sections additional catchwords are visible). Origin: As appears in colophons on p. 143, 198 and 237, daftars of Silsilat al-ẕahab copied by Ghāzī Qulī Arghūn with transcription completed in Sunbul [?] (بلدۀ سنبل) on the 2 nd, 21 st and 30 th of Shawwāl 969 [ca. 5 th June, 24 th June, 3 rd July 1562]. This copyist may have also executed the final mas̲navī (Khiradnāmah-i Iskandarī). As appears in colophons on p. 296 and 605, Tuḥfat al-Aḥrār and Yūsuf va Zulaykhā copied by Abū Aḥmad ibn ʻAbd Allāh al-Qāḍī al-Farāhī with transcription of Tuḥfat al-Aḥrār completed 14 Ramaḍān 969 [ca. 18 May 1562] and transcription of Yūsuf va Zulaykhā completed 7 Rabīʻ I 970 [?] [ca. 4 November 1562]. Much of the <b>decoration</b> in the <b>sections</b> executed by these two copyists is similar and was perhaps accomplished by the same craftsman. Transcription of other mas̲navīs likely completed around the same time, though possibly by still a different copyist. Former shelfmark: " 152 T. De M. [i. e. Tammaro De Marinis]" inscribed in pencil on verso of front flyleaf. Binding: Pasteboards covered in painted lacquerwork with dark brown (to black) leather over spine; Type III binding (without flap), two piece binding (seam of overlapping flanges visible at spine); doublures fine painted lacquerwork with paintings of a tall narcissus-like plant with leaves in shades of green and flowers and buds in yellow with pink accents {{at the head of}} a central stalk, flanked by leaves and smaller pink flowers, all on a red ground with border in black with gold accents (composition of upper doublure mirrors that of lower doublure); upper and lower covers carry paintings of nearly identical composition in mirror image to one another on an emerald green background, namely a central cluster of peonies, poppies, tulips, roses, irises, etc. with additional buds and floral forms filling the main panel all in shades of pink, light blue, lavender, yellow and white with leaves in various shades of green, and surrounded by a border of floral motifs in shades of blue, red and white on a red ground defined by bands of black with repeating vegetal patterns in bronze-gold; sewn in blue thread, two stations; worked chevron endbands in blue and magenta, good condition (partially protected by tabs of extended spine leather); overall in fair condition with some cracking and chipping of lacquer, minor delamination at board corners, abrasion of spine leather, etc.; likely not original to codex; housed in box for protection. Support: non-European (likely Persian) laid paper of at least two main types; one type (at the opening and close of the transcript) with roughly 8 laid lines per cm. (horizontal or vertical, somewhat indistinct) and no chain lines plainly visible, thin and transluscent, dark cream in color, well-burnished; another type with roughly 9 laid lines per cm. (mainly vertical, quite indistinct) and no chain lines plainly visible, dense and sturdy (much thicker than the other type and far less transluscent), dark cream in color, well-burnished; added leaves at opening and close of codex in Wove paper with grayish hue; endpapers in European laid paper (three hats watermark visible in back flyleaf, "A" visible in front flyleaf), surface dyed a yellow-orange and gold or silver-flecked. Decoration: Elegant illuminated headpiece (ʻunwān / sarlawḥ) appears at opening of each section (each mas̲navī and daftars of Silsilat al-ẕahab, pp. 146, 200, 240, 398, 480, 608, 732) mainly consisting of rectangular pieces with floral vegetal compositions (in lapis, gold, turquoise, pink, lavender, and white with some interlace and white banding with black crosses) but varying widely; further illuminated decorations (typically with floral vegetal motifs) appear in the ruled margins. headings typically rubricated or chrysographed but occasionally in blue; written area throughout (and divisions within, including ruled margins) surrounded by gold frame defined by black fillets with outermost blue (and through p. 478 additional red) rule. Script: Nastaʻlīq; at least three main hands; hands of the two copyists are quite similar, each in an elegant, medium line, characteristically serifless with gentle effect of words descending to baseline, elongation and contrasting thickness of horizontal strokes, pointing in distinct dots; a third central hand (see pp. 298 - 478) is more delicate, in a narrower line, less compact with even greater effect of elongation. Layout: Written in roughly 49 lines per page with 17 lines in central written area divided to two columns and 32 lines on the diagonal in the ruled margins; frame-ruled (impression of ruling board evident).
