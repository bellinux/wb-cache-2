General appearance of gills, filament and lamella lengths {{and the number}} of lamellae <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> were determined in order to evaluate the effects of these toxicants on gill development.

In larvae exposed to low pH alone and in those exposed to aluminium alone, a slight thickness in the apical part of the filaments, shorter lamellae and filament lengths and reduced numbers of lamellae <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> were found. But these findings statistically were not significant (P> 0. 05) compared with control. In larvae exposed to the combined effects of low pH and aluminium, shortened and thickened filaments, fusion of filaments and lamellae and low numbers of lamellae <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> were determined. Filament and lamella lengths and the numbers of lamellae <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> in this larva group were significantly lower (P< 0. 001) than those in the control group, and the mortality rate was quite high (80 %).

The main experimental results are scaling rules for integral filament properties (breakdown voltage, electrical input energy <b>per</b> <b>filament,</b> excimer radiation <b>per</b> <b>filament,</b> uv efficiency).

Two mechanisms of nano-particles formation are depicted from aerosol size distributions and TEM analysis. 0. 1 - 10  mJ prevented spark discharges produce 10 - 100  nm droplets ejected from melted craters as well as nucleated primary particles and subsequent 10 - 100  nm agglomerates, by nucleation and coagulation in expanding vapor jets. With smaller energy <b>per</b> <b>filament,</b> 0. 1 - 10  J micro-discharges and 0. 1 - 100  J streamers, the initial local vapor fluxes emitted from spots of interaction between plasma filaments and electrodes are reduced. Subsequent smaller primary particle density limits the local coagulation in the vapor plume since 2 - 10  nm non-agglomerated crystalline metal nano-particles are produced in mono-DBD with Au, Ag and Cu electrode. Besides, {{the evolution of the}} aerosol size from primary nano-particles to agglomerates with transit time suggests slow coagulation of these primary metal particles in mono-DBD.

For this purpose, we {{make use of the}} discrete wormlike chain model characterised by the monomer size d, a size dependent contour length L c and a persistence length lp. The calculation of the equilibrium filament size distribution and the average equilibrium force require the knowledge of the wall effect on the single filament partition function of any size, which can be computed by Metropolis Monte-Carlo methods. The force exerted by a living filament on a fixed wall {{turns out to be the}} weighted average of the dead grafted filament forces computed for sizes hitting the wall, multiplied by the probability of occurrence of the corresponding filament size. As the distance to the wall is varied, the resultant force shows large variations whose amplitude decreases with increasing gap sizes and/or with decreasing persistence length. Also, its average over a gap interval of precise size d gives an average force close to what is expected by the ratchet model for actin growth against a wall.

40|$|The RecA protein forms {{nucleoprotein}} filaments on DNA, {{and individual}} monomers within the filaments hydrolyze ATP. Assembly and disassembly of filaments are both unidirectional, occurring on opposite filament ends, with disassembly requiring ATP hydrolysis. When filaments form on duplex DNA, RecA protein exhibits a functional state {{comparable to the}} state observed during active DNA strand exchange. RecA filament state was monitored with a coupled spectrophotometric assay for ATP hydrolysis, with changes fit to a mathematical model for filament disassembly. At 37 °C, monomers within the RecA-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) filaments hydrolyze ATP with an observed kcat of 20. 8 ± 1. 5 min− 1. Under the same conditions, the rate of end-dependent filament disassembly (koff) is 123 ± 16 monomers <b>per</b> minute <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> end. This rate of disassembly requires a tight coupling of the ATP hydrolytic cycles of adjacent RecA monomers. The relationship of kcat to koff infers a filament state in which waves of ATP hydrolysis move unidirectionally through RecA filaments on dsDNA, with successive waves occurring at intervals of approximately six monomers. The waves move nearly synchronously, each one transiting from one monomer to the next every 0. 5 s. The results reflect an organization of the ATPase activity that is unique in filamentous systems, and could be linked to a RecA motor function...|$|R
40|$|Recently, in a {{beautiful}} set of experiments, {{it has been shown}} that a Ncd mutant, NK 11, which lacks directionality in its individual motion, was able to exhibit a new kind of directed motion in motility assays (Endow, S. A. & Higuchi, H. (2000) Nature (London) 406, 913 – 916) : the filaments keep a given velocity for a while and then suddenly move in the opposite direction with similar velocity. We show that these observations nicely illustrate the concept of dynamic transitions in motor collections introduced earlier in the case of an infinite number of motors. We investigate the experimentally relevant case of a finite number of motors both when directionality is present (kinesins, myosins, Ncd) and absent (NK 11). Using a symmetric two-state model, we demonstrate that bidirectional motion is the signature of a dynamic transition that results from the collective behavior of many motors acting on the same filament. For motors exhibiting directional bias individually, an asymmetric two-state model is appropriate. In that case, dynamic transitions exist for motor collections in the presence of an external force. We give predictions for the dependence of motion on ATP concentration, external forces, and the number of motors involved.

40|$|Cells {{moving on}} a two {{dimensional}} substrate generate motion by polymerizing actin filament networks inside a flat membrane protrusion. New filaments are generated by branching off existing ones, {{giving rise to}} branched network structures. We investigate the force-extension relation of branched filaments, grafted on an elastic structure {{at one end and}} pushing with the free ends against the leading edge cell membrane. Single filaments are modeled as worm-like chains, whose thermal bending fluctuations are restricted by the leading edge cell membrane, resulting in an effective force. Branching can increase the stiffness considerably; however the effect depends on branch point position and filament orientation, being most pronounced for intermediate tilt angles and intermediate branch point positions. We describe filament networks without cross-linkers to focus on the effect of branching. We use randomly positioned branch points, as generated in the process of treadmilling, and orientation distributions as measured in lamellipodia. These networks reproduce both the weak and strong force response of lamellipodia as measured in force-velocity experiments. We compare properties of branched and unbranched networks. The ratio of the network average of the force <b>per</b> branched <b>filament</b> to the average force <b>per</b> unbranched <b>filament</b> depends on the orientation distribution of the filaments.

40|$|Filamentous {{bacteria}} are {{the oldest and}} simplest known multicellular life forms. By using computer simulations and experiments that address cell division in a filamentous context, we investigate some of the ecological factors {{that can lead to}} the emergence of a multicellular life cycle in filamentous life forms. The model predicts that if cell division and death rates are dependent on the density of cells in a population, a predictable cycle between short and long filament lengths is produced. During exponential growth, there will be a predominance of multicellular filaments, while at carrying capacity, the population converges to a predominance of short filaments and single cells. Model predictions are experimentally tested and confirmed in cultures of heterotrophic and phototrophic bacterial species. Furthermore, by developing a formulation of generation time in bacterial populations, it is shown that changes in generation time can alter length distributions. The theory predicts that given the same population growth curve and fitness, species with longer generation times have longer filaments during comparable population growth phases. Characterization of the environmental dependence of morphological properties such as length, and the number of cells <b>per</b> <b>filament,</b> helps in understanding the pre-existing conditions for the evolution of developmental cycles in simple multicellular organisms. Moreover, the theoretical prediction that strains with the same fitness can exhibit different lengths at comparable growth phases has important implications. It demonstrates that differences in fitness attributed to morphology are not the sole explanation for the evolution of life cycles dominated by multicellularity...|$|R

40|$|Mammalian cardiac and {{skeletal}} muscle express unique isoforms of the thin filament regulatory proteins, troponin (Tn) and tropomyosin (Tm), and {{the significance of}} these different isoforms in thin filament regulation has not been clearly identified. Both in vitro and skinned cellular studies investigating the mechanism of thin filament regulation in striated muscle have often used heterogeneous mixtures of Tn, Tm and myosin isoforms, and variability in reported results might be explained by different combinations of these proteins. Here we used in vitro motility and force (microneedle) assays to investigate the influence of cardiac versus skeletal Tn and Tm isoforms on actin–heavy meromyosin (HMM) mechanics. When interacting with skeletal HMM, thin filaments reconstituted with cardiac Tn/Tm or skeletal Tn/Tm exhibited similar speed–calcium relationships and significantly increased maximum speed and force <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> length (F/l) at pCa 5 (versus unregulated actin filaments). However, augmentation of F/l was greater with skeletal regulatory proteins. Reconstitution of thin filaments with the heterogeneous combination of skeletal Tn and cardiac Tm decreased sliding speeds at all [Ca 2 +] relative to thin filaments with skeletal Tn/Tm. Finally, for filaments reconstituted with any heterogeneous mix of Tn and Tm isoforms, force was not potentiated over that of unregulated actin filaments. Combined the results suggest (1) that cardiac regulatory proteins limit the allosteric enhancement of force, and (2) that Tn and Tm isoform homogeneity is important when studying Ca 2 + regulation of crossbridge binding and kinetics as well as mechanistic differences between cardiac and {{skeletal muscle}}...|$|R

Size distribution studies of zebras indicate that division-suppressed mutants and wild-type cells both yield zebras of comparable length. Similarly the lengths of zebras found in populations emerging from spores are uniform in one-, two-, three-, and four-zebra-containing cells. In contrast, the length of spaces is slightly larger than that of zebras and is unusually large in two-zebra-containing cells. The locations of zebras and spaces along cell length have been studied in spore out-growth populations. A statistical procedure developed previously in genome location investigations was {{used to analyze the}} location of zebras along cell length. The data indicate that as cells elongate, new sites arise where the cell contents are strongly bound to the cell surface. Within filament populations produced by division-suppressed mutants there is a linear relationship of mean filament length and zebra number <b>per</b> <b>filament.</b> These data indicate that cytoplasm in filaments with no obvious structural compartmentalizations may be organized into units associated with particular regions of cell surface.

SA was the smallest in the basal zone and largest in the middle zone; DBT was greatest in the distal zone and smallest in the basal zone; SA and DBT increased at similar rates in different gill arches within the distal and middle zones but at different rates in each zone within an arch; growth of NPZ in the middle zone differed among gill arches but did not in the distal zone. Surface area of lamellae in the middle zone contributed most to increasing TSA. Compared with other fish of intermediate activity, the estimate of TSA for A. australis was smaller than expected; although DBT and TFL were as expected, SA was smaller than expected; possible reasons include method of measurement in situ, shrinkage caused by fixation, and absence of a weighting factor. The method employed enables large numbers of lamellae and filaments in a large number of fish to be measured, and enables regression equations to be derived that relate surface area <b>per</b> <b>filament</b> zone to head length and filament length in order to estimate the loss of surface area caused by ectoparasites...|$|R
