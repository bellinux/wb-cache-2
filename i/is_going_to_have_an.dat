500|$|Upon her introduction, Chloe was {{received}} positively by audiences. Soap Opera Weekly praised the character, stating, [...] "What {{started as a}} 10-episode arc as a bitchy stylist transformed into a meaty contract character and an even meatier storyline for Elizabeth Hendrickson." [...] The magazine also considered Chloe the [...] "complex Genoa City bad girl", and observed that [...] "viewers aren't exactly loving Chloe" [...] for driving a wedge between the popular pairing of Cane and Lily. Speaking of the character's pregnancy, Allison Waldman of TV Squad was unconvinced of Chloe's schemes regarding the child's paternity, writing, [...] "I'm having doubts about Chloe's bun in the oven. She claims that Cane's the father, based on one drunken night in a car that he has blacked out of his memory. Chloe's hardly a reliable source, especially since it's just been revealed that she's Kate, Esther's daughter. Yes, Esther, Kay's maid for the last 20 years or so. Cane's had DNA tests done, but they only prove {{he could be the}} baby's father. Watch, this baby <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interesting back story." [...] Carolyn Hinsey of the New York Daily News said Chloe's backstory reveal was a [...] "shock" [...] to fans and in light of her pregnancy wrote, [...] "Anyone who thinks Chloe's lies are over hasn't been paying attention. Is the baby even Cane's?" [...] Jillian Bowe of Zap2it credited the character as a [...] "quirky fashion diva", and penned the reunion between Chloe and Esther [...] "long overdue".|$|E
500|$|Soon after, UMNO backbencher Mahathir bin Mohamad {{attacked}} Lee in Parliament: [...] " [...] {{have never}} known Malay rule and cannot bear {{the idea that the}} people they have so long kept under their heels should now {{be in a position to}} rule them." [...] Lee responded with an unscripted speech made entirely in Malay opposing the government's pro-Malay policies: [...] "Of course there are Chinese millionaires in big cars and big houses. Is it the answer to make a few Malay millionaires with big cars and big houses? ... If we delude people into believing that they are poor because there are no Malay rights or because opposition members oppose Malay rights, where are we going to end up? You let people in the villages believe that they are poor because we don't speak Malay, because the government does not write in Malay, so he expects a miracle to take place [...] The moment we all start speaking Malay, he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> uplift in the standard of living, and if doesn't happen, what happens then? Meanwhile, whenever there is a failure of economic, social and educational policies, you come back and say, oh, these wicked Chinese, Indian and others opposing Malay rights. They don't oppose Malay rights. They, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." ...|$|E

5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. You <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the really cute one. You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the quiet one.

40|$|It became {{apparent}} in the beginning that the union <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change their approach and that we, at the cooperative, <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change ours [...] They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> understand {{that they were not}} the only ones who represent {{the best interests of the}} workers and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> let them in—to accept that they could bring situations to our attention...|$|R
6000|$|... “Is that so, Mr. Embleton? I am glad {{indeed to}} hear it. Then {{there is no}} doubt about the future of your boy, if he is steady and industrious. I am pleased to hear it for my own sake, if for nothing else; for {{although}} Pinder’s mates are capital sailors, and in all other respects able officers, they are not men of Pinder’s type. They can take, of course, a rough observation at noon, and work it out by rule of thumb and the aid of tables, but beyond that they can do nothing. They have not received the education to enable them to grapple with mathematical problems, even of the simplest kind; and although, in case of Pinder falling sick, they might manage under favourable circumstances to bring the ship home, they would fare very badly if they had a long spell of bad weather and could not get an observation at noon for days or even weeks together. It will be a satisfaction to me to know that in case of anything happening to the captain there is someone on board who could, in such a case, take a lunar or shoot a star. Well, to-morrow morning we will go down to the docks, and I will hand your boy over to Pinder. I should, of course, be very glad to have him here, but I think it is of great advantage to a boy to see everything done from the first step. She <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> entirely new fit-out both of standing and running rigging, so she has been stripped entirely, and has nothing but her three lower masts above the deck.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Selection from a {{specific}} real area.
