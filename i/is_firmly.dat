A large dog, stretched on its back on an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled.|$|E
5|$|At birth, a {{rattlesnake}} hatchling {{has only a}} small button or 'primordial rattle' which <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of evolution, the skull has been {{modified}} in most diapsids from the original version evident in the fossil record. However, all the original features are preserved in that of the tuatara; it has two openings – a temporal fenestra {{on each side of}} the skull, with complete arches. In addition, the upper jaw <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> attached to the skull. This makes for a very rigid, inflexible construction. Testudines (turtles and tortoises) have anapsid skulls – they lack any temporal fenestrae, are sometimes considered to be the most primitive among amniotes, though evidence strongly indicates they may have lost the temporal openings rather than never having had them.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the area}} of present-day Ghana in West Africa has {{experienced}} many population movements, the Akans <b>were</b> <b>firmly</b> settled by the 5th century BC.

5|$|Like all actinides, {{einsteinium}} {{is rather}} reactive. Its trivalent oxidation state is most stable in solids and aqueous solution where it induced pale pink color. The existence of divalent einsteinium <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> established, especially in solid phase; such +2 {{state is not}} observed in many other actinides, including protactinium, uranium, neptunium, plutonium, curium and berkelium. Einsteinium(II) compounds can be obtained, for example, by reducing einsteinium(III) with samarium(II) chloride. The oxidation state +4 was postulated from vapor studies and is yet uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The Layer Pyramid (known locally in Arabic as el haram el midawwar, , meaning 'rubble-hill pyramid') is {{a ruined}} step pyramid {{dating to the}} 3rd Dynasty of Egypt (2686 BC to 2613 BC) and located in the {{necropolis}} of Zawyet El Aryan. Its ownership is uncertain and may be attributable to pharaoh Khaba. The pyramid architecture, however, {{is very similar to}} that of the Buried Pyramid of king Sekhemkhet and for this reason <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> datable to the 3rd Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} too few {{published}} studies on the etymology of the figure of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some authorities have suggested derives etymologically from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so {{the origin of the}} figure remains unproven.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} pictured with four arms in South Indian iconography. The front right arm is {{stretched}} out downwards {{and the hand}} holds a bit of grass or another plant in the kataka gesture, {{near the mouth of}} his pet deer or antelope, who leaps playfully by his side. The back right arm is raised and holds a damaru (drum). The front left hand holds a kapala (skull-cup), used as a begging bowl. The back left hand holds a trishula decorated with peacock feathers. The left leg <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> rooted in the ground while the right one is slightly bent, suggesting walking. He often wears paduka (wooden sandals) but sometimes may be barefoot. The sandals are unique and identifying feature of Bhikshatana's iconography and distinguish him from other forms of Shiva and all other deities, who are always depicted barefoot. Sometimes Bhikshatana's iconography is amalgamated with that of Bhairava, in which case he displays Bhairava's attributes in addition to his own.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{international}} border <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect <b>is</b> <b>firmly</b> immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E
