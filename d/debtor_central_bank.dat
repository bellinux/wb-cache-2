40|$|Given buoyant capital inflows {{and managed}} {{exchange}} rates {{the majority of}} emerging market central banks have continued to accumulate massive foreign reserves. If left unsterilized, the liquidity expansion can threaten domestic macroeconomic stability. To contain domestic inflation these central banks absorb rather then provide liquidity in their regular monetary policy operations. Based on an augmented Barro-Gordon framework we show that inflation targeting within an environment of surplus liquidity is less efficient, because absorbing liquidity raises the costs of monetary policy operations. By implementing sterilization costs into the central bank’s objective function the inflation bias increases. inflation targeting, exchange rate targeting, sterilization, <b>debtor</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank...</b>|$|E
40|$|Given low {{interest}} rates in the large industrial countries and buoyant capital inflows into the emerging markets East Asian central banks have accumulated large stocks of foreign reserves. As the resulting {{easing of monetary conditions}} has become a threat to domestic price and financial stability, the East Asian central banks have embarked on substantial sterilization operations to absorb what we call ‘surplus liquidity ’ from the domestic banking systems. This has brought the East Asian central banks into debtor positions versus the domestic banking systems. We show based on a central bank loss function that given buoyant capital inflows and exchange rate stabilization the absorption of surplus liquidity leads either to financial repression, or rising inflation or both. Assuming that a <b>debtor</b> <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> moved towards a freely floating exchange rate to gain monetary policy independence, we show that monetary policy independence is undermined by sterilization costs and revaluation losses on foreign reserves...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} three empirical models {{commonly used}} to conduct exchange rate assessments and applies them to data for Australia and New Zealand. The baseline results using data and mediumterm projections available as of October 2008, suggest that the Australian and New Zealand dollars were broadly in line with fundamentals, but with a wide variation across models. A battery of sensitivity tests illustrate that altering the underlying assumptions can yield substantially different assessments. The results are particularly sensitive to the choice of assessment horizon, the set of economies included in the sample, medium-term forecasts, and the exchange rate reference period.

40|$|The paper {{initially}} discusses monetary {{policies in}} the context of the wide margins introduced on 1 August 1993. The new President of the European Monetary Institute (EMI) has suggested that a number of stringent non-monetary conditions must be met before there can be a return to narrow margins. While this list may be too comprehensive, the paper argues that there are also some monetary prerequisites which will be difficult to meet: at a minimum some mixture of less conditionality in interventions on behalf of creditor <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> and strong incentives for <b>debtor</b> <b>central</b> <b>banks</b> to raise interest rates to defend their currencies. The paper finds a continuation of wide margins for most of the transition realistic. Such a scenario might have certain advantages in relation to the transition to monetary union, provided participants continue to value exchange rate stability highly. In the second part the specific role of the EMI is reviewed. To the extent that the EMI President, the Director-General and other senior members of the staff succeed in taking charge of the work in the Council, The Alternates' Committee and the various writing groups monetary coordination and the preparations for full monetary union should be enhanced. The latter would also be helped if the EMI were to be given some operational functions beyond the passive holding and managing of internaitonal reserves specifically mentioned in the Treaty. An operational role also in domestic money market operations and in clearing in the ecu market appears desirable. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{endogenous}} {{theory of}} money, developed by Basil Moore, {{argues that the}} supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money in modern economies is not {{under the control of}} the <b>central</b> <b>bank.</b> According to this view, a <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> typically supplies cash reserves automatically on demand at its minimum lending rate, resulting in a clearly horizontal money supply function. While the paper agrees with Moore that the supply of <b>central</b> <b>bank</b> money cannot be determined exogenously by the <b>central</b> <b>bank,</b> it wonders whether the supply is determined completely by the demand of the commercial banks.
