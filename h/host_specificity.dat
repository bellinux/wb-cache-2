5|$|Many {{species are}} {{difficult}} or impossible to distinguish from each other using observable characteristics; laboratory incompatibility tests are often used on pure cultures to reliably determine species. Because of the difficulties posed by routine species identification, the use of DNA sequencing and phylogenetic approaches has become a standard method to help clarify relationships between species. Species differ in their geographical distribution and ecological position, <b>host</b> <b>specificity,</b> microscopic and macroscopic features, and also in their aggressiveness in colonizing wood hosts. The following list of Armillaria species {{is based on the}} taxonomic overviews provided by Volk and Burdsall in 1995, David Pegler in 2000, and reports of new species that have been published since then.|$|E
5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one host species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential host to the flea's original host, it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, <b>host</b> <b>specificity</b> decreases as the size of the host species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change host species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived host provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that the native blue crab in eastern North America, Callinectes sapidus, is able to control populations of C.maenas; numbers of the two species are negatively correlated, and C.maenas is not found in the Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus is most frequent. On the west coast of North America, C.maenas appears to be limited to upper estuarine habitats, in part because of predation by native rock crabs (Romaleon antennarium and Cancer productus) and competition for shelter with a native shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis. <b>Host</b> <b>specificity</b> testing has recently been conducted on Sacculina carcini, a parasitic barnacle, as a potential biological control agent of C.maenas. In the laboratory, Sacculina settled on, infected, and killed native California crabs, including the Dungeness crab, Metacarcinus magister (formerly Cancer magister), and the shore crabs Hemigrapsus nudus, Hemigrapsus oregonensis and Pachygrapsus crassipes. Dungeness crabs were the most vulnerable of the tested native species to settlement and infection by the parasite. Although Sacculina did not mature in any of the native crabs, developing reproductive sacs were observed inside a few Metacarcinus magister and Hemigrapsus oregonensis. Any potential benefits of using Sacculina to control C.maenas on the west coast of North America would need to be weighed against these potential non-target impacts.|$|E

5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological <b>host</b> <b>specificity,</b> and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E

25|$|Host {{plants that}} are taxonomically related show more similar EcM fungal {{communities}} than do taxa that are more distantly related.

Even establishment timeframe of the host species can have an effect, with lower EcM fungal richness associated with hosts from a secondary forest than from a primary forest.|$|E
500|$|Suillus lakei is {{indigenous}} to the Rocky Mountains and western parts of North America. Its range extends south into Mexico. Fruit bodies grow solitarily or in {{groups on the}} ground in young conifer stands or grassy parkland. Fruiting occurs in the late summer and autumn. Suillus lakei forms ectomycorrhizae with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and its distribution coincides with this tree. It {{is one of the most}} common bolete species found in northwestern Montana and Idaho. In a study of <b>host</b> <b>specificity</b> in pure culture in the laboratory, S.lakei failed to form healthy ectomycorrhizas with Eucalyptus roots—the hyphae were covered in mucilage-like deposits and appeared to be collapsed. [...] It has also been noted to prefer poor, exposed soil such as that found on road banks and campgrounds. It can often be found with the mushroom Gomphidius subroseus, another species that associates with Douglas fir.|$|E
500|$|Lactarius deterrimus has {{traditionally}} been considered to have a strict mycorrhizal <b>host</b> <b>specificity</b> with Norway spruce. In 2006, {{it was reported that}} the fungus can also form arbutoid mycorrhiza with bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). Arbutoid mycorrhizal associations are variants of ectomycorrhiza found in certain plants in the Ericaceae characterised by hyphal coils in epidermal cells. The mycorrhiza formed by L.deterrimus on both bearberry and Norway spruce show typical features such as a hyphal mantle and a Hartig net; the distinguishing characteristic between the mycorrhizal symbioses with the different hosts is that the hyphae penetrate the epidermal cells of bearberry, although there are also some differences {{in the form of the}} Hartig net, branching pattern, and colour. Although bearberry [...] has been shown to form mycorrhiza with a wide range of fungi both in the field and in laboratory experiments, it had never previously been known to form mycorrhiza with fungi thought to be strictly host-specific. Bearberry may function as a nurse plant to help re-establish Norway spruce in deforested areas.|$|E

40|$|Giardia intestinalis is a {{major cause}} of {{waterborne}} enteric disease in humans. The species is divided into eight assemblages suggested to represent separate Giardia species based on <b>host</b> <b>specificities</b> and the genetic divergence of marker genes. We have investigated whether genome-wide recombination occurs between assemblages using the three available G. intestinalis genomes. First, the relative nonsynonymous substitution rates of the homologs were compared for 4, 009 positional homologs. The vast majority of these comparisons indicate genetic isolation without interassemblage recombinations. Only a region of 6 kbp suggests genetic exchange between assemblages A and E, followed by gene conversion events. Second, recombination-detecting software fails to identify within-gene recombination between the different assemblages for most of the homologs. Our results indicate very low frequency of recombination between the syntenic core genes, suggesting that G. intestinalis assemblages are genetically isolated lineages and thus should be viewed as separated Giardia species. Key words: diplomonads, protists, sex, substitution rate. The intestinal parasite Giardia intestinalis (syn. G. lamblia and G. duodenalis) belongs to diplomonads, and the morpholog-ical G. intestinalis species is divided into eight assemblages based on genetic differences and <b>host</b> <b>specificities</b> (Monis et al. 2009). Diplomonads have been viewed as primitive asex-ual eukaryotes. However, G. intestinalis encodes proteins as-sociated with meiotic sex (Ramesh et al. 2005).

500|$|Paxillus involutus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} {{with a number}} of coniferous and deciduous tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialised nutrient requirements and a relatively broad <b>host</b> <b>specificity,</b> it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs. There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where P.involutus was cultivated on the root exudate of red pine (Pinus resinosa), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Seedlings inoculated with P.involutus also showed increased resistance to Fusarium. Thus P.involutus [...] may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot. Paxillus involutus also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against heavy metal toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of cadmium and zinc to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits ectomycorrhiza formation in seedlings, colonization with P.involutus decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal cell walls, as well as accumulating in the vacuolar compartments. Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to copper or cadmium drastically increase production of a metallothionein—a low molecular weight protein that binds metals.|$|E

2500|$|A {{field of}} recent {{importance}} {{for the application of}} ecological fitting is that of emerging infectious disease: infectious diseases that have emerged or increased incidence in the last 20 years, as a result of evolution, range expansion, or ecological changes. [...] Climate change represents an ecological perturbation that induces range and phenological shifts in many species, which can encourage parasite transmission and host switching without any evolutionary change occurring. When species begin to infect host species with which they were not previously associated, it {{may be the result of}} ecological fitting. Even organisms with complex life histories can switch hosts as long as the resource required by each life stage is phylogenetically conserved and geographically widespread, meaning that it is difficult to predict based on life history complexity or other external factors. This has been used to explain the mysterious appearance of the bullfrog lung trematode Haematoloechus floedae in Costa Rican leopard frogs, even though bullfrogs do not and have never occurred in this area. [...] When emerging infectious disease is the result of ecological fitting and <b>host</b> <b>specificity</b> is loose, then recurrent host shifts are likely to occur and the difficult task of building a predictive framework for management is necessary.|$|E

40|$|Baculoviruses are insect-specific {{pathogens}} with {{a generally}} narrow host ranges. Successful primary infection is {{initiated by the}} proper interaction of at least 8 conserved per os infectivity factors (PIFs) with the host's midgut cells, a process that remains largely a mystery. In this study, we investigated the <b>host</b> <b>specificities</b> of the four core components of the PIF complex, P 74, PIF 1, PIF 2 and PIF 3 by using Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (HearNPV) backbone. The four pifs of HearNPV were replaced by their counterparts from a group I Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) or a group II Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltNPV). Transfection and infection assays showed that all the recombinant viruses were able to produce infectious budded viruses (BVs) and were lethal to H. armigera larvae via intrahaemocoelic injection. However, feeding experiments using very high concentration of occlusion bodies demonstrated that all the recombinant viruses completely lost oral infectivity except SpltNPV pif 3 substituted pif 3 -null HearNPV (vHaBacΔpif 3 -Sppif 3 -ph). Furthermore, bioassay result showed that the median lethal concentration (LC 50) value of vHaBacΔpif 3 -Sppif 3 -ph was 23 -fold {{higher than that of}} the control virus vHaBacΔpif 3 -Hapif 3 -ph, indicating that SpltNPV pif 3 can only partially substitute the function of HearNPV pif 3.
