Soegijapranata opposed marriage between Catholics and non-Catholics. He counselled young Catholic couples before marriage, believing that these unions helped unite the Catholic families in the city, and continued to write for Swaratama, again serving as its <b>editor</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief.</b> In 1938, he was chosen to advise the Society of Jesus, coordinating Jesuit work in the Indies.|$|E
