40|$|AbstractThis paper studies {{compaction}} {{characteristics and}} California Bearing Ratio, CBR values of fine-grained soils, lateritic soils and crushed rocks. All test data were collated from the Bureau of Rural Road 6, the Department of Rural Roads, Thailand. The Ohio's and the modified Ohio's curves can predict satisfactorily the compaction curves of the fine-grained soils, and lateritic soils and crushed rocks {{consistent with the}} grade B of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) requirement. The CBR value of a specific soil {{is directly related to}} the relative <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight (the ratio of <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight to maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, γd/γd,max). The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function. Finally, the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight reaches a constant value, which is close to the laboratory maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight. Even with a large number of roller passes (compaction energy), the <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight cannot be enhanced further because the soil state approaches the zero air void state. In practice, the excess roller pass is thus not economic. Based on the analysis of the test data, the field compaction procedure for road embankment and pavement constructions, which includes the material selection and the construction control, is suggested. It is useful in terms of both engineering and economic viewpoints...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a comprehensive investigation on the utilization of carpet waste fibers in reinforcement of clay soils. Effects of adding proportionate quantities of {{two different types of}} shredded carpet waste fibers to clay soils (i. e., 1, 3, and 5 % by dry weight of the soil) were investigated and evaluated. The investigation was conducted on specimens prepared at their maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and optimum moisture content, as well on specimens prepared at variable conditions of <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content. A comparison was also made on specimens prepared at the same fiber content by changing <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight while moisture content was kept unchanged or by changing both <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content. The investigation revealed that inclusion of carpet waste fibers into clay soils prepared at the same <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight can significantly enhance the unconfined compression strength (UCS), reduce postpeak strength loss, and change the failure behavior from brittle to ductile. The results also showed that the relative benefit of fibers to increase the UCS of the clay soils is highly dependent on initial <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight and moisture content of the soil. Failure patterns were gradually transformed from the apparent classical failure for unreinforced soil specimens to barrel-shaped failures for reinforced specimens at 5 % fiber content...|$|R

40|$|In practice, soil {{compaction}} quality assessment {{relies on the}} determination of the in-place compacted <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, which is then compared with the maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight obtained from a laboratory compaction test. Most DOTs typically require that the in-place <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight for compacted soil be over 95 % of the laboratory maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight obtained from Standard Proctor compaction test results. Nuclear gauges may be used to determine the in-place <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight, however, they are potentially hazardous and require safety precautions. Other tests, such as the Dynamic Cone Penetration Test (DCPT), can be used for {{soil compaction}} quality assessment. ^ The main objectives of this research were to develop criteria for soil compaction quality assessment for different soils based on DCPT results. A number of DCPTs were performed on Indiana road sites, in a test pit, and in the soil test chamber at Purdue University. Since soil compaction varies spatially, a statistical approach was applied to the test measurements {{in the development of the}} criteria for soil compaction quality control. Based on the results of DCP tests performed on INDOT road sites and the requirement that the in-place <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight of the fill material be over 95 % of the laboratory maximum <b>dry</b> <b>unit</b> weight obtained from standard Proctor compaction tests, correlations that can be used to obtain the minimum required DCP blow count (NDCP) req were proposed for soils belonging to three groups of the AASHTO (American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials) soil classification system. ^ A series of tests were performed in the laboratory to determine the matric suction in compacted silty clays for different compaction conditions. Based on the results of the tests performed in this research and those available in the literature, a method was proposed that can be used to estimate the shear strength and small-strain shear modulus of compacted silty clays. A dynamic analysis, accounting for the increase in shear strength and stiffness due to matric suction in compacted soils, was used to predict DCPT results, which were then compared with DCP blow counts measured in the field. The results of this study are very useful for facilitating the use of DCPT as a tool for compaction quality control. ...|$|R

40|$|A natural {{convection}} solar tunnel dryer comprising three major units, a solar collector unit, a <b>drying</b> <b>unit,</b> and a vertical bare flat-plate chimney, was constructed. No-load tests with a horizontal configuration of air {{entry into the}} collector resulted in a bidirectional air flow in the dryer. To correct this undesirable situation, an air guide at the collector was incorporated to ensure that air entered in a vertical direction. To investigate its performance, drying experiments with mango were carried out at the University of Zambia, Department of Agricultural Engineering. Uncertainties in the parameters measured in the experiment were analysed and quantified. The results showed that, under solar radiation between 568. 4 and 999. 5 [*]W/m 2, air temperature of up to 65. 8 °C was attained at the collector unit.
