40|$|The European Union, {{through its}} SAVE II programme, aims at {{promoting}} the rational use of energy within the community. SAVE II is a non-technological programme with many elements, among others labelling, standardisation and other {{actions in the}} area of energy-using equipment. This report summarises the results of the Working Group on Efficient <b>Domestic</b> <b>Ovens.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify possible EU Commission actions to improve the efficiency of domestic electric and gas ovens and to develop a common basis for possible national actions. The study focuses on conventional <b>domestic</b> <b>ovens</b> only. Other ways of cooking, such as hobs, microwave ovens, grills and electric kettles are not taken into consideration. Possibilities for and impacts of fuel switching are also outside the scope of this study. However, a wide range of possibilities to improve energy efficiency, and related policy options, are discussed in a qualitative way, to give a more complete picture of ovens in the context of climate policies. The study, financed by the SAVE II Programme (with supplementary financing from NOVEM for the Dutch partner) was carried out in 1998 - 1999 by research teams from eight countries. Representatives of NOVEM and CECED as well as those of the relevant working groups of CENELEC (CLC/TC 59 X/WG 3) and CEN (CEN/TC 49 /WG 2) have participated in the meetings. CECED has also provided data for a number of tasks. The work was organised in six tasks. The aim of Task 1 was to establish the real life energy consumption of the ovens concerned, as opposed to the energy consumption according to the test standard. Task 2 was to provide a statistical analysis of the European gas and electric ovens market. The purpose of Task 3 was to review, identify, and analyse energy-saving design options for <b>domestic</b> <b>ovens.</b> Task 4 was to assess the environmental impacts of scenarios concerning the efficiency improvements of <b>domestic</b> <b>ovens.</b> A stock model methodology was used. Task 5 aimed at analysing the different impacts of efficiency policies on manufacturers. The aim of Task 6 was to give the information necessary to develop an appropriate mix of policies.

50|$|Reflowing as a rework technique, {{similar to}} the {{manufacturing}} process of reflow soldering, involves dismantling the equipment to remove the faulty circuit board, pre-heating the whole board in an oven, heating the non-functioning component further to melt the solder, then cooling, following a carefully determined thermal profile, and reassembling, a process which is hoped will repair the bad connection without the need to remove and replace the component. This may or not resolve the problem; {{and there is a}} chance that the reflowed board will fail again after some time. For typical devices (PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360) one repair company estimates that the process, if there are no unexpected problems, takes about 80 minutes. On a forum where professional repair people discuss reflowing of laptop computer graphics chips, different contributors cite success rates (no failure within 6 months) of between 60 and 90% for reflowing with professional equipment and techniques, in equipment whose value does not justify complete reballing. Reflowing can done non-professionally in a <b>domestic</b> <b>oven</b> or with a heat gun.

30|$|Microwave {{reactors}} can {{be designed}} to function in two different modes: multimode and monomode (also referred to as single-mode) reactors. In multimode reactor instruments (which {{is similar to a}} <b>domestic</b> <b>oven</b> in concept), the microwaves that enter the cavity are reflected by the walls and the load over the typically large cavity. In most instruments a mode stirrer ensures that the field distribution is as homogeneous as possible. In the much smaller monomode cavities, the electromagnetic irradiation is directed through an accurately designed rectangular or circular wave guide onto the reaction vessel mounted at a fixed distance from the radiation source, thus creating a standing wave. The key difference between the two types of reactor systems is that in multimode cavities several reaction vessels can be irradiated simultaneously in multi vessel rotors (parallel synthesis), in monomode systems only one vessel can be irradiated at any time. In the latter case high throughput can be achieved by integrated robotics that move individual reaction vessels {{in and out of the}} microwave cavity [133].|$|E

On the other hand, not only computational studies, but also experimental studies are important in understanding the heat and fluid flow in domestic ovens.

This study focuses on deciding optimum insulation design, by decreasing thermal bridges over itself. Firstly, experiments are performed for determining excessive heat region on a reference oven's insulation. Also these experiments are completed with two different thermocouple layouts in various temperatures and isotherm maps are generated for innerand outer chassis surfaces.

Standard energy consumption experiments are performed for each insulation designs under the working mode, which the dominant one in heat transfer, is forced convection.

40|$|Microwave (MW) and high-intensity {{ultrasound}} (US) provide innovative {{techniques for}} {{the degradation of}} persistent organic pollutants (POPs). When Fenton's reagent is used to treat industrial wastes, organic pollutants are degraded by highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (HO·) that can oxidize almost any organic compound to carbon dioxide and water. These reactions, when carried out under US or MW, are faster and much more efficient. The present work assesses the combined effect of US and MW using a new flow reactor developed in our laboratory.

40|$|The {{replacement}} of artificial with natural dyes {{is one of}} the most challenging research fields in the food production area. Recent studies have shown that some frequently used synthetic colours, called the “Southampton 6 Colours” may be linked with hyperactivity in children. The purpose of this work is to analyse the degradation behaviour of black carrot, a natural, red dye commonly used for colouring food products, and subsequently improve its stability during heat and storage conditions. The stability of the black carrot mixture to heat exposure was investigated at a range of pH values by heat-treating aqueous solutions in a <b>domestic</b> <b>oven</b> at around 180 oC to maintain the temperature at 100 oC and the powdered material in a furnace at 180 oC (typical baking conditions). 1 H NMR (800 MHz) spectroscopy was used for the assignment of the aromatic chemical shifts of the black carrot mixture by overlaying them with the characterised 1 H NMR chemical shifts of the individual components separated by RP-HPLC. Integration of high-resolution 1 H NMR (800 MHz) spectra was used to follow the relative degradation of each of the components. Different procedures for the complexation of black carrot with metal oxides were developed, for which colourants of different colour shades were prepared. Spectroscopic techniques were used to follow the degradation of the complexes which were heat-treated at 180 oC. Nano-scale investigation of the metal oxide powders was also carried out. The optimised colourants were tested on a bench scale and subsequently on an industrial scale in food pilot procedures. The successful complexes produced were found to be more heat stable compared to the commercial black carrot dye.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a self-cleaning catalytic coating for application on <b>domestic</b> <b>oven</b> windows. The thin, optically transparent coating should be able to remove food stains on the window pane by catalytic oxidation at temperatures as low as 250 &# 176;C. The purpose is to increase the visibility through the window in order to monitor the cooking progress, as well as to reduce the effort to clean the window manually. Previous research in this area yielded catalytic coatings that are very active at low temperature, but these could only be applied on the walls of <b>domestic</b> <b>oven</b> because of their thickness and non-transparency. On the other hand, research on thin, transparent coatings for windows focused mainly on heating devices that operate at temperatures far above the normal cooking temperatures in ovens. In this thesis, a protocol is established to screen a broad range of catalytic compositions for application on oven windows. Based on a modified citric acid complexation method, thin, optically transparent oxide coatings are synthesized on commercial glass substrates. Their performance is evaluated in the oxidation of a thin layer of pre-oxidized lipid at 250 &# 176;C, as followed by FTIR and visual/UV-Vis spectroscopic inspection. Based on both evaluation methods, manganese and mixed manganese-ceria oxide coatings with a thickness of around 35 nm are selected as the most promising ones: they combine an excellent activity for oxidative removal of the contaminant with the desired optical characteristics. Optimization of the manganese based oxide reveals that the introduction of mesopores increases the catalytic activity of the coating and that 10 to maximally 20 mol% of ceria intimately mixed with MnOx shows a synergistic catalytic effect. The mixed Mn-Ce oxide is studied {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms involved in the oxidative removal of the organic contaminants. Surface analysis revealed that during reaction with the contaminant the valence of the manganese oxide decreased from its initial value between + 3 and + 4. A less pronounced reduction in the presence of ceria suggests the transfer of lattice oxygen from ceria to Mn oxide which would explain the higher activity of the mixed oxide. Nevertheless, the reoxidation of the oxide by gas phase oxygen at 250 &# 176;C seems to be the rate limiting step. Gas analysis indicates that ca. 3 times as much CO 2 is produced on the catalyst-coated glass than on a blank glass slide in oxygen atmosphere. The liquid phase products resemble those of a catalyzed liquid phase autoxidation, with too high catalyst concentrations inhibiting the conversion of the lipid. Therefore, an oxidation mechanism involving elements of a Mars  van Krevelen mechanism and a metal ion catalyzed liquid phase mechanism is proposed. The performance of the selected catalyst is further tested with more severe contamination. From a certain loading on, the catalytic oxidation is too slow to remove the organic contaminants totally. Heat-induced and transition metal ion catalysed radical polymerisation reactions occur in the oil, leading to unwanted browning of the oily contaminant. Several approaches are investigated to reduce the darkening of a thick oil drop when applied on the catalytic coating. The creation of an oleophilic catalytic surface and the addition of an oxygen-diffusing underlayer were examined. Since the browning of the oil is correlated with the direct contact of the oil with the catalyst, the addition of an inert, porous oleophilic top layer and the addition of a permeable oleophobic top layer were tested. The browning of oil on the oleophobic surface is dependent on which wetting regime applies (Wenzel or Cassie-Baxter). Overall, in case of overloading of the catalyst, it seems difficult to achieve good catalytic activity without browning of the oil contaminant. nrpages: 240 status: publishe...|$|E
