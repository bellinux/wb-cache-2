5|$|Slow lorises have {{an unusually}} low basal {{metabolic}} rate, about 40% {{of the typical}} value for placental mammals of their size, {{comparable to that of}} sloths. Since they consume a relatively high-calorie diet that is available year-round, it has been proposed that this slow metabolism is due primarily to the need to eliminate toxic compounds from their food. For example, slow lorises can feed on Gluta bark, which may be <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> humans.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{numbers of}} "compact" and "sub-compact" cars on American {{roads in the}} late sixties and early seventies have given rise to a number of controversies with regard to the safety aspects of these vehicles. The major {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationships between fatal accidents and the size of vehicles involved. Specific objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the significance of the size of the vehicle and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>fatal</b> accidents; 2) <b>to</b> determine the significance of the age, sex, status of the driver (drinking), proximity of residence of the driver, and its relationship <b>to</b> <b>fatal</b> accidents; 3) <b>to</b> determine the significance of traffic density, vehicle defects, weather conditions, and light conditions <b>to</b> <b>fatal</b> accidents; 4) <b>to</b> identify the important factors that contribute <b>to</b> <b>fatal</b> accidents; and 5) to suggest what measures of traffic safety might be necessary <b>to</b> reduce <b>fatal</b> accidents. The data analyzed was both secondary and cross-sectional in nature. Ten sets of equations, each set with 92 observations were subjected to regression analysis. Following the analysis, the criteria set forth under the Model and Methodology were used to determine the factors. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

Bullet ants (Paraponera), located in Central and South America, are considered to have the most painful sting of any insect, although it is usually not <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> humans. This sting is given the highest rating on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E

5|$|The king soon revoked the {{charters}} {{of freedom}} and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued {{in other parts of}} the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at Billericay, he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt. Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> his reign.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat to the conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E

He described Fawkes's appearance to arm Harry and then to heal him as a deus ex machina: he said that the book does not explain how Fawkes knew where to find Harry; and Fawkes's timing had to be very precise, as arriving earlier would probably have prevented the battle with the basilisk, while arriving later would have been <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> Harry and Ginny.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors contributed to the {{collapse}} of this initial resistance and to nearly all non-Muslim majority princely states agreeing to accede to India. An important factor was the lack of unity among the princes. The smaller states did not trust the larger states to protect their interests, and many Hindu rulers did not trust Muslim princes, in particular Hamidullah Khan, the Nawab of Bhopal and a leading proponent of independence, whom they viewed as an agent for Pakistan. Others, believing integration to be inevitable, sought to build bridges with the Congress, hoping thereby to gain a say in shaping the final settlement. The resultant inability to present a united front or agree on a common position significantly reduced their bargaining power in negotiations with the Congress. The decision by the Muslim League {{to stay out of the}} Constituent Assembly was also <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> the princes' plan to build an alliance with it to counter the Congress, and attempts to boycott the Constituent Assembly altogether failed on 28 April 1947, when the states of Baroda, Bikaner, Cochin, Gwalior, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Patiala and Rewa took their seats in the Assembly.|$|E

5|$|After {{the other}} {{candidates}} had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By the end of the first day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded even all of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the first}} devices {{external}} to the human body that are considered instruments are rattles, stampers, and various drums. These earliest instruments evolved due to the human motor impulse to add sound to emotional movements such as dancing. Eventually, some cultures assigned ritual functions to their musical instruments, using them for hunting and various ceremonies. Those cultures developed more complex percussion instruments and other instruments such as ribbon reeds, flutes, and trumpets. Some of these labels carry far different connotations from those used in modern day; early flutes and trumpets are so-labeled for their basic operation and function rather than any resemblance to modern instruments. Among early cultures for whom drums developed ritual, even sacred importance are the Chukchi people of the Russian Far East, the indigenous people of Melanesia, and many cultures of Africa. In fact, drums were pervasive throughout every African culture. One East African tribe, the Wahinda, believed it was so holy that seeing a drum would be <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> any person other than the sultan.|$|E
5|$|Another area {{of concern}} is California, where {{recovery}} began to fluctuate or decline in the late 1990s. Unusually high mortality rates amongst adult and subadult otters, particularly females, have been reported. In 2017 the US Geological Survey found a 3% drop in the sea otter population of the California coast. This number still keeps them on track for removal from the endangered species list, although just barely. Necropsies of dead sea otters indicate diseases, particularly Toxoplasma gondii and acanthocephalan parasite infections, are major causes of sea otter mortality in California. The Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which is often <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> sea otters, is carried by wild and domestic cats and may be transmitted by domestic cat droppings flushed into the ocean via sewage systems. Although disease has clearly contributed {{to the deaths of}} many of California's sea otters, it is not known why the California population is apparently more affected by disease than populations in other areas.|$|E

5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and are injured at work more often and more severely.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove <b>fatal</b> <b>to</b> cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E

Two hypothetical case examples are given, demonstrating the use of the equations. The equations highlight the need to examine the risks associated with individuals, their specific jobs and their workplaces. They also highlight significant uncertainties in the determination of fitness, which perhaps have been underestimated in the past. Wherever possible, redundant defences should be utilized to prevent accidents in the event of sudden incapacity...|$|R
