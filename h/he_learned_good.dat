Both authors admitted to the hoax having backfired to a certain extent, as it overshadowed their more serious work.

50|$|Gooch was {{introduced}} to jazz and blues at an early age. By thirteen, taking his music seriously, he enrolled on a course of classical guitar lessons. The disciplines <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> were <b>good</b> grounding for him, but he soon realised his interest lay outside of the classical sphere, and moved towards rock and blues. At first he was influenced by his childhood heroes, Larry Carlton, Steely Dan, The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Led Zeppelin, Buddy Guy and later Frank Zappa. Gooch replaced Alvin Lee in Ten Years After, with limited success, and later formed Hundred Seventy Split with bassist Leo Lyons.|$|R

Mrs. Otter was useful to him too, and sometimes Miss Chalice criticised his work; <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> from the glib loquacity of Lawson and from the example of Clutton. But Fanny Price hated him to take suggestions from anyone but herself, and when he asked her help after someone else had been talking to him she would refuse with brutal rudeness. The other fellows, Lawson, Clutton, Flanagan, chaffed him about her.|$|R

60|$|Presently {{he began}} too {{to find that}} <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> little <b>good</b> in the {{classical}} lecture. His fellow-students there were too dull, as in mathematics they were too learned for him. Mr. Buck, the tutor, was no better a scholar than many a fifth-form boy at Grey Friars; might have some stupid humdrum notions about the metre and grammatical construction of a passage of Aeschylus or Aristophanes, but had no more notion of the poetry than Mrs. Binge, his bed-maker; and Pen grew weary of hearing the dull students and tutor blunder through a few lines of a play, which he could read in a tenth {{part of the time}} which they gave to it. After all, private reading, as he began to perceive, was the only study which was really profitable to a man; and he announced to his mamma that he should read by himself a great deal more, and in public a great deal less. That excellent woman knew no more about Homer than she did about Algebra, but she was quite contented with Pen's arrangements regarding his course of studies, and felt perfectly confident that her dear boy would get the place which he merited.|$|R
2500|$|James {{was born}} into slavery in Frederick County, Virginia, but sources differ as to the year: 1798 or 1800. Being born of mixed race, he had a mother who was an enslaved African-American mulatto woman, and his father was her master, Sir Jennings Beckwith, a {{descendant}} of Irish and English nobility. Little was known about Beckwourth's mother, but James {{was said to be}} third of her thirteen children. When James was a boy, his father arranged to apprentice him to a blacksmith so that <b>he</b> could <b>learn</b> a <b>good</b> trade. <b>He</b> acknowledged James as his son.

60|$|A {{citizen of}} Pittsburg, aged sixty, had, by tireless {{industry}} and the exercise of rigid economy, accumulated a hoard of frugal dollars, the sight and feel whereof were to his soul a pure delight. Imagine his sorrow and the heaviness of his aged heart when <b>he</b> <b>learned</b> that the <b>good</b> wife had bestowed thereof upon her brother bountiful largess exceeding his merit. Sadly and prayerfully while she slept lifted he the retributive mallet and beat in her brittle pate. Then with the quiet dignity of one who has redressed a grievous wrong, surrendered himself unto the law this worthy old man. Let him who has never known the great grief of slaughtering a wife judge him harshly. He that is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone-and let it be a large heavy stone that shall grind that wicked old man into a powder of exceeding impalpability. The Faithful Wife.|$|R
5000|$|Born into {{a working-class}} family {{living in a}} peasant house in Vaslui, Romania. An {{adequate}} but unexceptional student (although <b>he</b> did apparently <b>learn</b> <b>good</b> German), his first exposure to the stage was by attending plays at [...] "Pârjoala" [...] garden, where he saw popular theater, including actors such as Zaharia Burienescu and I.D. Ionescu. This inspired him to start an amateur theater group among his friends; they worked up scenes from the plays Meşterul Manole, Căpitanul Valter Mărăcineanu and Constantin Brâncoveanu; their {{closest thing to a}} stage was a barn.His first professional experience as an actor was in the Yiddish-language theater troupe of Mordechai Segalescu: they were short an actor for a performance in Vaslui and drafted the youthful Tănase. In 1896 he completed gymnasium. Despite his wish to become an actor, at his parents behest he enrolled in the Military School at Iaşi, but his rebellious behavior there quickly got him booted out. He headed to Brăila, where he briefly attended the [...] "Nicolae Bălcescu" [...] High School, but after a few weeks he dropped out due to lack of funds.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Walter Fullerton ordered Diana held in {{jail for}} four days until {{sentencing}} without bail, which drew criticism from publications such as St. Petersburg Times and Mother Jones magazine, with the latter's Sean Henry stating that while this was the norm for murderers and drug lords, {{it is not so}} for those convicted of misdemeanors. Fullerton explained, [...] "I felt incarceration in jail was part of the sentence, so why not begin? <b>He</b> <b>learned</b> some <b>good</b> lessons." [...] Though Baggish recommended Diana be incarcerated for two years, Fullerton sentenced Diana to three years of supervised probation, a $3,000 fine ($1,000 for each count), 1,248 hours of community service, and ordered him to avoid contact with minors. Fullerton also ordered Diana to follow a state-supervised psychiatric evaluation at his own expense, to take an ethics-in-journalism class, and ruled that he was to submit to unannounced, warrantless searches of his personal papers by the police and deputized probation officers from the Salvation Army, which would allow them to seize any drawings or writings. Although such random searches during probation are typical only in drug and weapons cases, Baggish stated that it was natural to extend this for obscenity convictions, saying, [...] "Treatment is {{the most important part of}} the sentence", and that such searches were needed to force Diana [...] "to refrain in a rehabilitative vein from this conduct. To cure the psychological maladjustment, necessary to catch him in his true state." ...|$|R
60|$|However, the crew's {{opinion of}} the green-hand captain {{had been a good}} deal changed. In his various cruises <b>he</b> had <b>learned</b> a <b>good</b> deal about navigation, and could now give very fair orders, and his furious pursuit of Blackbeard had also given him a {{reputation}} for reckless bravery which he had not enjoyed before. A man who was chafing and fuming for a chance of a hand-to-hand conflict with the greatest pirate of the day must be a pretty good sort of a fellow from their point of view. Moreover, their strutting and stalking captain, so recently balked of his dark revenge, was a very savage-looking man, and it would not be pleasant either to try to persuade him to give up his piratical intention, or to decline to join him in carrying it out; so the whole of the crew, minor officers and men, changed their minds about going to St. Thomas, and agreed to hoist the skull and cross-bones, and to follow Captain Bonnet wherever he might lead.|$|R
5000|$|Napier's {{father was}} Sir Archibald Napier of Merchiston Castle, {{and his mother}} was Janet Bothwell, {{daughter}} of the politician and judge Francis Bothwell, Lord of Session, and a sister of Adam Bothwell who became the Bishop of Orkney. Archibald Napier was 16 years old when John Napier was born.As was the common practice for members of the nobility at that time, he was privately tutored and did not have formal education until he was 13, when he was sent to St Salvator's College, St Andrews. He did not stay in college very long. It is believed that he dropped out of school in Scotland and perhaps travelled in mainland Europe to better continue his studies. Little is known about those years, where, when, or with whom he might have studied, although his uncle Adam Bothwell wrote a letter to John's father on 5 December 1560, saying [...] "I pray you, sir, to send John to the schools either to France or Flanders, for <b>he</b> can <b>learn</b> no <b>good</b> at home", and it is believed that this advice was followed.|$|R

60|$|But why? What {{need for}} the soldier and the man of science to fraternise just now? This need: the two classes which will have an increasing, {{it may be a}} preponderating, {{influence}} on the fate of the human race for some time, will be the pupils of Aristotle and those of Alexander--the men of science and the soldiers. In spite of all appearances, and all declamations to the contrary, that is my firm conviction. They, and they alone, will be left to rule; because they alone, each in his own sphere, have learnt to obey. It is therefore most needful for the welfare of society that they should pull with, and not against each other; that they should understand each other, respect each other, take counsel with each other, supplement each other's defects, bring out each other's higher tendencies, counteract each other's lower ones. The scientific man has something to learn of you, gentlemen, which I doubt not that <b>he</b> will <b>learn</b> in <b>good</b> time. You, again, have--as I have been hinting to you to-night--something to learn of him, which you, I doubt not, will <b>learn</b> in <b>good</b> time likewise. Repeat, each of you according to his powers, the old friendship between Aristotle and Alexander; and so, from your mutual sympathy and co-operation, a class of thinkers and actors may yet arise which can save this nation, and the other civilised nations of the world, from that of which I had rather not speak, and wish that I did not think too often and too earnestly.|$|R
