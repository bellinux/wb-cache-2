40|$|INTRODUCTION: Interest in the {{possibility}} of certain insulin treatments having the potential to modify cancer development and prognosis was reawakened in 2009, following publication of several epidemiological studies addressing this issue. This interest extends to how diabetes itself and cancer might be linked, and makes desirable an <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>expert</b> views and knowledge to enhance understanding in this subject among those treating diabetes and cancer, or those developing diabetes therapies. METHODS: A European meeting was convened with participants invited based on known relevant interests in endocrinology, oncology, epidemiology, and insulin analog design and investigation. Experts in these fields were invited to present on relevant topics, with open discussions held after each presentation. RESULTS: Concern over the potential mitogenic properties of certain insulin analogs has arisen from some (but not all) epidemiological studies, although confounding factors render interpretation controversial. Future epidemiological studies are likely to strengthen confidence in drawing conclusions. Meanwhile, pharmacological studies, and a consideration of cancer pathophysiology, implicate increased insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor affinity, and/or deranged insulin receptor interaction/signaling properties as possible a priori causes for concern with some insulin analogs. Again, interpretation of the body of pharmacological evidence is confounded by the array of test systems and methodologies used, and by studies frequently succumbing to methodological pitfalls. Reassuringly, most available insulin analogs do not differ in their receptor interaction response profile to human insulin, and for those that do there are reasons to question any potential clinical relevance. Nevertheless, it is desirable that new experimental models are devised that can better determine the likely clinical consequences of any variance in receptor response profile versus human insulin. CONCLUSION: More data are required to increase our understanding of this issue. To facilitate and disseminate such understanding, close cooperation and communication between diabetologists, epidemiologists, oncologists, and insulin engineers will be essential...|$|R

It presents an overview of international activities fostering the transition process, carried out within the UNECE/FAO integrated programme of work. The decisive role of MCPFE is recognized: the adoption of Resolution H 3 is considered a milestone of international cooperation. The results of its implementation are presented. Cooperation was focused mainly on capacity building, dissemination of knowledge and information, education, training, and transfer of know-how as well as policy and strategy improvement. The main forms of cooperation were study tours, workshops, seminars, <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>experts</b> {{and other forms of}} education. The outcomes and recommendations of several workshops are analyzed in detail. The Joint UNECE/FAO Team of Specialists to monitor and develop assistance in the forest sector and the implementation of the H 3 resolution focused its activities on three main areas of assistance: institution building and framework conditions, building of the legal and policy infrastructure; activities related to the development of market oriented and ecologically sound enterprises; and issues of general importance for the protection of forests, forest conservation and sustainable development.

The {{focus is on the}} building- and HVAC-models used for each of three distinct CCx-domains: The identifcation of energy conserving opportunities (ECOs), fault detection, diagnosis, evaluation and overhaul (FDDe) and model-based control (MBC). For each domain, the relations between chosen model structure, model order, parameter estimation procedure, available sensor data quality and calculation power are highlighted. These insights are critical for office building managers,BEMS manufacturers and researchers involved or interested in the selection and implementation of MBCC strategies. The analyses indicate that the chosen model order and parameter estimation technique depend highly on available calculation power and data availability. Full model-sharing between different subtopics is rarely performed, presumably due to the diversity of model requirements for each CCx-domain. Several model structures and parameter estimation procedures -e. g. multi-step-ahead and subspace identifcation- are recurring frequently within one domain -e. g. MBC-.
