5|$|Liz becomes furious when Jack {{decides that}} Tracy {{should be the}} number one {{priority}} on The Girlie Show. Jenna fears that Tracy will begin to overshadow her, but Tracy is quite pleased with his new job on the show. Liz and Jenna become more aggravated when Jack decides to {{change the name of}} The Girlie Show to TGS with Tracy Jordan, without consulting either of them. Jack has Tracy and Jenna appear in a promotion for the show, in which Tracy angers Jenna by forgetting her name and by not letting her speak. After the promotion, Liz tries to re-assure Jenna by telling her that nobody on the show likes Tracy and that the only reason that he is on the show is because of Jack. Liz finds out that Jenna's microphone was still on, and everyone in the studio <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>say</b> terrible things about Jack and Tracy.|$|E
500|$|Liu Xia {{was under}} house-arrest almost {{immediately}} after the announcement, and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband. She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother {{had not been able}} to get through to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats who had tried to visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>say</b> [...] "they are forcing me to leave Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E
500|$|While {{working in}} the studio for her fifth studio album, Beyoncé demanded from Miguel to write a song in which nothing was [...] "off-limits" [...] and where he could push the {{envelope}} creatively. He recalled that they collaborated soon after she had had her first baby. Inside the studio, she told him, [...] "'Listen I feel so empowered at this time and place. You'll have to put me on a pedestal, like, never mind that it's Beyoncé. I wanna make music {{that makes me feel}} or shows that I feel hot and I'm confident and I wanna feel empowered because that's what I meant in my life'". For the opening lines of the song, Miguel was inspired by the singer herself: [...] "What's the first thing I'd want Beyoncé to say to me, as a man? What have I not <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>say?</b> That's where the song came from." [...] He further noted that [...] "Rocket" [...] managed to showcase a new part of the singer which was confident, sexual and liberating at the same time.|$|E

500|$|As the Pope was, at that time, {{prisoner}} of Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, {{as a result}} of the Sack of Rome in May 1527, Knight had some difficulty obtaining access. In the end he had to return with a conditional dispensation, which Wolsey insisted was technically insufficient. Henry now had no choice but to put his great matter into Wolsey's hands, who did all he could to secure a decision in Henry's favour, even going so far as to convene an ecclesiastical court in England, with a special emissary, Lorenzo Campeggio from the Pope himself to decide the matter. But the Pope never had empowered his deputy to make any decision. The Pope was still a veritable hostage of Charles V, and Charles V was loyal to his aunt, Catherine. The Pope forbade Henry to contract a new marriage until a decision was reached in Rome, not in England. Convinced that Wolsey's loyalties lay with the Pope, not England, Anne, as well as Wolsey's many enemies, ensured his dismissal from public office in 1529. George Cavendish, Wolsey's chamberlain, records that the servants who waited on the king and Anne at dinner in 1529 in Grafton <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>say</b> that the dishonour that Wolsey had brought upon the realm would have cost any other Englishman his head. Henry replied, [...] "Why then I perceive...you are not the Cardinal's friend." [...] Henry finally agreed to Wolsey's arrest on grounds of praemunire. Had it not been for his death from illness in 1530, he might have been executed for treason. A year later in 1531 (fully two years before Henry's marriage to Anne), Queen Catherine was banished from court and her rooms were given to Anne.|$|E

[...] In a long-redacted interview for Life magazine days later, Mrs. Kennedy recalled, [...] "All the ride to the hospital I kept bending over him saying, 'Jack, Jack, can you hear me? I love you, Jack.' I kept holding {{the top of his}} head down trying to keep the ..." [...] The President's widow could not finish her sentence.|$|E
2500|$|When he was 6 years old, Barrie's next-older brother David (his mother's favourite) {{died two}} days before his 14th {{birthday}} in an ice-skating accident. This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Is that you?" [...] "I {{thought it was the}} dead boy she was speaking to", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother Margaret Ogilvy (1896) [...] "and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me. Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as Robinson Crusoe, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and The Pilgrim's Progress.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said his}} friend, [...] "but I did. We'd been married three years--three long years--and I had 'ad enough of it. Awful temper she had. The last words I ever <b>heard</b> <b>'er</b> <b>say</b> was: 'Take that!'" ...|$|R

2500|$|By the 1950s Australia was gripped {{in a red}} scare {{similar to}} that which led to McCarthyism in the United States. Attempts by the Liberal Prime Minister Robert Menzies to outlaw the Communist Party of Australia were {{overturned}} in the High Court of Australia (see Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth) and defeated at a referendum in 1951. Members {{on both sides of}} the Australian House of Representatives advocated severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Relations between Australia and the Soviet Union hit a low point when Vladimir Petrov, the Third Secretary of the Soviet embassy in Canberra, an associate and appointee of Lavrentiy Beria who feared execution if he returned to the Soviet Union, defected at the end of his three-year assignment on 3 April 1954 with the help of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and was given political asylum. The defection, which became known as the Petrov Affair, was disclosed by Menzies on 13 April 1954, the eve of the last day of Parliament before the May federal election. In his notice to Parliament Menzies disclosed that Petrov was an agent of the MVD and turned over to the Australian authorities details of Soviet intelligence operations in Australia, and announced intention for a Royal Commission to investigate Petrov's information, which included allegations of a Soviet fifth column being created in Australia. The revelations shocked the Australian public, which was more attuned to such things happening overseas. It was also reported that Evdokia Petrova, Petrov's wife and fellow MVD agent, had decided to stay with the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, and on 14 April, Petrova and Nikolai Generalov, the Soviet ambassador, accused Australian security services of kidnapping Petrov. On 19 April, the affair took another twist when Petrova was being escorted onto a waiting BOAC Constellation at Kingsford Smith Airport by Soviet diplomatic couriers for a flight back to the Soviet Union. William Wentworth took statutory declarations from Russian and Czechoslovakian anti-communists in the crowd who had stormed the tarmac to prevent Petrova from leaving, that they had <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>say</b> Petrova calling out in Russian [...] "I do not want to go. Save me", and asked Menzies to make the aircraft stop at Darwin in order to ask Petrova whether she wanted to leave Australia. Contrary to reports, Petrova did not cry out for help at Sydney Airport, but the aircraft did stop at Darwin Airport on a scheduled fuel-stop, enabling Australian security services to interview Petrova. After talking to Reginald Sylvester Leydin, the Government secretary, and to her husband on the phone, Petrova accepted the Australian government's offer of asylum and defected. The Soviets accused the Menzies government of manufacturing the defection of Petrov as an election stunt, ostensibly to boost his support in the upcoming elections, and on 21 April they also levelled against Petrov charges that he had misappropriated Embassy funds. Menzies dismissed the allegations, stating that he was waiting for such charges to be levelled as they were in the Gouzenko case in Canada, and also went on to say he believed the charges contradicted the Soviets' initial allegation that Petrov was kidnapped. The Australian government refused to hand over Petrov, who was deemed by the Soviets to be a criminal, and the Soviet government responded on 23 April 1954 by severing diplomatic relations with Australia, which saw the Soviet Embassy in Canberra being recalled and the Australian Embassy in Moscow being expelled. The Soviet decision was not unexpected, as it was thought by the Australian government to have been one possible response, but the swiftness of the decision was said to have shocked government advisers. The severance of diplomatic relations led to rumours that the Soviet Olympic team would not compete at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. In the absence of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union's interests in Australia were represented by Sweden, and Australia's interests in the Soviet Union were represented by the United Kingdom.|$|E

6000|$|The young prince had pity on her, {{and offered}} to take her behind him, which he did. As they passed by a ruined {{building}} the lady dismounted and went in. The prince also dismounted and followed her. To his great surprise, he <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>saying</b> to some one inside, [...] "Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth."

60|$|He <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> voice <b>say</b> something, felt <b>her</b> lips {{touching}} his nose, and, snuggling up beside her who lay awake and loved {{him with her}} thoughts, he fell into the dreamless sleep, which rounded off his past.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] Corp went on painfully, [...] "she canna help being fond o' him, {{though she}} thinks she shouldna hae had him.

6000|$|The {{relief from}} the stress upon him was delicious.

6000|$|He {{was content}} to have Bessie stay on, though he was almost {{dropping}} with sleep, for {{he was afraid that}} if she went at once, the carriage might not have got back, and the whole affair must somehow be given away; at last, if she were waiting, she decided to wait no longer, and then Westover {{did not know how to}} keep her. He saw her rise and stoop over her aunt, putting her mouth to the elder lady's ear, and he <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I am going home, Aunt Louisa."

"'For the minute,' {{continued}} James Fairbairn, 'a thought {{did just}} cross {{my mind that}} something might perhaps be wrong, and I put my newspaper aside {{and went to the}} other end of the room towards the glass partition. The manager's room was still quite dark, and I could not clearly see into it, but the door into the hall was open, and there was, of course, a light through there. I had got quite close to the partition, when I saw Mrs. Ireland standing in the doorway, and <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>saying</b> in a very astonished tone of voice: 'Why, Lewis, I thought you had gone to your club ages ago.

He subdued it, however; <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> <b>saying,</b> 'the truth, the whole truth, {{and nothing but the}} truth,' and looked up. She made a rich figure of it, in her furs and large hat, with a slight flush on her cheek-bones, calm, matter-of-fact; and he felt proud of her thus confronting all these 'confounded lawyers.' The examination began. Knowing that this was only the preliminary to divorce, Val followed with a certain glee the questions framed so as {{to give the impression that}} she really wanted his father back.
