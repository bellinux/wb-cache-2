40|$|ITER Task No. D 201, Vacuum Vessel Design (Subtask 1. 3 and Subtask 3), was {{initiated}} to propose and evaluate local vacuum vessel reinforcement alternatives in {{proximity to the}} Neutral Beam, Radial Mid-Plane, Top, and Divertor Ports. These areas were reported to be highly stressed regions {{based on the results}} of preliminary stress analyses performed by the USHT (US Home Team) and the ITER <b>Joint</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Team</b> (JCT) at the Garching JWS (Joint Work Site). Initial design activities focused on the divertor port region which was reported to experience the highest stress intensities. Existing stress analysis models and results were reviewed with the USHT stress analysts to obtain an overall understanding of the vessel response to the various applied loads. These reviews indicated that the reported stress intensities in the divertor port region were significantly affected by the loads applied to the vessel in adjacent regions...|$|E
40|$|Interactions between plasmas {{and their}} {{surrounding}} materials (plasma facing components) are {{of great interest}} to present and future magnetic fusion experiments, and ITER [ITER Physics Basis Editors, ITER Physics Exper Group Chairs, ITER <b>Joint</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Team,</b> and Physics Inte gration Unit, Nucl. Fusion 39, 2137 (1999) ] in particular. This interest is the result of concerns with the survivability of these materials, as well as the impact of these interactions back on the plasma. These interactions begin on the surface, but can have consequences a few microns into the material. This mini-conference on these "first microns" was designed to bring to the Division of Plasma Physics Meeting experts on these topics who would otherwise not attend. At the same time, the mini-conference was intended to expose the broader fusion community to these issues. The mini-conference covered in three, half-day sessions the topics of lithium coatings and surfaces, mixed materials characteristics, and issues associated with graphite...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} {{effort in the}} ITER Engineering Design Activities (EDA) since 1998 has been the {{development}} of a new design to meet revised technical objectives and a cost reduction target of about 50 % of the previously accepted cost estimate. Drawing on the design solutions already developed and using the latest physics results and outputs from technology R&D projects, the <b>Joint</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Team</b> and Home Teams, working jointly, have been able to converge towards a new design which will allow the exploration of a range of burning plasma conditions, with a capacity to progress towards possible modes of steady state operation. As such the new ITER design, whilst having reduced technical objectives from its predecessor, will nonetheless meet the programmatic objective of providing an integrated demonstration of the scientific and technological feasibility of fusion energy. The main features of the current design and of its projected performance are introduced and the outlook for construction and operation is summarised. 1...|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} the pedigree {{analysis of the}} MELCOR 1. 8. 2 code {{to be used for}} ITER’s Report Preliminary on Safety. To pedigree the code the process involved four steps. First, taking the modified MELCOR 1. 8. 2 code used by the ITER <b>Joint</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Team</b> (JCT) for analyses in previous ITER Safety Assessments and compared the FORTRAN code of this version line-by-line to the original 1. 8. 2 version of MELCOR. The second step was a non-regression analysis which involves comparing the results from the pedigreed version against those predicted by the original, unmodified version of MELCOR 1. 8. 2. The third step involved comparing the pedigreed version results to results from the MELCOR version used by the ITER JCT for the Generic Site Safety Report (GSSR) against a set of accident problems analyzed for the safety report. The fourth and final step involved a comparison between the pedigreed version of the code and the developmental test problems cited in the change documents referenced in this report. The results from the pedigree process are described in this report...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the life-history of an institutional complex, namely the emergence, functioning and breakdown of <b>joint</b> <b>central</b> regulation in Sweden. Institutionalisation {{is divided into}} four stages and comparisons are made with Denmark, Norway and Britain at each stage. The first stage was {{the formation of the}} labour movement between l 880 and l 898. Union organisation developed from a local craft unionism to a class-wide federation. The class-wide character of this federation is explained in terms of the influence of socialism and the movement away from craft unionism, which are in turn related to Sweden's industrialisation and democratisation. The second stage was the employer counter-attack during {{the first decade of the}} twentieth century. An escalatory pattern of conflict developed in the engineering industry and then at federal level, the existence of a class-wide union federation stimulating the class-wide organisation of the employers. Out of this conflict came an embryonic <b>joint</b> <b>central</b> regulation, though the defeat of the 1909 general strike led to a reversion to decentralised industrial relations. The third stage saw the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>central</b> regulation with the negotiation of the 1938 Basic Agreement. While inherited organisational structures were a necessary condition, Social Democrat government precipitated the 1938 compromise but only after attempts to further develop state regulation had failed. Although an organised opposition had developed within labour, the main resistance to <b>joint</b> <b>central</b> regulation came from a group of employers. In the fourth, postwar, stage <b>joint</b> <b>central</b> regulation culminated in the institutionalising of central wage negotiations. The expansion of the public sector, economic growth and intensified political conflict then undermined <b>joint</b> <b>central</b> regulation, though it also had certain self-undermining features. In the 1970 's industrial conflict and legislative regulation increased, as the corporatist integration of industrial relations broke down...|$|R
40|$|The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Project {{requires}} {{a set of}} buildings, {{each with its own}} distinct function, to support ITER`s mission. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Team</b> (JCT) has identified all the buildings in the set and has placed them in an efficient arrangement on the site. The JCT has developed a conceptual layout of each individual building. The buildings have been categorized into two main groups: (1) {open_quotes}Level 1 Buildings{close_quotes} which are on the construction schedule critical path and (2) {open_quotes}Level 2 Buildings{close_quotes} which, while important, are not on the critical path. The buildings are further categorized according to construction material, that is, {open_quotes}reinforced concrete{close_quotes} or {open_quotes}steel-frame on concrete slab{close_quotes}. This Report responds to the Project`s request to perform the initial structural steel design for all the {open_quotes}steel-frame on concrete slab{close_quotes} buildings.

The ultimate responsibility for the adequacy of work performed on tasks assigned to the U. S. Home Team resides with the U. S. Home Team Leader and the U. S. Department of Energy Office of Fusion Energy (DOE-OFE). This document constitutes the quality assurance plan for the ITER U. S. Home Team. This plan describes the controls exercised by U. S. Home Team management and the Performing Institutions to ensure the quality of tasks performed and the data developed for the Engineering Design Activities assigned to the U. S. Home Team and, in particular, the Research and Development Large Projects (7). This plan addresses the DOE quality assurance requirements of 10 CFR 830. 120, "Quality Assurance. " The plan also describes U. S. Home Team quality commitments to the ITER Quality Assurance Program. The ITER Quality Assurance Program is based on the principles described in the International Atomic Energy Agency Standard No. 50 -C-QA, "Quality Assurance for Safety in Nuclear Power Plants and Other Nuclear Facilities. " Each commitment is supported with preferred implementation methodology that will be used in evaluating the task quality plans to be submitted by the Performing Institutions. The implementing provisions of the program are based on guidance provided in American National Standards Institute/American Society of Mechanical Engineers NQA- 1 1994, "Quality Assurance. " The individual Performing Institutions will implement the appropriate quality program provisions through their own established quality plans that have been reviewed and found to comply with U. S.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve our {{understanding}} of situation awareness (SA) in teams performing in technologically advanced command, control, and communications (C 3) operations, researchers need to develop valid approaches to assess both individual and shared SA. We investigated SA in an interdisciplinary military rescue operation training exercise. For this study, we developed procedures to measure the degree of shared SA between two team members and to improve the accuracy of their shared SA scores. We suggest that SA scores that are calculated using many existing methods may be inflated because they often fail to account for error {{in terms of both}} the amount of information that is thought to be relevant and in the accuracy of a person 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of it. We calculated true SA scores that account for both of these types of error. The measures were then used to evaluate five potential predictors of shared SA.
