5|$|The Air Combat Group (ACG) {{was created}} on 1 January 2002 with {{the merging of}} two <b>Force</b> <b>Element</b> Groups (FEGs), Strike Reconnaissance Group (F-111) and Tactical Fighter Group (F/A-18 Hornet, Hawk and PC-9A). The ACG was tasked to deliver the core {{capabilities}} of Control of the Air and Precision Air Strike {{with the hope that}} it would allow the RAAF to more quickly deploy its combat aircraft. Although the fighter and strike elements will continue to operate as discrete units for some time, ACG will provide the opportunity for the RAAF to test the organisation required to deliver a range of combat capabilities.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a mathematical programming model, *ForceOp*, {{which has been}} developed to assist army officers {{in the process of}} allocating <b>force</b> <b>elements</b> to different objectives of a mission. The model uses the concept of <b>force</b> <b>elements</b> generating effects to achieve objectives. It requires users to state objectives and then specify the effects required to achieve each objective. The <b>force</b> <b>elements</b> are then rated according to their ability to create the effects required in each objective. *ForceOp* is used to allocate <b>force</b> <b>elements</b> to the objectives in order to maximise the effectiveness of the whole deployment. The model can provide several solutions if required. User-defined allocations can be evaluated and compared. *ForceOp* complements a human decision-maker by accounting for the effects of many interacting decisions simultaneously...|$|R

5|$|The Royal Australian Navy {{today is}} a {{medium-sized}} modern navy in world terms but {{is one of the}} strongest navies in the Asia Pacific Region. Today, the combat fleet of the RAN is made up of eight s, four s, fourteen patrol boats of the , and six s. The RAN also comprises an amphibious and supply force to transport the Australian Army and to resupply the combat arm of the navy. The RAN is divided into seven <b>Force</b> <b>Element</b> Groups (FEGs): Surface Combatants, Amphibious Warfare Forces and Afloat Support Force, Naval Aviation, Submarine Force, Mine Warfare and Clearance Diving, Patrol Boat Force and the Hydrographic Force. The FEG's were formed to manage the operations of the separate sections of the RAN in a more efficient way.|$|E

5|$|The Special Air Service Regiment {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the RAR. Originally formed as the 1st SAS Company in 1957, in 1960 {{it became an}} independent company of the RAR and was tasked with providing the army's special operations capability. The SASR became a regiment {{in its own right}} on 20 August 1964, severing the link with the RAR at this time. Re-raised as a commando battalion from 1997, 4 RAR (Commando) served in East Timor as a conventional light-role battalion in 2001, before focusing on the development of its special operations capability. In this role the battalion was designed to be a flexible, self-contained <b>force</b> <b>element</b> able to deploy at short notice to undertake offensive operations in support of Australia's national interests. Once full operational capability was reached, elements of 4 RAR (Commando) would serve in Timor Leste, Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as providing a domestic counter terrorism capability as part of Tactical Assault Group (East). In 2009, 4 RAR (Commando) was renamed the 2nd Commando Regiment, and as such is no longer part of the RAR. Rather than being formally disbanded, 4 RAR remained on the Army's order of battle with its colours and traditions maintained and protected, ready to be re-raised in the future if required.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{had only}} a minor role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, providing a <b>force</b> <b>element</b> of about 40 Commandos from 4 RAR to support the Special Forces Task Group, {{which was based on}} an SASR Squadron. Following the invasion, the deteriorating security situation in Baghdad saw the deployment of a combined arms Security Detachment (SECDET), charged with protecting the Australian embassy and its personnel. Over a dozen companies of the regiment provided force elements to the various rotations. In February 2005 Prime Minister John Howard committed a battle group to southern Iraq to partially replace a Dutch unit that had been operating in the Governorate of Al Muthanna. The regiment's contribution to the first battle group, initially known as the Al Muthanna Task Group, was a rifle company, although the second and third rotations were led by 5/7 RAR and 2 RAR respectively. When Provincial Iraqi Control was declared in Al Muthanna in July 2006, AMTG 3, led by 2 RAR, was renamed the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)). The fifth battle group to serve in Iraq was based on 5 RAR, by which time OBG(W) was operating in both the Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar Governorates {{as a part of the}} British Multi-National Division South East (MND(SE)). (AMTG 1, OBG(W) 2 and OBG(W) 4 were all based on cavalry regiment headquarters). During this time elements of the regiment conducted counterinsurgency operations until withdrawn in mid-2008. Casualties in Iraq included one member of the regiment who was accidentally killed.|$|E

25|$|Camps {{were not}} {{necessarily}} in remote areas. They were often situated near hamlets, or even within them - with troops taking shelter in individual houses if the village was fully dominated by the guerilla forces. After digging in, telephone wire was run, units positioned and contact made with other surrounding military formations - especially militia and guerrilla fighters. These local units were crucial in warning, diversion and delay of GVN or US forces if the Main <b>Force</b> <b>element</b> came under attack. Communist forces generally avoided villages with high canal banks, graveyards or trees because such obstacles hindered observation and gave advancing US and ARVN troops cover. Mines and booby traps were also planted along likely avenues of approach.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the earlier}} Australian {{operations}} in the area, key Taliban leaders {{and a number of}} fighters were believed to have moved south {{along the banks of the}} Dorafshan River and Gabriel subsequently tasked Combat Team Tusk with clearing the East Dorafshan in preparation for further operations west of the river. Australian Special Forces from SOTG were also operating in the area, conducting disruption {{operations in the}} West Dorasfshan area. Between 3–15 April the Australians conducted Operation Shak Hawel (or Mysterious Area) in the fertile green-zone around Patrol Base Buman, in order to target the Taliban stronghold. More than 200 Australians were involved—nearly half the battle group—including a combined arms <b>force</b> <b>element</b> with infantry, cavalry and engineers, and an ANA battalion from the 2nd Kandak, 4th ANA Brigade. Throughout the offensive, Australian and Afghan troops were engaged in numerous fire-fights as they conducted intensive patrolling and cordon and search operations to restrict insurgent freedom of movement throughout the area of operations. However, during the biggest battle, dozens of Taliban fighters were killed as they attempted to ambush an Australian force operating in the fertile green belt.|$|E

500|$|The {{battalion}} {{provided a}} commando <b>force</b> <b>element</b> {{as part of}} the Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, known as Operation Falconer. A reinforced commando platoon formed an element of the Australian Special Forces Task Group (SFTG), which also included 1 Squadron, SASR, a troop from the Incident Response Regiment, and three CH-47 Chinook helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment. The commandos formed the [...] "quick reaction" [...] element for the task group. The SFTG operated in western Iraq where it was successful in securing its area of operations, including the huge Al Asad Air Base. After the invasion was complete, the 40-man commando element provided security to humanitarian assistance missions and other security operations, later providing close protection for Australian officials in Baghdad as part of Operation Catalyst. In 2004, claims appeared in the media that Australian special forces were involved in counter-insurgency operations inside Iraq, although this was denied by the government. The last commando element was withdrawn in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Promoted to air marshal, Newham became Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) on 21 May 1985, {{succeeding}} Air Marshal David Evans. [...] Newham initially {{endorsed the}} Federal government's 1986 Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, {{otherwise known as}} the Dibb Report, but shortly afterwards publicly criticised its [...] "understanding of the application of air power" [...] and [...] "debatable judgments", especially its lukewarm attitude to the employment of the F-111s for strategic strike. At a conference the same year, he reiterated the RAAF's position that [...] "defensive action may prevent defeat, but wars can be won only by offensive action". On 9 June, he was raised to Companion of the Order of Australia for service to the RAAF, [...] "particularly as Chief of the Air Staff". Newham's term as CAS was also marked by the Federal government's decision to transfer the RAAF's battlefield helicopters to the Australian Army, against the recommendation of an independent committee. According to Air Force historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, [...] "Newham protected {{the best interests of}} the Australian Defence Force by getting on with the business of effecting the transfer, notwithstanding the deep disappointment within his own service. In February 1987, OPCOM (subsequently Air Command) was restructured into <b>Force</b> <b>Element</b> Groups (FEGs), large functional organisations that supplanted the earlier concept of all-powerful air base commands, to which every unit on a base reported. Initially established on a one-year trial basis, the FEGs have remained in place.|$|E
