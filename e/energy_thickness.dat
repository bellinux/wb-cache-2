Autoignition within this separation zone exhibits strong dependence on flow pressure and temperature, injector diameter, local boundary layer <b>energy</b> <b>thickness,</b> wall temperature, and on fluid dynamic interactions with adjacent downstream facing steps (such as inlet isolation steps).

40|$|Abstract The Bjelovar Sub-basin is {{situated}} in Northern Croatia and constitutes the southwestern branch of the Drava Basin. The Neogene-Quaternary sedimentary section can be subdivided into three megacycles, which are separated by regional unconformities. The data analyzed {{in this study are}} related to the first megacycle, which is characterized by a tectonic-erosional unconformity above the Neogene basement (electric log, abbr. e-log marker Pt or Tg); its top is the regional e-log marker Rs 7. It is generally assumed that the Rs 7 marker separates Sarmatian and Pannonian sediments and indicates the period just after the first transtensional and first transpressional events. The youngest elog marker, Rs 5, represents the Lower/Upper Pannonian boundary (in Croatian stratigraphic nomenclature) and more generally the early period of the second transtensional event. The lithology of the Lower and Middle Badenian is characterized by coarse and medium-grained sediments, while the Upper Badenian to Lower Pannonian section is dominantly pelitic as a result of flattening of the eroded paleorelief, as well as of reduced amounts of fans and <b>energy.</b> <b>Thickness</b> maps for the stratigraphic intervals Pt/Tg-Rs 7 (4. 9 Ma) and Rs 7 -Rs 5 (2. 2 Ma) were statistically analyzed using a regular grid with individual cells of 500 × 500 m. It is demonstrated that the first transpressional event in this sub-basin continued during the Lower Pannonian, causing a significant decrease of sediment thickness and a large unconformity in the east. Statistics based on histograms and averages confirmed that the first transtension and first transpression can be clearly distinguished by the presented methodology...|$|E
40|$|Nanoimprint {{lithography}} {{is a novel}} {{method of}} fabricating nanometer scale patterns. It is a simple process with low cost, high throughput and high resolution. But it also requires a stamp which has a lower fabrication cost and longer life time. Depending on application, stamps in wafer-size scale have been studied by several groups. CoNi alloys {{can be used to}} fabricate a nano-size patterned mold by electrodeposition on a Si mother mold with a seed layer. After electrodeposition, the sample is usually dipped in KOH solution to remove Si. The consumption of Si mold is a necessary step to produce a stamp. In this study, a method was developed to fabricate CoNi alloy stamps without the consumption of Si mother mold. Vapor self assembled monolayer (SAM) method was used to deposit an anti-adhesion layer instead of Si removal method. SAM has a low surface energy, makes possible to separate Ni from Si substrate without causing any damages on Si mold. Especially, vapor SAM method has its advantage when the mold features are in nanometer scale. It eliminates the use of organic solvents and greatly simplifies the handling of the sample. As a result, 140 mm CoNi stamp for NIL has been successfully fabricated from a nano Si mother mold by using a developed method. The characteristics of deposited SAM were analyzed by measurements of the contact angle, its hysteresis, surface <b>energy,</b> <b>thickness</b> and lateral friction force. Duplicated patterns on CoNi alloy stamp were compared with those of Si mother mold by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).

From top to bottom these units are: Tiva Canyon welded unit, Paintbrush nonwelded unit. Topopah Spring welded unit, Calico Hills nonwelded unit, and Crater Flat unit. Welded units have a mean fracture density of 8 to 40 fractures per unit cubic meter, mean matrix porosities of 12 to 23 %, matrix hydraulic conductivities with geometric means ranging from 6. 5 x 10 {sup - 6 } to 9. 8 x 10 {sup - 6 } foot per day (2 x 10 {sup - 6 } to 3 x 10 {sup - 6 } meter per day), and bulk hydraulic conductivities of 0. 33 to 33 feet per day (0. 1 to 10 meters per day).

40|$|Hybrid {{wing-body}} {{aircraft noise}} generation and boundary layer ingestion (BLI) performance trends with increased fan face Mach number inlet designs are investigated. The presented topics are {{in support of}} the NASA subsonic fixed wing project, which seeks to lower noise and increase performance by improving prediction methods and technologies. The aircraft configurations used for study are the N 2 A, using conventional podded engines, and the N 2 B, using an embedded propulsion system. Preliminary FAR Part 36 noise certification assessments are completed using the NASA Aircraft Noise Prediction Program (ANOPP). The limitations of applying current ANOPP noise prediction methods to hybrid wing-body aircraft are investigated. Improvements are made to the landing gear and airfoil self-noise modules, while a diffraction integral method is implemented in a companion thesis to enhance noise shielding estimates. The N 2 A overall takeoff and landing noise estimate is found to be 5. 3 EPNdB higher than the N+ 2 goal. The dominant noise sources are the fan rearward and jet on takeoff and the main landing gear and elevons on approach. A lower fan pressure ratio and advanced landing gear fairings are recommended to decrease N 2 A overall noise levels. The available engine noise estimation tools were inadequate to model the N 2 B distributed propulsion system and rectangular exhaust nozzle; therefore, overall N 2 B aircraft noise results are presented for reference only. A simplified embedded propulsion system integration study is carried out to explore the N 2 B fan design space. A 2 -D computational domain with contoured slip boundaries around the centerbody is used to replicate the effects of 3 -D relief on the airframe and inlet aerodynamics. The domain includes the S-shaped inlet duct and is extended far downstream for a Trefftz plane power balance analysis to determine the propulsive power required for steady level flight. A fan actuator volume is included to couple the airframe external and the engine internal flows. Aircraft power savings, fan efficiency, and boundary layer thickness trends are examined to determine if increasing fan face Mach number improves system performance while mitigating the total pressure distortion risk of boundary layer ingestion. A fan face Mach number near 0. 7 is found to increase aircraft power savings 12 % relative to the baseline design and to reduce centerbody boundary layer kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>thickness</b> by 4. 7 %. In addition, power balances at lower fan pressure ratios as fan face Mach number increases suggesting that high-flow low pressure ratio fans are desirable for BLI. by Philip Andrew Weed. Thesis (S.

40|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} {{progress}} in nanotechnology, high resolution TEM investigations {{become more and more}} important in structural and chemical material analyses. For such investigations the thickness of the TEM sample should be as thin as possible. The thickness of TEM samples prepared by focused ion beam (FIB) is about 50 to 100 nm. For light elements like silicon this might be sufficient for most of the analytical work. Due to the Z-dependence of the electron scattering it is also necessary to achieve even smaller thicknesses to perform TEM analyses at materials with high mass densities or high atomic numbers like Au or Pt. The difficulties to prepare plane-parallel lamellae with thicknesses of 10 to 50 nm by FIB are known. Common methods especially the FIB preparation do not have the abi lity to control the thickness precisely during the preparation process. Therefore, it is difficult or nearly impossible to stop the FIB sputtering process at the right target thickness. The aim of the presented work was to use the contrast formation of backscattered electrons (BSE) at thin samples by SEM during FIB preparation to determine the thickness of the observed TEM sample. The images produced by backscattered electrons have the advantage that they are not influenced by any FIB generated electrons. Thus, BSE can be used to monitor the thickness changes whilst FIB milling of TEM samples. The contrast in a backscattered electron image of a thin sample depends among other things on the maximal depth from which electrons could be backscattered. If the thickness of a sample is smaller than this depth a part of the primary electrons, which would be backscattered in bulk samples, will traverse the sample and could not be detected as BSEs. So the amount of BSEs will decrease (see thin edge of the wedge in Fig. 1). This thickness dependent contrast change is also a function of the material of the sample and the energy of the incident electrons. To describe this BSE contrast formation we derive a global normalized backscatter electron transmission function (GNTF). This function depends on primary electron <b>energy,</b> <b>thickness</b> and material parameters (element and density) of the lamella. It is based on a modified regularized incomplete Gamma-function adapted to Monte-Carlo simulations of electron trajectories in solids (CASINO) [1] (Fig. 1 b). The fact that BSE have a depth dependent energy distribution and the used BSE detector have an enery dependent amplification is considered by a correction function which is based on a continuous slowing down approximation. The GNTF and the correction function are used to calculate for each pixel of a BSE-image of a thin sample a thickness value and display all of them in a color-coded thickness map. For this the transmission function is scaled with the maximum (bulk sample area) and the minimum (background without sample) grey values (Fig. 1 a). To verify the calculated normalized BSE transmission gradients, wedges of different materials were prepared by FIB milling. The thickness determined by analyzing the grey values was compared to values measured at cross sections at certain markers (Fig. 1, 2) ...|$|E

40|$|Biofouling, the {{accumulation}} of biomolecules, cells, organisms and their deposits on submerged and implanted surfaces, is a ubiquitous problem across various human endeavors including maritime operations, medicine, food industries and biotechnology. Since several decades, there have been substantial research efforts towards developing various types of antifouling and fouling release approaches to control bioaccumulation on man-made surfaces. In this work we hypothesized, investigated and developed dynamic change of the surface area and topology of elastomers as a general approach for biofouling management. Further, we combined dynamic surface deformation of elastomers with other existing antifouling and fouling-release approaches to develop multifunctional, pro-active biofouling control strategies. This research work was focused on developing fundamental, new and environment-friendly approaches for biofouling management with emphasis on marine model systems and applications, but which also provided fundamental insights into the control of infectious biofilms on biomedical devices. We used different methods (mechanical stretching, electrical-actuation and pneumatic-actuation) to generate dynamic deformation of elastomer surfaces. Our initial studies showed that dynamic surface deformation methods are effective in detaching laboratory grown bacterial biofilms and barnacles. Further systematic studies revealed that a threshold critical surface strain is required to debond a biofilm from the surface, and this critical strain {{is dependent on the}} biofilm mechanical properties including adhesion <b>energy,</b> <b>thickness</b> and modulus. To test the dynamic surface deformation approach in natural environment, we conducted field studies (at Beaufort, NC) in natural seawater using pneumatic-actuation of silicone elastomer. The field studies also confirmed that a critical substrate strain is needed to detach natural biofilm accumulated in seawater. Additionally, the results from the field studies suggested that substrate modulus also affect the critical strain needed to debond biofilms. To sum up, both the laboratory and the field studies proved that dynamic surface deformation approach can effectively detach various biofilms and barnacles, and therefore offers a non-toxic and environmental friendly approach for biofouling management. Deformable elastomer systems used in our studies are easy to fabricate and can be used as complementary approach for existing commercial strategies for biofouling control. To this end, we aimed towards developed proactive multifunctional surfaces and proposed two different approaches: (i) modification of elastomers with antifouling polymers to produce multifunctional, and (ii) incorporation of silicone-oil additives into the elastomer to enhance fouling-release performance. In approach (i), we modified poly(vinylmethylsiloxane) elastomer surfaces with zwitterionic polymers using thiol-ene click chemistry and controlled free radical polymerization. These surfaces exhibited both fouling resistance and triggered fouling-release functionalities. The zwitterionic polymers exhibited fouling resistance over short-term (∼hours) exposure to bacteria and barnacle cyprids. The biofilms that eventually accumulated over prolonged-exposure (∼days) were easily detached by applying mechanical strain to the elastomer substrate. In approach (ii), we incorporated silicone-oil additives in deformable elastomer and studied synergistic effect of silicone-oils and surface strain on barnacle detachment. We hypothesized that incorporation of silicone-oil additive reduces the amount of surface strain needed to detach barnacles. Our experimental results supported the above hypothesis and suggested that surface-action of silicone-oils {{plays a major role in}} decreasing the strain needed to detach barnacles. Further, we also examined the effect of change in substrate modulus and showed that stiffer substrates require lower amount of strain to detach barnacles. In summary, this study shows that (1) dynamic surface deformation can be used as an effective, environmental friendly approach for biofouling control (2) stretchable elastomer surfaces modified with anti-fouling polymers provides a pro-active, dual-mode approach for biofouling control, and (3) incorporation of silicone-oils additives into stretchable elastomers improves the fouling-release performance of dynamic surface deformation technology. Dynamic surface deformation by itself and as a supplementary approach can be utilized biofouling management in biomedical, industrial and marine applications. Dissertatio...|$|E
