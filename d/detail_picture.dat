In this paper, 58 folding events sampled during 47 molecular dynamics trajectories for a total simulation time of more than 4 μs provide an atomic <b>detail</b> <b>picture</b> of the folding of a 20 -residue synthetic peptide with a stable three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet fold. The simulations successfully reproduce the NMR solution conformation, irrespective of the starting structure. The sampling of the conformational space is sufficient to determine the free energy surface and localize the minima and transition states. The statistically predominant folding pathway involves the formation of contacts between strands 2 and 3, starting with the side chains close to the turn, followed by association of the N-terminal strand onto the preformed 2 – 3 β-hairpin. The folding mechanism presented here, formation of a β-hairpin followed by consolidation, is in agreement with a computational study of the free energy surface of another synthetic three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet by Bursulaya and Brooks [(1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 9947 – 9951]. Hence, it might hold in general for antiparallel β-sheets with short turns...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Requirements {{analysis}} and general management issues within {{the development process}} of new software components are addressed in this paper, focusing on factors that result from requirements elicitation and significantly affect management decisions and development activities. A new methodology performing a certain form of requirements identification and collection prior to developing new software components is proposed and demonstrated, the essence of which lays on a three-entity model that describes the relationship between different types of component stakeholders: Developers, reusers and end-users. The model {{is supported by a}} set of critical factors analysed in the context of three main directions that orient the production of a new component, that is, the generality of the services offered, the management approach and the characteristics of the targeted market. The investigation of the three directions produces critical success factors that are closely connected and interdependent. Further analysis of the significance of each factor according to the priorities set by component developers can provide a <b>detail</b> <b>picture</b> of potential management implications during the development process and more importantly can support management decisions related to if and how development should proceed. ...|$|E
40|$|The self-assembling {{processes}} underlining {{the capabilities}} of facially differentiated ("Janus") polycationic amphiphilic cyclodextrins (paCDs) as non-viral gene nanocarriers have been investigated by a pluridisciplinary approach. Three representative Janus paCDs bearing a common tetradecahexanoyl multitail domain at the secondary face and differing in the topology of the cluster of amino groups at the primary side were selected for this study. All of them compact pEGFP-C 3 plasmid DNA and promote transfection in HeLa and MCF- 7 cells, both in absence and in presence of human serum. The electrochemical and structural characteristics of the paCD-pDNA complexes (CDplexes) have been studied by using zeta potential, DLS, SAXS, and cryo-TEM. paCDs and pDNA, when assembled in CDplexes, render effective charges that are lower than the nominal ones. The CDplexes show a self-assembling pattern corresponding to multilamellar lyotropic liquid crystal phases, characterized by a lamellar stacking of bilayers of the CD-based vectors with anionic pDNA sandwiched among them. When exposed to human serum, either in the absence or {{in the presence of}} pDNA, the surface of the cationic CD-based vector becomes coated by a protein corona (PC) whose composition has been analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Some of the CDplexes herein studied showed moderate-to-high transfection levels in HeLa and MCF- 7 cancer cells combined with moderate-to-high cell viabilities, as determined by FACS and MTT reduction assays. The ensemble of data provides a <b>detail</b> <b>picture</b> of the paCD-pDNA-PC association processes and a rational base to exploit the protein corona for targeted gene delivery on future in vivo applications...|$|E

To investigate the hydrogeochemical reactions and effect on concrete degradation in the proposed LLW repository site, HYDROGEOCHEM 5.0 model was applied to simulate the complex chemical interactions between the cement minerals of the concrete and groundwater flow and reactive chemical transport resulting from water–rock interaction in the proposed site. Simulation results show the main processes responsible for concrete degradation involve geochemical reactive species induced from hydrogen ion, sulfate, and chloride. The intrusion of hydrogen ion from groundwater results the dissolution of portlandite. However, the portlandite still maintains alkaline condition in proposed LLW repository, the concrete used as a confinement material in EBS may remain in well durable condition. The sulfate-induced concrete degradation may form the ettringite and the chloride-induced concrete degradation form Friedel’s salt. Thaumasite and monocarboaluminate are also formed as carbonate aggregates by sulfate attack, and carbonate intrusion, respectively. The formation of ettringite, Friedel’s salt, thaumasite and monocarboaluminate may result a volume expansion. The EBS with the side ditch efficiently drains the ground water and lowers the concentration of concrete degradation induced species. The degree of concrete degradation on performance of EBS with side ditch is {{much lower than the}} disposal tunnel without the side ditch. Moreover, the redox processes significantly influence on the formations of degradation materials. Reductive environment in the EBS can reduce the ettringite formation in the concrete degradation processes. The results of the study provide a <b>detail</b> <b>picture</b> of the long-term evolution of the hydrogeochemical environment of the proposed LLW disposal site in Taiwan. The chemical kinetics effect should be included in future reactive chemical transport simulations. Moreover, the interaction among water and other minerals of cement, bentonite, and backfill materials in the near field, volume-expanded cracks and seismic induced-fractures should also be considered in the future research. The development of advanced numerical models that coupled with thermo-hydraulic–mechanical–chemical processes is especially welcomed.|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{analyses}} Japanese {{nuclear power}} discourses as necessitation by uncovering the strategies and arguments surrounding {{the nuclear power}} expansion debate in 2004 - 2006. The study on Japanese case is contrasted with Finland as a representing case of European perspective of nuclear power in revival period from early to mid- 2000 s. Based on previous research the concept of necessitation is defined as 'reluctant acceptance' of nuclear power. People unwillingly accept nuclear power as for the greater challenges such as climate change and energy security. In addition, necessitation is a forceful strategy of argumentation promoting nuclear power as an energy source without alternatives. Regarding necessitation, this research addresses following themes: discourses and representations surrounding nuclear power in Japan 2004 - 2006, argumentation strategies to necessitate nuclear power, and major similarities and differences of nuclear power discourses between Japan and Finland. Qualitative content analysis {{is applied to the}} minutes of the meetings produced by responsible institutions in Japan. Following datasets are selected for the analysis: 1) the sectorial meetings for long-term nuclear energy policy under Japan Atomic Energy Commission in 2004 - 2005 and 2) the minutes documented in Nuclear Subcommittee under Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in 2005 - 2006. In order to gain deeper understanding of the arguments, discourse analysis is also conducted upon the material. The research first discloses seven Japanese nuclear power discourses based on the arguments - nuclear power for: energy security, stable supply, cost-efficiency, environmental compatibility, nuclear power as a means of international contribution, new economic growth, and guaranteed nuclear safety. Representations of nuclear power are analysed within each discourse. The analysis also reveals the employed argumentation strategies to oblige nuclear power use and prioritised discourses. A comparison between Japanese and Finnish nuclear power discussions shows significant common discourses in energy security, stable supply, affordable electricity, and climate change mitigation. This comparison also shows distinctive Japanese discourses in international collaboration and national economic prosperity. Moreover, Japanese arguments over environmental and economic benefit of nuclear power are by far more elaborate. The research reveals a wide range of social issues concerning the necessity of nuclear power in Japan, whereas Europe concentrates on limited social issues of nuclear power. A <b>detail</b> <b>picture</b> of Japanese nuclear power shows extensive expectation of nuclear power which are embedded in the society. This indicates that more convincing persuasion for nuclear power expansion is required in Japan. In both domestic and international level, Japan still has to dispel the suspicion of military use of nuclear power and diminish the concerns about nuclear safety. Moreover, Japan is in need of establishing additional social benefit of nuclear power for the acceptance of more economically, environmentally and technologically challenging nuclear fuel cycle...|$|E
40|$|Band 4. 1 {{protein is}} one of {{peripheral}} membrane proteins of erythrocyte membranes, which directly binds to glycophorin C, an integral membrane protein, at its N-terminal half. Recently, the amino acid sequence of the N-terminal half of this protein {{was found to be}} conserved in the N-terminal end of several distinct proteins, pointing to the existence of the band 4. 1 superfamily. In addition to band 4. 1 protein, this band 4. 1 superfamily includes ezrin, radixin, moesin, talin and protein-tyrosine-phosphatases (PTPHI and PTPMEG). Furthermore, the tumor suppressor protein for neurofibromatosis 2 named 2 ̆ 7 merlin 2 ̆ 7 is also reportedly included in this superfamily. For {{a better understanding of the}} structure and functions of these superfamily members, I first tried to clarify the more <b>detail</b> <b>picture</b> of this superfamily using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (Chapter I), and next to examine the physiological functions of ezrin/radixin/moesin by the use of antisense oligonucleotides (Chapter II). In the Chapter I, in order to examine the structural diversity of this superfamily members, using the PCR method with synthesized mixed primers, I have attempted to list up as many members of the band 4. 1 superfamlly as possible expressing in mouse teratocarcinoma F 9 cells and the mouse brain tissue. In total, 14 distinct types of cDNA clones were obtained; 8 clones were identical to the corresponding parts of cDNAs for the so far identified members, while 6 clones appeared to encode novel members (NBL 1 - 6 :Novel βand 4. 1 -like proteins). Sequence analyses of these clones revealed that the band 4. 1 superfamily can be subdivided into 6 gene families such as band 4. 1 protein, ERM (ezrin/ radixln/ moesin), talin, PTPHI (PTPH 1 / PTPMEG/ NBL 1 - 3), and NBL 4 (NBL 4 / NBL 5) and merlin (merlin/ NBL 6) families. The existence of the NBL 4 family was first recognised here. I screened F 9 cell cDNA Iibrary and obtained a full length (2. 5 -kb) cDNA encoding an NBL 4. NBL 4 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 554 amino acids. Its N-terminal half segment is more homologous to those of the PTPases and band 4. 1 protein than the other superfamily members. Its band 4. 1 homology domain bears a putative myristoylation site and phosphorylation sites for A-kinase and protein-tyrosine kinases, suggesting its possible involvement in the regulation of cellular events just beneath the plasma membrane. In this study, I describe initial characterization of these new members and discuss the evolution of the band 4. 1 superfamily. In the Chapter II, to examine the functions of ERM family members, antisense oligonucleotides to the N-terminal sequences of ERM family members were constructed and added to cultures of mouse epithelial cells (MTD- 1 A cells) and thymoma cells (L 5178 Y), which coexpress all the members. Immunoblotting revealed that each antisense oligonucleotides selectively suppressed the expression of the corresponding member to the undetectable level. Immunofluorescence microscopy of these ezrin, radixin or moesm "null" cells showed that all the ERM family members are colocalized at cell-to-cell adherens junctions, microvilli and cleavage furrows where actin filaments were densely associated with plasma membranes. The ezrin/radixin/moesin antisense oligonucleotides mixture induced the destruction of both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion and the disappearance of microvilli. Ezrin or radixin antisense oligonucleotides singly affected the initial step of the formation of both cell-cell and cell-substrate adheslon, but showed no effects on the microvilli structures. In sharp contrast, moesin antisense oligonucleotide did not singly show any effect on cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, whereas it partly affected the microvilli structure. These data indicate that ezrin and radixin can be functionally substituted for each other, that moesin has some synergetic functional interaction with ezrin and radixin, and that these ERM family members are directly involved in cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion as well as microvilli formation...|$|E
