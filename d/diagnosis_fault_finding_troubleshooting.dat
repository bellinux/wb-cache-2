40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} consumer complaints with respect to recently purchased consumer electronics. This research document will investigate the instances of development and device management as a tool used to aid consumer and manage consumer’s mobile products in order to resolve issues in or before the consumers is aware one exists. The problem {{at the present time}} is that mobile devices are becoming very advanced pieces of technology, and not all manufacturers and network providers have kept up the support element of End users. As such, the subject of the {{research is}} to investigate how device management could possibly be used as a method to promote research and development of mobile devices, and provide a better experience for the consumer. The wireless world is becoming increasingly complex as revenue opportunities are driven by new and innovative data services. We can no longer expect the customer to have the knowledge or ability to configure their own device. Device Management platforms can address the challenges of device configuration and support through new enabling technologies. Leveraging these technologies will allow a network operator to reduce the cost of subscriber ownership, drive increased ARPU (Average Revenue per User) by removing barriers to adoption, reduce churn by improving the customer experience and increase customer loyalty. DM technologies provide a flexible and powerful management method but are managing the same device features that have historically been configured manually through call centers or by the end user making changes directly on the device. For this reason DM technologies must be treated as part of a wider support solution. The traditional requirement for discovery, <b>fault</b> <b>finding,</b> <b>troubleshooting</b> and <b>diagnosis</b> are still as relevant with DM as they are in the current human support environment yet the current generation of solutions do little to address this problem. In the deployment of an effective Device Management solution the network operator must consider the integration of the DM platform, interfacing with many areas of the business, supported by knowledge of the relationship between devices, applications, solutions and services maintained on an ongoing basis. Complementing the DM solution with published device information, setup guides, training material and web based tools will ensure the quality of the customer experience, ensuring that problems are completely resolved, driving data usage by focusing customer education {{on the use of the}} wireless service In this way device management becomes a tool used both internally within the network or device vendor and by the customer themselves, with each user empowered to effectively manage the device without any prior knowledge or experience, confident that changes they apply will be relevant, accurate, stable and compatible. The value offered by an effective DM solution with an expert knowledge service will become a significant differentiator for the network operator in an ever competitive wireless market. This research document is intended to highlight some of the issues the industry faces as device management technologies become more prevalent, and offers some potential solutions to simplify the increasingly complex task of managing devices on the network, where device management can be used as a tool to aid customer relations and manage customer’s mobile products in order to resolve issues before the user is aware one exists. The research is broken down into the following, Customer Relationship Management, Device management, the role of knowledge with the DM, Companies that have successfully implemented device management, and the future of device management and CRM. And it also consists of questionnaires aimed at technical support agents and mobile device users. Interview was carried out with CRM managers within support centre to further the evidence gathered. To conclude, the document is to consider the advantages and disadvantages of device management and attempt to determine the influence it will have over customer support centre, and what methods could be used to implement it...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} {{and testing of}} a multiple-choice programme to teach systematic <b>fault</b> <b>finding</b> in electronic equipment. <b>Fault</b> <b>finding</b> and the repair of faults, in electronic equipment used by the Royal Navy, are presenting problems which have become more and 1 nore difficult in recent years. This is due to two main factors; the first being that the increasing, complexity of equipment is producing a requirement for higher levels of training, and the second factor being the difficulties surrounding the recruiting and retention of men {{with high levels of}} education and training. Maintaining equipment in a ship at sea also presents special problems due to the measure of self-reliance which is necessitated by the ship being away from home ports for long periods. In an attempt to overcome these problems, an investigation was commissioned to examine new methods of <b>fault</b> <b>finding.</b> The aim was to discover a new generalised method of <b>fault</b> <b>finding</b> which could be applied to all electrical and electronic equipments, and to devise a training course which would instruct men in this new method, if it improved performance. Such a method was found, and on testing was discovered to work extremely well. Having found the method, investigation then took place as to the best way to disseminating this information.
