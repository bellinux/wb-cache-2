5|$|Negation is {{done with}} the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an {{auxiliary}} verb. A contracted form of not -n't {{can be used as}} an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English I don't know him is the correct answer to the question <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him?,</b> but not *I know him not, although this construction may be found in older English.|$|E
500|$|The verb do {{can be used}} as an {{auxiliary}} even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in [...] "I did shut the fridge." [...] However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when {{an auxiliary}} is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *I know not—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not (don't) know. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so {{it is not possible to}} say *Know you him?; grammatical rules require <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>him?</b> ...|$|E
