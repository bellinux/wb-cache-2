The resulting cladistic tree of their analysis was resolved using Maximum-Parsimony. 61 hadrosauroid species were included, characterized for 273 morphological features: 189 for cranial features and 84 for postcranial features.

500|$|Wright's {{views on}} the role of genetic drift in the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>scheme</b> were {{controversial}} almost from the very beginning. One of the most vociferous and influential critics was colleague Ronald Fisher. Fisher conceded genetic drift played some role in evolution, but an insignificant one. Fisher has been accused of misunderstanding Wright's views because in his criticisms Fisher seemed to argue Wright had rejected selection almost entirely. To Fisher, viewing the process of evolution as a long, steady, adaptive progression {{was the only way to}} explain the ever-increasing complexity from simpler forms. But the debates have continued between the [...] "gradualists" [...] and those who lean more toward the Wright model of evolution where selection and drift together play an important role.|$|E
500|$|Other naturalists of {{this time}} speculated on the {{evolutionary}} change of species over time according to natural laws. In 1751, Pierre Louis Maupertuis wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and Erasmus Darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism (or [...] "filament"). The first full-fledged <b>evolutionary</b> <b>scheme</b> was Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's [...] "transmutation" [...] theory of 1809, which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents. (The latter process was later called Lamarckism.) These ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support. In particular, Georges Cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by William Paley into the Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity (1802), which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles Darwin.|$|E

40|$|The mass {{distributions}} of dense cores in star-forming regions are measured {{to have a}} shape similar to the initial mass function of stars. This has been generally interpreted to mean that the constituent cores will form individual stars or stellar systems at a nearly constant star formation efficiency.

We find that the different <b>evolutionary</b> <b>schemes</b> have an overall small effect on {{the shape of the}} resultant distribution of stars. Our results imply that at the current level of observational accuracy the comparison between the mass functions of dense cores and stars alone is insufficient to discern between different evolutionary models.

According to Hick, in the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>scheme</b> of things in which at isolated ages and places the early religions are succeeded by higher religions, it is the same message of God that comes distinctly to a particular group but in a different form from the others.
