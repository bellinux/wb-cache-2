40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> {{materials}} {{can be used}} to advantage in radio frequency and high-speed digital systems but an obstacle to their use is the lack of availability of information on the electrical properties of materials to high frequencies and, in particular, the variation in dielectric constant and loss tangent as a function of frequency. This makes accurate electromagnetic simulation of high frequency flexible interconnects difficult. The variation of the electrical properties of these materials as a function of environmental parameters, such as humidity, is also unknown at higher frequencies. This paper has, using microwave resonators, investigated the electrical properties from 2 GHz to 18 GHz of a polyimide <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> material saturated at 25 % RH and at 85 % RH relative humidity levels. Rigid circuit board materials FR 4 and CER- 10 were also measured as reference materials.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{describes the}} technology {{used to produce}} thermoplastically deformable electronics, based on <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> technology, to achieve low-cost 2. 5 D free-form rigid smart objects. These one-time deformable circuits employ {{a modified version of}} the previously developed meander-based “polymer-last” technology for dynamically stretchable elastic circuits. This is readily achieved by substituting the dynamically stretchable elastomeric materials (e. g. silicone) with thermoplastic polymers (e. g. polycarbonate). Afterwards the circuit is given its final form using widely available thermoforming techniques, such as vacuum forming, where the material is heated above its glass transition temperature and drawn against a forming tool by a strong vacuum. After cooling down the thermoplastic retains its shape without inducing large internal stresses. The presented method allows for the production of these circuits on a flat substrate, using standard printed circuit board production equipment, with deformation only taking place afterwards; eliminating the need for large investments and reducing the cost of fabrication. Potential advantages over competitive methods are reductions in weight and material usage, decrease of mechanical complexity; lower tooling cost, increased resilience, and a higher degree of manufacturer independence due to adhering to standard industrial practices. This is realized by starting production from a <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board,</b> manufactured by an industrial supplier using polyimide flexible copper clad laminate, which is attached to a temporary reusable carrier board through means of a silicone based high-temperature pressure sensitive adhesive. Through selective laser structuring the meander and island outlines of the flexible circuit are defined, without causing damage to the carrier board or pressure sensitive adhesive. After removing the residual material the circuit is assembled using high-temperature lead-free solder, made possible by the temporary carrier keeping the circuit in place at these elevated temperatures. The circuit is then transferred into a thermoplastic laminate, which is deformed into its final shape. After demonstrating the need for stretchable electronics for this application, this contribution describes the method used to design, fabricate, and test the first one-time deformable circuits manufactured using the presented technology. Using the initial set of observations a series of preliminary design rules is established, both for the circuit and choice of materials. The feasibility of this manufacturing method was then demonstrated through a small scale production run using lab scale equipment, where a large quantity of high power LEDs was integrated into a one-time deformable device made out of polystyrene and thermoplastic polyurethane. These devices were then tested by exposing them to real world conditions for several days...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{circuit boards}} are being {{widely used in}} the {{electronic}} packages. Solders are often used to assemble chip resistors and other components on them. In practice, solder alloys work in high homologous temperatures and experience cyclic temperature loadings. As a result, damage may accumulate in solder materials quickly and this will eventually lead {{to the failure of}} the solder joints. In this work, computer modelling technique has been used to predict such damage accumulations in chip resistor solder joints under a range of thermal cycling conditions. It has been documented that the higher and the lower dwell temperatures of a thermal cycle dominate the damages in solder joints. Both the ramp time and the cycle duration have strong influence on the damage accumulation. In general, faster ramp time and longer cycle duration cause more damages. The types of materials used to produce <b>flexible</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> have also significant impact on the damage accumulation. Polyimide (PI), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN) and Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) based flexible circuit boards have been compared for their effect on damage in solder joints and the results show that the highest damage could be found in the chip resistor solder joint on the PI-based flexible circuit boards and least damage could be found for the LCP based flexible circuit boards. The results also show that the thicknesses of the constituent layers of different materials in flexible circuit boards are linearly proportional to the damage accumulation in solder joints...|$|E
