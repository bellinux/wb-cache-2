5000|$|A rather {{successful}} marketing {{theme that}} began with the 1973 Mark IV, and continued in varying numbers {{through the end of the}} 1981 model year, the Mark V with Luxury Group option allowed the buyer to custom design their own Mark. The Luxury Group's [...] "color name" [...] was derived from the color of the interior. To start the process, the customer had to first decide on the interior trim, whether it be in cloth or leather-with-vinyl. At which point, the next step for the customer would be to choose an exterior paint color ( [...] anywhere from as little as one, but most often from two to as many as four [...] ) offered within the selected Luxury Group. After the exterior paint was chosen, the customer then would select their desired roof style ( [...] painted metal, full-length vinyl, rear landau vinyl [...] ) and then its color that was offered within that specific group ( [...] for 1978 and 1979, a full-length <b>Diamond</b> <b>grain</b> vinyl simulated convertible [...] "Carriage Roof" [...] would also be an available roof style - but only in the color White [...] ). Following the roof choice, would then be the customer's selection of the bodyside molding vinyl insert color - then to be completed by the selection of the available bodyside and decklid paint stripe color within the specified group. After all that was said and done, then the customer would make choices of wheels/wheel covers, options list, whitewall tire options, etc. The number of possible color combinations and options could border on the staggering. But in general, the Luxury Group was a rather fun 'mix-or-match" [...] experience for the expressive Mark customer. The end result could be understated elegance to dramatically flashy, or anywhere in between.|$|E

The diamond grinding process of SiC has been largely investigated in recent years, but the interface between <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> and SiC in grinding has not been completely understood. In this paper, a single diamond scratching method was presented in order to insight into the interface realizing on a SRV friction and abrasion test machine using three types of diamond grains with different shapes.

But {{no change in the}} color of <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> was observed, in the RUD of bone, which also shows that temperature of these <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> was low during RUD.

It is found that both <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> and GBs promote the conductivity in O+-implanted UNCD films, in which GBs make at least half contribution. The p-type conductivity in O+-implanted samples {{is a result of}} H-terminated <b>diamond</b> <b>grains,</b> while n-type conductive samples are closely correlated with O-terminated O+-implanted <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> and GBs in the films.

(2) The method of lapping is effective not only for roughing the <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> to protrude from the bended surface but it is also effective in sharpening the worn and flat <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> under suitable conditions...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an ultrananocrystalline diamond {{film was}} studied with grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} (GISAXS) {{to determine the}} <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> size and average distance of the grains with a non-destructive method and with excellent sampling statistics. The measured 2 D GISAXS patterns were modelled with the assumption of monodisperse spheres. The best fits were obtained with the "buried layer" model where the spheres are correlated within the film plane. This correlation was approximated with a two-dimensional Percus–Yevick structure factor. The average <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> size of D = 8. 0 – 8. 5 nm and a centre-to-centre distance of the grains with 10. 4 – 11. 9 nm agrees well with transmission electron microscopy results of comparable samples...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearch {{results on}} 3 D {{modeling}} of the <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> and its bearing layer when sintering diamond grinding wheels {{are provided in}} this paper. The influence of the main characteristics of the wheel materials and the wheel production process, namely the quantity of metallic phase within <b>diamond</b> <b>grain,</b> {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of the metallic phase, the modulus of elasticity of bond material and sintering temperature, on the internal stresses arising in grains is investigated. The results indicate that the stresses in the grains are higher in the areas around the metallic phase. Additionally, sintering temperature has the greatest impact on the stresses of the grain-metallic phase-bond system regardless of the type of the bond. Furthermore, by employing factorial design for the carried out finite element model, a mathematical model that reflects the impact of these factors on the deflected mode of the diamond grain-metallic phase-bond material system is obtained. The results of the analysis allow for the identification of optimal conditions for the efficient production of improved diamond grinding wheels. More specifically, the smallest stresses are observed when using the metal bond with modulus of elasticity 204 GPa, the quantity of metallic phase in <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> of not higher than 7 % and coefficient of thermal expansion of 1. 32 × 10 − 51 /K or lower.

40|$|We {{report that}} the {{diffusion}} and desorption of hydrogen (H) {{play a key role}} in the diamond/amorphous carbon phase transitions of O+-implanted UNCD films at different annealing temperatures (Ta) by using high resolution transmission electronic microscopy (HRTEM), vis-uv Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements. The results of HRTEM and uv Raman spectroscopy measurements show that with Ta increasing from 500 to 900 °C, the amorphous carbon in grain boundaries (GBs) transits to diamond phase. Visible Raman spectroscopy measurements show that the amount of H bonded to trans-polyacetylene (TPA) chains in GBs reduces with Ta increasing to 900 °C, while that of H terminating to the surfaces of <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> increases confirmed by FTIR measurements. It reveals that H diffuses from GBs to the surfaces of <b>diamond</b> <b>grains.</b> In this process, the active H extracts H which terminates the diamond surface, leaving a reactive surface site. This gives a chance for the neighbored amorphous carbon clusters to attach to the surface site, so that <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> become larger. After 1000 °C annealing, the amount of diamond phase dramatically decreases and diamond transits to amorphous carbon by HRTEM and uv Raman spectroscopy. It is observed that the amount of H bonded to TPA chains in GBs and that of H terminating to the surfaces of <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> dramatically decreases from visible Raman spectroscopy and FTIR measurements. It is revealed that H is desorbed from both surfaces of <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> and GBs, which forces <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> to collapse to amorphous carbon...|$|R

Microdiffraction, high resolution images and EELS help determine that the first <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> that nucleate from fullerene precursors generally form on a thin amorphous carbon interlayer and seldom directly on the silicon substrate. Grain size measurements reveal nanocrystalline <b>diamond</b> <b>grains.</b> Cross section TEM images show that the nanocrystalline <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> are equiaxed and not columnar nor dendritic.

40|$|Nanocrystalline diamond {{films were}} grown by {{microwave}} plasma assisted {{chemical vapor deposition}} using N 2 and CH 4 as precursors. The microstructure of the films such as the <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> size, graphite content, and N incorporation, was controlled by introducing {{a small amount of}} hydrogen gas (0 - 10 sccm) in the growth. Effects of the growth parameters on the film microstructure were investigated using transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectroscopy. A surface stabilizing model is suggested to explain the formation mechanism of the uniformly grain size-controlled nanocrystalline diamond. A systematic investigation on the film microstructure and their field electron emission (FEE) property is presented for varoius films of different <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> sizes and graphite contents. It was found that the FEE property highly depended on the diamond/graphite mixed phase structure. Novel field emission properties (1 V/mum emission threshold an 10 mA/cm² emission current) are obtained by optimizing the growth parameters. A transport-tunneling mechanism is applied to explain the experimental observations. Our results showed that nanocrystalline diamond film can be a very promising cold cathode material for field emission applications...|$|E
40|$|The wear {{behavior}} of conventional and graded polycrystalline diamond compact cutters was studied using a vertical lathe with mortar counterfaces. Different cutters were considered regarding to their <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> {{size and the}} high pressure and the high temperature conditions of the manufacturing process (HPHT). On the base of these cutters, a cobalt graduation process {{was performed on the}} WC–Co substrates by reactive imbibition. A quality factor developed in previous studies was calculated to evaluate cutters wear performances. The results showed that a controlled HPHT process can act on the wear resistance certainly by improving the <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> boundary cohesion. Unexpectedly, the diamond granulometry appeared to be a secondary factor influencing the wear resistance. The reactive imbibition clearly increased the wear resistance, even for cutters with coarse diamond grains (i. e. potentially impact resistant). Finally, a third body approach describes that the quartz particles detached from the mortar rock realizes abrasive scratches on the cutters wear flat. When the wear flat reaches the substrate, the formation of voids in the contact, associated with the trapping of abrasive particles, rises the wear kinetic. As a secondary mechanism, Raman spectroscopy measurements highlighted tribological transformed structures by the formation of graphite and amorphous carbon on the diamond worn surfaces...|$|E

From these measurements, depth profiles were obtained for the phase content and the residual stress. The fracture surfaces were examd. optically to est. the crit. flaw size. Material ground with coarse <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> was significantly weaker than that ground with fine <b>diamond</b> <b>grains.</b> Coarse <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> in the grinding wheel resulted in more residual stress and a thicker layer of transformed zirconia than when fine grains were in the wheel.

40|$|AbstractSingle grain cutting {{tests are}} an {{important}} basic tool in understanding complex grinding processes. Simulations offer additional insight into important process data and can reduce {{the overall number of}} required experiments. Cutting simulations with FE Methods have problems arising from large deformations at the chip root and negative rake angles of the <b>diamond</b> <b>grain.</b> Those problems can be overcome using meshfree methods, but with the additional difficulties of contact modeling and the enforcement of boundary conditions. In this work, a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Method is used to model the cutting behavior of single hexa-octahedral diamond cutting grains. The material behavior at low cutting depths is characterized using experimental data and simulations of micro-Vickers indenter tests. The simulations show the influence of the yaw and rake angle on the cutting and passive forces as well as the ratio of chip and burr generation. Both the cutting and the passive forces show good accordance with the experimental data. The burr generation is still overestimated {{due to the lack of}} a physical failure criterion in the SPH-method. Difficult to predict effects like the generation of a stagnant zone of workpiece material moving in front of the <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> at the chip root are reproduced as well. This work shows the advantages of using a meshfree method in areas were classical FE-methods have difficulties...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Diamond {{films with}} grain sizes {{in the range}} of 5 - 1000 nm and grain {{boundaries}} containing nondiamond carbon are depositedonasiliconsubstratebyvaryingthedepositionparameters. Theoverallmorphologiesoftheas-depositeddiamond-nondiamond composite films are examined by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, which show a decrease in the surface roughness with a decrease in the <b>diamond</b> <b>grain</b> size. Although the Raman spectra show predominately nondiamond carbon features in the diamond films with smaller grain sizes, glancing-angle X-ray diffraction spectra show the absence of graphitic carbon features and the presence of very small amorphous carbon diffraction features. The CH 4 percentage (%) in Ar and H 2 plasma during deposition plays {{a crucial role in the}} formation of diamond films with different grain sizes and nondiamond carbon contents, which, in turn, determines the field-emission behavior of the corresponding diamond films. The smaller the grain size of the diamond, the lower is the turn-on field for electron emission. A lower turn-on field is obtained from the diamond films deposited with 2 - 5 % CH 4 than from the films deposited with either 1 % or 7. 5 % CH 4 in the Ar medium. A current density greater than 1 mA/cm 2 (at 50 V/µm) is obtained from diamond films deposited with a higher percentage of CH 4.

On the contrary, the purities of the film surfaces comprised of the nano-sized <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> significantly reduces, manifesting as the enhancement of non-diamond peaks, especially the broad peaks around 1580 /cm corresponding to the graphitic phase (G bands). Besides, the peaks around 1200 /cm in the Raman spectra of the boron-doped film surfaces are the typical features related to the boron doping. Specially, for the BDM-UFGCD film, because the Raman can detect mostly the chemical characters of the film surface (the UFGD layer), significant non-diamond peaks exist in its Raman spectrum. However, compared with the single-layer UFGD film, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the sp 3 diamond peak is smaller, indicating that the diamond purity {{on the surface of}} the composite film is a little higher, owing to the effect of the BDMCD layer beneath the surface UFGD layer. It is rather difficult to measure the hardness of the diamond film deposited on the complicated milling cutter, but in our previous study, on the planar WC- 6 wt.%Co substrates, it is proved that the surface hardness decreases when the grain size changes from micro to nano, mainly as a result of the deteriorated film quality, while the hardness of the composite diamond film, although with nano-sized <b>diamond</b> <b>grains</b> on the surface, is higher than that of the UFGD film, due to the reinforcement effect of the micro-sized <b>diamond</b> <b>grains.</b>|$|R
