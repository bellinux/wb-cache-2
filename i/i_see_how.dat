500|$|Meanwhile [...] Mitford had {{completed}} her latest book, [...] Voltaire in Love, {{an account of}} the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet. [...] She considered it her first truly grown-up work, and her best. Published in 1957, it sold well, was taken seriously by the critics and [...] was warmly praised by Mitford's friends. Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and [...] worries that she might be going blind. The problem was resolved after a visit to the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper, who gave her new spectacles: [...] "It is heavenly {{to be able to read}} for a long time on end & now <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> handicapped I was when doing Voltaire". She then returned to writing [...] fiction, with Don't Tell Alfred, in which she revived Fanny Wincham, the narrator of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador. Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles. The book, published in October 1960, was popular with the public, but received indifferent reviews. Some of Mitford's friends disliked it, and she decided she would write no more fiction.|$|E
500|$|John Kricfalusi, {{the creator}} of The Ren & Stimpy Show, claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump", {{which was part of}} a cartoon book series {{viewable}} online. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, [...] "I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!'... This idea of [...] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea." [...] Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company Spümcø was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with [...] "Nutty the Friendly Dump" [...] and that the claim was [...] "ludicrous". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy, which {{he said he did not}} enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the South Park creators: [...] "He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> it could just be a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big Ren and Stimpy fan.' — I'm not a Ren and Stimpy fan." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{of early}} 2017, Cardi B began {{publicly}} dating fellow American rapper Offset, {{of the southern}} hip hop group Migos, and the two quickly became a prevalent couple in the music industry. When speaking on her relationship with Offset, Cardi B told The Fader, [...] "It’s been a blessing, me meeting him and meeting his friends. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> hard they work. And that motivated me to work even harder. And <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> good things are going for them and how popping {{it is to be}} number one. And I’m like, I want that. A lot of people just see they jewelry and they money, but I don’t {{think a lot of people}} see how hard they work for that shit every single day." [...] Cardi B and Offset became engaged on October 27, after Offset proposed to Cardi B at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, during the Power 99 Powerhouse concert. According to a report from TMZ, shortly after Offset and Cardi B became engaged, a handful of TV networks, including BET, VH1 and WE tv, began making offers for a nationally televised wedding special.|$|E
2500|$|... "On both a {{personal}} and a professional level, I am still dealing {{with the consequences of}} this episode. Some people felt that I had committed an irrevocable betrayal of trust, and have discounted me and my teaching ever since. Others were more forgiving, but their trust in me and my integrity was permanently shaken. Even newer students, who come to Zen Center and find out about these incidents, are sometimes confused and question whether I can be their teacher. These events are a helpful reminder—both to me and to others—of my vulnerability to arrogance and inflation. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> my empowerment to protect and care for the Triple Treasure inflated my sense of personal authority, and thus detracted from and disparaged the Triple Treasure. This ancient twisted karma I now fully avow." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Beckham {{signed a}} {{contract}} with Telstar Records and 19 Management worth £1.5 million. Beckham then began recording a pop-influenced album, Open Your Eyes, which yielded the single [...] "Let Your Head Go", but she allegedly chose not to release it after being disappointed with the results. Instead of pop, Beckham wanted a more urban sound and worked with urban producer Damon Dash to work on the R and hip hop influenced album Come Together. When Dash was first asked why he recorded with Beckham, he stated: [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much she gets photographed over here." [...] A Dash-produced track [...] "It's That Simple" [...] featuring M.O.P. premiered on radio stations in July 2003, generating mixed reviews. Beckham's first single with Telstar, [...] "Let Your Head Go" [...] / [...] "This Groove", was released in the UK on 29 December 2003, following heavy promotion and many TV appearances across the Christmas period with the video being directed by Andy Hylton. The single charted at number three in the UK. This double A-side lifted [...] "Let Your Head Go" [...] from Beckham's earlier pop-inspired work with [...] "This Groove" [...] one of her hip hop and R songs and remains Beckham's last single release to date. Outside of the UK, Damon Dash had plans for Beckham in the US, including a potential release of [...] "Let Your Head Go / This Groove" [...] under the name of [...] "Posh Spice Victoria Beckham". The release was proposed for sometime between March to May 2004, but never eventuated.|$|E

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick. [...] It wasn't really baseball." ...|$|E
2500|$|An American, a Hindu, and a Russian land in Purgatory. A grey-winged angel {{with a huge}} whip {{hanging from}} his belt meets them and says: [...] "Alright, here's the rules. Anyone who takes three strikes from my whip without screaming, can go {{straight}} to Heaven. You can shield yourselves with whatever you like. We've got everything here. Who's first?" [...] The American steps forward. [...] "Alright, you've got three hours to prepare yourself." [...] The American puts on a full-body Kevlar outfit, gets into a tank, drives it into a concrete bunker, the bunker is covered with 15 feet of dirt and inch-thick titanium plates. The angel unravels his whip. SNAP! The titanium and the dirt are gone. SNAP! The bunker and tank are gone. SNAP! The American howls in pain, the ground opens up under his feet and he drops straight to Hell. [...] "Next!", says the angel. The Hindu steps forward. [...] "You've got three hours to prepare yourself." [...] / [...] "I need only five minutes. I have studied Yoga all my life and can make myself immune to all pain." [...] The Hindu gets into a lotus position, hums mantras for a few minutes, and rises {{a couple of inches}} off the ground. The angel unravels his whip. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! The Hindu is completely unfazed. [...] "Hmm, impressive. Alright, you're free to go." [...] / [...] "Thank you, but only after <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> this last one makes it out of this", says the Hindu, looking at the Russian. / [...] "Your call."
