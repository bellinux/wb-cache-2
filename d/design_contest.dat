5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> for a dreadnought in 1906, but the Duma refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} similar {{political}} and economic concerns in France had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.|$|E

5|$|Mayor John Curtis began {{a public}} process {{to replace the}} flag in 2013, in {{response}} to the second NAVA survey, consulting with local vexillologists and residents for ideas. In May 2014, the flag replacement process was narrowed to two options by a three-member committee, both consisting of simple renditions of Utah Lake and nearby mountains, with one option having three stars to represent life in Provo. The designs were not well received by residents, leading Mayor Curtis to propose a public <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> to end in early June. A consensus was reached by residents to not use the color red in the new flag, as it is used by the University of Utah, a rival to Provo's Brigham Young University.|$|E
5|$|The B-1 {{was first}} envisioned in the 1960s as a {{platform}} that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52, and would ultimately replace both bombers. After {{a long series of}} studies, Rockwell International (now part of Boeing) won the <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> for what emerged as the B-1A. This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high cost of the aircraft, the introduction of the AGM-86 ALCM cruise missile that flew the same basic profile, and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1. This led to the program being cancelled in 1977, after the B-1A prototypes had been built.|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{some of its}} {{neighboring}} countries, the Netherlands do {{not have}} a strong tradition in public <b>design</b> <b>contests.</b> As of old, this kind of procedures are unpopular among public clients. Persistent prejudices prevail. <b>Design</b> <b>contests</b> are expensive, consume {{a lot of time and}} their outcome is uncertain (Spreiregen 1979). The few Dutch public <b>design</b> <b>contests</b> that have been organized in the past years are mainly used for image reasons and incidentally to generate ideas or just 9 ̆ 1 to do something different 9 ̆ 2. These procedures are rarely used for contract allocation. Public clients prefer to solicit bids from a select group of preferred architects. The implementation of the European Public Procurement Directives (Directive 2004 / 17 /EG and 2004 / 18 /EG) had a profound impact on Dutch design competition culture. Suddenly, open competition was compulsory for public contracts with a value above the European thresholds. Confronted with this legal obligation, Dutch public clients have resorted to European (predominantly restricted) tender procedures to award their contracts for design services (SESAM). Most architects resent recent design competition culture in the Netherlands. Especially the European Procurement Directives, or 9 ̆ 6 to be more precise 9 ̆ 6 their unnecessary strict interpretation by Dutch awarding authorities, in the past years have given way to a seemingly endless stream of criticisms (Kroese et al. 2008; Van der Pol et al. 2009; Geertse et al. 2010; Stegmeijer 2010). These complaints are not confined to the architectural sector (Ruiter 2009). Besides overt aggravated requirements, criteria and contract terms and mounting transaction costs, architects complain about lacking properties, usually attributed to 9 ̆ 1 classic 9 ̆ 2 design contests: peer review and holistic, qualitative review methods. It must be pointed out that these issues are not a specific Dutch phenomenon; everywhere in Europe the formal straightjacket of EU procurement causes similar problems (Geertse et al. 2010 : 50 - 59). However, those who think architects prefer <b>design</b> <b>contests</b> are wrong. They are not enthusiastic about this kind of selection procedures because of the slim chances of winning and the considerable transaction costs involved. They resent the lack of commitment surrounding most <b>design</b> <b>contests.</b> Clients ask a lot, but generally offer little in return. The bulk of the Dutch <b>design</b> <b>contests</b> concern so-called 9 ̆ 1 ideas competitions 9 ̆ 2 in which architects are asked to enter 9 ̆ 1 free designs 9 ̆ 2; they receive no remuneration for design costs, prize money is negligible and they have to transfer all intellectual property (Pöll 2013; Kempe 2013). Also abroad, these ideas competitions are a serious concern to architects (Geertse 2011). Despite the dominant sentiments towards <b>design</b> <b>contests</b> in the Netherlands, they are actually booming.

25|$|This {{situation}} was considered impracticable due to rising passenger {{figures in the}} 19th century, so plans were laid out as early as 1866. At first, a large scale station with up to 34 platforms was considered, then the number got reduced to 18. Post and baggage handlings had their own underground facilities, and the city council demanded the station to be moved further away from the city. In the end, in 1881, the German architect Hermann Eggert won the <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> for the station hall, his runner-up in the contest, Johann Wilhelm Schwedler was made chief engineer for the steel-related works. The new station was placed about 1km {{to the west of}} the first three stations. The platforms were covered by three iron-and-glass halls.|$|E

25|$|The Women's Memorial was {{designed}} by Glenna Goodacre for {{the women of the}} United States who served in the Vietnam War. The original winning entry of the Women's Memorial <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> was deemed unsuitable. Glenna Goodacre's entry received an honorable mention in the contest and she was asked to submit a modified maquette (design model). Goodacre's original design for the Women's Memorial statue included a standing figure of a nurse holding a Vietnamese baby, which although not intended as such, was deemed a political statement, and it was asked that this be removed. She replaced them with a figure of a kneeling woman holding an empty helmet. On November 11, 1993, the Vietnam Women's Memorial was dedicated. There is a smaller replica of that memorial at Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park in Angel Fire, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, the {{university}} opened a national <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> {{for the new}} campus. The renowned Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The cornerstone of the first building, Busch Hall, was laid on October 20, 1900. The construction of Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and Olympics. The delay allowed {{the university}} to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent {{for the development of}} the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson’s original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.|$|E
25|$|After this, a <b>design</b> <b>contest</b> {{was held}} for a {{signature}} span (a span with distinctive and dramatic appearance, unique to the site) by the Engineering and Design Advisory Panel (EDAP) of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). A number of innovative proposals were examined until all but four proposals that were submitted by members of EDAP were selected as semi-finalists, and a winner was selected from this group. This posed a serious conflict of interest, {{as members of the}} EDAP who were selecting the bridge design reviewed proposals by their own firms and rejected all proposals that did not have a representative on the EDAP. The design chosen was more expensive than the alternatives, because the primary structure cannot be self-supporting until it is structurally complete. This requires the building of two bridges, the first a falsework to support the final span, which would be removed upon completion of the final span. It has also been criticized as both a less structurally robust design and with less predictable construction costs than other modern spans.|$|E
