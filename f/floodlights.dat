5|$|Despite only {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs {{were invited to participate}} in the first season of the European Cup, which was not strictly based on league positions at that time. Eighteen clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and who also had the <b>floodlights</b> necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate. <b>Floodlights</b> had been used at Easter Road for the first time in a friendly match against Hearts on 18 October 1954. Hibs became the first British club in Europe because the Football League secretary Alan Hardaker persuaded Chelsea, the English champions, not to enter.|$|E
5|$|When {{the ride}} opened in 2000, Cedar Point chose High End Systems, {{headquartered}} in Austin, Texas, {{to light the}} ride. Rob Decker, Cedar Point’s Corporate Director of Planning & Design, said that they thought {{they would have to}} mount multiple <b>floodlights</b> on the tower. However, they were able to install thirty EC-1 <b>floodlights</b> {{at the base of the}} lift hill structure which provided lighting throughout the ride's structure. Of the six main support towers, three had six EC-1s, and three towers had four EC-1s. The three tallest towers had another unit in the middle.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Summer Olympics, {{the stadium}} hosted the {{football}} preliminaries. For the next 50 years, the stadium changed little, although during the Second World War the North Bank terrace was bombed {{and had to}} be rebuilt; the roof was not restored until 1956. <b>Floodlights</b> were fitted in 1951, with the first floodlit match being a friendly against Hapoel Tel Aviv on 19 September of that year. The <b>floodlights</b> that adorn Dalymount Park, once stood at the Arsenal stadium. They were shipped to Dublin in 1962. The inaugural floodlit match saw Arsenal beat Bohemians 3–8. Undersoil heating was added in 1964. Unlike at many other grounds, Arsenal refused to install perimeter fencing, even at the height of hooliganism in the 1980s, which made it ineligible for use as an FA Cup semi-final venue.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, {{the rear of}} the Grosvenor Road End was cordoned off as cracks had {{appeared}} in the rear wall, and this section of the ground was later segregated and allocated to away supporters. Extensive improvements were made over the mid 1980s, including new turnstiles, refurbished dressing rooms, new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room being readied, hospitality boxes being built to the Main Stand and crash barriers being strengthened. The David Longhurst Stand was constructed over the summer of 1991, and was named after the York player who collapsed and died from heart failure in a match a year earlier. It provided covered accommodation for supporters in what was previously the Shipton Street End, and was officially opened for a friendly match against Leeds United. In June 1995, new <b>floodlights</b> were installed, which were twice as powerful as the original <b>floodlights.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Floodlights</b> {{were first}} used at Ibrox in December 1953, for a {{friendly}} match against Arsenal. The first floodlit Scottish league match was played at Ibrox, in March 1956. Covers were {{built over the}} north and east terracing during the 1960s. No structural changes were made to Ibrox, but capacity was cut to approximately 80,000 by safety legislation.|$|E

5|$|Other {{than new}} <b>floodlights</b> {{and a small}} section of {{terracing}} refurbishment, the ground has received no public investment since. During this time, in excess of £50 million of public money has been spent on 15 other football grounds in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The three-minute ride {{features}} 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats altogether) {{spinning around}} a central tower. A lighting package was installed {{on all four}} WindSeekers, consisting of strips of LED lights mounted on the arms that support the swings and (except at Knott's Berry Farm) colored <b>floodlights</b> to illuminate towers from above.|$|E
5|$|With the club's {{finances}} in {{a strong}} position, York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand and the Shipton Street End. The Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street over the summer of 1955, {{and a year later}} a concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. The ground was fitted with <b>floodlights</b> in 1959, which were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United. The <b>floodlights</b> were updated and improved in 1980, and were officially switched on for a friendly with Grimsby Town. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End in 1981, and two years later new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents' lounge.|$|E

The Sussex <b>Floodlight</b> Cup was won in three {{consecutive}} years from 1991 to 1993 and also again in 1998-99.|$|R
5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. Up to half of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large <b>floodlights</b> were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E

5|$|Feethams was {{originally}} used by Darlington Cricket Club, but {{began to be}} used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand {{at the turn of the}} century and the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. <b>Floodlights</b> were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an electrical fault gutted the West stand in a fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all-seater stand, but its cost had a major negative effect on the club's finances. George Reynolds came in to the club, paid its debts and initiated construction of a new stadium. The last match played at Feethams was a 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient on 3 May 2003. Following the closure of the ground, the <b>floodlights</b> were sold to Workington A.F.C. and the stadium demolished. A housing estate was planned for the cleared site.|$|E

50|$|Further {{enhancements}} {{were made}} to the football pitch in 2011, when <b>floodlighting</b> was added. There had been a desire to include <b>floodlighting</b> at the stadium since 2006, but this had not been achieved due to the high cost of installation. A trip to Bhutan by Tata Group owner Ratan Tata led to an agreement between Tata Power, Druk Green and the Bhutan Olympic Committee to install <b>floodlighting,</b> with Tata bearing the cost of installation as an act of corporate social responsibility. The total cost of installing the <b>floodlighting</b> was Rs 13,230,000.|$|R
5|$|<b>Floodlights</b> were {{installed}} in the ground in September 1958. The supporters' association raised the £15,000 cost of the new lights. When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961, {{one of his many}} influential changes was {{to take advantage of the}} lights, playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon. This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays. The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Park {{lies on the}} {{outskirts}} of Leek and has been the team's home since 1948, when the club purchased what was then called Hamil Park for £1,250. Changing rooms were constructed in the 1950s (previously the players had been obliged to change in a nearby pub), along with the first covered accommodation for spectators, and <b>floodlights</b> (which had previously belonged to the defunct Rugby Town) were erected in 1972, soon after which the stadium was renamed Harrison Park after former club chairman Geoff Harrison.|$|E
5|$|Herbert Chapman won Arsenal's first {{national}} trophies, but died prematurely. He helped introduce the WM formation, <b>floodlights,</b> and shirt numbers, and added the white sleeves and brighter red to Arsenal's kit.

The ground has a modern, 400 seater grandstand.|$|R
5000|$|Budweiser {{remained}} {{sponsor of}} the <b>Floodlit</b> Cup until 1994/95 with Portadown winning the trophy for a record third time. With Budweiser's withdrawal as sponsors the competition was immediately replaced by the Coca-Cola <b>Floodlit</b> Cup (the Budweiser branded trophy ended at this point). The Coca-Cola <b>Floodlit</b> Cup was a new trophy, and {{in the years that}} followed the term [...] "Floodlit" [...] became less prevalent. The Coca-Cola <b>Floodlit</b> Cup itself lapsed in 1998/99 with the remainder of the company's six-year sponsorship deal transferring to the Irish League Cup as the number of competitions open to Irish League clubs was reduced.|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Lillestrøm SK took {{initiative}} to convert {{one of the}} gravel pitches to artificial turf. The proposal also saw the installation of <b>floodlights</b> and under-soil heating. The new field cost NOK9 million, which was covered by LSK, betting grants and the municipality. Construction started in August 2004 and was completed in November. The pitch located behind Skedsmohallen was converted to a throwing venue in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Family Stand {{was opened}} in the Main Stand in 1992, and manager John Ward ran the London Marathon to help raise funds for the project. Bootham Crescent first hosted a {{play-off}} match when York beat Bury 1–0 on 19 May 1993 in the Third Division play-off semi-final; the attendance of 9,206 was the ground's highest in seven years. During 1993–94 the Main Stand paddock was seated and covered, and the recent work to the stand cost £220,000. The ground's capacity fell to 9,459, including seating for 3,645, after the renovations to the David Longhurst and Main Stands. In May 1995, a new drainage system was installed for £11,000, {{to improve the quality}} of the pitch during winter. New <b>floodlights</b> were installed in June 1995 at a cost of £122,000, and despite being shorter in height were twice as powerful as the original <b>floodlights.</b> A water tower was installed in the late 1990s, to further help the pitch quality.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel Railway reopened for the 1946 {{season as}} usual. The {{illuminated}} tableaux {{had been removed}} during the war but were replaced, but this time they were illuminated by <b>floodlights</b> fitted {{to the sides of}} the trains rather than being self illuminated. The line {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of the railways and so remained in the hands of Ramsgate Olympia (later Pleasurama). The tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing vandalism, and the station signage changed from World Scenic Railway to Tunnel Railway.|$|E
