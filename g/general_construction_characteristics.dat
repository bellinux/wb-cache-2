40|$|Abstract. This note announces a <b>general</b> <b>construction</b> of <b>characteristic</b> {{currents}} for singular connections on a vector bundle. It develops, in particular, a Chern-Weil-Simons {{theory for}} smooth bundle maps α: E → F which, for smooth connections on E and F, establishes formulas {{of the type}} φ = ResφΣα + dT. Here φ is a standard charactersitic form, Resφ is an associated smooth “residue ” form computed canonically in terms of curvature, Σα is a rectifiable current depending only on the singular structure of α, and T is a canonical, functorial transgression form with coefficients in L 1 loc. The theory encompasses such classical topics as: Poincaré-Lelong Theory, Bott-Chern Theory, Chern-Weil Theory, and formulas of Hopf. Applications include: a new proof of the Riemann-Roch Theorem for vector bundles over algebraic curves, a C∞-generalization of the Poincaré-Lelong Formula, universal formulas for the Thom class as an equivariant characteristic form (i. e., canonical formulas for a de Rham representative of the Thom class of a bundle with connection), and a Differentiable Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck Theorem {{at the level of}} forms and currents. A variety of formulas relating geometry and characteristic classes are deduced as direct consequences of the theory. 1...|$|R
