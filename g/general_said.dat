5|$|This National War Museum Committee {{set about}} {{collecting}} material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, {{the production of}} munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation {{of the need for}} exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director <b>General,</b> <b>said</b> that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.|$|E

However, the Rhode Island Attorney <b>General</b> <b>said</b> that their prosecution would not go forward until the Boston cases ended.|$|E
25|$|As a {{historic}} memento to {{victory over the}} Swedish army in 1645, the local Petrov Cathedral rings noon an hour earlier, at 11o'clock because the locals and Swedish army were in stalemate and the Swedish <b>general</b> <b>said</b> he would withdraw if his army had not won by noon; the bell ringer tricked him by ringing the bell an hour early. Keeping his word, the general and his army left.|$|E

25|$|IDF Lieutenant-General Gabi Ashkenazi {{testified to}} Israel's Turkel Commission that the IDF had fired 308 live rounds and about 350 bean bag rounds and paintballs. An aide to the <b>general</b> <b>said</b> that 70 of these shots were aimed to cause injury, {{while the others}} would have been warning shots. IDF Major-General Giora Eiland said that the IDF had found {{evidence}} of four instances of soldiers coming under fire from activists, and that {{in at least one}} case, the fire came from weapons that were not stolen from commandos.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{popularity}} was not universal. Sir Sam Fay, {{a railway}} official {{who worked at}} the War Office 1917–19, enjoyed cordial face-to-face relations with Wilson but wrote that he could argue with total conviction that a horse chestnut was the same thing as a chestnut horse, and that an unnamed senior <b>general</b> <b>said</b> he suffered a “sexual disturbance” whenever he came within a mile of a politician (Fay recorded that the general had in fact used “vulgar and obscene” language – Walter Reid simply writes that exposure to politicians gave Wilson an erection). Edward Spears – also a senior Anglo-French liaison officer, but junior to Wilson – loathed him and compared him to Quint, the sinister and evil valet in Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw.|$|E
25|$|Chen was {{reportedly}} {{shot in the}} stomach while campaigning {{in the city of}} Tainan on Friday, March 19, 2004, the day before polls opened on Saturday. According to Chen, the bullet left a flesh wound that was 11cm long and 2cm deep and was found in his clothes. He left the hospital on the same day with 14 stitches. His Vice President Annette Lu was also reportedly shot in the leg in the same incident. After the election, video from the hospital Chen and Lu were taken to showed Chen walking into the hospital after the Presidential Office Secretary <b>General</b> <b>said</b> that he had been taken in. The opposition made many allegations into the conduct of the security and hospital procedures requiring Chen and Lu to change parts of their stories in order for it to make sense. While many theories were put forth, the opposition had no access to the physical evidence so the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) refuted them.|$|E
5000|$|War {{correspondent}} Quentin Reynolds {{wrote in}} 1943, [...] "He and his troupe would do 300 miles in a jeep, and give four shows... One of the <b>generals</b> <b>said</b> Hope {{was a first}} rate military target since he was worth a division; that that's about 15,000 men. Presumably the Nazis appreciated Hope's value, since they thrice bombed towns while the comic was there." ...|$|R

25|$|On July 23, 2015, The New York Times {{reported}} {{the existence of}} a June 2015, memorandum to the Justice Department from the Inspectors General of the Intelligence Community and the State Department regarding the presence of classified government information in emails from the personal email account Hillary Clinton used as Secretary of State. A transmittal memorandum, written by State Dept. official Patrick F. Kennedy, said that, based on an assessment of a small sample of the contents of Mrs. Clinton’s private account by the two Inspectors General, it was likely that the entire body of emails contained hundreds of instances of classified information. In their joint statement, the inspectors <b>general</b> <b>said</b> that classified information in the emails had originated from U.S. intelligence agencies, such as the CIA and the NSA, and that it is illegal anyone to receive a classified document, or briefing, and then summarize or otherwise transmit that information in an unclassified email.|$|E
25|$|The {{system was}} set up as such by the Fathers of Confederation because they saw such a use of {{constitutional}} monarchy as a bulwark against any fracturing of the Canadian federation. In 1939, Sir Shuldham Redfern, then Secretary to the Governor <b>General,</b> <b>said</b> that, without a common allegiance to the Crown, the regions of Canada might break up. The British North America Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867), was written so as to reflect the view of John A. Macdonald and the Earl of Derby that the provinces were subordinate to the federal Crown, with the lieutenant governors appointed by the governor general and not—as is done with the governors of the Australian states and was suggested be integrated in Canada by the 1979 Task Force on National Unity—by the Queen herself. Further, while the lieutenant governors did each hold a great seal, summoned and prorogued parliament in the Queen's stead, and granted Royal Assent to bills that bore the Queen's name, it was still expected that the latter be given {{in the name of}} the governor general.|$|E

500|$|Elements of the 82nd Airborne Division {{arrived in}} New Orleans September 3. The {{flooding}} {{was a challenge}} for the paratroopers when they first arrived. The division had just four boats at the time, however, the division quickly started getting Coast Guard, Navy and Marine assets placed under their control. Army Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell IV, the 82nd's commanding general, noted: [...] "We eventually became the 82nd 'Waterborne' Division," [...] the <b>general</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and that really was our forte" [...] during search-and-rescue and security missions in flooded sections of the city.|$|E
500|$|There {{had been}} {{opposition}} to military rule in West Pakistan as well. [...] Eventually the military relented, and in December 1970 {{the first ever}} elections were held. [...] To the surprise of many, East Pakistan's Awami League, headed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a clear majority. The West Pakistani establishment was displeased with the results. In Dacca following the election a <b>general</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Don't worry, we will not allow these black bastards to rule over us". Soon President Yahya Khan banned the Awami League and declared martial law in East Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|Donayre {{became the}} center of an {{international}} controversy on November 24, 2008, when Peruvian media showed a YouTube video in which the <b>general</b> <b>said</b> [...] "We are not going to let Chileans pass by (...) [...] Chilean who enters will not leave. Or will leave in a coffin. And if there aren't sufficient coffins, there will be plastic bags". The video, dated to 2006 or 2007, was recorded during a [...] party at a friend's house attended by army officials and civilians. These comments caused widespread indignation in Chile, making headlines in the El Mercurio newspaper. The Peruvian president, Alan García, called his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet, to explain that these remarks did not reflect official Peruvian policy. Bachelet declared herself satisfied with the explanations.|$|E

500|$|Regulations {{required}} interested nursing schools to: (1) be state accredited; (2) {{be connected}} with a hospital approved by the American College of Surgeons or a hospital of equal standards; (3) maintain adequate instructional facilities and personnel; (4) provide adequate clinical experience in four basic services—medicine, surgery, pediatrics and obstetrics; (5) provide maintenance and a stipend of $30.00 for all Senior Cadet Nurses, or arrange for their requested transfer to federal or other hospitals; (6) provide satisfactory living facilities and an adequate health service for students; (7) provide for an accelerated program; and (8) restrict its hours of practice. The standards of the National League of Nursing Education were adopted to evaluate the participating schools. After issuing these regulations, the Surgeon <b>General</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The schools of nursing are free to select students, to plan curricula, and to formulate policies consistent with the Act and {{the traditions of the}} institution concerned. This is a partnership job between the USPHS, the institutions, and the students..." ...|$|E
500|$|The SEC's {{occupancy}} of {{the building}} did not occur as planned. In October 2010, the SEC informed Nassif Associates that it needed only [...] of the [...] it had leased. On January 20, 2011, the SEC's inspector general launched an investigation into whether the SEC leased was proper and legal. SEC chairman Mary Schapiro was strongly criticized by Republicans in the United States House of Representatives for her handling of the lease, which she had personally approved. By May, it was unclear if the SEC would occupy any space {{at all in the}} building. On May 23, the SEC inspector general requested a formal opinion by the Comptroller General of the United States as to whether the lease violated the Antideficiency Act. The inspector <b>general</b> <b>said</b> SEC [...] "grossly overestimated the amount of space needed at SEC Headquarters for the SEC's projected expansion by more than 300 percent and used these groundless and unsupportable figures to justify the SEC committing to an expenditure of $556.8 million over 10 years".|$|E
