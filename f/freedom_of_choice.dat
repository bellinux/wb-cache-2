5|$|A {{brain and}} a subtle ear {{has gone into}} the making of this poem...celebrating the mystery of Christ's conception. Dew falling on grass, flower and spray (traditional imagery, {{deriving}} from OT texts such as Psalm 72:6) suggests ease, grace and delicacy generally (not progressive stages of insemination). The emphasis on Mary's <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> {{at the moment of}} the annunciation, is theologically strictly proper.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the view in The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E
5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its discretion, it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of discretion were recognized: fettering of discretion through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of discretion by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering of discretion have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of discretion in administrative law – the first form relates to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> and second form the notion of one's personal discretion.|$|E

5|$|Writing in {{the journal}} Social Problems, Jessica Fields {{characterized}} Not in Front of the Children as a significant monograph which effectively criticized the rhetoric of protection of the sexual purity of youths {{as a form of}} ideology. Cynthia A. McDaniel wrote in a piece for the journal Counterpoints assessing that Heins had put forth a thesis that attempting to shield youths from events led to negative unintended consequences. McDaniel emphasized that rationale debate is key to a functional society which values <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice.</b> She wrote that debate and introspection were critical to growth in this area, {{in order to determine the}} need to modify behavior patterns.|$|E
5|$|In {{his review}} of the Director's Cut, IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting {{inconsistencies}} in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version {{in addition to the}} added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the Director's Cut, particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as The Missing Link that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael Gapper of Official Nintendo Magazine stated that all the changes made to the game for the Director's Cut had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> in addition to the new features.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{problem of}} quantum mechanics {{has been there for}} almost a century. Academia tends to regard this problem as a combination of definite outcomes and preferred basis. At the start of this century, John Conway and Simon Kochen proposed the strong free will theorem. This theorem clearly proved that free will exist within any given particle, which implies that particles have perceptions and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choices.</b> A particle’s perception and its free will are then linked with energy, and two principles of energy are reached: the perception-energy principle and the will-energy principle. With these two principles, the measurement problem can be solved, and a new interpretation {{of quantum mechanics}} can be revealed...|$|R

40|$|This book takes a new {{approach}} on understanding causes of extreme poverty and promising actions to address it. Its focus is on marginality being a root cause of poverty and deprivation. “Marginality” is the position {{of people on the}} edge, preventing their access to resources, <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choices,</b> and the development of capabilities. The book is research based with original empirical analyses at local, national, and local scales; book contributors are leaders in their fields and have backgrounds in different disciplines. An important message of the book is that economic and ecological approaches and institutional innovations need to be integrated to overcome marginality. The book will be a valuable source for development scholars and students, actors that design public policies, and for social innovators in the private sector and non-governmental organizations. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{goal of the}} FreedomCAR and Fuel Partnership is the {{development}} of emission- and petroleum-free cars and light trucks. The Partnership focuses on the high-risk research needed to develop the necessary technologies, such as fuel cells and advanced hybrid propulsion systems, to provide a full range of affordable cars and light trucks that are free of foreign oil and harmful emissions — and that do not sacrifice <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> mobility and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> vehicle <b>choice.</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{dimensions}} of urban form and spatial urban development {{are discussed in}} the light of the main criteria of a sustainable development. If a sustainable development is to be achieved, it is necessary to avoid further urban sprawl. Low density, dispersed cities can hardly be energy efficient unless their inhabitants renounce the <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> characterizing today's cities with respect to job market opportunities, services and cultural events. However, a strategy for more compact cities should be cautious so that it does not decimate important green areas within the city, and localities of unfavourable microclimatic conditions should not be selected for residential construction. Planning for sustainability must be oriented towards long-term and global goals, but should not rely solely on technical and instrumental rationality. A broad spectrum of planning strategies should be used, contingent on the concrete planning situation. ...|$|R

5000|$|Many {{games have}} {{made use of}} a silent protagonist out of utility, because of technology, time, or budget limitations, or as a {{narrative}} device. Whether the player {{is supposed to be}} the protagonist or is merely assuming control of an established character and whether the game allows the player <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>choices</b> that would be difficult to believably justify with spoken narrative influence this decision. Some have cited Myst as an example of a first person adventure, where the main character is merely an avatar for the player's choices and dialogue would not be needed or helpful. Grand Theft Auto III, as another example, had no dialogue for its protagonist, as was common for its time, and also to allow players of many backgrounds and personalities identify with the character they control in the game's open world environment.|$|R
