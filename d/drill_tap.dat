40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. This study is the initial step {{in the development of}} a basic skills simulator for surgical residents, intended to serve as a cross-platform objective motor skills training system. A robust system was developed to measure motor skills of orthopaedic surgeons and gynecologic surgeons. The orthopaedic study focused on three basic skills: <b>drill,</b> <b>tap,</b> and screw insertion. Each of the participants repeated the sequential task of <b>drill,</b> <b>tap,</b> screw insertion ten times in cadaveric femoral diaphyseal bone. The gynecologic study focused on placement of sutures across ten incisions in synthetic skin. Real time wrist, hand, and finger position was recorded bilaterally using Immersion CyberGloves® and the Ascension Liberty Tracker®. Four metrics were evaluated: task duration, gesture proficiency, hand movement smoothness (replaced by subjective rating in Gyn study), and number of errors, in order to differentiate between groups with different skill levels: No Skills, Limited Skills, Advanced Skills, and Expert Skills. The results demonstrated a significant difference between the Expert Skills group and the less skilled groups. In both studies the Expert Skills group completed the tasks the fastest, with the greatest proficiency, smoothness and accuracy. These results establish the 5 capability of our present skill quantification system and will assist in future improvement of the analysis algorithm...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To assess if {{the screw}} design (self-drilling/self-tapping) {{and the pilot}} hole tapping could affect the {{insertion}} torque and screw pullout strength of the screw used in anterior fixation of the cervical spine. Methods: Forty self-tapping screws and 20 self-drilling screws were inserted into 10 models of artificial bone and 10 cervical vertebrae of sheep. The studied parameters were the insertion torque and pullout strength. The following groups were created: Group I-self-tapping screw insertion after pilot hole drilling and tapping; Group II-self-tapping screw insertion after pilot hole drilling without tapping; Group III-self-drilling screw insertion without <b>drilling</b> and <b>tapping.</b> In Groups I and II, the pilot hole had 14. 0 mm in depth and was made with a 3 mmn <b>drill,</b> while <b>tapping</b> was made with a 4 mm tap. The insertion torque was measured and the pullout test was performed. The comparison between groups was made considering the mean insertion torque and the maximum mean pullout strength with the variance analysis (ANOVA; p≤ 0. 05). Results: Previous <b>drilling</b> and <b>tapping</b> of pilot hole significantly decreased the insertion torque and the pullout strength.
