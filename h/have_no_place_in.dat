5|$|Roman Academic Cotta ridicules both {{literal and}} allegorical {{acceptance}} of myth, declaring roundly that myths <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> philosophy. Cicero is also generally disdainful of myth, but, like Varro, he is emphatic in {{his support for}} the state religion and its institutions. It is difficult to know how far down the social scale this rationalism extended. Cicero asserts that no one (not even old women and boys) is so foolish as to believe in the terrors of Hades or the existence of Scyllas, centaurs or other composite creatures, but, on the other hand, the orator elsewhere complains of the superstitious and credulous character of the people. De Natura Deorum is the most comprehensive summary of Cicero's line of thought.|$|E

However, seeing how important it is to Bella, he agrees to try, but only after they are married.|$|E

ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> our collective conscience and no role in our security.|$|E
25|$|Futurism is {{a modernist}} avant-garde {{movement}} {{in literature and}} part of the Futurism art movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909). Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.|$|E

500|$|Much of folk {{psychology}} {{involves the}} attribution of intentional states (or more specifically as a subclass, propositional attitudes). Eliminativists {{point out that}} these states are generally ascribed syntactic and semantic properties. An {{example of this is}} the language of thought hypothesis, which attributes a discrete, combinatorial syntax and other linguistic properties to these mental phenomena. Eliminativists argue that such discrete and combinatorial characteristics <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the neurosciences, which speak of action potentials, spiking frequencies, and other effects which are continuous and distributed in nature. Hence, the syntactic structures which are assumed by folk psychology can <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> such a structure as the brain. Against this there have been two responses. On the one hand, there are philosophers who deny that mental states are linguistic in nature and see this as a straw man argument. The other view is represented by those who subscribe to [...] "a language of thought". They assert that the mental states can be multiply realized and that functional characterizations are just higher-level characterizations of what's happening at the physical level.|$|E

The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Joe Lieberman.

500|$|Francis Bacon (no direct {{relation}} to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy {{of science at}} the time of the Scientific Revolution. In his work Novum Organum (1620) – a reference to Aristotle's Organon – Bacon outlined a new system of logic to improve upon the old philosophical process of syllogism. Bacon's method relied on experimental histories to eliminate alternative theories. In 1637, René Descartes established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, Discourse on Method, advocating the central role of reason as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica argued that [...] "...hypotheses... <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> experimental philosophy. In this philosophy propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. [...] " [...] This passage influenced a [...] "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy." [...] In particular, later in the 18th century, David Hume would famously articulate skepticism about the ability of science to determine causality and gave a definitive formulation of the problem of induction. [...] The 19th century writings of John Stuart Mill are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.|$|E
500|$|The topic {{came up in}} a 2013 {{interview}} of President Barack Obama, who stated {{that if he were}} the owner of the Redskins, he would consider changing the name because it offends many Native Americans, but {{that he did not have}} a stake in the issue as he is not an owner of a professional sports team. In November 2015 Obama, speaking at the White House Tribal Nations Conference, stated [...] "Names and mascots of sports teams like the Washington Redskins perpetuate negative stereotypes of Native Americans" [...] and praised Adidas for a new initiative to help schools change names and mascots by designing new logos and paying for part of the cost of new uniforms. On May 22, 2014, fifty U.S. Senators, forty-eight Democrats and two Independents, sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Goodell asking the league, referencing the Donald Sterling case, to [...] "send the same clear message as the NBA did: that racism and bigotry <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> professional sports." [...] Five Democratic Senators declined to sign the letter, and Republicans were not invited to do so. [...] No Senators have publicly supported the name, but rather have either declined to give an opinion or stated their opposition to Senate involvement in the issue. During his campaign, President Donald Trump defended the name.|$|E

500|$|A different, widely {{circulated}} story {{suggests that}} Peel urinated on the pitch before being dismissed by Hawke. Woodhouse, writing in 1989, suggested that [...] "it {{is difficult to}} ascertain the truth behind this long-standing tale", while Hodgson observes: [...] "I have never been convinced of this account because it has {{always seemed to be}} so much out of character for a cricketer of that time when so much stress was placed upon behaving 'like a gentleman' even in one's cups." [...] Mick Pope writes: [...] "The more recent accusation that Peel urinated on the pitch remains unjust, unproven and such a myth... that it should <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> any study of Bobby Peel, the cricketer." [...] The story originated in a cricket publication, Cricket Quarterly, in 1968. The historian Rowland Bowen, in an article called [...] "Fresh Light on the Dismissal of R Peel in 1897", claimed that an [...] "aged Yorkshireman of 85" [...] told him that Peel had urinated and that this was a common practice then. Subsequent research by the historian Irving Rosewater established that Bowen's information came to him second-hand. The 85-year-old had not used the word [...] "urinated" [...] but had actually said [...] "pissed at the wicket", meaning that Peel was drunk ("pissed" [...] being slang for drunk) on the pitch ("at the wicket"). Rosewater suggests that this was merely repetition of the already known story, not the new information claimed by Bowen. Rosewater self-published his findings in a book called An Unjust Slur on Bobby Peel in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} climate in the United States and in Arizona {{in particular was}} pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act. For example, Clarence Dupnik, Pima County Sheriff, initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related, observing, [...] "When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol {{that comes out of}} certain mouths about tearing down the government. The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous." [...] He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become [...] "the capital" [...] of such feelings. [...] "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," [...] he said. But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard. International media referred to the {{political climate}} in the United States and the Palin map in particular. The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm [...] "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence." [...] President Obama called the shooting an [...] "unspeakable tragedy", adding that [...] "such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society". Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack [...] "senseless and cruel violence" [...] and House Speaker John Boehner said, [...] "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve. Acts and threats of violence against public officials <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> our society". Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement noting, [...] "we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own", with the death of Chief Judge John Roll.|$|E
