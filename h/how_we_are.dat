5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} the poem is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of the poem is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of the poem deals with the senses and the ending describes <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> limited in our ability to understand the world. The poem takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of the poem knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{truth is}} that Cousin's {{doctrine}} of the spontaneous apperception of impersonal truth amounts {{to little more than}} a presentment in philosophical language of the ordinary convictions and beliefs of mankind. This is important as a preliminary stage, but philosophy properly begins when it attempts to coordinate or systematize those convictions in harmony, to conciliate apparent contradiction and opposition, as between the correlative notions of finite and infinite, the apparently conflicting notions of personality and infinitude, self and not-self; in a word, to reconcile the various sides of consciousness with each other. And whether the laws of our reason are the laws of all intelligence and being—whether and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to relate our fundamental, intellectual and moral conceptions to what is beyond our experience, or to an infinite being—are problems which Cousin cannot be regarded as having solved. These are in truth the outstanding problems of modern philosophy.|$|E

Asch concluded [...] "to know a person is to have a grasp of a particular structure". He demonstrated through his experiments that forming an impression has the following elements: ...|$|E

It tells {{a story of a}} group of school children from Karin (Erzurum) in 2050 taking a trip throughout the [...] "liberated from enemy" [...] territories: Tigranakert, Baghesh (Bitlis), Mush and Akdamar Island. The country they live in is called Hayk' [...] (Հայք) after the historical name of Armenia. The series was aired by the Public Television of Armenia. In one of his last interviews, Sahakyants stated: [...] "If today I'm shooting a film about <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to return Western Armenia, then I'm convinced that it will definitely take place." ...|$|E

500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four {{of us in the}} Battersby family read our scripts together to work out <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to play our parts. On this occasion, all four of us were sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E

The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. On March 13, 2008, during the broadcast of the sixth season, the network renewed the show for a seventh season, with 26 episodes in order. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon & MTVN Kids and Family Group, said, [...] "The strength of the Nickelodeon brand comes from how we embrace everything important to kids, and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> with them virtually everywhere they want us to be.

[...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun.

2500|$|Philosopher Philip Stokes of the University of Reading {{noted that}} overall, Foucault's work was [...] "dark and pessimistic", {{but that it}} did leave some room for optimism, in that it {{illustrates}} how the discipline of philosophy {{can be used to}} highlight areas of domination. In doing so, Stokes claimed, we are able to understand <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> being dominated and strive to build social structures that minimise this risk of domination. In all of this development there had to be close attention to detail; it is the detail which eventually individualises people.|$|E
