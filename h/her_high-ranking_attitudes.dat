5000|$|The {{difference}} between Fehler's reported course to Halifax and his true course was soon realized by US authorities who dispatched two destroyers to intercept U-234.

Dr. Velma Hunt, a retired Penn State University environmental health professor, has suggested U-234 may have put into two ports between her surrender and her arrival at the Portsmouth Navy Yard: once in Newfoundland, to land an American sailor who had been accidentally shot in the buttocks, and again at Casco Bay, Maine.

40|$|International audienceIn March 2000, Colonel Yuri Budanov kidnapped, {{raped and}} killed a young Chechen girl {{from the village of}} Tangui-Chu. After his arrest and during the entire trial, he claimed that she was a sniper who had murdered several of his soldiers, and that he had lost his temper and strangled her, but he denied raping <b>her.</b> <b>High-ranking</b> {{military}} officials closed ranks behind him, and at all stages of his trial demonstrations of support were organised in front of the court. He was finally condemned to ten years of imprisonment in July 2003. The aim {{of this article is to}} study how Russian public opinion perceived this case, using different kinds of sources (newspapers, forums and discussions on the Internet, public opinion polls, Human rights report, etc.). How were the events covered by the Russian medias? Some groups (the military, the Cossacks, fascist groups) can be identified as his supporters. But what support did he receive from the general public and on what basis? Which arguments were used to defend Budanov and how were they perceived? Was this crime "justified" by the vengeance against "a sniper", by the "laws of war"? Was Budanov a scapegoat sacrificed for the sake of good relations with the West? Defining the attitude towards Budanov might help explain why other Russian servicemen charged with crimes against Chechen civilians (the Ulman group, Arkacheev-Khudiakov) have been systematically acquitted by a popular jury...|$|R

As a result, instead of Haiphong, Jean-Baptiste is sent to a remote French military base on the notorious Dragon Islet (Hòn Rồng) in northern Indochina. On arrival, he is greeted by the outgoing commanding officer, who says the French authorities hardly pay attention to this outpost: its sole function is to gather unemployed northern Vietnamese who seek indenture on plantations in more prosperous southern Indochina.|$|R

Nick is faced with the choice to either move on or attempt to recapture his humanity through a method that puts Natalie's life in the balance. At that point LaCroix appears and indicates the time to leave is near and he must either bring Natalie over or leave her to die. Nicholas decides that neither option is acceptable and hands LaCroix a wooden stake. We do not see what LaCroix does, but we hear him say [...] "Damn you, Nicholas" [...] in stress and frustration, and the scene pans out to the building where Nick lives.|$|R

She also rejects the idea of arranged marriages and believes in a woman's right to a career and to marry for love. Benio's best friends are the beautiful Tamaki (voiced by: Rihoko Yoshida), who is much more feminine than Benio but equally interested in women's rights, and Ranmaru (voiced by: Kazuko Sugiyama), a young man who was raised to play female roles in the kabuki theater and as a result has acquired very effeminate mannerisms.|$|R

Catherine de' Medici, queen of France, had stayed with Felice {{for a short period of}} time as a young child, and later wrote a letter thanking Felice for the care she had received. Though this letter was written long before Catherine became an important figure, Felice’s good reputation can be discerned from the letter Catherine wrote to her. Another figure Felice corresponded with was Pope Leo X, who succeeded Felice's father as pope. <b>Her</b> reputation among <b>high-ranking</b> figures is reflected through her business dealings with Leo X and her hosting of him and his guests at her residence.

5000|$|A {{subordinate}} of Zess, Cleo is a 12-year-old mech {{pilot who}} looks like a teenager; her friend Lee used to make fun of her for being extremely developed for her age. She's a quick learner, but despite this she is very clumsy and somewhat a slow thinker with some subjects. She says her positive skills are cooking, laundry, and keeping watch without even getting tired. She graduated from military school after two years, when it ordinarily takes six years. When Cleo learns that Lee was killed in battle, Cleo believes Rygart killed her (unaware that Lee committed suicide) and initially wants to kill him. Afterward, she meets Rygart in battle and shows a surprising amount of skill contrary to how she was before, almost defeating Rygart. She is defeated shortly after securing Zess's escape and taken prisoner, where she was treated very leniently and shared a room with Sigyn. She initially tried to escape by securing Sigyn's gun and attempting to kill Rygart, but fails because the gun actually had no ammo. She befriends Sigyn and no longer tries to escape afterward. Later, she is released in a hostage exchange for Rygart and his squad. Her family has been serving the Athens military for three generations, with her grandmother a retired mech pilot who is now an Athens military academy instructor and <b>her</b> mother, a <b>high-ranking</b> officer in the Athens military.|$|R
500|$|Although Lebrón was {{a member}} of the Liberal Party from a young age, she didn't display any {{interest}} in politics. However, her posture changed after March 21, 1937, when a group of militants from the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party were killed during a peaceful protest which became known as the Ponce massacre. [...] Lebrón who was eighteen years old at the time, developed a nationalistic ideology following this event. [...] During this timeframe, Lebrón had a relationship with a local engineer, following the advice of her family. When she was twenty-one years old she gave birth to her first daughter Gladys, who was left in Rafaela Luciano's custody after Lebrón was separated from her husband and moved to New York City. [...] After she arrived in New York City, she started to experience problems finding employment, mostly because she did not fully understand English. [...] Lebrón worked as a seamstress in several factories. She was fired from some of her jobs because she was considered a [...] "rebel by her bosses" [...] after she protested [...] against the discrimination which she witnessed against Puerto Rican workers. This influenced her nationalistic views even further and she eventually established contact with members of the Puerto Rican Liberation Movement. She enrolled at George Washington College, where she studied for two years during her free time from work. She married again when she was twenty-two years old and gave birth to her second child, whom she would send to Puerto Rico to live with her mother, a year later. [...] Lebrón decided to divorce her husband because she felt that he was oppressing her. In 1943, there was a massive migration of Puerto Ricans from Puerto Rico to New York, composed mostly of jibaros seeking employment. Lebrón grew increasingly frustrated when she observed how they were forced to live in poverty and under social decadence and she increased her work within nationalist circles. In 1946, she formally became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, following the advice of a friend. During this time she developed an admiration for the Party's president Pedro Albizu Campos, studying and memorizing his biography and ideals. [...] After joining the party, Lebrón inadvertently included some of her own initiatives within the organization's ideals, these were influenced by [...] socialist and feminist ideals. [...] Seeking more involvement in society and politics for women, new economic systems and social reforms that would protect women and children. Her constant involvement in the party's affairs earned <b>her</b> several <b>high-ranking</b> positions, among them those of secretary, vice-president, and executive delegate of its delegation in New York.|$|R
