[...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not afraid to do that. We'll hit someone if <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> bit of discourse going," [...] said McDermott.|$|E

He said, [...] "There's a little bit of rivalry building up between [...] Fatboy can tell that AJ likes Denise. But at , AJ puts a [...] on for Denise, and it's just totally wrong. [...] Fatboy takes over and [...] <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> big response." [...] Inside Soap said that AJ does not know what makes Denise tick, while Sharma said [...] "Denise isn't a big fan of AJ at the moment!" [...] In 2013, Inside Soap said they expected to see AJ paired with Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), saying, [...] "He's been trying his luck for some time, and surely there's only so long Bianca can fend off AJ. If nothing else, he'd be lots of fun around her kids, as AJ isn't the most mature fella in Albert Square." [...] Vicky Prior from the Metro also hoped to see AJ find romance with Bianca.|$|E
500|$|James Poniewozik of Time observed, [...] "NBC's public {{troubles}} {{have been}} 30 Rocks greatest blessing this season, providing it with satiric fodder from The Jay Leno Show to the Comcast acquisition. The show {{may not be}} the best sitcom on TV now, but it's definitely the best work of NBC-criticism." [...] In regards to the main plot, he said it [...] "could have done even more with the premise of the Jaypocalypse re-enacted with janitors, but <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> lot of credit for the inspired idea." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning gave the episode an 8.3 out of 10 rating, writing that the janitor plot [...] "came at a perfect time" [...] in regards to the Leno and O'Brien controversy. He, however, did not like the other two plots, noting they were [...] "less impressive". Meredith Blake from the Los Angeles Times said that the Khonani and Subhas plot was [...] "supremely clever and self-referential", and that the show's take on it was [...] "decidedly neutral, albeit very funny".|$|E

500|$|Todd Martens {{from the}} Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Celebration" [...] {{works as a}} throwaway, midsummer dance pop number. However, {{he felt that the}} song had modest goals, [...] "at least by Madonna's standards. Even when <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> bit risque [...] silliness rules the day. She invites us 'to the dance of life,' and coasts over the chorus." [...] He went on to add that the song [...] "is an {{effective}} look back, a gliding, reassuring number that she [...] hasn't forgotten her beginning. But rather than instill a sense of nostalgia, everything feels a bit obligatory. The sound of an artist, hopefully, ready for the next chapter." [...] Michael Slezak from Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "unapologetically dance-y" [...] but felt [...] "disappointed that lyrically, Madonna seems to be revisiting the 'Party! Get on the floor!' theme for the umpteenth time without even the slightest bit of linguistic flair." [...] Chris Williams from Billboard said that [...] "Madonna's latest single won't start any new trends, but it does return the singer to her dance-floor roots." [...] It further added that [...] "'Celebration' [...] a score for Madonna's retro-futuristic fan base and a nice bookend to her collection of chart glories." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{favored the}} songs accompanying music video, in particular Scherzinger's intricate choreography. On {{the day the}} video premiered, a reviewer from Rap-Up wrote [...] "It’s getting hot in here," [...] referencing Scherzinger's [...] "smokin’ body" [...] and [...] "steamy visuals". Staff of Idolator spoke favorably of Scherzinger's choreography, stating that it [...] "would make the other Pussycat Dolls blush". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the video a positive review stating that she was impressed of Scherzinger's athletic and acrobatic methods of dancing. She continued, [...] "she doesn’t even {{have to try and}} be sexy; she just is". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy appreciated Scherzinger's writhing around on the floor in [...] "somewhat compromising positions" [...] and added that Scherzinger is wet for about 50 percent of the video, so [...] "we're guessing guys across the country aren't going to be writing complaint letters anytime soon." [...] Sophie Forbes of Daily Mail positively stated [...] "Clutching a net round her body, she looked sensational in her taupe two piece as she stared wistfully off into the distance." [...] David Griffiths of 4Music positively reviewed the song's music video stating it [...] "featur some jaw-droppingly good dancing, a hair flick or two and some serious thrusting, <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> big thumbs up from us." [...] "Wet" [...] ranked at number 70 on MTV's most watched music videos of 2011.|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took a little time to grow on me. I liked it better on the show than when I heard it by itself, which is weird because it's exactly the same thing. Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a sucker for a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad I felt for Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'. I'm sure they could one day, but this one fell a bit short for me musically. [...] In the context of the show, however, it was a great moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|For many years, John Elway was bitter, on both a {{personal}} level and {{on behalf of his}} team, about the touchdown being allowed: [...] "This was an insult to college football... They [...] ruined my last game as a college football player." [...] The Play cost Stanford an invitation to the Hall of Fame Classic, in addition to a winning season, and Elway completed his college career having never played in a bowl game. Geiger said that the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy. Elway would nevertheless enjoy a tremendously successful NFL career, winning two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos, and was inducted into the Pro Football and College Football Halls of Fame. Years later, Elway came to terms with The Play, stating that [...] "each year <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> little funnier." ...|$|E
2500|$|If a pawn {{reaches the}} furthest rank, <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> second {{opportunity}} to promote on a non-capture. (This {{is because the}} pawn can never leave the zone, {{and there is a}} legitimate reason to defer its promotion: a pawn can stand between two protected lions without allowing either player to trade them, which is something a promoted pawn – a gold general – cannot do.) No such exception exists or is needed for lances (the only other piece with no backward moves) as there is never any reason to defer promotion of a lance in the first place: therefore, a lance that reaches the furthest rank without promoting becomes an immobile [...] "dead piece" [...] (死に駒). This last-rank promotion of pawns can likewise be declined, leaving the pawn as an immobile [...] "dead piece". (Unlike for lances, this might still be done with reason, again because of the lion-trading rules.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s, Lavalle was a {{frequent}} critic of soccer, including the 1994 FIFA World Cup. [...] Before the event, Lavalle's surveys had claimed that soccer was less popular than sports like college wrestling, log rolling, skeet shooting and dog racing, and that the World Cup organizers had botched the event. [...] Afterwards, the New York and LA Times quoted Lavalle as saying [...] "for World Cup soccer worldwide, the World Cup gets a grade A; for staging of the World Cup in America, <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> grade A. But {{for the future of}} soccer in America, the grade is incomplete. If you want a prediction, it seems like the term paper will be turned in and it will get a failing grade. To say that it will ever be on par with hockey or golf or even wrestling is way off the mark." [...] About the launch of Major League Soccer, Lavalle was quoted as saying in 1994 [...] "There is no chance it will survive. [...] Absolutely no chance whatsoever." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, {{he started}} {{attending}} Stanford University, {{where he played}} football and baseball. In his senior season in 1982, Stanford was 5-5 and needed to win its final game, the Big Game against California, to secure {{an invitation to the}} Hall of Fame Classic bowl game. With two minutes remaining in the game, Stanford was down 19-17 and had 4th-and-17 on their own 13-yard line. Elway completed a 29-yard pass and drove the ball downfield to the 35-yard line, where Mark Harmon kicked {{what appeared to be the}} winning field goal. However, the clock had four seconds remaining, so Stanford had to kick off. What followed is now simply known as [...] "The Play", in which Cal players lateraled the ball, rugby-style, five times – two of them controversial – and scored a touchdown to win the game, 25-20. Elway was bitter about the game afterward, stating that the officials [...] "ruined my last game as a college football player." [...] Stanford athletics director Andy Geiger said the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy.

2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, {{who are used to}} show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher, Jules Tavernier, Marge Green, Nellie Ellis, Jim Branning, Charlie Slater, Mo Harris, Patrick Trueman, Cora Cross, Les Coker, Rose Cotton, Pam Coker, Stan Carter, Babe Smith, Claudette Hubbard, Sylvie Carter, Ted Murray and Joyce Murray. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, but I think you need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> bit thin and inexperienced.
