5|$|In {{addition}} to {{the evidence of the}} Chronicle that Æthelberht was accorded the title of bretwalda, there is evidence of his domination <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, Æthelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Sæberht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was Æthelberht, and not Sæberht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes Æthelberht as Sæberht's overlord.|$|E

5|$|Tekno Team 2000 {{made their}} WWF debut during a house show at Madison Square Garden on March 19, 1995. They {{defeated}} The Heavenly Bodies (Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray) and repeated the result {{the following night}} at Boston Garden. Their WWF television debut {{took place on the}} May 27, 1995 episode of WWF Superstars; they defeated Barry Horowitz and the Brooklyn Brawler. They were booked to appear in a series of matches against The Heavenly Bodies. Del Ray was not able to appear <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matches, so he was replaced by Mantaur and Barry Horowitz <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matches. Tekno Team 2000 won all of the matches in this series. The WWF teased a storyline in which Tekno Team 2000 was being scouted by Ted DiBiase to join the Million Dollar Corporation, but they did not join the group. Their success led Pro Wrestling Illustrated to rank them among the top ten tag teams in the world.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial Gift was the {{donation}} of aircraft from British surplus stocks after the First World War to the Dominions: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Empire of India.

5|$|The first {{clinical}} study of psilocybin {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1970—led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona {{and supported by the}} Heffter Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies—studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E
5|$|The {{greylag goose}} (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians at least 3000 years ago, and a {{different}} wild species, the swan goose (Anser cygnoides), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, {{is known as a}} Chinese goose. The two hybridise with each other and the large knob {{at the base of the}} beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese goose, is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks.|$|E
5|$|After {{garrison}} duty at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, {{the regiment}} {{served with the}} Coast Division commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside. The Coast Division was deployed in January 1862 for operations {{on the coast of}} North Carolina, and participated in the Battle of Roanoke Island and the Battle of New Bern among other engagements. Burnside's division was recalled to Virginia in July 1862. The 21st Massachusetts was then attached to the Army of the Potomac and participated <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest battles of the Civil War, including the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. The most devastating engagement of the war for the 21st was the Battle of Chantilly, fought on September 1, 1862, during which the unit suffered 35 percent casualties. From March 1863 to January 1864, the 21st served with Burnside in the Department of the Ohio, seeing action in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee. In May 1864, the regiment rejoined the Army of the Potomac, participating in Lt. Gen. Ulysses Grant's Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. The regiment was a favorite of Clara Barton, the famed battlefield nurse, who was also from Worcester County, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in the seventeen-year-old Anastasia. In 1998, when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7inches was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga. However, the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing. Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skeletons, the Russian scientists' assertion that Anastasia's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists.|$|E
5|$|Exquemelin {{wrote that}} Morgan's men {{undertook}} widespread torture <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towns they captured. According to Stephen Snelders, in {{his history of}} piracy, the Spanish reports of Morgan's raids do not refer to torture being practiced on the residents of Porto Bello or Gibraltar – although there are reliable reports that it {{was carried out in}} Panama. The historian Patrick Pringle observes that while torture seems cruel and ruthless to contemporary eyes, it was an accepted part of judicial interrogation in many European countries at the time. Morgan always fought with a commission from the governor of Jamaica. In doing so, he was acting as a reserve naval force for the English government in the defence of Jamaica. As the Spanish did not recognise privateering as a legal activity, even if a captain carried letters of marque, they considered Morgan to be a pirate, something he firmly rejected.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Western Australia state government allocated relief funds to offset the cost of recovery and clean-up <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected towns. Individuals and families became eligible to apply for personal grants and small business owners would be considered for special interest rates on new loans. Local government entities listed under the proclamation were the shires of Ashburton, Broome, East Pilbara, Meekatharra, and the Town of Port Hedland. Disaster assistance money in these jurisdictions would be used to restore public assets and infrastructure impaired by the storm. The name Lua was later retired from the cyclical list of tropical cyclone names due to the system's adverse effects on land and was replaced by the name Luana.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{fell into}} an {{economic}} slump during the 1920s, resulting <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mining communities being closed. By the 1930s only Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani and the Soviet state-owned Arktikugol were left, {{which led to}} a bilateralization of politics. The archipelago was evacuated during the Second World War and the major settlements leveled by Germany during Operation Zitronella. The Soviet Union proposed in 1944 that Svalbard become a condominium under joint Norwegian and Soviet rule, except for Bjørnøya, which would be transferred to the Soviet Union. Although the proposal was discussed in Norway, it was ultimately rejected in 1947. The Norwegian and Russian communities were largely built independent of each other and each had their own infrastructure, such as postal service, radio stations and transport. The Norwegian population stabilized at about 1,000 people, while there were about twice as many Soviets.|$|E

5|$|The Bayan {{class was}} a group of four armored cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy around the {{beginning}} of the 20th century. Two of the ships were built in France, as Russian shipyards had no spare capacity. The lead ship, , was built several years earlier than the later three. The ship participated <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, and provided naval gunfire support for the Imperial Russian Army until she struck a mine. Bayan was trapped in harbor during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur, and was sunk by Japanese artillery. She was salvaged and put into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy with the name of Aso. She mostly served as a training ship before she was converted into a minelayer in 1920. The ship was sunk as a target in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The Ten Commandments are {{a series}} of {{religious}} and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation <b>in</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism. As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and {{serve as the basis for}} Catholic social justice. A review of the Commandments is one of the most common types of examination of conscience used by Catholics before receiving the sacrament of Penance.|$|E
