5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
25|$|In {{criminal}} law, {{a conspiracy}} is {{an agreement between}} two or more persons {{to commit a crime}} at some time in the future. Criminal law in some countries or for some conspiracies may require that at least one overt act must also have been undertaken in furtherance of that agreement, to constitute an offense. There is no limit on the number participating in the conspiracy and, in most countries, no requirement that any steps have been taken to put the plan into effect (compare attempts which require proximity to the full offence). For the purposes of concurrence, the actus reus is a continuing one and parties may join the plot later and incur <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> and conspiracy can be charged where the co-conspirators have been acquitted or cannot be traced. Finally, repentance by one or more parties does not affect liability – unless, in some cases, it occurs before the parties have committed overt acts – but may reduce their sentence.|$|E

50|$|The {{absolute}} effect {{means that}} one juristic act affects all joint several debtors {{in the same}} way. For example, the creditor can demand the obligation in full amount from either party. The performance from one several liability debtor affects also the others and the creditor cannot refuse it without being in default. In this case the creditor will be in default towards all <b>joint</b> several <b>liability</b> debtors.The autonomy of the different obligations undertaken by the <b>joint</b> several <b>liability</b> debtors {{is the reason for}} one juristic act that affects some of the obligations not have any effect on the others. This hypothesis is described by the term “relative effect of the joint several liability”. The obligations of the joint several debtors might have different due dates. As a rule the default of the debtor worsens his financial situation. That is why the default of one of the <b>joint</b> several <b>liability</b> debtors does not have any harmful consequences for the others. Another rule that can describe the relative effect of the <b>joint</b> several <b>liability</b> is that when the performance becomes impossible and only one of the debtors is responsible for that, the creditor may claim from the latter full damages. The limitation period also have a relative effect.If one of the <b>joint</b> several <b>liability</b> debtors to have performed in full amount to the creditor for him to have a regress claim against his co-debtors but only for him to have paid more than his share.|$|R
50|$|For instance, U.S. {{maritime}} law recognizes {{the concept of}} <b>joint</b> and several <b>liability</b> among tortfeasors, while many states do not.

60|$|Nevitt's behaviour, {{to say the}} truth, wasn't {{quite so}} black as Guy Waring painted it. He had gone off with the extra three {{thousand}} in his pocket, to be sure; but he didn't intend to appropriate it outright to his own uses. He merely meant to give Guy a thoroughly good fright, as it wasn't really necessary the call should be met for another fortnight; and then, as soon as he'd found out the truth about Colonel Kelmscott and his unacknowledged sons, he proposed to use {{his knowledge of the}} forgery as a lever with Guy, so as to force him to come to advantageous terms with his supposed father. Nevitt's idea was that Guy and Cyril should drive a hard bargain on their own account with the Colonel, and that he himself should then receive a handsome commission on the transaction from both the brothers, under penalty of disclosing the true facts about the cheque by whose aid Guy had met their <b>joint</b> <b>liability</b> to the Rio Negro Diamond Mines.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} a framework for such interpretation {{and implementation of the}} new innocent spouse laws.

The article then examines the tax rationales that have traditionally been offered for imposing <b>joint</b> and several <b>liability.</b> The author concludes that because the fiction of marital unity is deeply embedded in our tax system, <b>joint</b> and several <b>liability</b> for married <b>joint</b> filers is likely to remain the law. While it can sometimes promote legitimate goals of fairness and efficiency, as an examination of <b>joint</b> and several <b>liability</b> in tort, agency and fraudulent conveyance law reveals, it can also produce unjust or irrational results.
