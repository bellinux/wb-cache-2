5|$|Kershaw had a 41 inning {{scoreless}} inning streak {{that ended}} {{in the top of}} the sixth inning on July 10 when, with two outs, Chase Headley <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history. He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in a row. He was 4–0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in a row he had reached that number, trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|E
50|$|In {{the top of}} the ninth, Hamilton hit another solo {{home run}} off Yankees {{reliever}} Sergio Mitre which tied the ALCS home run records. Guerrero followed up with an infield single. Cruz then <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> to make the score 10-3.|$|E
50|$|In {{the ninth}} inning, Biittner walked the Expos' Dave Cash and then retired Chris Speier. Then, Ellis Valentine <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> {{to make the}} game 16-2. Biittner then gave up two more singles and served up a third home run to Andre Dawson.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Gentry batted [...]304, {{a career}} high. He also hit his first outside-the-park home run, a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> in Toronto on April 30. Gentry pitched the final inning of a 12-1 loss {{at the hands}} of the Oakland Athletics on June 4. He allowed two runs on three hits and a walk.|$|R
50|$|Florida did {{not give}} up {{in the bottom of}} the seventh, {{beginning}} their rally with a walk for Aja Paculba. Bruder doubled to put them both in scoring position, and with one out, Francesca Enea hit a 3-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> center, shrinking Alabama's lead to two. After Brooks and Bush consecutively walked, Hilberth struck out, and Michelle Moultrie hit a fly to deep right that was about five feet from going out of the park.|$|R
50|$|With the Series tied at {{one game}} apiece, John Smoltz faced off against the Pirates' twenty-game winner, John Smiley. Orlando Merced hit Smoltz's first pitch {{over the right}} field wall for a home run and a 1-0 lead. But the Braves rallied with four runs {{in the bottom of}} the first, topped off by Greg Olson's two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> Smiley was gone by the third inning with the Braves leading, 6-1. In the seventh, with the score 7-3, Alejandro Peña struck out Jay Bell with the bases loaded to end the Pirates' last threat. Ultimately, the Braves won 10-3 with home runs from Ron Gant, Greg Olson, and Sid Bream.|$|R
50|$|He {{also hit}} {{the first of}} his three career walk-off home runs in 1993. The Angels trailed the Minnesota Twins 3-2 {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning with Salmon on base and one out. Pérez <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field off Twins {{reliever}} Rick Aguilera for a 4-3 Angels win.|$|E
50|$|The NL {{got off to}} a {{quick start}} against Chris Sale when Kris Bryant homered {{in the top of the}} first to give the NL a 1-0 lead. In the bottom of the second inning, the AL got to Johnny Cueto when Eric Hosmer <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> to tie the game. Two batters later, Salvador Pérez hit a two-run shot to give the AL a 3-1 lead.|$|E
50|$|The Gators {{bounced back}} from their first loss of the season, scoring 11 runs in 6 innings. The first scoring of the day {{happened}} {{in the top of}} the third when Kim Waleszonia, Aja Paculba, and Ali Gardiner had back-to-back-to-back singles, the third of which scored Waleszonia. Two innings later, Megan Bush took a lead-off walk, was moved over to 2nd on a sacrifice bunt by Michelle Moultrie and to 3rd on a groundout by Waleszonia. All the small ball proved unnecessary as Paculba <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field, increasing Florida's lead to 3.|$|E
5000|$|A {{line drive}} single by Julio Franco {{in the fifth}} inning broke a 3-3 tie Cleveland {{defeated}} Cincinnati to win the final Ohio Cup in [...] Manny Ramírez had given Cleveland a 3-1 lead with a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field in the second off the Reds' Mark Portugal. Hal Morris drove in two runs for the Reds with a first-inning single and a double in the third, with Bret Boone scoring both times. A single by Vince Coleman in the fifth drove in Jeff Branson and tied the score at 3-3. The victory gave the Indians a 6-2 lead in the Ohio Cup series and was viewed by 16,697 people, the largest crowd in the game's history and the second largest at Cooper Stadium. Indians starter Joe Roa was the winning pitcher.|$|R
25|$|González got off {{to strong}} start, quickly {{retiring}} the Cubs in order {{in the top of}} the first with two strikeouts. With two outs in the bottom of the first, third baseman Anthony Rendon hit a solo home run into the Nationals′ bullpen in right field to give the Nats their first run and first lead of the series, but Cubs catcher Willson Contreras responded with a towering leadoff <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> {{in the top of the}} second to tie the game at 1-1. González then kept the Cubs off the bases until the top of the fourth inning, when third baseman Kris Bryant led off with a double and first baseman Anthony Rizzo followed immediately with a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> right to give Chicago a 3–1 lead, becoming the Cubs' career leader in postseason homers (with six) and in postseason RBIs (with 16). González left the game after five innings, having given up three earned runs on three hits and two walks while striking out six Cubs.|$|R
50|$|Florida started badly when Megan Bush {{committed}} {{an error}} on a hard-hit grounder, allowing the runner to reach. Then, with two outs, starting pitcher Stephanie Brombacher walked clean-up hitter Jessica Spigner. The next batter scored Tennessee's first {{run on a}} single, which also moved the other runner to third. After a double from right fielder Erin Webb scored both runners and a walk, Brombacher forced a pop-up to Bush for the third out. With Tennessee leading 3-0, the Gator offense put Florida back on top. Aja Paculba led off with a double <b>to</b> <b>left</b> center, and after a groundout from Kristina Hilberth moved Paculba to third, Ali Gardiner brought the Gators back to within one with a <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> With two outs, Kelsey Bruder was hit on the helmet with a pitch. Corrie Brooks brought her home with a triple, and Brooks gave Florida the lead with an RBI single from Bush.|$|R
50|$|In {{their opening}} {{game of the}} Cox Invitational, Florida uncharacteristically allowed five earned runs, but still {{managed to get the}} win. Corrie Brooks started off the scoring slowly with a solo shot {{in the top of the}} second inning. Three more came in the third off the bat of Kelsey Bruder, who <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> {{bringing}} home Francesca Enea and Tiffany DeFelice, who both singled. They'd add one more an inning later after Kim Waleszonia was hit by a pitch with one out. Waleszonia stole second and Enea got the RBI on a single to left.|$|E
50|$|Nine {{walks in}} {{fewer than five}} innings proved the undoing of Rex Barney in this start for Brooklyn. A pair of walks and RBI single by {{opposing}} pitcher Spec Shea in the fourth put the Yankees up 1-0. Joe DiMaggio <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> in the fifth. That was all the runs the visiting Yanks would get at Ebbets Field, but this was Shea's stadium this day. A hit by Jackie Robinson in the sixth scored Al Gionfriddo to pull the Dodgers within 2-1. Then in the ninth, after a Bruce Edwards leadoff single and sacrifice bunt by Carl Furillo, the tying run died on base. Shea got Spider Jorgensen on a fly to right, and with Brooklyn's fans on their feet, pinch-hitter Cookie Lavagetto struck out.|$|E
50|$|June saw a turn in {{play for}} the Yankees, as they won seven {{straight}} to begin the month of June. In the month, various achievements were reached. Alex Rodriguez hit his 3000th career hit at home on June 19, hitting a home run to right field off from Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. The achievement was similar to Derek Jeter's 3000th hit in 2011, when he <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> off from Tampa Bay Rays pitcher David Price. Price and Verlander happen to both be winners of the Cy Young Award. Ironically, Price and Verlander were both members of the Tigers organization the date of Rodriguez's 3000th hit. A few weeks later, Rodriguez was given the ball back from Zack Hample, the fan who caught it.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 December 2011 - Jonathan Sedgwick, acting Chief Executive, UKBA, {{in charge}} after Lin <b>Homer</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> become Permanent Secretary at the Department for Transport {{and before the}} {{appointment}} of Rob Whiteman. On the same day, the Committee published some written evidence submitted by Brodie Clark.|$|R
50|$|Florida sailed {{in their}} NCAA Tournament opener against Florida A&M. Stephanie Brombacher threw a two-hit, five-inning shutout and the Gator offense hit three home runs. In {{the bottom of}} the first, Aja Paculba led off with a home run, Kristina Hilberth {{followed}} up with a high chopper up the middle, and Ali Gardiner walked. With one out, Kelsey Bruder hit an RBI double that moved Gardiner to third. A sacrifice fly from Corrie Brooks scored her but left Bruder at second. Megan Bush brought her home in the following at-bat with the Gators' second home run of the game, upping the Florida lead to five. The second inning was more of the same; with Paculba (walk), Hilberth (single), and Gardiner (walk) all on base, Florida's all-time RBI leader got two more with a single to center field. Brooks cleared the bases two batters later on a <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> center, increasing the lead to 10. The final scores for Florida came on Paculba's two RBI single that brought home Bush, who was on third after a walk, and Kim Waleszonia, who was on second after a double.|$|R
50|$|Facing {{elimination}} and {{the last}} game at Wrigley Field for the season, the Cubs sent ace Jon Lester to the mound while the Indians countered with Trevor Bauer. Lester surrendered a second inning <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> José Ramírez as the Cubs fell behind 1-0. However, Kris Bryant answered in the fourth, <b>homering</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> lead off the inning. Anthony Rizzo doubled following Bryant's homer and Ben Zobrist singled. Addison Russell followed with an infield single to score Rizzo and put the Cubs up 2-1. Following a Jason Heyward strikeout, Javier Báez singled on a bunt to load the bases with one out. David Ross hit a sacrifice fly to score Zobrist, but Lester struck out to end the inning. Bauer {{was removed from the}} game after pitching four innings, but the Cubs could do no further damage. Leading 3-1, Lester allowed a run in the sixth following a single and stolen base by Rajai Davis and a Francisco Lindor single. Lester was lifted with the 3-2 lead after six innings. Carl Edwards Jr. replaced Lester in the seventh and gave up a single. Following a flyout, Cub manager Joe Maddon went to closer Aroldis Chapman for an eight-out save. Chapman closed out the seventh and gave up a single to Davis in the eighth. Davis stole second and third, but Chapman stranded him there. In the ninth, Chapman retired the side, striking out José Ramírez to end the game and extend the series to a Game 6 in Cleveland.|$|R
50|$|Derek Lowe and Cole Hamels {{faced each}} other at Citizens Bank Park for Game 1. In the first inning, Manny Ramírez missed a home run by mere feet to center field and settled for an RBI double to give LA a 1-0 lead, {{and later in the}} fourth, Matt Kemp scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Blake DeWitt. However, in the sixth inning, as Lowe was rolling, a throwing error by Dodgers shortstop Rafael Furcal put Shane Victorino on second base, apparently breaking the momentum for Lowe, who on the next pitch surrendered a home run to Chase Utley that tied the score. After a Ryan Howard groundout, Pat Burrell <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> and put the Phillies out front 3-2, and that would prove to be the final score. Brad Lidge tossed a perfect ninth for the save.|$|E
50|$|Kershaw had a 41 inning {{scoreless}} inning streak {{that ended}} {{in the top of}} the sixth inning on July 10 when, with two outs, Chase Headley <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field at Dodger Stadium. Kershaw's streak was, at the time, tied for the fifteenth longest scoreless inning streak in MLB history. He won the pitcher of the month award again in July, the third Dodger (along with Don Sutton and Burt Hooton) to win it two months in a row. He was 4-0 with a 1.10 ERA in the month with 48 strikeouts and only 10 walks. He picked up his 200th strikeout of the season on September 2, the fifth year in a row he had reached that number, trailing only the six seasons in a row for Sandy Koufax among Dodger starters. He also became just the fourth pitcher since 1893 to have at least five 200-strikeout seasons through an age-26 season (Bert Blyleven, Walter Johnson and Sam McDowell are the others).|$|E
5000|$|One {{night after}} {{becoming}} a father, Bret Saberhagen tossed a five-hitter and the Royals {{became the first}} team to ever rally from a three games to one deficit twice in the same postseason to win the World Series. They also were {{the first team to}} lose the first two games at home and rally to win the Series. Saberhagen got all the offense he needed when Darryl Motley <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> off John Tudor in the second inning, after a walk to Steve Balboni. In the third, Lonnie Smith led off with a walk, and with one out George Brett hit an accidental infield single. After a double steal, Tudor issued walks to Frank White and Jim Sundberg, making it 3-0. Tudor was replaced with Bill Campbell after only [...] innings. Balboni singled to left off Campbell for two runs to make it 5-0. Tudor walked four and was charged with all five runs. In the dugout, he angrily punched an electrical fan, cutting his pitching hand.|$|E
50|$|The A's {{took another}} early {{lead on the}} Tigers, when Coco Crisp led off {{the game with a}} triple off Doug Fister and scored on a Jed Lowrie single. The A's {{extended}} the lead to 3-0 {{in the top of the}} fifth, when Lowrie hit a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> right field. It looked like the Tiger hitters, who had struggled to put up runs all series long, were on their way to another frustrating evening when starter Dan Straily no-hit them through the first four innings. But Prince Fielder led off the bottom of the fifth with a bloop single <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> Victor Martínez grounded a single to right, and Jhonny Peralta followed with a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> tie the game. Tiger manager Jim Leyland went to Game 1 starter Max Scherzer as a reliever in the top of the seventh, and Oakland promptly went up 4-3 when Coco Crisp drove in Stephen Vogt with a single. On a controversial play, the Tigers managed to tie the game in the bottom of the inning, when Victor Martínez hit the ball to the right-center field wall and a fan reached into the field of play and disrupted its trajectory. The call on the field was a home run for Martínez. Umpires reviewed the play because the fan had clearly interfered with the path of the ball, but they let the home run stand after concluding that there was not enough video evidence to determine if right fielder Josh Reddick would have made a leaping catch. Later in the inning, Austin Jackson gave the Tigers a 5-4 lead on a broken-bat RBI single that scored pinch runner Andy Dirks. Scherzer nearly gave the lead back when he loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the eighth, but he struck out Reddick and Vogt before getting pinch hitter Alberto Callaspo on a line out to center. The Tigers got three additional runs in the bottom of the inning, when pinch runner Hernán Pérez scored on a bases-loaded wild pitch by Brett Anderson, and Omar Infante followed with a two-run double to make the score 8-4. The A's made it interesting in the top of the ninth, getting the tying run to the plate after a two-run single by Yoenis Céspedes, but Joaquín Benoit struck out Seth Smith to prevent any further damage.|$|R
2500|$|Carl Edwards Jr. came in {{to pitch}} for the Cubs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, which began with pinch-hitter Adam Lind, a veteran who had played 1,344 regular-season games over 12 seasons, {{singling}} in the first postseason appearance of his career. Twenty-year-old Victor Robles, who had just reached the major leagues for the first time on September 7, made his own career postseason debut when he {{came in to}} pinch-run for Lind. After Trea Turner struck out, Bryce Harper, 0-for-3 in the game with two groundouts and a strikeout and seemingly overmatched by Cubs pitching, came to the plate; he had just returned in late September from 42 days on the disabled list and since then had gone 4-for-25 (.160) in the regular season and postseason combined with no extra-base hits, but on a 3-1 pitch from Edwards he <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> right – the fifth home run of his 16-game postseason career – to tie the game at 3-3. Edwards then walked Rendon. Mike Montgomery relieved Edwards, but surrendered a single to Daniel Murphy which advanced Rendon to second. Zimmerman then came up to bat; he had hit only [...]167 against the Cubs during the regular season and his 1-for-6 performance in the division series had dropped his average against the Cubs in 2017 as a whole to [...]144, but he hit a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> giving the Nationals a 6-3 lead. After Montgomery retired the side, Nationals closer Sean Doolittle made his first appearance of the series, and gave up only a single in the top of the ninth on his way to earning the first postseason save of his career. The Nationals evened the series at 1-1.|$|R
5000|$|On July 30, 2012, Morales hit {{two home}} runs in the same inning (once left handed and the other right handed). He became only the third player in MLB history <b>to</b> <b>homer</b> both <b>left</b> and right in the same inning. He {{finished}} the 2012 season with a [...]273 batting average, 22 home runs, and 73 RBI.|$|R
50|$|The Gators got on {{the board}} early when Francesca Enea <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field, also {{bringing}} home Aja Paculba who was walked and Ali Gardiner who singled. Then, in the 2nd, Corrie Brooks doubled, Megan Bush hit a sacrifice bunt to move her to third, and Michelle Moultrie hit a sacrifice fly to left field to bring her home. Center fielder Kim Waleszonia immediately homered, making the game 5-0 in favor of Florida. Two innings later, {{in the bottom of}} 5th, Paculba added to the Gators' home run total, bringing the lead to six. Gardiner was hit by a pitch, Lauren Heil (who was pinch running for Gardiner) stole second, and advanced to third on a throwing error by catcher Courtney Oberg. After Kelsey Bruder was walked, Brooks singled and both she and Bruder advanced an extra base as the Bears attempted, but failed to prevent Heil from scoring. In the bottom of the 6th, Alicia Sisco pinch hit for Moultrie and got her first collegiate hit. Paculba doubled to center field to score Sisco after she advanced to second on a walk of Hilberth. Up by eight, the game ended because of the mercy rule.|$|E
50|$|Another 18-inning contest {{was played}} between the Atlanta Braves and the Houston Astros on October 9, 2005. In the 4th game of a National League Division Series at Minute Maid Park in Houston, the Braves (who were {{trailing}} the series two games {{to one and}} facing elimination) took a 6-1 lead into the 8th inning. A grand slam by Lance Berkman {{in the bottom of}} the 8th brought the score to 6-5, and with two outs {{in the bottom of the}} 9th, Brad Ausmus homered to tie the game and send it to extra innings. The score remained deadlocked at 6-6 until the 18th, when the Astros' Chris Burke (who entered the game in the 9th inning as a pinch runner) <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field to win the game and send Houston to the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Roger Clemens, who was brought in to pinch-hit in the 15th and pitched the last three innings in relief, was credited as the winning pitcher in the 5-hour, 50-minute contest. In a somewhat odd coincidence, Adam LaRoche and Tim Hudson played in both 18 inning games. This one as Atlanta Braves and the other one as opposing sides of one another with Hudson pitching in both games as the visiting team's starting pitcher. It is the longest winner in a potential clinching game in baseball history.|$|E
50|$|Monday, October 13, 2008 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CaliforniaGame 4 was an see-saw {{battle between}} the two teams. The Phillies struck first; {{in the top of}} the first they {{collected}} three hits and two runs off Derek Lowe, who started on three days' rest. In the bottom of the inning, James Loney hit a ball off the center field wall to score Rafael Furcal and cut the lead to 2-1. Starter Joe Blanton began strong, but in the fifth inning gave up two runs and forced Charlie Manuel to go to his bullpen. In the sixth, the Dodgers' bullpen faltered first, when Clayton Kershaw gave up a walk and a hit, and Chan Ho Park threw a wild pitch to tie the game. In the bottom of the sixth, Casey Blake <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> and with two on, a throwing error by Ryan Howard allowed Juan Pierre to score. The inning ended when Chase Utley made a diving catch and stumbled to second base for the double play. Things looked great for the Dodgers until Cory Wade relieved in the eighth and Shane Victorino hit a two-run home run that landed in the LA bullpen to tie the score. Jonathan Broxton came in after Carlos Ruiz singled off of Wade and promptly gave up another two-run homer to pinch-hitter Matt Stairs, the veteran's first career postseason homer. Brad Lidge then came in and pitched his first save of 2008 that consisted of more than three outs, his 49th consecutive save.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, it was James Shields who got {{the start}} against C. J. Wilson. With runners on the corners in the 3rd inning, Shields went to 1st base for a pickoff attempt, but the throw over was errant, {{allowing}} the runner to score from 3rd base. Ian Kinsler launched a solo <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> in the 4th, putting Texas up 2–0. In the 5th, Shields {{was removed from the}} game with two on and one out, being replaced by Chad Qualls to face Michael Young. With a 2–2 count, Young checked his swing on a pitch that was called a ball. The Rays appealed to first base umpire Jerry Meals, but Meals ruled that Young held up in time, drawing the ire of the Rays dugout. Replays showed that Young may not have checked in time, and had the ruling been made that he did not, it would have resulted in a strikeout. Instead, Young went deep to center on the very next pitch for a 3-run home run, putting the Rangers up 5–0. Rays manager Joe Maddon went out to the mound to talk to his pitcher after the home run, but began arguing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf about the check swing, which led to Wolf ejecting Maddon from the game. Texas added another run in the 6th inning, and held the Rays scoreless, winning 6–0 and taking a commanding 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series.|$|R
5000|$|The ALDS {{also set}} the tone for what would be an unusually suspenseful post-season; while their first game was {{considered}} a blow-out, the remaining games saw the White Sox making the most of rare opportunities and hanging on to narrow leads. In the first inning of game 1, the White Sox put up 5 runs, and never looked back. A late inning three-run home run by Scott Podsednik - his first home run of the season, was the icing on the cake in the game 1 blowout. In Game 2, the White Sox were actually down 4-2 when Red Sox second baseman Tony Graffanino, formerly playing for the White Sox, let Juan Uribe's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder go through his legs; one out later, Tadahito Iguchi hit a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> that clinched the game for the White Sox. In Game 3, Orlando Hernández entered the game with the bases loaded and nobody out with the White Sox ahead by only one run {{in the bottom of the}} sixth inning. Based on their regular season performance, it was later calculated that the Red Sox's probability of winning at that point was [...]662, even though they were trailing by one run. Instead, the first two batters, Jason Varitek and Tony Graffanino, both popped out, and Johnny Damon struck out swinging on a breaking ball. Hernandez went on to retire six of the next seven batters, and the White Sox's rookie reliever Bobby Jenks closed out the game.|$|R
50|$|The Royals drew first {{blood in}} a back-and-forth opener that {{featured}} high offensive output from both teams. After hitting just three {{home runs in}} the regular season, Alcides Escobar hit a one out, solo <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> give the Royals a 1-0 lead. Later in the inning, with the bases loaded, Alex Gordon hit a broken bat, looping fly ball that dropped just fair inside the right-field line to plate all three runners. Suddenly, it was 4-0 Kansas City. Baltimore got a run back {{in the bottom of}} the inning on Adam Jones' RBI-single, but it could have been more had it not been for a great diving catch by Gordon in the left-center field gap, robbing Steven Pearce of a hit. In the bottom of the fifth, after the Royals added a run in the top of the frame, the Orioles finally got to James Shields. Nelson Cruz added to his postseason legacy with an RBI-double and Ryan Flaherty delivered a two-run single to make it a one-run game, 5-4. In the sixth, after a walk to Jonathan Schoop and a flare single to right by Nick Markakis, Alejandro De Aza hit a high chopper past the pitcher's mound that shortstop Escobar had no play on; Schoop scored to tie the game. Jones hit what appeared to be a double play ball, but Mike Moustaskas' relay throw short-hopped first baseman Eric Hosmer and the inning continued to bring up Cruz. He could not deliver the big hit this time as he rolled into an inning-ending double play.|$|R
50|$|To {{begin the}} {{historic}} World Series, the teams sent their number one starters {{to the mound}} in Cleveland: Corey Kluber for the Indians and Jon Lester for the Cubs. The Cubs altered their lineup a bit, batting Kyle Schwarber, making his first appearance in six months, as their DH. Things started well for Lester as he retired the first two batters he faced. However, Francisco Lindor singled and stole second with two outs. Lester then walked Mike Napoli and Carlos Santana. With the bases loaded, José Ramírez hit an infield single to drive in a run and Lester hit the next batter, Brandon Guyer, to give the Indians a 2-0 lead. Kluber started hot as well, striking out eight of the first nine batters he faced, a World Series record. In {{the bottom of the}} fourth, Roberto Pérez <b>homered</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> off of Lester increasing the lead. Kluber continued his excellent performance, striking out nine before giving up a double to Ben Zobrist {{in the top of the}} seventh which ended Kluber's night and brought Andrew Miller to the mound. Schwarber walked and Javier Baéz singled to load the bases. However, Miller induced a shallow fly ball by pinch hitter Willson Contreras and struck out Addison Russell and David Ross to end the Cub threat. With Justin Grimm pitching for the Cubs in the bottom of the eighth, the Indians put runners on first and second and Héctor Rondón gave up another home run to Pérez to put the game out of reach 6-0. The win put the Indians up one game and Terry Francona's World Series winning streak reached nine with this victory.|$|E
2500|$|Offensively, in Game 4 the Rays {{picked up}} right where they {{left off the}} {{previous}} day. Carlos Peña tripled to left-center field in the 2nd inning, and scored on an error by Rangers' second baseman Ian Kinsler, who misplayed a pop fly beyond the infield. Evan Longoria, who was inactive {{for the last several}} games of the regular season, had a huge game, starting with a leadoff double in the 4th inning. The next batter was Peña, who hit a double of his own to the opposite field, bringing Longoria home and giving the Rays a 2–0 lead. Later in the inning, another double came off the bat of B. J. Upton, putting the Rays up 3–0. Rangers starter Tommy Hunter did not come out to pitch the 5th inning. Derek Holland was sent in for relief, but Tampa Bay added to their lead when Longoria blasted a 2-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> making it 5–0. Texas had the bases loaded {{in the bottom of the}} 5th, but Rays starter Wade Davis got Vladimir Guererro to swing and miss for a strikeout to end the threat. The Rangers did score in the 6th inning, as Nelson Cruz led off with a home run, and Mitch Moreland hit an RBI double with two outs off of Rays reliever Grant Balfour to make cut the Tampa Bay lead to three runs. It was the only scoring Texas would do in the game, as Rafael Soriano entered the game in the 9th inning and picked up the save. The Rays took the game 5–2 to force a decisive Game 5 back home at the Trop. In Game 5, however Cliff Lee was dominant. [...] He outdueled David Price in a 5–2 victory to help the Rangers advance to their first ever American League Championship Series ...|$|R
50|$|With {{the series}} tied at three games apiece, the Cubs sent regular season ERA leader Kyle Hendricks to the mound. The Indians countered with Corey Kluber, winner of Games 1 and 4. Things started {{well for the}} Cubs as Dexter Fowler led off {{the game with a}} home run to {{straight}} away center to give the Cubs an early 1-0 lead. Hendricks held the Indians scoreless until the third when Coco Crisp doubled, was moved to third on a sacrifice bunt by Roberto Pérez, and scored on a single by Carlos Santana. The Cubs jumped back out in front in the fourth when Kris Bryant singled, Anthony Rizzo was hit by a pitch, and Ben Zobrist forced Rizzo at second. Addison Russell hit a shallow fly ball <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field which allowed Bryant to tag and score to put the Cubs up 2-1. Willson Contreras followed the sacrifice fly with a double to right-center field to score Zobrist and the Cubs were up 3-1. The lead increased in the fifth when Javier Báez homered on the first pitch of the inning to drive Kluber from the game. Andrew Miller, who had dominated the postseason, entered the game. Following a single by Fowler, Kyle Schwarber grounded in to a double play and Miller looked to have escaped the inning. But, Bryant coaxed a walk on a nine-pitch at bat and scored from first on a single to right by Rizzo to make the lead 5-1. Hendricks, who had seemingly settled down, got the first two outs {{in the bottom of the}} fifth, but walked Santana. Cub manager Joe Maddon pulled Hendricks to be replaced by Games 1 and 5 starter, Jon Lester. Lester allowed a dribbler in front of the plate by Jason Kipnis, but David Ross, who had entered the game with Lester and was playing in his final major league game, threw wildly to first allowing runners to advance to second and third. Lester uncorked a wild pitch that bounced off Ross's mask and scored both runners, tightening the lead to 5-3. Ross partially atoned for the error in the sixth with a <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> center field to bring the lead to 6-3. Lester allowed runners in the sixth and the seventh, but held the Indians without a run. In the eighth, after retiring the first two batters, Lester allowed a single up the middle to José Ramírez. Maddon had seen enough and brought Aroldis Chapman, pitching in his third straight game, into the contest. Brandon Guyer promptly doubled to score Ramirez and reduce the lead to two. Rajai Davis then stunned the Cubs by <b>homering</b> <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> tie the game at six. In the ninth, Ross walked and was pinch run for by Chris Coghlan. Jason Heyward grounded into a force play, but then stole second and advanced on a bad throw by Yan Gomes. With two strikes, Báez attempted to bunt, but fouled out. Fowler grounded out to end the threat. Surprisingly, Chapman returned to the mound in the ninth and retired the Indians in order to force extra innings.|$|R
5000|$|... 8:07 p.m. (EDT) at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, CaliforniaHaving used Max Scherzer {{in relief}} during Game 4, Jim Leyland sent Game 2 starter Justin Verlander to the hill. A's manager Bob Melvin also {{chose to go}} with his Game 2 starter, Sonny Gray, who had befuddled the Tigers for eight shutout innings earlier in the series. Gray looked solid again, {{surrendering}} only a walk through the first three innings. Torii Hunter got the Tigers' first hit in the fourth, a one-out single up the middle, then Gray made a mistake on an inside fastball to Miguel Cabrera that the slugger hit for a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> It was Cabrera's first extra-base hit of the series and only his second home run since August. The Tigers got a third run with one out in the sixth inning. With runners on first and third, Omar Infante hit a potential inning-ending double play ball to third off reliever Dan Otero, but Josh Donaldson bounced his throw to second baseman Alberto Callaspo. Callaspo corralled the ball for a force out but had no chance to get Infante at first, and Victor Martínez scored on the play. Verlander, who threw a four-hit shutout in Game 5 of the 2012 ALDS, also in Oakland, was brilliant again. He retired the first 16 Oakland batters before giving up a one-out walk to Josh Reddick in the sixth inning. He lost his no-hit bid with two outs in the seventh, when Yoenis Céspedes hit a hard single to center, but escaped the inning with no damage. Verlander would leave after eight shutout innings, surrendering two hits and one walk, while striking out ten. Closer Joaquín Benoit surrendered a two-out double to Jed Lowrie and hit Céspedes with a pitch to bring the tying run to the plate {{for the second straight}} game. But he got Seth Smith to fly out to short right field, ending the game and the series.|$|R
50|$|The Dodgers {{opened the}} scoring {{in the bottom}} of the third inning. Andrew Toles led off with a single <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> {{advanced}} <b>to</b> second base on a ground out by Hill, then scored with two outs on a Corey Seager single <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field. Yasmani Grandal made the score 3-0 in the fourth with a two-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> right field. The Dodgers tacked on another in the fourth as Justin Turner drilled a solo <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> center field, chasing Arrieta from the game. Hill, meanwhile, pitched six shutout innings, limiting the Cubs to two hits and two walks with six strikeouts on 93 pitches.|$|R
5000|$|Game 5 was a {{pitching}} rematch of Game 1 between former Cy Young Award winners Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum. Down 3-1 in the series, the Rangers needed a win in their ballpark {{to send the}} Series back to San Francisco or the Giants would return home as champions. What resulted was the pitching duel anticipated, but not realized, in Game 1. Both Lee and Lincecum pitched six shutout innings, with Lincecum allowing only two hits and Lee three. In {{the top of the}} seventh inning, Ross and Uríbe singled back to back to put two runners on with none out. The next hitter, Huff, who had never laid down a bunt in his major league career, sacrificed successfully, with only a quick pickup and crisp, accurate throw by Lee to just get Huff at first saved a bases-loaded, nobody out dilemma for Texas. Runners were now at second and third with one out for Burrell, whom Lee struck out after a struggle for the second out, preserving the scoreless tie for the moment. Shortstop Édgar Rentería, who had hit a walk-off single in Game 7 off Cleveland's Charles Nagy to win the 1997 World Series for Jim Leyland and his Florida Marlins in extra innings, now came to the plate. His two years with San Francisco had been considered a major disappointment, marred by injuries and slumps, but here in the World Series he became an unlikely hero by launching a three-run <b>homer</b> <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> After Nelson Cruz answered with a solo homer in the seventh, Lincecum shut the door on the Rangers, giving up just three hits and striking out ten in eight innings of work. Brian Wilson then retired the side in order in the ninth for the Series-winning save and first-time baseball world championships not just for the Giants (for the first time in 56 years) but for San Francisco, since the Giants' five other world championships were won in New York (in 1905, 1921, 1922, 1933 & 1954). Rentería was named World Series MVP for hitting [...]412 with two home runs (including the Series winner) and six RBI. It was Bochy's first world championship as a player or manager, having played as a second-string catcher for eight years and having managed the Padres and Giants for sixteen.|$|R
