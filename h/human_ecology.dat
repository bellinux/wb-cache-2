5|$|The {{ecological}} complexities {{human beings}} are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene. The unique set of circumstances has generated {{the need for a}} new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon, but moves beyond the field of <b>human</b> <b>ecology.</b> Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life-supporting functions they sustain. In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems, there has been a surge of interest in social-natural capital, which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services. Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world. Ecosystems relate importantly to <b>human</b> <b>ecology</b> as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity, and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to point}} out some {{problems}} of <b>human</b> behavioral <b>ecology</b> referring to its historical development, and tries to partially defend its methodology. The origin of <b>human</b> behavioral <b>ecology</b> lies in <b>human</b> sociobiology initially led by R. Alexander and some anthropologists from the 1970 s to the 1980 s; subsequently, these studies were criticized by Kitcher and others. I argue that because of its origin and inheritance {{from some of the}} assumptions from human sociobiology, the characterization of <b>human</b> behavioral <b>ecology</b> by Smith and Winterhalder in the 1990 s, which is still relatively prevalent, does not overcome the criticisms by Kitcher and others. Next, however, I try to defend the use of optimality models in <b>human</b> behavioral <b>ecology</b> as a kind of heuristics...|$|R
50|$|<b>Human</b> {{behavioral}} <b>ecology</b> (HBE) or <b>human</b> evolutionary <b>ecology</b> {{applies the}} principles of evolutionary theory and optimization {{to the study of}} human behavioral and cultural diversity. HBE examines the adaptive design of traits, behaviors, and life histories of humans in an ecological context. One aim of modern <b>human</b> behavioral <b>ecology</b> is to determine how ecological and social factors influence and shape behavioral flexibility within and between human populations. Among other things, HBE attempts to explain variation in human behavior as adaptive solutions to the competing life-history demands of growth, development, reproduction, parental care, and mate acquisition.|$|R
5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to <b>human</b> <b>ecology</b> and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, the Legislature placed all state-funded higher {{education}} {{into the new}} State University of New York (SUNY). Cornell's four statutory colleges (agriculture, <b>human</b> <b>ecology,</b> labor relations and veterinary medicine) have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception, but {{did not have any}} such state affiliation prior to that time. Statutory college employees legally are employees of Cornell, not employees of SUNY. The State Education Law gives the SUNY Board of Trustees the authority to approve Cornell's appointment of the deans/unit heads of the statutory colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the statutory colleges.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added {{programs}} and staff that continued {{the transformation of}} the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from MIT and started the first pathogen-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of <b>Human</b> <b>Ecology,</b> was founded in 1956. Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. donated $15million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the Association of American Universities, an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education.|$|E

25|$|The {{ecology of}} the Low Salinity Zone of the San Francisco Estuary is {{difficult}} to characterize {{because it is the}} result of a complex synergy of both abiotic and biotic factors. In addition, it continues to undergo rapid change resulting from newly introduced species, direct anthropogenic influences and climate change. Future ecological changes will be driven on an ecosystem wide scale, particularly as sea level rise, tectonic instability and infrastructure decline cause levee failure in the Delta. The resulting back-surge in water flow is expected to force X2 into the Delta, jeopardizing spatially oriented habitat (like freshwater marshes), channelizing the low salinity zone, and threatening southern California's water supply, with unknown and unforeseeable consequences for the natural and <b>human</b> <b>ecology</b> of the West coast's largest estuary.|$|E
25|$|Cornell is one {{of three}} private land grant {{universities}} in the United States and the only one in New York. Of its seven undergraduate colleges, three are state-supported statutory or contract colleges through the State University of New York (SUNY) system, including its agricultural and <b>human</b> <b>ecology</b> colleges as well as its industrial labor relations school. Of Cornell's graduate schools, only the veterinary college is state-supported. As a land grant college, Cornell operates a cooperative extension outreach program in every county of New York and receives annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions. The Cornell University Ithaca Campus comprises 745 acres, but is much larger when the Cornell Botanic Gardens (more than 4,300 acres) and the numerous university owned lands in New York City are considered.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} hypothesis {{about the}} epidemiology—the appearance, spread, and especially disappearance—of plague from Europe {{is that the}} flea-bearing rodent reservoir of disease was eventually succeeded by another species. The Black Rat (Rattus rattus) was originally introduced from Asia to Europe by trade, but was subsequently displaced and succeeded throughout Europe by the bigger Brown Rat (Rattus norvegicus). The brown rat was not as prone to transmit the germ-bearing fleas to humans in large die-offs due to a different rat ecology. The dynamic complexities of rat ecology, herd immunity in that reservoir, interaction with <b>human</b> <b>ecology,</b> secondary transmission routes between humans with or without fleas, human herd immunity, and changes in each might explain the eruption, dissemination, and re-eruptions of plague that continued for centuries until its unexplained disappearance.|$|E

25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. <b>Human</b> <b>ecology,</b> e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure to care about the natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
500|$|Ecology {{is as much}} a {{biological}} science as it is a human science. <b>Human</b> <b>ecology</b> is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species. [...] "Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bioecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bioecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary <b>human</b> <b>ecology</b> will most likely address itself to all three." [...] The term was formally introduced in 1921, but many sociologists, geographers, psychologists, and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior, especially in the late 19th century.|$|E

50|$|<b>Human</b> Behavioral <b>Ecology</b> (HBE) studies how {{ecology and}} social factors shape human {{behavioral}} variability. A key assumption of <b>human</b> behavioral <b>ecology</b> is that individuals will act {{in response to}} environmental factors in ways that enhance their fitness. While both HBE and evolutionary psychology are both concerned with fitness benefits and natural selection, HBE is not typically concerned with mechanisms or how humans display adaptive behaviors in novel environments. If the human mind took its present form and evolved in the African Pleistocene, why should one expect to behave adaptively {{in the present and}} in so many new environments? Human Behavioral Ecologists may respond by stating that humans evolved as ecological generalists and display a wide range of variable behaviors to maximize fitness. Where cooperation and food-sharing among extant hunter-gatherers may be seen as the result of kin-selection psychological mechanisms by an evolutionary psychologist, a human behavioral ecologist may attribute this behavior to optimal risk-reduction strategies and reciprocal altruism. For <b>Human</b> Behavioral <b>Ecology,</b> cultural behaviors should tend towards optimality (i.e. higher fitness) in their current environment. For evolutionary psychology, cultural behaviors are the result of psychological mechanisms which were selected for in ancestral environments.|$|R
