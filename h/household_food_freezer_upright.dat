40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2010. Measurement of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> {{insecurity}} {{is needed}} to identify the magnitude of food insecurity and {{assess the impact of}} development interventions. However, there is no commonly agreed measure of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity. While researchers continually experiment with new measures, the resultant measures are often complex and include numerous variables that still do not distinguish clearly between the food secure and the food insecure. This study set out to prepare a quick and convenient tool to measure <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security, using common household demographic and socio-economic variables commonly collected through a variety of household surveys. This has minimised data collection costs and assisted national food security units to continually measure and monitor <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity. Food insecurity levels were estimated using data from a baseline survey conducted in a community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Food security was estimated using a number of measures, including food quantity (adequacy), dietary diversity, dietary quality, coping strategies employed and the Coping Strategies Index. The study found that <b>household</b> <b>food</b> availability varied across the two seasons over which data were collected. Only the percentile of sample <b>households</b> with adequate <b>food</b> intakes (one third of the samples) consumed enough food during the lean period when agricultural production was low. <b>Households</b> with inadequate <b>food</b> intakes also had consumed insufficient energy and lower micronutrient intakes during the period when agricultural produce was more abundant. Energy, iron and protein consumption was positively related to the consumption of adequate food. Energy intake was a relatively good indicator of protein and micronutrient intakes during the leaner period. Consumption of foods from three food groups, namely cereals, legumes and vegetables and fruits were necessary for adequate food intake. Cereals were the most important foods, forming the base of most meals, while fats and animal sourced foods were not widely consumed. Diversifying consumption through fruits and vegetables contributed significantly and positively to improved <b>household</b> <b>food</b> intakes. <b>Household</b> dietary diversity and dietary quality improved during the period of plenty. The application of coping strategies was strongly related to <b>household</b> <b>food</b> intake and diversity. Engaging in more coping strategies and having resultant higher Coping Strategy Index scores was strongly associated with <b>household</b> <b>food</b> inadequacy intakes and low food diversity scores. As expected, sampled households employed more coping strategies during the lean season. The strong and significant relationships between the Coping Strategies Index scores, the number of coping strategies practised by households and the <b>household</b> <b>food</b> intake indices (the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Intake Index and Nutrient Adequacy Ratios) show that food intake is a strong indicator for <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security. The <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Index and the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Scale were developed using 13 potential household demographic and socio-economic variables to identify the food-insecure households. The results of these two new measures were correlated with the results of the common measures reported above and found to be useful determinants of food security. The study found that while the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Index explained the influence of demographic and socio-economic variables in <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity, the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Scale is more convenient in application (easy data management and computation process), and it is strongly related to the Coping Strategies Index scores. Both the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Scale and the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Index were useful tools to measure <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security and differentiate between food security and <b>food</b> insecure <b>households</b> in Embo Community.

40|$|Food {{insecurity}} exists when {{access to}} safe, nutritionally adequate foods is limited or uncertain, or when acquisition of these foods occurs in socially unacceptable ways (Anderson, 1990).

To address this gap in the literature, a mixed methods approach was used to explore the connections between risk factors, <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity, and health in urban and rural settings. This dissertation comprised three studies. In the first study, secondary data were used to identify the household factors that increased the risk for <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity and to examine whether place of residence moderated these relationships. Significant associations were found between household sociodemographics and <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity. In addition, rural households {{were more likely to report}} <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity. Although most moderation models were non-significant, a moderation effect was found for educational attainment: secondary school graduation increased the risk for <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity in urban households, yet it was protective in rural households. In the second study, secondary data were used to examine the relationship between <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity and poor general, physical, and mental health, and to test for a moderation effect of place of residence. In the main effects models, <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity was associated with an increased likelihood of poor health on all measures. There was no evidence of urban-rural differences in these relationships. In the third study, qualitative data were used to explore <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity from the perspective of urban and rural residents in Eastern Ontario. Findings revealed that urban and rural residents described similar conditions, processes, and consequences of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity; however, the unique features of the urban and rural settings influenced how people managed these experiences. In particular, certain aspects of the rural settings added to the complexity of managing <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Household</b> <b>food</b> {{security}} is a term associated with social welfare {{and the distribution of}} resources within society. It is also an organizing metaphor that is highly political and context dependent in its construction and deployment. How the concept emerges into new situations is often overlooked. This article prob-lematizes the recent emergence of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security in England, a feature closely linked to the food policy developments of the UK Government (2007 – 2010). I explore <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security in England through a discourse analysis of published policy texts and semi-structured interviews with third-sector prac-titioners. These reveal the tensions surrounding the introduction of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security into this domestic policy setting. I show how policymakers used the concept strategically, and how the discursive and institutional legacies of food poverty and the welfare state constrained the wider adoption of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security in this contemporary setting...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association of}} seasonality with dietary diversity, <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security and nutritional status of pregnant women in a rural district of northern Bangladesh. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 2013 to February 2015. Data were collected on demographics, <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security (using the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Insecurity Access Scale), dietary diversity (using the women's dietary diversity questionnaire) and mid-upper arm circumference. Descriptive statistics were used to explore demographics, dietary diversity, <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security and nutritional status, and inferential statistics were applied to explore the role of seasonality on diversity, <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security and nutritional status. Setting: Twelve villages of Pirganj sub-district, Rangpur District, northern Bangladesh. Subjects: Pregnant women (n 288). Results: Seasonality {{was found to be}} associated with dietary diversity (P= 0 · 026) and <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security (P= 0 · 039).

Drawing on theories of the social production of health and disease, research evidence linking food insufficiency with poor mental health, and high rates of food insufficiency among welfare recipients, we examined whether a change in <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insufficiency is associated with a change in women's self-reported mental health in a sample of current and recent welfare recipients over a 3 -year period of time, controlling for common risk factors. Data were obtained from a prospective survey of women who were welfare recipients in an urban Michigan county in February 1997 (n= 753). We estimated fixed effect models for changes in mental health status that make use of information on <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insufficiency gathered in the fall of 1997, 1998, and 1999.

The result shows the connection between social capital and food security which identified on the research locations {{in the form of}} mutual assistance of giving or borrowing food, and exchanged of food among neighbors or families; relatively high level of trust in the society or between society and the government (particularly extensi??n officers, head of the village and community leaders); <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security level both at the lowlands and highlands show not food secure with Food Diversification Score of 4; the problems of food insecurity are in the aspects of availability, accesibility, and food consumption these are due to limited production capital (small land, and lack of knowldge of tools usage) and low understanding of food and nutrition. Therefore the household requirement to improve food security are productive business development program and increase society knowledge about food and nutriion; food security development program can be done through strengthening/development of institution (ecomic small business groups, farmers groups including women farmers group). The suitable institutional strengthening are: (1) Instituional support model; (2) Development of human reseource capacity to improve the <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security...|$|R

However, there is no commonly agreed measure of <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity. While researchers continually experiment with new measures, the resultant measures are often complex and include numerous variables that still do not distinguish clearly between the food secure and the food insecure. This study set out to prepare a quick and convenient tool to measure <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security, using common household demographic and socio-economic variables commonly collected through a variety of household surveys. This has minimised data collection costs and assisted national food security units to continually measure and monitor <b>household</b> <b>food</b> insecurity. Food insecurity levels were estimated using data from a baseline survey conducted in a community in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Food security was estimated using a number of measures, including food quantity (adequacy), dietary diversity, dietary quality, coping strategies employed and the Coping Strategies Index...|$|R

The national food security systems are dualistic in nature, and the {{rural and urban}} food security systems are weakly related. <b>Household</b> <b>food</b> security in rural areas is primarily determined by access to arable land and fishery resources, whereas in urban areas <b>household</b> <b>food</b> security is primarily determined by access to employment. <b>Household</b> <b>food</b> security has been a concern in both rural and urban areas. Both under nutrition and over nutrition are highly relevant indicators that nutritional food security {{is an important issue}} in the country. food security, Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R

If <b>household</b> <b>food</b> waste reduction initiatives are to be successful {{they will need to}} be informed by people's motivations and barriers to minimising <b>household</b> <b>food</b> waste. This paper reports a qualitative study of the thoughts, feelings and experiences of 15 UK <b>household</b> <b>food</b> purchasers, based on semi-structured interviews. Two core categories of motives to minimise <b>household</b> <b>food</b> waste were identified: (1) waste concerns and (2) doing the ‘right’ thing. A third core category illustrated the importance of food management skills in empowering people to keep <b>household</b> <b>food</b> waste to a minimum. Four core categories of barriers to minimising food waste were also identified: (1) a ‘good’ provider identity; (2) minimising inconvenience; (3) lack of priority; and (4) exemption from responsibility. The wish to avoid experiencing negative emotions (such as guilt, frustration, annoyance, embarrassment or regret) underpinned both the motivations and the barriers to minimising food waste. Findings thus reveal potentially conflicting personal goals which may hinder existing food waste reduction attempts...|$|R
40|$|Measuring <b>household</b> <b>food</b> {{insecurity}} {{represents a}} challenge {{due to the}} complexity and wide array of factors associated with this phenomenon. For over one decade, researchers and agencies throughout {{the world have been}} using and assessing the validity of variations of the United States Department of Agriculture <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Security Supplemental Module. Thanks to numerous studies of diverse design, size, and purpose, the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Security Supplemental Module has shown its suitability to directly evaluate the perceptions of individuals on their food security status. In addition, challenges and limitations are becoming clearer and new research questions are emerging as the process advances. The {{purpose of this article is}} to describe the development, validation procedures, and use of the <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Security Supplemental Module in very diverse settings. The most common <b>Household</b> <b>Food</b> Security Supplemental Module related studies have been conducted using criterion validity, Rasch modeling and Cronbach-Alpha Coefficient. It is critical that researchers, policy makers, governmental and non-governmental agencies intensify their efforts to further develop tools that provide valid and reliable measures of food security in diverse population groups. Additional work is needed to synthesize a universally applicable tool able to capture the global human phenomenon of food insecurity...|$|R
