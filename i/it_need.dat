5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria <b>it</b> <b>need</b> only enter the cell.|$|E

Using and shaping networked ICT to enhance democracy is a challenging task. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> action research as well as theoretical considerations. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> societal pull and technological push. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> research funding and self-organised grass-root activities. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> both an administration oriented approach of development and an autonomous citizen-oriented approach.

25|$|Regarding {{the debate}} {{about the role of the}} liberal {{democratic}} model in peacebuilding, one side contends that liberal democracy is a viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve <b>it</b> <b>need</b> to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate yardstick for success. Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.|$|E
25|$|Dark matter {{can refer}} to any {{substance}} which interacts predominantly via gravity with visible matter (e.g. stars and planets). Hence in principle <b>it</b> <b>need</b> not be composed of {{a new type of}} fundamental particle but could, at least in part, be made up of standard baryonic matter, such as protons or electrons. However, for the reasons outlined below, most scientists consider the dark matter to be dominated by a non-baryonic component, which is likely composed of a currently unknown fundamental particle (or similar exotic state).|$|E

40|$|This paper argues that, if {{cultural}} {{political economy}} {{is to be}} worthwhile, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> {{to be critical of}} its object. In order to develop its critical understanding of contemporary society, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to do at least three things. Firstly, while the cultural turn has corrected and sometimes inverted economic reductionism's dismissive treatment of culture and the lifeworld, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to avoid reducing economic systems to the lifeworld in which they are embedded, so that the extent to which systems are responsible for economic and cultural effects-good or bad-is not obscured. Secondly, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to take a more critical look at the social and cultural embedding of economic activities, and at the way system mechanisms of capital accumulation and uneven development have powerful disembedding and disruptive effects. Thirdly, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> to reconsider, rather than ignore, classical political economy, which was always cultural and is still of relevance today, even though it failed to anticipate new issues of cultural and political significance, such as the politics of identity...|$|R
50|$|The {{engineers}} {{who designed the}} Fairchild F8 Microcomputer did so mindful {{of a set of}} goals. The computer needed to be electrically frugal. <b>It</b> <b>needed</b> characteristics that permitted easy interface to standard SSI and MSI components. <b>It</b> <b>needed</b> a moderate instruction set. <b>It</b> <b>needed</b> to be easy to incorporate into a design. The design needed to put the maximum number of computer components and circuits into the LSI components to minimize the package count. This approach reduced the time spent on designing support logic circuits.|$|R
25|$|The {{school with}} the most {{aggregate}} points {{at the end of}} the week is the winner, progressing to the semi-finals and then the Grand Final. The winning school on any one day does not compete for more points or prizes, and should there be a tie <b>it</b> <b>need</b> not be broken. However, should there be a tie after the week, a tie breaker would be given out for the Friday's teams. The team that gives the correct answer gets 10 points for their team and go through to the next round. An incorrect answer would lose them 10 points and the opposing team go through instead.|$|E
25|$|It did {{not matter}} that the vehicle was lightly armoured, because the {{soldiers}} it was expected to meet would be lightly equipped; what was of key importance was that the vehicle would survive the bombardment that was expected to immediately precede a landing. Armadillos were to be kept {{a short distance from}} the airfield, well hidden and protected but always ready to be called into action. Overweight, the Armadillo was unsuitable for travelling over rough or boggy ground. However, it did not need to travel far or fast, nor did <b>it</b> <b>need</b> to cope with hills; it could easily move along airfield taxiways and perimeter roads.|$|E
25|$|By {{looking at}} a {{cylindrical}} rod can one tell whether it is twisted? If the rod is perfectly cylindrical, then the circular symmetry of the cross section {{makes it impossible to}} tell {{whether or not it is}} twisted. However, if there were a straight line drawn along the length of the rod, then one could easily say whether or not there is a twist by looking at the state of the line. Drawing a line is gauge fixing. Drawing the line spoils the gauge symmetry, i.e., the circular symmetry U(1) of the cross section at each point of the rod. The line is the equivalent of a gauge function; <b>it</b> <b>need</b> not be straight. Almost any line is a valid gauge fixing, i.e., there is a large gauge freedom. To tell whether the rod is twisted, you need to first know the gauge. Physical quantities, such as the energy of the torsion, do not depend on the gauge, i.e., are gauge invariant.|$|E
