40|$|Abstract Background Cowden Syndrome (CS) {{patients}} with germ line point mutations in the PTEN gene {{are at high}} risk for developing breast cancer. It is believed that cells harboring these mutant PTEN alleles are predisposed to malignant conversion. This article will characterize the biochemical and biological properties of a mutant PTEN protein found in a commonly used metastatic breast cancer cell line. Methods The expression of PTEN in human breast carcinoma cell lines was evaluated by Western blotting analysis. Cell line MDA-MB- 453 was selected for further analysis. Mutation analysis of the PTEN gene was carried out using DNA isolated from MDA-MB- 453. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate a PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K mutant cDNA and ectopic expressed in PC 3, U 87 MG, MCF 7 and Pten -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFS). Histidine (His) -tagged PTEN fusion protein was generated in Sf 9 baculovirus expression system. Lipid phosphatase and ubiquitination assays were carried out to characterize the biochemical properties of PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K mutant. The intracellular localization of PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K was determined by subcellular fractionation experiments. The ability of PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K to alter cell growth, migration and apoptosis was analyzed in multiple PTEN-null cell lines. Results We found a mutation in the PTEN gene at codon 307 in MDA-MB- 453 cell line. The glutamate (E) to lysine (K) substitution rendered the mutant protein to migrate with a faster mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. Biochemically, the PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K mutant displayed similar lipid phosphatase and growth suppressing activities when compared to wild-type (WT) protein. However, the PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K mutant was present at higher levels in the membrane fraction and suppressed Akt activation {{to a greater extent than}} the WT protein. Additionally, the PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K mutant was polyubiquitinated to a greater extent by NEDD 4 - 1 and displayed reduced nuclear localization. Finally, the PTEN <b>E</b> <b>307</b> K mutant failed to confer chemosensitivity to cisplatinum when re-expressed in Pten -/- MEFS. Conclusions Mutation at codon 307 in PTEN C 2 loop alters its subcellular distribution with greater membrane localization while being excluded from the cell nucleus. This mutation may predispose breast epithelial cells to malignant transformation. Also, tumor cells harboring this mutation may be less susceptible to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutics. </p...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in Parkin {{are one of}} the {{predominant}} hereditary factors found in patients suffering from autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinsonism. Parkin {{is a member of the}} E 3 ubiquitin ligase family that is defined by a tripartite RING 1 -in-between-ring (IBR) -RING 2 motif. In Parkin, the IBR domain has been shown to augment binding of the E 2 proteins UbcH 7 and UbcH 8, and the subsequent ubiquitination of the proteins synphilin- 1, Sept 5, and SIM 2. To facilitate our understanding of Parkin function, the solution structure of the Parkin IBR domain was solved by using NMR spectroscopy. Folding of the IBR domain (residues M 327 –S 378) was found to be zinc dependent, and the structure reveals the domain forms a unique pair scissor-like and GAG knuckle-like zinc-binding sites, different from other zinc-binding motifs such as the RING, LIM, PHD, or B-box motifs. The N terminus of the IBR domain, residues <b>E</b> <b>307</b> –E 322, is unstructured. The disease causing mutation T 351 P causes global unfolding, whereas the mutation R 334 C causes some structural rearrangement of the domain.

40|$|Background: Pre-operative {{informed}} consent {{is an important}} aspect of surgery, yet there has been no formal training regarding it in Pakistan. This study was done to assess the preoperative {{informed consent}} practice. Methods: After taking informed permission, a questionnaire was filled in during an interview with 350 patients, who have undergone elective surgical procedures under routine practice conditions from July to October 2010. All the patients were asked a set of standard questions which related to the information they were provided before the operation as a part of standard informed consent practice. Results: Most i. <b>e.</b> <b>307</b> (87. 7 %) patients were informed about their condition but very few 12 (3. 4 %) were briefed regarding complications. Only 17 (4. 9 %) patients said they knew about the risks and complications of proposed anesthesia.

40|$|The GPA 1, STE 4, and STE 18 {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae encode the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, respectively, of a G protein {{involved}} in the mating response pathway. We have found that mutations G 124 D, W 136 G, W 136 R, and delta L 138 and double mutations W 136 R L 138 F and W 136 G S 151 C of the Ste 4 protein cause constitutive activation of the signaling pathway. The W 136 R L 138 F and W 136 G S 151 C mutant Ste 4 proteins were tested in the two-hybrid protein association assay and found to be defective {{in association with the}} Gpa 1 protein. A mutation at position <b>E</b> <b>307</b> of the Gpa 1 protein both suppresses the constitutive signaling phenotype of some mutant Ste 4 proteins and allows the mutant alpha subunit to physically associate with a specific mutant G beta subunit. The mutation in the Gpa 1 protein is adjacent to the hinge, or switch, region that is required for the conformational change which triggers subunit dissociation, but the mutation does not affect the interaction of the alpha subunit with the wild-type beta subunit. Yeast cells constructed to contain only the mutant alpha and beta subunits mate and respond to pheromones, although they exhibit partial induction of the pheromone response pathway. Because the ability of the modified G alpha subunit to suppress the Ste 4 mutations is allele specific, {{it is likely that the}} residues defined by this analysis play a direct role in G-protein subunit association...|$|E

We compare these upper {{limits to the}} radio luminosities of several black hole binaries in very similar hard states, and find that the neutron star systems are as faint as or fainter than all of the black hole candidates. The differences in luminosities can partly be attributed to the lower masses of the neutron star systems, which on theoretical and observational grounds are expected to decrease the radio luminosities as M 0. 8. However, there still remains a factor of 30 scatter in the radio luminosities of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries, particularly at X-ray luminosities of a few percent Eddington. We find no obvious differences in the X-ray timing and spectral properties that can be correlated with the radio luminosity.

40|$|AbstractNucleotide binding domains (NBDs) of the multidrug {{transporter}} of Candida albicans, CaCdr 1 p, possess unique divergent {{amino acids}} in their conserved motifs. For example, NBD 1 (N-terminal-NBD) possesses conserved signature motifs, while the same motif is divergent in NBD 2 (C-terminal-NBD). In this study, we have evaluated {{the contribution of}} these conserved and divergent signature motifs of CaCdr 1 p in ATP catalysis and drug transport. By employing site-directed mutagenesis, we made three categories of mutant variants. These included mutants where all the signature motif residues were replaced with either alanines or mutants with exchanged equipositional residues to mimic the conservancy and degeneracy in opposite domain. In addition, a set of mutants where signature motifs were swapped to have variants with either both the conserved or degenerated entire signature motif. We observed that conserved and equipositional residues of NBD 1 and NBD 2 and swapped signature motif mutants showed high susceptibility to all the tested drugs with simultaneous abrogation in ATPase and R 6 G efflux activities. However, some of the mutants displayed a selective increase in susceptibility to the drugs. Notably, none of the mutant variants and WT-CaCdr 1 p showed any difference in drug and nucleotide binding. Our mutational analyses show not only that certain conserved residues of NBD 1 signature sequence (S 304, G 306, and <b>E</b> <b>307)</b> are important in ATP hydrolysis and R 6 G efflux but also that a few divergent residues (N 1002 and E 1004) of NBD 2 signature motif have evolved to be functionally relevant and are not interchangeable. Taken together, our {{data suggest that the}} signature motifs of CaCdr 1 p, whether it is divergent or conserved, are nonexchangeable and are functionally critical for ATP hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnosis of West Nile virus (WNV) infections {{is often}} {{difficult}} due to the extensive antigenic cross-reactivity among flaviviruses, especially in geographic regions where {{two or more of}} these viruses are present causing sequential infections. The {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) produced against WNV to verify their applicability in WNV diagnosis and in mapping epitope targets of neutralizing MAbs. Methods Six MAbs were produced and characterized by isotyping, virus-neutralization, western blotting and MAb-epitope competition. The MAb reactivity against various WNVs belonging to lineage 1 and 2 and other related flaviviruses was also evaluated. The molecular basis of epitopes recognized by neutralizing MAbs was defined through the selection and sequencing of MAb escape mutants. Competitive binding assays between MAbs and experimental equine and chicken sera were designed to identify specific MAb reaction to epitopes with high immunogenicity. Results All MAbs showed stronger reactivity with all WNVs tested and good competition for antigen binding in ELISA tests with WNV-positive equine and chicken sera. Four MAbs (3 B 2, 3 D 6, 4 D 3, 1 C 3) resulted specific for WNV, while two MAbs (2 A 8, 4 G 9) showed cross-reaction with Usutu virus. Three MAbs (3 B 2, 3 D 6, 4 D 3) showed neutralizing activity. Sequence analysis of 3 B 2 and 3 D 6 escape mutants showed an amino acid change at <b>E</b> <b>307</b> (Lys → Glu) in the E protein gene, whereas 4 D 3 variants identified mutations encoding amino acid changed at E 276 (Ser → Ile) or E 278 (Thr → Ile). 3 B 2 and 3 D 6 mapped to a region on the lateral surface of domain III of E protein, which is known to be a specific and strong neutralizing epitope for WNV, while MAb 4 D 3 recognized a novel specific neutralizing epitope on domain II of E protein that has not previously been described with WNV MAbs. Conclusions MAbs generated in this study can be applied to various analytical methods for virological and serological WNV diagnosis. A novel WNV-specific and neutralizing MAb (4 D 3) directed against the unknown epitope on domain II of E protein can be useful to better understand the role of E protein epitopes involved in the mechanism of WNV neutralization. </p...|$|E

The evaluation was performed in GES medium supplemented with one of the following phosphates: Anitápolis, Araxá and Catalão, through a factorial experiment [(56 isolates + control) x three phosphates] in a randomized complete design with three replications. After 15 days of inoculation, levels of phosphorus and pH of the media were determined. Effects of phosphates, isolates and the interaction were verified. Low values of pH were obtained by isolates with high and medium potential. The average level of P was superior in Anitápolis phosphate, followed by Araxá. Thirty-one isolates solubilized significant quantities. The isolate 310 showed the highest potential (average of 263 mug mL- 1 of P).

A faixa ideal de pH foi 5, 0 e de temperatura, 50 º C, verificada para as enzimas Celulase Total, Endoglicanase e β-glicosidase. Quanto à termoestabilidade, as enzimas presentes mantiveram mais de 60 % da atividade inicial após 2 horas de incubação a 50 º C. O perfil de proteínas analisado por SDS-PAGE demonstrou que os clones secretam um conjunto de enzimas celulolíticas com 25 a 100 KDa, quando cultivado em farelo de trigo, e 30 a 60 KDa, quando cultivados em CMC. No ensaio de cromatografia para o clone 307 /E 11, foram selecionadas 5 frações que obtiveram melhores resultados na dosagem enzimática e testados frente ao pH e à temperatura. O resultado obtido foi que o complexo enzimático bruto, extraído do sobrenadante produzido pelo clone, possui melhor atividade frente ao pH e à temperatura do que as frações parcialmente purificadas. Microorganisms are {{distinguished}} {{by a wide}} genetic diversity and they perform unique and crucial functions concerning the maintenance of ecosystems. One of those functions is the production of extracellular enzymes, which help in the degradation of organic matter and which are increasingly wanted and explored by industry. Such feature boosts the search of enzymes that can be exploited in several industrial sectors with improved full use and low cost. Cellulase belongs to such class of enzymes and it is composed of a multi-enzymatic complex which is able to hydrolyse cellulose through {{the breaking of the}} chemical bond β, 1 - 4. Considering such attribute of the cellulase, a heterologous expression, related to cellulose hydrolysis in a metagenomic inventory of the soil of Caatinga, was realized. Tests of enzymatic production were performed, and through them, we could elect the clones 283 /A 8 and 307 /E 11 as the best endoglicanase producers. Those clones were inoculated in different cellulose sources, pH and temperature, so that we could analyse the kinetic of cellulase production between them. The ideal pH range was 5. 0 and the ideal temperature range was 50 º C (122 º F), verified for the enzymes Total Cellulase, Endoglicanase and β-glucosidase. With regard to thermostability, the present enzymes kept more than 60 % of the initial activity after 2 hours of incubation at 50 º C (122 º F). The proteins profile analysed with the help of SDS-PAGE proved that the clones secrete a group of cellulolytic enzymes with a weight average of 25 to 100 KDa, when cultivated in wheat bran, and of 30 to 60 KDa, when cultivated in CMC. Five fractions with the best results, regarding enzymatic dosage and tested before pH and temperature, were chosen by the chromatography research for the clone 307 /E 11. The achieved result proved that the raw enzymatic complex, extracted from the supernatant produced by the clone, develops a better activity before pH and temperature than the fractions partially purified...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of the application of different water depths and nitrogen and potassium doses in the quality of Tanzania grass, in the southern of the state of Tocantins. The experiment was conducted on strips of traditional sprinklers, and used, as treatments, a mixture of fertilizer combinations of N and K 2 O always in the ratio of 1 N: 0. 8 K 2 O. This study determined throughout the experiment: plant height (PH), the crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). The highest plant height obtained was 132. 4 cm, with a fertilizer dose of 691. 71 kg ha- 1 in the proportion of N: 0. 8 K 2 O, in other words, 384. 28 kg ha- 1 of N and 307. 43 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O, and water depth of 80 % of the ETc. The highest crude protein content was 12. 2 %, with the fertilizer dose application of 700 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 in the proportion of 1 N to 0. 8 of K 2 O, in other words, 388. 89 kg ha- 1 of N and 311. 11 kg ha- 1 of K 2 O and absence of irrigation. The lowest level of neutral detergent fiber was 60. 7 % with the application of the smallest dose of fertilizer and highest water depth. It was concluded in this study that there was an increase in plant height by increasing the fertilizer dose and water depth. The crude protein content increased 5. 4 % in the dry season, by increasing the fertilizer dose and water depth. In the dry season, there was an increase of NDF content by 4. 5 % by increasing the application of fertilizer and water depth. Teve-se como objetivo neste trabalho avaliar os efeitos da aplicação de diferentes lâminas de água e doses de nitrogênio e potássio na qualidade do capim-Tanzânia, no sul do Estado do Tocantins. O experimento foi conduzido em faixas com aspersão convencional e aplicou-se, como tratamentos, uma mistura de adubo com combinações de doses de N e K 2 O sempre na relação de 1 N: 0, 8 K 2 O. Para o estudo, determinaram-se ao longo do experimento: a altura de plantas (PH) e os teores de proteína bruta (PB) e de fibra em detergente neutro (FDN). A maior altura de plantas obtida foi de 132, 4 cm, com a dose de 691, 71 kg ha- 1 do adubo na proporção de 1 N para 0, 8 de K 2 O, ou seja, 384, 28 kg ha- 1 de N <b>e</b> <b>307,</b> 43 kg ha- 1 de K 2 O e lâmina de água de 80 % da ETc. O maior teor de proteína bruta foi de 12, 2 %, com a aplicação da dose de 700 kg ha- 1 ano- 1 do adubo, na proporção de 1 N para 0, 8 de K 2 O, ou seja, 388, 89 kg ha- 1 de N e 311, 11 kg ha- 1 de K 2 O e ausência de irrigação. O menor teor de fibra em detergente neutro foi de 60, 7 % com a aplicação da menor dose de adubo e da maior lâmina de água. Concluiu-se, neste trabalho, que houve aumento na altura das plantas, com o aumento da dose do adubo e da lâmina de irrigação. O teor de proteína bruta aumentou 5, 4 %, no período seco, com o incremento da dose de adubo e da lâmina de irrigação.

40|$|Xylanolytic enzymes {{are widely}} used in {{processing}} industries, e. g., pulp and paper, food, livestock feeds, and textile. Furthermore, certain xylanotic enzymes have demonstrated the capability to improve the resistance and immunity of plants. Screening of high-yield microbial xylanolytic enzyme producers is significant for improving large-scale cost-effective xylanolytic enzyme production. This study provided new evidence of high-level xylanolytic enzyme production by a novel fungus, designated Leptosphaerulina chartarum SJTU 59. Under laboratory conditions, L. chartarum SJTU 59 produced xylanolytic enzymes of up to 17. 566 U/mL (i. <b>e.,</b> 878. <b>307</b> U/g substrate). The enzyme solution was relatively stable {{over a wide range}} of pH (pH 3. 0 to pH 9. 0) and temperature (40 °C to 65 °C) while showing high resistance to the majority of metal ions tested. Composition analysis of the hydrolytic products of xylan showed sufficient degradation by xylanolytic enzymes from L. chartarum SJTU 59, mainly the monosaccharide xylose, and a small amount of xylobiose were enzymatically produced; whereas in the presence of sufficient xylan substrates, mainly xylooligosaccharides, an emerging prebiotic used in food industry, were produced. In addition, the xylanolytic enzyme preparation from L. chartarum SJTU 59 could initiate tissue necrosis and oxidative burst in tobacco leaves, which may be related to enhanced plant defense to adversity and disease. L. chartarum SJTU 59 possessed a complex xylanolytic enzyme system, from which two novel endo-β- 1, 4 -xylanases of the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10, one novel endo-β- 1, 4 -xylanase of the GH family 11, and one novel β-xylosidase of the GH family 43 were obtained via rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends. Given the high yield and stable properties of xylanolytic enzymes produced by L. chartarum SJTU 59, future studies will be conducted to characterize the properties of individual xylanolytic enzymes from L. chartarum SJTU 59. xylanolytic enzymes-encoding gene(s) of potential use for industrial and agricultural applications will be screened to construct genetically engineered strains...|$|R

40|$|Tese (doutorado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro Tecnológico. Programa de Pos-Graduação em Engenharia Ambiental. Filtros plantados com macrófitas, {{constructed}} wetlands, são sistemas naturais projetados sob critérios de engenharia e empregados no tratamento de esgotos domésticos, industriais e agrícolas. Estudos e aplicações da combinação destes filtros com lagoas de estabilização no tratamento de esgotos domésticos, vêm sendo intensificados desde 1990, principalmente, na Europa. Em regiões de clima subtropical, caso do sul do Brasil, inexistem trabalhos utilizando a seqüência lagoas de estabilização seguido de filtros plantados com macrófitas no tratamento de esgotos domésticos, contribuindo para o déficit do saneamento da região. Este trabalho tem como objetivo geral identificar e avaliar a potencialidade de filtros plantados com macrófitas no pós-tratamento de efluente de lagoas de estabilização empregadas sob clima subtropical, a fim de aplicá-los como alternativa tecnológica para o tratamento descentralizado de esgotos domésticos. A base metodologia empregada conduziu a ações diferenciadas em quatro etapas, sendo uma em laboratório, duas em experimento de campo conduzidas simultaneamente e uma por simulação computacional empregando-se o software AQUASIM®. Em laboratório, durante um período de sete meses, buscou-se através de ensaios em colunas de PVC (DN 150) a identificação do material filtrante a ser empregado nos filtros plantados. Para as etapas de campo, foram construídos e avaliados, durante um período de vinte e dois meses, dois FPMHs em paralelo (10 m 2 de área; 0, 60 m profundidade, cada unidade), plantados com Typha domingensis, implantados a jusante de duas lagoas facultativas pilotos de tratamento secundário de esgotos domésticos, a fim de se identificar as potencialidades dos filtros no polimento de efluente de lagoas facultativas, notadamente em relação a remoção dos sólidos em suspensão. Apenas um FPMH (submetido a uma taxa hidráulica de 83 mm/d) foi empregado no polimento do efluente das lagoas facultativas, enquanto que o outro permaneceu em repouso durante doze meses, sendo então posto em operação como unidade complementar FPMVs, (também sob uma taxa hidráulica de 83 mm/d e plantados com a mesma macrófita) durante a segunda etapa de campo. Para esta segunda etapa de campo, realizada durante um período de nove meses, implantou-se seis módulos de FPMVs (2, 57 m 2 de área em cada módulo, com densidade de plantio de 4 mudas/m 2 de Typha domingensis), submetidos a diferentes taxas hidráulicas (153, 70 mm/d, 230, 74 mm/d <b>e</b> <b>307,</b> 39 mm/d) e diferentes cargas de sólidos suspensos (10 gSS/m 2. d, 15 gSS/m 2. d e 20 gSS/m 2. d), com o objetivo de se identificar as potencialidades de nitrificação do efluente da lagoa anaeróbia e da desnitrificação, sem introdução de carbono, promovida pelo FPMH pós FPMVs. Os resultados obtidos ao longo de todas as etapas apontaram: (i) à utilização da areia (d 10 = 0, 20 mm e U = 4, 9) como material filtrante dos filtros plantados; (ii) uma potencialidade de remoção de 80 % de DBO 5 e 94 % de SS quando da utilização de FPMH pós lagoas anaeróbia seguidas de facultativas; (iii) nitrificação de 73 % do total de nitrogênio amoniacal removido no FPMV com 0, 75 m de espessura de material filtrante (0, 05 m de brita 1 no topo, 0, 60 m de areia no meio e 0, 10 m de brita 1 no fundo), submetido a uma taxa hidráulica de 230, 74 mm/d e cargas orgânicas de 41 gDQO/m 2. d, 15 gSS/m 2. d, 12, 7 gNTK/m 2. d e 10, 2 gNH 4 -N/m 2. d.; (iv) desnitrificação no FPMH de 61 % do nitrogênio nitrato efluente dos FPMVs, sem a necessidade da introdução forçada de carbono orgânico no filtro; (v) uma adaptação das macrófitas em todos os filtros e (vi) uma boa indicação do potencial de nitrificação em filtros verticais através da simulação computacional, quando utilizado cinéticas e coeficientes estequimétricos definidos pelo modelo ASM 1 (Active Sludge Model N° 1). A partir das conclusões geradas neste estudo, recomenda-se o uso de filtros plantados com macrófitas associadas às lagoas de estabilização no tratamento de esgotos domésticos, principalmente para locais com densidade populacional inferior a 50 habitantes/km 2, caso verificado em oito dos treze municípios da Grande Florianópolis, estado de Santa Catarina, sul do Brasil. Soil filters {{planted with}} macrophytes, known as constructed wetlands, are natural systems designed using engineering criteria which are {{applied in the}} treatment of domestic, industrial and agricultural wastewaters. Studies and applications of a combination of these filters with stabilization ponds {{in the treatment of}} domestic wastewaters have been increasing since 1990, mainly in Europe. In regions with a subtropical climate, {{as in the case of}} southern Brazil, there have been no studies to date which use a sequence of stabilization ponds followed by constructed wetlands in the treatment of domestic wastewaters, contributing to the lack of sanitary facilities in the region. The overall aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the potential for constructed wetlands in the post-treatment of effluent from stabilization ponds applied in a subtropical climate, with a view to applying them as an alternative technology for the decentralized treatment of domestic wastewaters. The basic methodology employed led to four stages, one in the laboratory, two field experiments carried out simultaneously and one computer simulation using the software AQUASIM®. In the laboratory, for a period of seven months, tests were carried out in PVC (DN 150) columns to identify the filter material to be employed in the constructed wetlands. For the field stages, two HFCWs in parallel (10 m 2 area; 0. 60 m depth, each unit), planted with Typha domingensis, installed next to two pilot facultative treatment ponds for the secondary treatment of domestic wastewaters, were constructed and evaluated for a period of twenty-two months, in order to identify the potential of the filters in the polishing of the facultative pond effluents, particularly in relation to the removal of suspended solids. Only one HFCW (submitted to a hydraulic loading rate of 83 mm/d) was employed in the polishing of the effluent from the facultative ponds while the other remained at rest for twelve months, it then being put into operation as a complementary VFCWs unit (also with a hydraulic loading rate of 83 mm/d and planted with the same macrophyte) for the second field stage. For this second field stage, carried out for a period of nine months, six VFCW modules were installed (2. 57 m 2 area in each module, with a plant density of 4 seedlings/m 2 of Typha domingensis), and submitted to different hydraulic loading rates (153. 70 mm/d, 230. 74 mm/d and 307. 39 mm/d) and different suspended solids loads (10 gSS/m 2. d, 15 gSS/m 2. d and 20 gSS/m 2. d), in order to identify the potential for nitrification and denitrification of the anaerobic pond, without the introduction of carbon, offered by the HFCW after VFCWs. The results obtained over all of the stages indicated: (i) the use of sand (d 10 = 0. 20 mm and U = 4. 9) as the filter material for the constructed wetlands; (ii) a potential removal of 80 % for BOD 5 and 94 % for SS when using a HFCW after anaerobic, followed by facultative, ponds; (iii) nitrification of 73 % of total ammoniacal nitrogen removed in the VFCW with 0. 75 m of filter material thickness (0. 05 m of gravel 1 on top, 0. 60 m of sand in the middle and 0. 10 m of gravel 1 at the botton), submitted to a hydraulic loading rate of 230. 74 mm/d and organic loadings of 41 gCOD/m 2. d, 15 gSS/m 2. d, 12. 7 gTKN/m 2. d and 10. 2 g NH 4 -N /m 2. d.; (iv) denitrification in the HFCW of 61 % of the nitrate nitrogen in the effluent of the VFCWs, without the need to introduce organic carbon into the filter; (v) an adaptation of the macrophytes in all of the filters; and (vi) a good potential for nitrification in vertical filters through the computational simulation, when using kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients defined by the ASM 1 model (Active Sludge Model N° 1). From the conclusions generated by this study, the use of constructed wetlands together with stabilization ponds in the treatment of domestic wastewaters can be recommended, particularly for places with a population density lower than 50 inhabitants/Km 2, as is the case for eight of the thirteen municipalities of Greater Florianopolis, state of Santa Catarina, Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Progênies de café Maragogipe A. D. derivadas de 115 plantas matrizes selecionadas na região de São José do Rio Pardo e Mococa, foram plantadas em Campinas, em 1936 e 1937. Estas progênies foram divididas em três grupos, a saber: grupo A, constando de um conjunto de 62 progênies provenientes de sementes obtidas {{de flores}} de polinização aberta, plantadas em 1936 em linhas de 20 cafeeiros cada uma; grupo B, com 53 progênies com 10 plantas cada uma, também oriundas de sementes de flores não autofecundadas {{artificial}}mente, e finalmente um grupo C, encerrando as mesmas progênies do grupo B, tendo, porém, as plantas provindo de sementes obtidas pela autofecundação artificial das flôres e sendo plantadas em 1937, em seguida aos 10 cafeeiros das progênies correspondentes ao grupo B. Tôdas as 115 progênies, num total de 2300 plantas, tiveram suas produções individuais controladas por seis anos, quando então se fêz uma seleção, continuando-se a colhêr apenas 20 progênies até 1952. Das outras progênies, 310 cafeeiros se mostraram mais produtivos aos seis anos, e continuaram também a ser colhidos individualmente até que se efetuou a seleção definitiva em 1952. Com os dados de produção obtidos procurou-se verificar se a eliminação das piores progênies, baseando-se nos dados dos dois primeiros anos de produção, ocasionaria a perda de progenies bem produtivas após seis anos de produções sucessivas. A análise dos dados mostrou que poucas progênies teriam sido eliminadas, se tal seleção tivesse realmente sido feita. A comparação de uma seleção das melhores progênies baseada nos dois primeiros anos de produção com a classificação das progênies aos seis anos de produção, mostrou igualdade de eficiência. A julgar por êstes dados a seleção dos progênies do Maragogipe A. D. poderia ter sido eficientemente feita após as duas primeiras produções; contudo, o contrôle das produções por um período mínimo de seis anos é aconselhável para evitar a perda de progênies de valor e um pouco tardias. Dos 310 cafeeiros individuais selecionados, 230 pertenciam aos grupos A e B e 80 ao grupo C, os quais, tendo um ano a menos de produção que os demais, foram considerados à parte. Para os grupos A e B escolheram-se as 50 plantas mais produtivas após o primeiro, segundo e terceiro biênios e também depois de quinze anos de colheitas acumuladas. Verificou-se que muitos dos melhores cafeeiros aos dois anos não se conservaram entre os mais produtivos alguns anos depois. Pelo comportamento individual dos cafeeiros concluiu-se da necessiadde de se colherem dados de suas produções pelo menos por 12 a 15 anos sucessivos, para então se poder realizaruma escolha mais eficiente. Para as plantas do grupo C os resultados observados foram concordes com os dos grupos A e B. O estudo dos coeficientes de variação da produção dos três grupos de plantas indicou votores médios ao redor de 30, 00 %, sendo mais elevados para o grupo C, de plantas provenientes de sementes autofecundadas. Determinou-se para os 115 progênies a sua constituição genética com relação dos fatôres maragogipe e côr dos brotos. Comparando as suas produções com a condição do alelo Mg, notou-se que, de um modo geral, os progênies heterozigotas Mg mg apresentam maiores produções em kg de café moduro do que as progenies homozigotas Mg Mg. As progênies que segregam para o fator maragogipe apresentaram, em geral, maiores valores para o C V. que as homozigotas. Algumas progênies do grupo C que tiveram valores do C. V. bastante elevados, também são as de maior variação no grupo B, indicando provàvelmente que segregam para fatôres que controlam a produção. Além da análise genética das plantas matrizes, 123 cafeeiros móis produtivos foram também estudados quanto à segregação do fator Mg e, dêsses, apenas 17 quanto aos alelos T e Na. Verificou-se que os cafeeiros portadores dos alelos TT apresentam menor produção médio do que as plantas tt, e que as plantas Mg mg são mais produtivas que as do constituição Mg Mg e mg mg. Os dados referentes às porcentagens de sementes dos tipos moca, concho e chato, tamanho da semente (peneira média) e rendimento, foram analisados apenas para um grupo de progênies. Verificou-se que o quantidade de sementes moca e concha mostrou-se baixa, e que as progênies apresentam uma porcentagem média bem próxima à observada nas respectivas plantas matrizes. A peneira média mostrou-se muito pouco variável e da ordem de 20, 0, não ocorrendo grandes diferenças entre as plantas matrizes e as suas progênies. O rendimento de algumas progênies foi ruim, enquanto em outras mostrou-se excelente. Os dados de produção obtidos em 15 anos de observações no café Maragogipe A. D. indicam que as progenies de prefixos 315, 300, 306 <b>e</b> <b>307</b> seriam as mais indicados paro a multiplicação, caso se observasse um maior interêsse por este tipo de café. The mutant maragogipe {{in spite of}} having large beans and strong vegetative growth is a low yielding type of coffee. In the Northeastern coffee region of S. Paulo, a higher yielding strain of the Maragogipe coffee (Maragogipe A. D.) is cultivated, which aiso has large and well developed beans. Selection in this coffee was started in 1935 when 115 coffee mother trees were selected. Seeds from open pollinated flowers were planted in nurseries, the seedlings being transplanted to large distances {{in order to be}} classified according to segregation for the maragogipe and bronze alleles. Twenty seedlings from apparently Mg Mg progenies were transplanted to the field in 1936 in line and without replication, forming a group A of progenies. From visually segregating progenies (Mg mg), only 10 plants were transplanted in 1936 in line and also without replication (group B). A year later 10 more seedlings were transplanted of the same group B progenies, derived from selfed (group C). All 2, 300 plants of the 115 progenies were individually harvested during the first six consecutive years, when a preliminary selection of the 20 higher yielding progenies was undertaken, and also 310 individual coffee plants belonging to several other progenies. Yielding data were obtained for these groups of progenies and individual plants for another period of eight or nine years. The yielding data were analysed in order to verify how effective a very precocious selection would be based only on the yield data corresponding to the first two crops, in relation to the obtained data of six consecutive horvests. It wos verified that if such selection was made for the 62 progenies of the group A, from the 35 progenies with yield equal or above the average yield of the whole group, corresponding to the first biennial, only 4 (6. 5 %) good progenies would be lost after six consecutive crops (Table 2). From the 53 progenies of the group B only 4 (7. 6 %) would not be selected (Table 5) and this percentage for the group C would be of 8. 5 % (Table 7). It may be concluded that the high yielding Maragogipe progenies reveal this characteristics very early. However a period of at least six consecutive crops is advisable to be recorded before any selection be made in order to avoid losing good but late yielding progenies. The correlation coefficient of 0. 65 for the yields of the plants of the same progenies belonging to the group B (open pollinated) and C (self pollinated) indicated that the self pollination has not affected the yield. Only the yield variability measured by the coefficient of variation (Tables 1, 4) seems to be higher for the group C. For the 20 progenies and 310 individual plants whose yields were followed for 14 consecutive years, a comparison was also undertaken of the yield after 2, 4, 6 and the 14 years in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a precocious selection. It was concluded that in order to select high yielding individual coffee trees of the Maragogipe A. D., it is better to control the yields for a period of at least 14 years. From the 115 selected mother trees, it was found that 81 carry the maragogipe allele in the homozygous condition (Mg Mg) while 34 are heterozygous (Tables 3, 6 and 8). A comparison of the total yield of their respective progenies after six consecutive harvests, indicated that yields are higher in the progenies of the heterozygous plants in the three groups A, B and C of progenies. Progenies of the mother trees of the constitution Br Br (bronze), Br br (light bronze) and br br (green) do not differ in their total six-year yields. The segregation for this genetic factor does not seem to affect the yield variability. The 17 highest yielding plants after six consecutive crops were analysed in relation to the typica, bronze and maragogipe alleles. The alleles typica and maragogipe seemed to affect the yield, the plants bringing the alleles tt or Mg mg producing more ripe coffee than the plants of constitution TT or Mg Mg. A comparison was made of the percentage of the flat, peaberry and shell types of seeds, found in the 115 mother trees and their respective progenies (Table 12) and also for the seed size and outturn. No significant differences were found in these characteristics. However the percentage of peaberry seeds revealed to be higher for the selfed part (group C) of some progenies of group B. The outturn data indicated that a selection could be successfully dane improving the yield of seeds, in some of the high yielding progenies. In spite of the yielding differences noticed among the Maragogipe A. D. progenies, even the most promising ones can not compete with other coffee selection developed at Campinas. If for any special purpose the Maragogipe A. D. will be recommended for planting, the progenies numbered 315, 300, 306 and 307 would be indicated for establishment of multiplication plots...|$|E

Confirmou-se que quatro populações eram resistentes e uma (Mo 190) era susceptível. Esta população provinha de um campo tratado com bensulfurão-metilo e bentazona anualmente. Os resultados dos ensaios de doseresposta confirmam a maior susceptibilidade ao bensulfurão-metilo, no estado fenológico 116. Apresentaram resistência cruzada a todos os herbicidas inibidores da ALS excepto ao metsulfurão-metilo e ao imazetapir. Obtiveram-se valores de NR de 3 a 315 para azimsulfurão, cinosulfurão e etoxisulfurão. Bentazona, MCPA, oxadiazão e {{propanil}} apresentaram NR próximos da unidade, indicando que herbicidas com diferente modo de acção mantiveram a sua eficácia e podem constituir alternativa no combate a populações de A. plantago-aquatica resistentes ao bensulfurão-metilo. The repetitive use of bensulfuron-methyl in {{rice fields}} from Sorraia, Sado and Mondego river valleys had selected resistant (R) populations of Alisma plantago-aquatica in Portugal, identified as So 306, So 307, Sa 88, Mo 190; Mo 260, respectively. The response of R-biotypes to bensulfuron-methyl at 26 days after seeding (DAS) and 42 DAS and the crossresistance either to ALS- inhibitors or to herbicides with other mode of action, {{was investigated in}} dose-response experiments. The results confirmed bensulfuron-methyl resistance in four biotypes, but not in Mo 190, which had been also treated with bentazon every year. Younger plants (6 linear phyllodium, BBCH 116) were more susceptible to bensulfuron-merthyl than were older plants (6 expanded phyllodium, BBCH 126). R-biotypes presented cross-resistance to all ALS-inhibitors studied except for imazethapyr and metsulfuron-methyl. Resistance indeces (RI= ED 50 R /ED 50 S) ranged frome 3 to 313 for the three sulfonylurea herbicides. Herbicides with different mode of action including bentazon, MCPA, oxadiazon and propanil showed resistance indices of one, indicating that all herbicides tested had equal activity to both Rand S-biotypes. It was concluded that these herbicides could be effective for the control of resistant A. plantago-aquatica biotypes in rice paddy fields...|$|R
40|$|We re-analyze the {{precision}} radial velocity (RV) observations of HD 160691 (µ Ara) by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search Team. The star {{is supposed to}} host two Jovian companions (HD 160691 b, HD 160691 c) in longperiod orbits (∼ 630 days and ∼ 2500 days, respectively) and a hot-Neptune (HD 160691 d) in ∼ 9 days orbit. We perform a global search for the best fits in the orbital parameters space with a hybrid code employing the genetic algorithm and simplex method. The stability of Keplerian fits is verified with the N-body model of the RV signal {{that takes into account}} the dynamical constraints (so called GAMP method). Our analysis reveals a signature of the fourth, yet unconfirmed, Jupiter-like planet HD 160691 <b>e</b> in ∼ <b>307</b> days orbit. Overall, the global architecture of four-planet configuration recalls the Solar system. All companions of µ Ara move in quasi-circular orbits. The orbits of two inner Jovian planets are close to the 2 : 1 mean motion resonance. The alternative three-planet system involves two Jovian planets in eccentric orbits (e ∼ 0. 3), close to the 4 : 1 MMR, but it yields a significantly worse fit to the data. We also verify a hypothesis of the 1 : 1 MMR in the subsystem of two inner Jovian planets in the four-planet model.

40|$|This study reports {{quantitative}} {{information on the}} concentration of complement receptor for C 3 b and C 4 b (CR 1) on erythrocytes from normal individuals and patients with immune complex disease. The measurements were performed by an immunoradiometric assay using monoclonal antibodies against CR 1. The antibody specificity was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of CR 1 from extracts of surface-labeled cells, by inhibition of rosette formation between B lymphocytes and the erythrocytes intermediate EAC 14 oxy 23 b, and by the characteristic distribution of the antigen among cells of human peripheral blood. The number of CR 1 molecules in erythrocytes from 52 normal individuals was estimated as 1, 410 +/- 620. No significant differences in CR 1 levels were observed when individuals were grouped by sex, age, or blood groups. In patients with SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, the number of CR 1 molecules per RBC was significantly lower, i. <b>e.,</b> 600 +/- <b>307</b> and 903 +/- 417, respectively. CR 1 levels were normal in asthmatics undergoing long-term treatment with prednisone. In SLE patients, significant correlations were found between CR 1 levels, C 4 hemolytic titers, and levels of circulating immune complexes. In two out of four patients with SLE, CR 1 levels increased significantly during remission, showing that the deficiency is, at least in part, reversible. The deficiency in CR 1 could be genetically controlled or could represent an epiphenomenon caused by {{the interaction of the}} receptor with a ligand present in the circulation of patients...|$|R

The overall host-sensitivity {{values of the}} tested markers in human wastewater samples were 1. 0 (all human wastewater samples contained the E. coli genetic markers). The overall host-specificity values of these markers to differentiate between human and animal host groups were 0. 94, 0. 85, 0. 72, and 0. 57 for H 8, H 12, H 24, and H 14, respectively. Based on the higher host-specificity values, H 8 and H 12 markers were chosen for a validation environmental study. The prevalence of the H 8 and H 12 markers was determined among human wastewater E. coli isolates collected from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Among the 97 isolates tested, 44 (45 %) and 14 (14 %) were positive for the H 8 and H 12 markers, respectively. A total of <b>307</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates were tested from environmental water samples collected in Brisbane, of which 7 % and 20 % were also positive for the H 8 and H 12 markers, respectively.

O presente estudo teve por objetivo avaliar o desempenho operacional de um protótipo "Aerossolo", tracionado por um trator Valtra BM 100 4 x 2 TDA, com potência no motor de 73, 6 kW (100 cv). O equipamento é de arrasto, constituído por comando hidráulico, cabeçalho com luva telescópica para regulagem longitudinal, duas seções dispostas lateralmente, contando com 28 lâminas em cada uma delas, lastros de concreto, rodas de transporte e rolo destorroador. O trabalho foi conduzido no Departamento de Engenharia Rural da UNESP -Jaboticabal, em delineamento em blocos casualizados, no esquema fatorial 3 x 3, com quatro repetições. A combinação dos nove tratamentos deu-se por três condições de lastragens (0; 960 <b>e</b> 1. <b>307</b> kg) <b>e</b> três ângulos das seções (0 º; 7 º e 14 º).

The present study had as objective to evaluate the operational performance of an "Aerossolo" prototype tracked with a Valtra BM 100 4 x 2 TDA, with the engine power of 73. 6 kW (100 cv). The prototype equipment is a drag type, hydraulically commanded, with telescopic heading for longitudinal adjustment, two lateral sections with 28 knifes in each one of them, concrete ballasts, wheels of transport and aggregate breaker coil. The work was conducted in the Department of Agricultural Engineering of the UNESP, Jaboticabal Campus, in a randomized blocks design, factorial 3 x 3, with four repetitions. The nine studied treatments were a combination for three ballast conditions (0; 960 and 1, 307 kg) and three angles of the sections (0 º; 7 º and 14 º). The results indicate an increase in operational consumption (liters per hectare) of 32. 4 % in relation to the concrete ballast addition, and a 26. 8 % in relation to the angle variation between sections.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the prevalence {{and diversity of}} Escherichia coli strains isolated from surface waters from multiple watersheds within the South Nation River basin in eastern Ontario, Canada. The basin is composed of mixed but primarily agricultural land uses. From March 2004 to November 2007, a total of 2, 004 surface water samples were collected from 24 sampling sites. E. coli densities ranged from undetectable to 1. 64 × 105 CFU 100 ml− 1 and were correlated with stream order and proximity to livestock production systems. The diversity of 21, <b>307</b> <b>E.</b> coli isolates was characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR), allowing for the identification {{of as many as}} 7, 325 distinct genotypes, without capturing all of the diversity. The community was temporally and spatially dominated by a few dominant genotypes (clusters of more than 500 isolates) and several genotypes of intermediary abundance (clustering between 10 and 499 isolates). Simpson diversity indices, assessed on a normalized number of isolates per sample, ranged from 0. 050 to 0. 668. Simpson indices could be statistically discriminated on the basis of year and stream order, but land use, discharge, weather, and water physical-chemical properties were not statistically important discriminators. The detection of Campylobacter species was associated with statistically lower Simpson indices (greater diversity; P < 0. 05). Waterborne E. coli isolates from genotypes of dominant and intermediary abundance were clustered with isolates obtained from fecal samples collected in the study area over the same period, and 90 % of the isolates tested proved to share genotypes with fecal isolates. Overall, our data indicated that the densities and distribution of E. coli in these mixed-use watersheds were linked to stream order and livestock-based land uses. Waterborne E. coli populations that were distinct from fecal isolates were detected and, on this basis, were possibly naturalized E. coli strains...|$|R
40|$|Molecular cloning {{techniques}} {{were used to}} investigate antigenic determinants of periodontopathogen P. gingivalis {{in an attempt to}} begin to explore the cell surface of this organism. A genomic library generated in Escherichia coli was probed with polyclonal antiserum specific for P. gingivalis whole cells. Clone pGPR 1, which contained a 307 bp fragment of P. gingivalis DNA sequence, was found to react with both polyclonal antiserum and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific for the trypsin-like protease of this organism (Brick 190). This fragment was used to probe a second P. gingivalis genomic library. Clone pGPR 2 was shown to hybidise with the 307 bp probe. DNA sequence analysis revealed pGPR 2 contains a 5, 653 bp insert with seven open reading frames one of which shows significant DNA homology with the rnhB gene of <b>E.</b> coli. The <b>307</b> bp probe sequence was found to reside within an ORF predicted to encode a 455 amino acid (50 kDa) protein and this ORF was designated pgaA (P. gingivalis antigen). The predicted amino acid sequence of PgaA contains a putative ABC signature for binding NTPs as well as a predicted transmembrane domain. Subclones of pgaA in expression vector pTTQ 18 * were found to be reactive with a mAb specific for a 46 kDa species-specific antigen of the cell envelope of P. gingivalis (LDS 28) as well as Brick 190. One such subclone, pGPR 7 was also shown to express a 46 kDa protein reactive in western blots with mAb LDS 28. Minicell labelling of pGPR 2 -encoded proteins using pGPR 2 subclones revealed that pgaA directs expression of protein of multiple molecular weights (31 - 46 kDa) from its own promoter in E. coli, and that some of these forms may be caused by proteolysis of a 50 kDa precursor which itself shows a reduced apparent molecular weight (46 kDa) on SDS PAGE...|$|R

Analyzing CYP 21 A 2 gene mutations was so far not reported in Iraq. This work aims to analyze the spectrum and frequency of CYP 21 A 2 mutations among Iraqi CAH patients. Sixty-two children were recruited from the Pediatric Endocrine Consultation Clinic, Children Welfare Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq, from September 2014 till June 2015. Their ages ranged between one day and 15 years. They presented with salt wasting, simple virilization, or pseudoprecocious puberty. Cytogenetic study was performed for cases with ambiguous genitalia. Molecular analysis of CYP 21 A 2 gene was done using the CAH StripAssay (ViennaLab Diagnostics) for detection of 11 point mutations and > 50 % of large gene deletions/conversions. Mutations were found in 42 (67. 7 %) patients; 31 (50 %) patients were homozygotes, 9 (14. 5 %) were heterozygotes, and 2 (3. 2 %) were compound heterozygotes with 3 mutations, while 20 (32. 3 %) patients had none of the tested mutations. The most frequently detected mutations were large gene deletions/conversions found in 12 (19. 4 %) patients, followed by I 2 Splice and Q 318 X in 8 (12. 9 %) patients each, I 172 N in 5 (8. 1 %) patients, and V 281 L in 4 (6. 5 %) patients.
