40|$|Abstract: Novel {{electron}} accelerator techniques {{can be used}} to create <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>lasers</b> in a wide wave length interval extending to the X-ray region, i. e. providing an X-ray laser. Due to the coherent emission, very large intensities can be obtained, with peak brilliance ten orders of magnitude higher than in conventional synchrotron radiation. This opens completely new prospects for sciences that study material and molecular structures as well as their dynamics using the high time resolution. One should consider three-dimensional imaging, e. g. using holography, with very high space-time resolution â€” envisage the potential of femto-second snap-shots of atomic structures! We describe briefly the basic physics of <b>free</b> <b>electron</b> <b>lasers,</b> the present development and future plans, and discuss the potential applications. ...|$|R
