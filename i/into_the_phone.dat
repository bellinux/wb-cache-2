He was also known to frequently get naked and do various stunts for laughs. Chris Rock once claimed that he probably saw Farley's private parts more than Farley's girlfriend did.

25|$|On February 9, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was unable to unlock one of the mobile phones they had recovered because of the phone's advanced security features. The phone was an iPhone 5C owned by the county and issued to its employee, the shooter Farook. The FBI first asked the National Security Agency to break <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> but the NSA was unable to do so. As a result, the FBI asked Apple Inc. to create {{a new version of the}} phone's iOS operating system that could be installed and run in the phone's random access memory to disable certain security features. Apple declined due to its policy to never undermine the security features of its products. The FBI responded by successfully applying to a United States magistrate judge, Sherri Pym, to issue a court order, mandating Apple to create and provide the requested software. The order was not a subpoena, but rather was issued under the All Writs Act of 1789.|$|E

500|$|Sakai and Gimmick!s {{composer}} Masashi Kageyama held meetings over telephone {{regarding the}} music, the former being in Nagoya {{and the latter}} in Tokyo at the time. With the two having similar musical interests, and Kageyama being able to plug his Macintosh synthesizer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> {{it was easy for}} Kageyama to share with Sakai how the music sounded. Even though Kageyama had already felt comfortable with the musical layout and controls he used for two PC Engine games, Out Live and Benkei Gaiden, Sakai provided him with extended sound sources. Sakai encouraged Kageyama to push the limits of the sound chips, and so Kageyama used the maximum amount of sound channels possible.
