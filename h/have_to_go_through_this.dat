But {{when it rains}} there is superadded a squalor and an ill humour to all the party which makes it almost impossible for them not to quarrel before the day is over. To talk politics to Mrs. Bubbs under any circumstances is bad, {{but to do so}} with the conviction that the moisture is penetrating from your greatcoat through your shirt to your bones, and that while so employed you are breathing the steam from those seven other wet men at the door, is abominable. To <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> is enough to take away all the pride which a man might otherwise take from becoming a member of Parliament.

3000|$|The {{barrier of}} {{starting}} {{school in a}} language {{that is not the}} learners’ home language changes the focus of learning from being learner-centred to teacher-centred, and thus reinforces passiveness and silence in classrooms, which in turn suppress the young learners’ potential and liberty to express themselves freely. The language handicap created by this situation dulls the excitement of the young minds, inhibits their creativity and makes the learning experience unpleasant.

Well I’ve got 56 hours now, only 14 more to go, but they’ll be the toughest, most {{instruments}} and they are really rough around here. We’re allowed a variation of 3 ° in heading and 10 feet in altitude. Anything over that is failing. I’m so sorry to hear about Ken. I’m glad he’s better though. That sounds like a swell set up Nan 2 ̆ 6 Joe have. I envy them, it must be swell to have a soft job like that. Honey you’re very sweet to send me that check. I’ll use it for the suitcase, shoes, and probably some new underwear and socks, I guess I need them. Thank you ever so much, you’re too good to me angel. I’m the luckiest guy in the world to have a mother like you. So you liked “The Suspect” eh? I saw it too. It was marvelous. I saw “National Velvet” also, I though[t] that was very excellent. Say hello to the Van Alen’s for me when you see them. They sure are grand people. I know you’ll have a swell time with them. Let me know how you like the show. I’m so sorry Bobbie’s plans were delayed. Well it won’t be much longer, but it’s too bad she has to take Ricky. Maybe Mrs. Nisar can take him too. I’ll bet she does. That sounds like a good idea for the flowers. I think I will get Dottie white roses, and you and Dot gardenias. I’ll see about that next weekend. I have to get Harry a carnation (how do you spell it?) for his lapel don’t I? And what about Charlotte? I have to get her some flowers, too. Maybe red roses. What is she going to wear? Do I get her a bouquet? Boy I hope I never <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> again. This weekend I’m also going to get the rings and see the photographer. I’m going to have some Kodachromes taken. At least I won’t have to pay for him until I get the pictures. Well honey, I’ve got some homework to do. I miss you and am looking forward to seeing you so much. Give all my love to Nan and Bob. And to you I send a heartful angel. You’re so sweet to me. I love you with all my heart. Goodnight sweetheart— Your devoted Son Judd [Transcription ends...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Sunday 2030 My Darling, Just {{got back}} from Eglin Field. It was quite {{interesting}} they’ve got alot [sic] of stuff over there. We had a mail call while we were there, an AT- 7 flew down from Craig with a load. I’m sending you a letter we got from your mother. Tell her hello for me, and send her my love, she’s very sweet. I also {{got a letter from}} you written Thursday night. It didn’t sound like you honey, it was very disgusted and very bitter and I’m sorry. But darling it can’t be helped. The Army is running our lives and there’s {{nothing we can do about}} it. Keep that beautiful chin of yours up baby, don’t let it get you down, it’s much harder that way. Darling I’m making this promise to you that every minute, every second that we can be together we will be. We can’t afford to spend a second of our time thinking about the past of the future. What’s important is that we will have that time and we’ve got to pack into it a lifetime of laughs, of wonderful moments, and maybe a few sorrows. And if you think I’m going to live on the post you’re nuts, and if the Army thins so its nuts too. You bet I’m going to live with you darling, the Army or anyone isn’t strong enough to stop me. Honey we really have no right to complain, we’re really very lucky, there are many other couples who haven’t had the happiness that we are going to, and will never be able to. Darling we should thank God that we will have all those wonderful months together. We have had some tough weeks but we can’t be bitter about it. If we let that happen we’ll start blaming each other, and that’s the quickest way of breaking up a marriage. I can’t help what the Army does with me darling, from the job they’re doing over there I guess they know what they’re doing. All fighter pilots <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> and I’m glad to be getting it over with. It would be even tougher later wouldn’t it darling? So keep smilin’ baby, and I’ll see you Saturday. Yes, Saturday, I was going to surprise you but I guess you need some cheering up (conceited ain’t I?). If you feel a tenth as bad as I do darling, you sure must. It’s so damned lonesome around here anyway and being separated from you makes it so God damned much worse. Please darling tell me that you’re happy, because when you aren’t, I’m not. Remember honey, the most important thing in the world to me is you. I love you darling, I feel I should make some attempt to tell you how much, but I can’t. It’s as hard to grasp and as large as the infinity of the universe angel, and even Einstein can’t explain that, so how could I ever begin to. All I can tell you is I love you, I love you, again and again, and if I kept on from now ‘til doom’s day, and every “I love you” was materially a part of my love for you, I’d not have enough time darling. The time will pass honey. It will be the longest week of my life, but believe it or not science has proved that time waits for no one. I guess we’ve come the closest to disproving it though. Just think of the time we’ll have together, - it helps. And I will be able to live off the Post darling. It’s not exactly legal but what the Army doesn’t know won’t hurt it. I love you angel, I love you with all my heart. You have all my love all my life, my darling wife, and until Saturday honey, I remain, as always, Your devoted husband Judd P. S. – It’s the moments apart that make the moments together so much more enjoyable. [Translation ends...|$|E
