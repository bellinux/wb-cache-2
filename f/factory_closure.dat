50|$|This episode explores how {{the closing}} of the Electrolux factory in Greenville, Michigan had serious {{negative}} effects on the health of the community. The program ends by comparing the situation in Greenville with that of Västervik, Sweden, where workers who lost their jobs after an Electrolux <b>factory</b> <b>closure</b> fared much better due to income and educational supports.|$|E
50|$|In April 2017, Fettig {{was criticized}} by François Ruffin for {{planning}} {{to close down}} a Whirlpool factory in Amiens, France and opening a new one in Poland, where salaries are lower, while raising shareholder dividends by 10%.

50|$|In 1945, Orehoved Træ- og Finerindustri, a {{wood and}} veneer factory, {{opened in the}} harbour area, soon gaining an {{international}} reputation.

50|$|Political writer Naomi Klein {{has also}} criticized the {{transient}} nature of FTZs, noting the <b>factory</b> <b>closures</b> {{connected to the}} 1997 Asian financial crisis. She criticized the low wages and long hours, citing work days of twelve or more hours in Indonesia, Philippines, Southern China and Sri Lanka circa 2000.|$|R
50|$|Further local <b>factory</b> <b>closures</b> in {{the early}} 2000s saw {{unemployment}} on the estate reach around 15%, {{at a time when}} the national unemployment rate was around 5%, one major blow at this time being the downsizing of the Goodyear factory. The recession of 2008 and 2009 saw unemployment rise even higher.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Jews {{who survived the}} 1942-43 Ghetto liquidation programme in Kraków, came from the Deutsche Emaillewaren-Fabrik (DEF) owned by the Moravian-born war profiteer Oskar Schindler. Tipped off to the <b>factory</b> <b>closure,</b> Schindler persuaded the SS officials {{to allow him to}} move his 1,200 Jewish workers from the Kraków Ghetto to Brünnlitz (Czech: Brněnec) in Sudetenland, thus sparing them from certain death.|$|E
50|$|The bar {{was moved}} to the Fawdon factory (where it was planned to be {{manufactured}} after its initial manufacture at the John Mackintosh, Halifax factory), because of the Castleford <b>factory</b> <b>closure</b> (due December 2012). The last toffee crisp to be made in Castleford was on Thursday 15 December 2012, and from that day the toffee crisp equipment was sent over to Fawdon factory where it has continued to be produced.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Venom Thruxton or simply Thruxton, some surviving examples could be 'upgraded' replicas based on the Venom or Viper, as many parts in the range were interchangeable. Due to the high values involved and possibility of fakes, a register was established {{by a member of the}} Velocette Owners Club, using production data of engine and frame numbers acquired after the <b>factory</b> <b>closure,</b> to enable owners and potential buyers to confirm provenance when selling and buying.|$|E
25|$|It was not {{uncommon}} until the <b>factory's</b> <b>closure</b> for children to be seen playing in the dust {{in the streets and}} the local school's playground, making 'snowballs' which were thrown in ignorance of the danger they posed. Others used the thick layer of dust in the playground to mark out hopscotch squares.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, Smethwick {{attracted}} {{a significant number}} of immigrants from Commonwealth countries, the largest ethnic group being Sikhs from the Punjab in India.

Griffiths ran a campaign critical of both the opposition, and the government's, immigration policies.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s Harrington, like Plaxton and Readings offered small party coaches on Karrier and Commer {{delivery}} van chassis, whilst {{from the late}} 1950s until the <b>factory's</b> <b>closure,</b> Harrington was responsible for producing the Rootes Group's in-house PSV conversion of the Commer 1500 minbus.

5000|$|Kirkby Rent StrikeA 14-month-long rent strike {{initiated}} by 3,000 tenants on October 9, 1972 {{in the town}} of Kirkby, outside Liverpool, against the Housing Finances Act. caused a £1 rent rise.

50|$|Crown Lynn became Ceramco in 1974 and diversified into {{a series}} of new interests, {{including}} electronics, appliance wholesaling and making acquisitions including Bendon lingerie. Ceramco announced the Crown Lynn <b>factory</b> <b>closure</b> on 5 May 1989. By then staff numbers had fallen to between 180 and 220, and many amongst the largely female workforce believed that the Government had sabotaged the company by allowing cheap imported tableware into the country. Crown Lynn's share of New Zealand's domestic tableware market was then less than 20% in value, despite the company's successful move from {{the lower end of the}} market to a more middle ground.|$|E
50|$|The growing {{popularity}} of the cigarette was a large cause of the eventual decline of many cigar companies’ success in Allentown. Cigarette manufacturers were enjoying better success by the 1920s, {{and their ability to}} mass-produce the more economical cigarette proved to be too much of a competition for the cigar manufacturers. Against all odds, Bondy and Lederer continued to maintain their presence as a major Allentown cigar manufacturer until the 1960s. After the cigar <b>factory</b> <b>closure,</b> the site was used briefly as a knitting mill. After the knitting mill closed, 707 North 4th Street, along with many of its neighboring factory buildings, stood vacant.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s and 70s, at a {{time when}} there were few {{shopping}} malls and markets and little governmental regulation, the number of hawkers exceeded 300,000. Hawker numbers rose with the unemployment caused by the 1973-74 stock market crash and 1970s energy crisis, which led to <b>factory</b> <b>closures</b> and the decline of the manufacturing sector in Hong Kong.|$|R
5000|$|To {{address a}} serious {{unemployment}} {{issue in the}} local area caused {{as a result of}} the Rippon piano <b>factory's</b> <b>closure.</b> There is no doubt that local and national political influences had their part to play in this project as Ireland was in a deep recession at the time, although the Shannon project was doomed to failure in later years.|$|R
25|$|In the plant's last years, {{one of the}} few markets it {{had left}} was the {{restoration}} of historic buildings that had originally used it or similar materials. The <b>factory's</b> <b>closure</b> left those builders without any source of authentic material. In 2004 Edison Coatings, Inc., of Plainville, Connecticut, trademarked the brand Rosendale Natural Cement Products and began offering an authentic, historically accurate replacement.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{development}} {{had started}} much earlier - the Force 7 coupé {{was announced in}} 1974 but eventually only 10 pre-production coupés survived. By {{the time of the}} <b>factory</b> <b>closure</b> in 1974, one Force 7 was already in England for secret testing, Leyland Australia kept one example and finally donated that coupé to an Australian museum with some other components of the P76 production line and the remaining eight coupés were offered for sale to private buyers in an auction after the factory had closed. The handbooks had even been printed and were offered for mail order sale by the auctioneers. There was to have been a base six-cylinder Force 7, a more powerful Force 7V with the V8 unit, and a range-topping Tour de Force. All the surviving cars are the [...] "mid" [...] range Force 7V. It was unusual in that it had full seating for five adults and a large rear hatchback, {{the first of its kind}} produced in Australia. It shared few body panels with the sedan.|$|E
5000|$|This {{decision}} was, in part, {{based on}} the fact that the town of Colchester was located on what was considered a poor water source for manufacturing and was far from seaports and land transportation hubs. The decision to close the factory was kept secret from the employees and the people of the town of Colchester. George Watkinson was promoted to a Vice President position with The United States Rubber Company in the spring of 1983 and left the town of Colchester on a guise of going on vacation. He was replaced in Colchester by Joseph Banigan who oversaw the last of the production from the factory in Colchester as well as the <b>factory</b> <b>closure.</b> During the Christmas holiday in 1893 the factory employees and the people of the town of Colchester were told that the company was going to re-tool the factory and it would be opened after New Year. Instead of this happening, all the machinery was removed from the factory in Colchester and shipped to The United States Rubber Company’s holdings at Providence, Rhode Island. [...] A Colchester Advocate newspaper article in early 1894, editorialized, asked when was the factory was going to re-open. [...] When it became clear that the factory was going to stay closed, the town collapsed half of the population leaving and a majority of the businesses in the town subsequently closing.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Ford {{developed}} the Volvo-derived Five Hundred {{to replace the}} Crown Victoria in the retail marketplace. As Ford dominated the market for police cars and taxi vehicles at the time, Ford chose to continue the Crown Victoria {{for the purposes of}} securing fleet sales; retail customers still interested in full-size rear-wheel drive cars would be marketed towards Mercury and Lincoln. Sales of the Crown Victoria to retail customers plummeted as a result; only 3,000 were sold in 2006 (outselling only the Ford GT, and only by 1000 cars). When the Five Hundred was updated and rechristened as the 2008 Ford Taurus, {{the decision was made to}} end retail sales of the Crown Victoria in the United States entirely. A year later, as part of The Way Forward, Ford announced the closure of the Southwold, Ontario, Canada facility where the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis were assembled; production of the Lincoln Town Car had been relocated there as part of another <b>factory</b> <b>closure.</b> Production of all three cars would cease by the end of 2011; only the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor would have a direct replacement (a modified version of the Ford Taurus). With the end of production of the full-size rear wheel drive body-on-frame platform for the Crown Victoria and Lincoln Town Car, Ford is promoting the Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS flagships for consumers. Ford is also promoting the Transit Connect Taxicab to replace the Crown Victoria for urban taxi cab usage. Some taxi operators have expressed concerns about replacing the roomy Crown Victoria with smaller, more compact vehicles, due to a [...] "bumpier, more cramped ride" [...] and [...] "knee-bumping back seats and flimsier frames". For police pursuit use, Ford is promoting the Ford Taurus Police Interceptor and the Ford Explorer interceptor to replace the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor.|$|E
50|$|Pâteçassaïé was a {{brand of}} fluoride-free, herbal {{toothpaste}} produced in Bangui, Central African Republic, from 1923 until the <b>factory's</b> <b>closure</b> in 1966. The toothpaste was notable for {{being one of the}} first locally manufactured toothpastes in what was the French colony of Ubangi-Shari, and the formula was loosely based on dentifrice brands in Europe, whilst using a mixture of salt and local herbs.|$|R
50|$|From 1908 to 1923 Preston Car {{plant was}} located at 633 Margaret Street. After the <b>factory's</b> <b>closure</b> in 1923 the site became a casting plant (later as Kanmet Limited foundry) until 1991. A fire {{destroyed}} the foundry, {{and the site}} became a vacant brownfield. Part of the old industrial site was redeveloped as Legion Park, and the remainder will become a residential development known as Preston Meadows.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the once}} {{important}} paper mills, today only {{the company of}} Mayr-Melnhof Karton (MM Karton) in Hirschwang is still in operation. Numerous <b>factory</b> <b>closures</b> affected the working and social life of the region. For example, after {{the closure of the}} paper mill in Schlöglmühl, a television documentary was produced called Postadresse 2640 Schlöglmühl ("Postal Address 2640 Schlöglmühl") which portrayed the decline of the former paper industry.|$|R
