40|$|Increasing free {{movement}} {{could be seen}} as way to adress the stated creativity deficit, in that new ideas will result from the meeting of different minds. But {{free movement}} depends on an infrastructure that lets people move without having to change, without having to translate their present self into a new situation. The <b>free</b> <b>mover</b> is part of a selection with a shared similarity, which decreases the level of difference. The paper proposes that a better way to order the university as a place is by the principle of contiguity, because it increases the level of difference in a syntagmatic bringing together of entities...|$|E
40|$|European bi-national marriages as {{a special}} case of interethnic unions have {{received}} relatively little attention in research. Existing studies on interethnic marriage mainly orient on union formation among non-western migrants and in particular intermarriages between the majority group and non-western migrants, which are often perceived as indicators for integration. European intermarriages can nonetheless be of similar interest {{from the perspective of}} European integration and identity formation. In this article, we first study the patterns and trends in bi-national European marriages in Belgium. Second, we analyse the diversity in bi-nationally married couples, and third, we pinpoint the characteristics of these European couples. We use the Belgian marriage register data from 1989 to 2010 as well as the census data from 2001. Our findings show that European bi-national marriages are still relatively limited in Belgium and that their numbers (and proportion) have remained constant over time over the past decade. There is nevertheless variety in the level of intermarriage among different nationality groups. Our analyses point to six different types of European bi-national marriages with different characteristics of the partners and their place of residence. keywords: intermarriage; European mobility; European integration; bi-national marriages; <b>free</b> <b>mover...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{second problem}} that my account raises {{is how to}} handle mixed flows and mixed motives if {{admission}} claims need to be treated differently. When discussing the ethical principles that ought to guide admission policies I have distinguished refugees, economic migrants and <b>free</b> <b>movers</b> benefiting from interstate agreements. Empirically, these categories are, however, not neatly separate ones but overlap strongly. While I cannot imagine significant overlaps between refugees and <b>free</b> <b>movers,</b> there are very significant ones between refugees and economic migrants, on the one hand, and between the latter and <b>free</b> <b>movers,</b> on the other hand.|$|R
3000|$|I {{have argued}} that pre-connected migrants, <b>free</b> <b>movers,</b> {{economic}} migrants and refugees have distinct claims that liberal democracies must respond to.

50|$|Alumni {{relations}} {{efforts for}} study abroad {{and professional development}} organizations in Germany have historically been limited to each group reaching out to their specific alumni. However, approximately 80% of people from abroad who study or undertake professional training in Germany - a total of roughly 14,000 people per year - are “free movers”, organizing and financing their own program. Trying {{to get in touch}} with these <b>free</b> <b>movers</b> was a complicated and often fruitless effort.|$|R

30|$|The first {{question}} is whether a state exempts a whole category of migrants from immigration control. By doing so it creates two categories that we may call <b>free</b> <b>movers,</b> for whom international migration is not essentially different from internal mobility, and controlled migrants. Free movement for EU citizens provides the obvious illustration for the former, but similar arrangements exist between Australia and New Zealand and among ECOWAS and MERCOSUR member states. As we will see shortly, however, this category is much broader and has great potential for further expansion.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to define the {{competitive}} advantages of a strategic business unit (SBU) that is within the organization structure of the University of Economics, Prague (VŠE). The Central and East European Studies Program (CESP) operates as an SBU within VŠE. This is a one-semester paid program {{that is part of}} the of foreign language programs at the university. The program's advantages were defined on the basis of a survey of CESP's competition on the market for <b>free</b> <b>movers</b> in the Czech Republic, a SWOT analysis, and the evaluation of a survey of CESP's students. In the future, CESP should be promoted with a focus on these advantages and the program should be further developed accordingly so as to attract new students to VŠE...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} investigates how newcomer subjectivities are (re) {{constructed in}} the process of settling (physically and affectively) in a new city, by scrutinising the spatial, temporal and power configurations that emerge in the urban places within which arrival is enacted and negotiated. By building on theoretical stances that make a plea for relational and processual approaches (Desmond, 2014; Glaeser, 2005; Lancione, 2016) to the manifoldness and complexity of urban social reality, the paper argues in favour of focussing on the unfolding emotional interactions among subjects and contexts, so as to grasp the embodied and situated features of newcomers' place apprenticeship and place making. In this sense, it considers the potentialities of these approaches in fostering non-static yet contextual reconsideration of notion of place. The paper presents the empirical outcomes of a field enquiry based in the "cosmopolite" Brussels, carried on with migrants with very diverse mobility trajectories - forced movers, such as asylum seekers and <b>free</b> <b>movers,</b> such as expats (Favell, 2009) - to investigate with ethnographic attention to newcomers' lived experiences how human and non-human affective resources are found, made and reassembled to produce a sense of place in the new city (Massey, 1993). By promoting substantive disruptions of social and geographical determinism of migrants' categorisations, the aim is to shed light on the multiple operating mechanisms - and on their unequal functioning - that configure the processual dynamics between newcomers and their place of settlement...|$|R

40|$|Polluting the {{environment}} with carbon emissions {{will likely be}} no longer <b>free.</b> Early <b>movers</b> which start incorporating carbon thinking in business decisions will be winners in the low carbon future. Companies subject to carbon caps under a carbon trading scheme can either invests in carbon sequestration project and or buy carbon credits to offset their carbon liabilities. While Net Present Value (NPV) has been recorded as the most popular appraisal technique used across the globe for project valuation purposes, finance theorist suggests that using real options (RO) analysis is a more superior technique to value investment opportunities. Using case study data, this paper reveals how RO approach provides more strategic insights than traditional NPV in valuing carbon sequestration investments (termed carbonvestments) ...|$|R

2500|$|Miami-Dade Transit, {{a county}} {{department}} {{of more than}} 4,000 employees, is the largest transit agency {{in the state of}} Florida and accounts {{for more than half of}} the trips taken on public transit in the state. MDT operates an accessible, integrated system of 93-plus Metrobus routes; the [...] Metrorail rapid transit system; Metromover, a <b>free</b> downtown people <b>mover</b> system; and the Paratransit division’s Special Transportation Service. Metrobus routes cover more than 35-million miles annually, including limited service to Broward and Monroe counties. In 2004, MDT's Metrorail, Metromover, and Metrobus transported more than 96 million passengers, compared to 85 million the previous year.|$|R

40|$|Because {{of their}} highly {{developed}} skills, {{major league baseball}} players generate significant economic rents. According to the 'weak version' of the Coase theorem, the allocation of these players is independent of who controls the rights to these rents, which depends on the rules governing competition in the baseball labour market. The rules of Major League Baseball establish a dual system. For senior players the market is competitive, and players have the right of 'free agency,' allowing them to attempt to contract with the team of their choice; for players with fewer years of experience the market is monopsonistic, and a player's right to play baseball is owned by his current team. Consequently, we simultaneously observe two different allocations of property rights. Using individual player data for 1979 and 1980 we test whether baseball player movement is independent of the ownership of these rents. We estimate the wage (marginal revenue) determination process for free-agent and non <b>free</b> agent <b>movers</b> and non-movers. This permits us to generate expected gains from a move for both free-agent eligible and non free-agent eligible players. Coase's theorem is tested by determining if both player types, and, hence, player allocation, are equally responsive to gains from migration. ...|$|R
2500|$|Metromover is a <b>free,</b> {{automated}} people <b>mover</b> (automated guideway transit) system, {{similar to}} an elevated light rail, that operates on three loops totaling [...] of elevated track and 21 {{stations in the}} Central Business District, [...] "Omni", and Brickell. The main Inner Loop opened in 1986, and the Omni (north) and Brickell (south) extensions opened in 1994. The Metromover gained popularity significantly when the 25-cent fare was lifted in 2002. Since then it has been free to ride. Metromover is used heavily by those who live, work, or attend events in downtown, with ridership doubling from 2002 to 2014, {{as well as by}} tourists staying in downtown to get to attractions or just to get a free tour of the downtown cityscape. It is also used by those who commute into the city using Metrorail and Tri-Rail. Metrorail and Metromover are connected at the Government Center and Brickell stations, and even by construction workers commuting to downtown-area projects. Tri-Rail and Metrorail are connected at the Tri-Rail and Metrorail transfer station. Metromover headways vary from about two to five minutes depending on loop and overlap.|$|R
