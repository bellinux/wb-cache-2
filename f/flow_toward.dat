25|$|In general, in very humid or undeveloped regions, {{the shape}} of the water table mimics the slope of the surface. The {{recharge}} zone of an aquifer near the seacoast is likely to be inland, often at considerable distance. In these coastal areas, a lowered water table may induce sea water to reverse the <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the land. Sea water moving inland is called a saltwater intrusion. In alternative fashion, salt from mineral beds may leach into the groundwater of its own accord.|$|E
25|$|During the mid-Eocene, it is {{believed}} that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch. Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic, while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin. As the Andes Mountains rose, however, a large basin was created that enclosed a lake; now known as the Solimões Basin. Within the last 5–10million years, this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch, joining the easterly <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the Atlantic.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{affecting the}} monsoon {{is that the}} westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds {{in the form of}} the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated terrain features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the northern Indian plains, influencing the wind <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon.|$|E

In northern B.C. the Stikine, Nass and Skeena Rivers <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the Pacific Ocean, and Peace River flows northeast toward the Arctic Ocean. Hydroelectric resources in B.C. are highly developed, and pulp and paper and lumber mills are common throughout the province. The Fraser, Nass, and Skeena Rivers have not been dammed {{in order to protect}} the salmon runs on them. Rivers and their valleys have for a long time provided routes through the mountains for people in B.C.|$|E
500|$|The {{tropical}} cyclone was never well-organized, and after its formation, the convection became elongated. As {{the entire system}} moved northwestward, another circulation developed which eventually became the dominant center, causing the original circulation to dissipate. Midday on June2, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Andres. The next day, steering winds forced the storm east-northeastward, and on June 4, Andres attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). A trough bypassed the storm {{to the north and}} changed the steering <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the southeast. This produced a track paralleling the Central America coastline; such a track was considered [...] "unprecedented" [...] by the National Hurricane Center in the database for all eastern Pacific storms. Initially, the storm was expected to continue moving toward Mexico and Guatemala.|$|E

500|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the GTAW system depends {{largely on}} the type of metal being welded. [...] Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) is often employed when welding steels, nickel, titanium, and other metals. It can also be used in automatic GTAW of aluminum or magnesium when helium is used as a shielding gas. The negatively charged electrode generates heat by emitting electrons, which travel across the arc, causing thermal ionization of the shielding gas and increasing the temperature of the base material. The ionized shielding gas flows toward the electrode, not the base material, and this can allow oxides to build {{on the surface of the}} weld. Direct current with a positively charged electrode (DCEP) is less common, and is used primarily for shallow welds since less heat is generated in the base material. Instead of flowing from the electrode to the base material, as in DCEN, electrons go the other direction, causing the electrode to reach very high temperatures. To help it maintain its shape and prevent softening, a larger electrode is often used. As the electrons <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the electrode, ionized shielding gas flows back toward the base material, cleaning the weld by removing oxides and other impurities and thereby improving its quality and appearance.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{northern}} part of the province, between 53° and 54° north, all the waters of Alberta <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the Arctic Ocean.

[...] After descending northeastward to within a few miles of Lake Athabasca, it is met by a stream emerging from that lake. [...] The united river carrying down the waters of the Athabasca slope is called the Slave River, which, passing through Great Slave Lake, emerges as the great Mackenzie River, which falls into the Arctic Ocean.

2500|$|Turkey and Syria {{completed}} their first dams on the Euphrates – the Keban Dam and the Tabqa Dam, respectively – {{within one year}} {{of each other and}} filling of the reservoirs commenced in 1975. At the same time, the area was hit by severe drought and river <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> Iraq was reduced from [...] in 1973 to [...] in 1975. This led to an international crisis during which Iraq threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. An agreement was eventually reached between Syria and Iraq after intervention by Saudi Arabia and the Soviet Union. A similar crisis, although not escalating to the point of military threats, occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkey's hydroelectricity production. In 1984, Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least [...] per second, or [...] per year, into Syria, and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries. Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey. In 2008, Turkey, Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee (JTC) on the management of the water in the Tigris–Euphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.|$|E
2500|$|In certain {{situations}} where strong electroosomotic <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the cathode is undesirable, the inner {{surface of the}} capillary can be coated with polymers, surfactants, or small molecules to reduce electroosmosis to very low levels, restoring the normal direction of migration (anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode).

[...] One of the most common approaches to suppressing EOF, reported by Stellan Hjertén in 1985, is to create a covalently attached layer of linear polyacrylamide. [...] The silica surface of the capillary is first modified with a silane reagent bearing a polymerizable vinyl group (e.g. 3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane), followed by introduction of acrylamide monomer and a free radical initiator. [...] The acrylamide is polymerized in situ, forming long linear chains, some of which are covalently attached to the wall-bound silane reagent. [...] Numerous other strategies for covalent modification of capillary surfaces exist. [...] Dynamic or adsorbed coatings (which can include polymers or small molecules) are also common. [...] For example, in capillary sequencing of DNA, the sieving polymer (typically polydimethylacrylamide) suppresses electroosmotic flow to very low levels. [...] A variety of dynamic capillary coating agents are commercially available to modify, suppress, or reverse the direction of electroosmotic flow. [...] Besides modulating electroosmotic flow, capillary wall coatings can also serve the purpose of reducing interactions between [...] "sticky" [...] analytes (such as proteins) and the capillary wall. [...] Such wall-analyte interactions, if severe, manifest as reduced peak efficiency, asymmetric (tailing) peaks, or even complete loss of analyte to the capillary wall.|$|E

6000|$|... "Your orders? You're {{a lot of}} damned cowards," [...] Ditmar replied, {{and went}} on. There were mutterings here; herded together, these slaves were bolder; and hunger and cold, discouragement at {{not being able to}} stop the <b>flow</b> <b>toward</b> the mills were having their effect. By the frozen canal, the scene of the onslaught of yesterday, the crowd had grown {{comparatively}} thick, and {{at the corner of the}} lodging-house row Ditmar halted a moment, unnoticed save by a few who nudged one another and murmured. He gave them no attention, he was trying to form an estimate of the effect of the picketing on his own operatives. Some came with timid steps; others, mostly women, fairly ran; still others were self-possessed, almost defiant--and such he marked. There were those who, when the picketers held them by the sleeve, broke precipitately from their annoyers, and those who hesitated, listening with troubled faces, with feelings torn between dread of hunger for themselves and their children and sympathy with the revolt. A small number joined the ranks of the picketers. Ditmar towered above these foreigners, who were mostly undersized: a student of human nature and civilization, free from industrial complexes, would from that point of vantage have had much to gather from the expressions coming within his view, but to Ditmar humanity was a means to an end. Suddenly, from the cupolas above the battlement of the mill, the bells shattered the early morning air, the remnant of the workers hastened across the canal and through the guarded gates, which were instantly closed. Ditmar was left alone among the strikers. As he moved toward the bridge they made a lane for him to pass; one or two he thrust out of his way. But there were mutterings, and from the sidewalk he heard a man curse him.|$|E
