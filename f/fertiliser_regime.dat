Suggested hypotheses related to effects of grazing herbivores, site exposure or soil infertility. To test one of these, a 100 m 2 experimental plot was subjected to a <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> over a period of three years with a vegetation survey and soil analysis conducted {{at the outset of the}} research period (1965), in 1969 and in 1996. Plant cover within the experimental plot increased from 5 % (1965) to 100 % (1996), and was maintained at this level in a recent monitoring (2010). A change from acidophilic plants dominated by heather to a grass/moss assemblage was also recorded within the plot over the monitoring period. Within an unfertilised control plot set up in 1996, plant cover had increased from 25 % to 50 % (2010), although there was little change in composition of plant species...|$|E
40|$|Although {{white clover}} Trifolium repens L. {{contributes}} {{significantly to the}} New Zealand economy through nitrogen fixation and its nutritive value to stock, its productivity and persistance are restricted by many diseases and pests. A plant breeding programme has resulted in white clover genotypes of widely differing resistance to the clover cyst nematode Heterodera trifolii Goffart. The most important resistance mechanism operates after nematodes have penetrated roots: {{they are unable to}} progress beyond the J 2 stage. The few nematodes that do succeed in reproducing on resistant plants are smaller and produce fewer eggs than their counterparts on susceptible genotypes. Progeny of these successful individuals are more likely to succeed in parasitising resistant genotypes than is the broader H. trifolii population. Since considerable damage to seedlings may occur without establishment of a feeding site, resistant seedlings are not necessarily more tolerant of H. trifolii than are susceptible seedlings. Nevertheless, some seedlines exhibit high levels of both resistance and tolerance. Selection of an appropriate <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> was important to the experiments in this thesis and in resistance screening.

40|$|Agricultural {{fertilisation}} increases {{crop yields}} but can cause environmental damage, thus reductions in inorganic fertiliser application have been advocated. Farmer usage of phosphate rock has declined {{over the last}} decade, which may lead to soil nutrient depletion that undermines future crop production. We investigated the long-term (55 years) effects of eight different inorganic <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> at four sites: no phosphorous and potassium (PR) fertilisation or annual replacement of harvested PR, combined with 0, 50, 100, or 150 kg nitrogen (N) ha(- 1) yr(- 1) {{on a range of}} soil properties and microbial community composition. We also investigated whether differences in microbial community composition under different <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> arose from differences in underlying soil properties, changes in soil properties resulting indirectly from fertilisation, or directly from fertilisation. Reduced fertiliser application significantly reduced topsoil organic carbon and N, as well as plant-available R This significantly reduced sugar beet yields but had less impact on winter wheat. The different <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> had no significant effect on microbial community composition. Differences in soil properties as a result of fertilisation were less than differences between sites, and differences in microbial community composition were mainly explained by site. The results show that long-term inorganic fertiliser practices have little impact on microbial community composition, and lend support to research showing that microbial community composition is more influenced by organic matter inputs and underlying soil properties.

40|$|Vegetable {{production}} systems are characterised by intensive production with high inputs of nitrogen fertiliser and irrigation water. Consequently, high emissions of nitrous oxide have been reported. The use of nitrification inhibitors (NI) offers an effective method to reduce N 2 O emissions, whilst maintaining yield and increasing nitrogen use efficiency. However, only limited data are currently {{available on the}} use of NI in vegetable cropping systems. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of the nitrification inhibitor 3, 4 -Dimethylpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) in combination with reduced N fertilizer application rates on N 2 O emissions and yield from a typical vegetable rotation in sub-tropical Australia. Annual N 2 O emissions ranged from 0. 59 to 1. 37 kgN/ha for the different fertiliser treatments. A 40 % reduced fertilizer rate combined with DMPP reduced N 2 O emissions by more than half but achieved a comparable yield to the standard grower’s practice in two out of three crops. We conclude that DMPP shows a great potential for reducing N 2 O emissions from vegetable systems. However, further research is required to understand under what conditions reduced N rates of DMPP coated fertiliser are applicable and to determine the long-term effect of such a <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> over extended cropping cycles...|$|E
40|$|Livestock {{performance}} is {{based largely on}} nutrition {{in terms of both}} quality and quantity. Part of the quality issue relates to the mineral content of the feed grown which is dictated primarily by the natural mineralogy of a given soil and historical fertiliser inputs. Within the framework of pastoral organic beef farming, there is the ability to alter the mineralogy of the soil so that the feed grown has the full range of macronutrients and micronutrients within the recognised optimum ranges for beef cattle. Because plant nutrient requirements differ to those of livestock the mineral levels found in pasture are commonly excessive to animal requirements for some elements such as potassium and sulphur, which themselves can impact on the bioavailability of other elements such as calcium and magnesium in the case of excessive potassium, and copper and selenium in the case of excessive sulphur. As few soils have all 17 essential elements required by both plants and animals in the right ratios, understanding and correcting the imbalances that occur at the soil level so that neither plant or animal productivity are compromised is a key tool available to organic beef producers. Trace element deficiencies can also be addressed through their inclusion in the organic <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime,</b> and although often applied to the soil in inorganic forms, their uptake via the plant roots and subsequent translocation to the foliage in highly available organic complexes is the most natural way of providing grazing livestock with necessary minerals...|$|E
40|$|RONO: 2480 3015 The Broadbalk Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted Research in the UK {{provides}} {{a unique opportunity}} to investigate the long-term impacts of environmental change and agronomic practices on plants and soils. We examined the influence of manure and mineral fertiliser applications on temporal trends in the stable N (15 N) and C (13 C) isotopes of wheat collected during 1968 - 1979 and 1996 - 2005, and of soil collected in 1966 and 2000. The soil 15 N values in 1966 and 2000 were higher in manure than the mineral N supplied soil; the latter had similar or higher 15 N values than non-fertilised soil. The straw 15 N values significantly decreased in all N treatments during 1968 to 1979, but not for 1996 - 2005. The straw 15 N values decreased under the highest mineral N supply (192 kg N ha- 1 year- 1) by 3 from 1968 to 1979. Mineral N supply significantly increased to straw 13 C values in dry years, but not in wet years. Significant correlations existed between wheat straw 13 C values with cumulative rainfall (March to June). The cultivar Hereward (grown 1996 - 2005) was less affected by changes in environmental conditions (i. e. water stress and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime)</b> than Cappelle Desprez (1968 - 1979). We conclude that, in addition to fertiliser type and application rates, water stress and, importantly, plant variety influenced plant 13 C and 15 N values. Hence, water stress and differential variety response should be considered in plant studies using plant 13 C and 15 N trends to delineate past or recent environmental or agronomic changes.

30|$|Given the {{changing}} inputs of inorganic nutrients to many grassland soils, {{we felt it}} timely {{to determine whether the}} stoichiometry of the soil microbial biomass could be affected by an unbalanced nutrient supply and if we could experimentally show nutrient limitation of the soil microbial biomass. To do this we sampled plots from a long-term agricultural trial instigated in 1968 (Culleton et al. 2002). Phosphorus had been applied annually at 0, 15 and 30 kg ha− 1, with the plots split in 1999 to reduce P applications to half the high-P plots and increase P to half the low-P plots (as detailed below). Soil microbial biomass and its elemental CNP composition were measured and total soil C, N and P determined. In addition, respiration measurements were conducted to assess nutrient constraints at different fertilisation levels. This would test if differences in soil microbial biomass element ratios in an agricultural situation could provide an insight into nutrient limitation in terrestrial ecosystems (Cleveland and Liptzin 2007), or whether microbial biomass element ratios may be responsive to altered <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> (Scott et al. 2012).|$|R

We report on a time series of soil samples from Swedish long-term fertility trials started in 1957, 1963 and 1966, which were analyzed for the amount ofP. brassicaeDNA. The crop rotations included a brassica crop every 4 or 6 years. All experimental sites with a 4 -year rotation of oilseed rape, except one with calcium carbonate in the soil profile, showed high (> 1000 fg DNA g− 1 soil) levels ofP. brassicaeDNA after 9, 11 and 12 rotations. In contrast, detectable levels (> 5 fg DNA g− 1 soil) ofP. brassicaewere found only at one of five sites with a 6 -year rotation of spring oilseed rape. In years with high levels ofP. brassicaeDNA, low yield was reported and a subsequent decline inP. brassicaeDNA in soil was observed. Different NPK (nitrogen/phosphorus/potassium) <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> resulted in similarP. brassicaeDNA levels.

Following cultivation with different nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes,</b> multiple metabolomic data sets, including minerals, were produced and analysed using multivariate statistical methods to reveal the degree of similarity between the genotypes and to identify discriminatory compounds supported by multiple technology platforms. Results revealed little effect of nitrogen supply on metabolites related to quality, despite known yield differences. All platforms revealed unique metabolic signatures for each variety and many discriminatory compounds could be identified as being relevant to consumers in terms of nutritional value and taste or flavour. For each platform, metabolomic diversity was highly associated with genetic distance between the varieties. This study demonstrates that multiple metabolomic platforms have potential as phenotyping tools to assist breeders {{in their quest to}} combine key yield and quality characteristics.

40|$|Analyses {{of plant}} sap from organic {{greenhouse}} tomato crops {{show that the}} levels of phosphorus (P) are frequently low, {{despite the fact that}} soil analyses indicate P status in the soil to be good. In the present study, two soils (A and B) with a pH of just over 6 and a high total content of N and P were investigated with respect to release of P and uptake in a tomato crop. The fertilisers primarily used on soil A was silage and blood meal, and on soil B Vinasse and blood meal. An incubation experiment showed that the release of P per unit time was greater from soil A than soil B. This difference between the two soils may be due to lower soil organic matter concentration, with less P sorbed by Al and Fe on soil A, and a <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> which favours a high concentration of dissolved organic carbon in this soil. Tomato plants grown for 10 weeks in the soils had greater DW production, total uptake of P and concentration of P in the leaves on soil A than on soil B. Addition of citric acid to the soils in order to mobilise P increased plant yield and uptake of N and P on soil A. Despite the increased growth, the concentration of P in plant leaves increased and the N concentration was unchanged. On soil B addition of citric acid decreased Zn uptake in the tomato plants despite good availability, resulting in a lower concentration of this micronutrient in the leaves. The plants on soil A maintained their concentrations of all micronutrients analysed, but the ratio of P to micronutrients increased. Thus for commercial organic tomato growers, adding citric acid with the irrigation water offers a possibility to increase P availability...|$|E
40|$|Browsing by {{marsupial}} herbivores is a {{major problem}} in plantation forestry. This has traditionally been controlled through a reduction in herbivore numbers achieved by lethal means. The mammal browsing group at the University of Tasmania and the CRC for Forestry has been researching non-lethal alternatives for over a decade and found that the most effective methods involved manipulating seedling palatability prior to planting and in the field. Specifically, the use of naturally resistant seedling stock, chemical repellent, modification of nursery <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> and use of natural vegetation on coupes have all proven successful in deterring feeding. Additionally, since 2007, the use of mesh stockings to protect plantation seedlings has become quite popular within the forestry industry, but data to confirm their effectiveness in reducing browsing is lacking. This study combined extensive browsing research to operationally test the most effective combination of non-lethal methods listed above. Treatment combinations were planted in eight field sites across Tasmania. Experimental seedlings were planted in replicated blocks spread in a single row around the perimeter of operational coupes. Seedlings were monitored regularly for browsing damage, with seedling height and characteristics of the surrounding vegetation being assessed periodically. We found that the most effective treatments at reducing the severity of browsing damage in the short term were seedling stockings and a combination of chemical repellent (Sen-Tree) and low nursery fertiliser. Stockings and repellent were then tested in further trials to demonstrate the effectiveness of these treatments across a range of sites and during winter, as opposed to spring plantings. Here we used six field sites and followed the same basic design as the initial trial. Stockings and repellent were tested in isolation, in combination, and with versus without field application of repellent. We found that the combination of stockings and repellent was the most effective, and resulted in a significant delay in browsing and a reduction in browse severity over 24 weeks, compared with control seedlings. These results have important and immediate implications for tree growers. Stockings and/or repellent can be applied to seedlings in the nursery to significantly delay the onset of browsing and reduce its severity when planted in the field. In areas with low browsing intensity, this could be enough to reduce browsing in itself; in other areas the browsing delay could be enough to allow alternative controls to be implemented. The long-term effectiveness of stockings needs to be determined (e. g. effects on seedling growth and form) and the issue of continued repellent re-application needs to be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication is {{a problem}} {{receiving}} much attention within New Zealand and {{throughout the rest of}} the world. Problems associated with eutrophication cause major financial, aesthetic and recreational costs to not only commercial and recreational water users but to society in general. The major nutrient of concern in relation to eutrophication is phosphorus (P) as it is often considered to be the limiting factor. The two major areas from which P enters waterways are point sources and non-point sources. Point sources are relatively easy to identify and quantify. Non-point sources however, are less easy to quantify due to the size of areas from which P is sourced and the number of varying factors which can affect the amount of P which is lost to water-ways. This study investigated P concentrations in surface runoff and subsurface flow from steep east coast hill country. Factors studied included aspect, soil P status, season and fertiliser addition. The study was carried out on grazed pasture farmlets, in which there were 'High P' and 'Low P' fertiliser regimes. Each regime had north and south facing aspects. Four sites were used in the study. High P North (HPN), High P South (HPS), Low P North (LPN) and Low P South (LPS). Simulated rainfall was applied to the sites and surface runoff samples were collected and analysed for dissolved reactive phosphate concentration (DRP). Superphosphate fertiliser was then applied at 20 kg P ha- 1 to each site and the runoff procedure was repeated 7 weeks and 14 weeks the lower P soil test values on the south-facing slopes. A water extractable P test provided a better correlation with runoff DRP concentrations for individual runoff events than the Olsen P test. Both tests however, provided poor correlations when all of the Runs were combined. This was due largely to the large increase in DRP concentrations in surface runoff in Run 3 with no corresponding increase in soil tests. There was no apparent relationship between <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> i. e. soil P status, and the concentration of DRP in subsurface runoff. In Run 3 however, there was a marked increase in subsurface DRP concentration for both sites which was consistent with the surface runoff results and supported the theory of soil moisture playing a major role in determining the DRP concentration in water. The study suggests that the greatest risk of P loss from soil to surface waters will be from northerly aspects with high fertiliser histories during the summer months when soil moisture levels are low...|$|E

Fifteen years after the cessation of N additions soil chemistry, plant tissue chemistry, plant biomass and Ellenberg N values were assessed. Results KCl-extractable ammonium-N, total soil N, total organic carbon and microbial biomass N differed between the controls and the higher historic levels of N addition. Plant tissue chemistry showed no significant effects of previous N addition. Above-ground biomass was higher where N had been added, although this response was only weakly significant. The species composition of the vegetation showed effects of the N addition with mean Ellenberg N values significantly higher than the control in most treatments.

The leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus were in general with some exceptions also representative in relation to actual cropping sequence and hydrological conditions. However at one field the leaching of nitrogen was much higher than the long-term value. The main reasons seem to be high mineral nitrogen level in the soil profile after ploughing of ley (March- 07) followed by substantial summer discharge (June-July).

40|$|Phosphorus {{fertiliser}} {{is necessary}} to maintain the production of New Zealand hill country pastures. Technological advances in GIS and GPS have given aerial fertiliser applicators more precision than ever before. The key question is; {{to what extent do}} soil chemical properties vary within hill country landscapes, and is a knowledge of the variability able to be used to differentially apply fertiliser, maximise P fertiliser use efficiency, and minimise P loss to waterways? The objective of this thesis was to quantify the phosphorus variability on Blue Duck Station, a summer-moist hill-country farm located in the Central North Island of New Zealand. The soil comprised Allophanic Soil (Andisols) on the flat to low slopes with Brown Soil (Inceptisols) on the steeper hills. Blue Duck Station was delineated into six soil-landscape groups (north facing medium slopes, north facing steep slopes, south facing steep slopes, south facing medium slopes, flat ridge tops, and flat valley floors, based on slope, aspect, and elevation using GIS. Three replicate units were randomly selected from each of the six soil-landscape groups, which gave 18 study-sites in total. For each study site, one transect sample and five grid samples were collected. Olsen P, Anion Storage Capacity, pH, Sulphate-sulphur and Cations (Mg, Na, K, Ca) were determined. The Olsen P ranged from a mean of 6. 8 in the south facing medium slopes to 21. 2 in the north facing medium slopes. North facing medium slopes and valley low floors had higher mean Olsen P values than all other landscape groups (P< 0. 01) and also had the greatest variability in Olsen P values. The majority of Olsen P values were considered ‘low’ or ‘very low’. Soil pH was consistent, ranging between 5 and 5. 4, whilst anion storage capacity (ASC) levels ranged from 35 % to 85 %. High ASC levels indicated soils of volcanic origin, containing tephra, whereas low ASC levels were associated with soil predominantly derived from tertiary sedimentary rock. At Blue Duck Station, the application of higher rates of P fertiliser to south facing steep slopes and south facing medium slopes, with medium rates of P fertiliser addition to north facing steep slopes and ridge low slopes would optimise fertiliser use. There is limited benefit in applying fertiliser to north medium slopes and flat valley floors as Olsen P is near optimal for this environment and stock transfer will continue to add nutrients to these areas. The variability within a sample site (between grid and transect samples) was often greater than the range of variability the means across all the landscape groups. Due to such large sample variability, difficulties arise when attempting to recommend accurate <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime,</b> or sampling programs. The soil analysis results from a small number of samples should be treated with caution. The Best Management Practice for soil sampling the Central North Island Hill Country would be to avoid sampling small exceptional areas like flat valley floors and flat ridge tops. Focusing sample regimes on a number of transects across northern and southern slopes would give more representative results...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{of disease}} {{epidemiology}} {{and the impact}} of plant nutrient status on development of disease is fundamental in establishing effective management strategies for crop pathogens such as Podosphaera aphanis Br. (Braun et al., 2002), the causal agent of powdery mildew on strawberries. The following study investigated the conditions conducive for powdery mildew in strawberry crops in South Australia, the effect of foliar concentration of potassium and calcium on yield and pathogen development on the strawberry cultivars Aromas (resistant to powdery mildew) and Selva (susceptible), the potential for use of foliar-applied potassium silicate to control disease and identification of genes differentially expressed during disease. Meteorological conditions associated with establishment of powdery mildew were observed over three consecutive seasons in commercial strawberry crops grown in Woodside, South Australia. Conducive conditions appear to be > 28 oC, 10 oC, > 90 % RH and no rain (for germination). Colony development was then promoted by days of > 15 oC and 8 oC, > 80 % RH and less than 2 mm rain in every 24 hour period. These are consistent with epidemiological studies of this pathogen (Peries, 1962 a; Jhooty and McKeen, 1964; Mukerji, 1968; Perera and Wheeler, 1975; Byrne et al, 2000; Miller et al, 2003; Blanco et al, 2004; Davik and Honne, 2005; Amsalem et al, 2006). This knowledge may facilitate prediction of times considered high risk for establishment of powdery mildew in strawberry crops. Subsequently, this may allow optimisation of fungicide application and improved management of this disease and reduced yield loss and management expenses. P. aphanis developed at an increased rate on leaves of Selva with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised leaves. Increased numbers of conidia germinated successfully on leaves of Aromas with low calcium content compared with development on normally fertilised Aromas leaves, however, the germinated conidia still failed to develop into sporulating colonies. Potassium nutrition had no obvious effect on P. aphanis development. Foliar concentration found to be adequate for growth of cultivars, Selva and Aromas were 6. 0 mg/g and 4. 5 mg/g Calcium, dry weight and 11. 0 mg/g and 12. 5 mg/g potassium, dry weight (respectively). Potassium silicate, buffered to pH 7. 0 and applied as a foliar fertiliser, reduced the severity of powdery mildew below the economic threshold, though not below the disease severity on plants treated with the fungicide, Systhane® (Bayer CropScience). As potassium silicate can be produced organically this compound may provide a useful management tool for both organic and conventional strawberry growers. Although the cultivar Aromas was not immune to disease under conducive conditions and high inoculum load in the field, inoculation of healthy Aromas plants with P. aphanis in the laboratory failed to produce disease. Conidia were seldom found attached to the leaf surface of healthy Aromas leaves. Germination and subsequent colony development were also not observed in inoculated samples. This suggests there is some mechanism of Aromas that inhibits development of this fungus. Preliminary investigation of differential expression in Aromas inoculated with P. aphanis, identified sequences with homology to a putative antimicrobial protein and photosynthesis-related genes. The results of these studies should enable growers to increase both crop yields and control of powdery mildew, one of the major economic diseases in South Australia. The epidemiological knowledge attained will be valuable, and may provide the basis for future forecast modelling for P. aphanis in strawberry crops in South Australia. Recommendations for calcium and potassium leaf content will allow growers to monitor their <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> for increased yield of these cultivars. Aromas was identified as a powdery mildew resistant cultivar potentially suitable for production in South Australia, and the genes associated with this resistance response may be used in studies of Fragaria species and breeding for powdery mildew resistant cultivars.

40|$|The {{effects of}} nine soil {{treatments}} on the storage potential of 'Hayward' kiwifruit were examined over three consecutive seasons at sites in Palmerston North and Te Puke, New Zealand (NZ). The treatments comprised three ground covers (viz. bare, grass and mulch), in factorial combination with three fertiliser regimes (viz. conventional, organic and organic plus (= organic + gypsum)). Each season, several fruit and vine attributes were measured at harvest {{and the subsequent}} softening behaviour of fruit was evaluated during storage. In {{the second and third}} seasons, several soil, fruit and vine attributes were also monitored before harvest. At both sites, significant and consistent differences were observed in many of the soil attributes that were measured. In particular, conventional plots often contained more inorganic nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) than organic and organic plus plots while organic plus plots nearly always contained more calcium (Ca) than conventional plots. Bare soil consistently contained less moisture, and experienced higher 2. 00 pm and lower 6. 00 am temperatures, than covered soil, while the mulch increased the surface rooting of vines. The soil amendments also had some consistent, though not statistically significant, effects on the mineral composition of vines, especially in the third season. In particular, fruit and leaves from conventional plots tended to contain more N and K but less Ca than those from organic and organic plus plots while fruit and leaves from grass plots consistently contained less N than those from bare and mulch plots. Of all the soil amendments, grass had the largest effect on fruit storage behaviour i. e. fruit associated with that amendment were consistently firmer throughout storage and developed significantly less [i. e. fewer] soft patches than fruit from bare and mulch plots. Although fruit from conventional plots tended to soften slightly more rapidly and develop more soft patches than fruit from organic and organic plus plots, the differences were never significant. Generally, soil, vine and fruit attributes did not differ significantly with the interaction of ground cover and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime.</b> In addition to the above work, in 1996 only, fruit were sampled from ten pairs of organic and conventional (i. e. Kiwigreen) orchards throughout the Bay of Plenty in NZ, to compare the responses of those fruit to typical postharvest handling and storage regimes and their compositional attributes. Generally, fruit from conventional orchards were harvested more mature, as indicated by soluble solids concentrations (SSC), although the average firmness of fruit from the two systems did not differ significantly. The average concentrations of N, K, magnesium (Mg) and phosphorous (P) in fruit did not differ significantly with production system. However, organic fruit often contained more Ca with the average difference being on the borderline of significance. Despite differences in maturity, whole fruit softening did not differ significantly with production system. On the other hand, fruit from organic orchards nearly always developed less soft patches than fruit from conventional orchards with the average difference being significant. This difference may have been partly due to the difference in the Ca concentration of fruit. Typical postharvest handling practices, compared to harvesting directly into trays, did not significantly affect whole fruit softening but did significantly decrease the incidence of soft patches, for reasons that are not clear. Across all the grower lines, the incidence of soft patches was significantly and negatively associated with the average concentrations of Ca in fruit. Combinations of other fruit attributes (i. e. SSC, initial firmness and the concentrations of N and Mg) with Ca concentration, produced indicators that were very strongly associated with the incidence of soft patches. These attributes would appear to be important in the development of soft patches. If these relationships are subsequently shown to be consistent, then they could form the basis for a predictive tool that would allow at-harvest segregation of fruit lines with different storage potentials. In all of the current work, fruit that developed soft patches consistently contained less Ca than healthy fruit. It therefore seems that enhancing the Ca content of fruit could be beneficial to fruit storage life. However, it appears that under some conditions at least, the uptake of minerals, particularly Ca, may be constrained at the root level and so manipulating the soil environment may not always guarantee an improvement in the storage potential of kiwifruit...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{is a major}} {{nutrient}} needed to attain optimal grain yield (GY) in all environments. Nitrogen fertilisers represent a significant production cost, in both monetary and environmental terms. Developing genotypes capable of taking up N early during development while limiting biomass production after establishment and showing high N-use efficiency (NUE) would be economically beneficial. Genetic variation in NUE has been shown previously. Here we describe the genetic characterisation of NUE and identify genetic loci underlying N response under different N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> in a bread wheat population of doubled-haploid lines derived from a cross between two Australian genotypes (RAC 875 × Kukri) bred for a similar production environment. NUE field trials were carried out at four sites in South Australia and two in Western Australia across three seasons. There was genotype-by-environment- by-treatment interaction across the sites and also good transgressive segregation for yield under different N supply in the population. We detected some significant Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with NUE and N response at different rates of N application across the sites and years. It was also possible to identify lines showing positive N response based on the rankings of their Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) within a trial. Dissecting {{the complexity of the}} N effect on yield through QTL analysis is a key step towards elucidating the molecular and physiological basis of NUE in wheat.

40|$|Extracts of soil {{are used}} to provide {{estimates}} of plant-available nitrogen sources such as nitrate, ammonium and amino acids (low molecular weight nitrogen, LMW-N). Soil extracts are a blunt tool; they introduce a number of inaccuracies through soil disturbance, and do not indicate the rapidity of N pool turnover. Microdialysis is used predominantly in neuroscience but was recently introduced in soil research. Small in situ probes cause minimal disturbance, and passive diffusion of solutes across a semi-permeable membrane allows dialysate to be collected over time allowing study of nutrient flux dynamics. This sampling mode is functionally similar to plant roots, and may provide a good estimate of the N forms available to roots. We used microdialysis to quantify induced diffusive fluxes of LMW-N in a subtropical agricultural soil under three <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes.</b> Shifts in LMW-N fluxes were detected over time, suggesting the formation of depletion zones around the probe surface similar to those associated with roots. A pronounced difference was observed between results from microdialysis and soil extracts. In dialysate, amino acids contributed up to 70 % of LMWN in unfertilised soil and 5 - 20 % in fertilised soils. In contrast, amino acids were a minor constituent in soil extracts, highlighting that soil extracts underestimate amino acid availability in soils. Modelling plant N uptake based on soil N fluxes and root uptake kinetics, we show that use of inorganic N in fertilised soil was constrained by the root’s uptake. In contrast, fluxes of amino acids and the root’s uptake capacity were closely matched...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{analysis}} {{of economic and}} environmental performance of horticultural crop production requires qualified assumptions {{on the effect of}} management options, and particularly of nitrogen (N) fertilisation, on the net returns of the farm. Dynamic soil-plant-environment simulation models for agro-ecosystems are frequently applied to predict crop yield, generally as dry matter per area, and the environmental impact of production. Economic analysis requires conversion of yields to fresh marketable weight, which is not easy to calculate for vegetables, since different species have different properties and special market requirements. Furthermore, the marketable part of many vegetables is dependent on N availability during growth, which may lead to complete crop failure under sub-optimal N supply in tightly calculated N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> or low-input systems. In this paper we present two methods for converting simulated total dry matter to marketable fresh matter yield for various vegetables and European growth conditions, taking into consideration the effect of N supply: (i) a regression based function for vegetables sold as bulk or bunching ware and (ii) a population approach for piecewise sold row crops. For both methods, {{to be used in the}} context of a dynamic simulation model, parameter values were compiled from a literature survey. Implemented in such a model, both algorithms were tested against experimental field data, yielding an Index of Agreement of 0. 80 for the regression strategy and 0. 90 for the population strategy. Furthermore, the population strategy was capable of reflecting rather well the effect of crop spacing on yield and the effect of N supply on product grading...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{formulate}} an integrated disease management (IDM) strategy for winter sports turf. (Winter sports turf, or coarse turf, consists primarily of perennial rye grass, Lolium perenne, which is used for football, rugby and hockey pitches because of its wear tolerant characteristics). IDM involves the use of a number of control strategies to suppress disease economically and efficiently. Such strategies incorporate cultural, biological, genetic, legislative and chemical control. In order to formulate a successful disease management strategy, all the significant diseases affecting winter sports turf and the effects of different management strategies on these target pathogens needed to be identified and collated. This was achieved by a comprehensive questionnaire survey to professional football clubs (who require a high level of turf maintenance) and local authorities (moderate/low maintenance). The questionnaire sought information regarding disease, pest and weed incidence, control measures employed and general problems, e. g. drainage, wear and routine management practices. Red thread, Laetisariafiiciformis, and Fusarium patch, Microdochium nivale appeared to be the most ubiquitous diseases on winter sports turf. Some important management practices that suppress red thread can, however, encourage Fusarium patch, e. g. the application of nitrogenous fertiliser. A series of experiments and field trials have been initiated to identify a number of specific factors which manage to effectively suppress both diseases. A field trial involving the use of species mixtures, perennial rye grass and smooth stalked meadow grass (Poa pratensis), illustrated that genetic diversity can help to reduce both red thread and Fusarium patch compared to turf grown in monoculture. The amount Fusarium patch and red thread cover indicated that disease severity was significantly lower in dual species stands as compared to monoculture. A mixture comprising 50 % perennial rye grass and 50 % smooth stalked meadow grass appeared the most effective at suppressing disease incidence. Similarly, mixtures of three perennial rye grass cultivars appeared more successful at suppressing slight outbreaks of red thread as compared to bi-blends and monoculture. In addition, individual perennial rye grass cultivars also vary in tolerance to red thread. One hundred and ten cultivars, under three different nitrogen regimes were assessedto determine which were the most disease resistant. The cultivars, received artificial football type wear treatment throughout the winter, to determine if red thread incidence predisposes rye grass to be less wear tolerant. The results indicate that a number of cultivars tolerant to red thread throughout the summer were also more resistant to wear. These cultivars included Quickstart, DelDwarf and Brightstar. Wear tolerance was also increased under a moderate nitrogen level (150 kg/ha/yr). Finally, a field trial investigating the effect of nitrogen rate on red thread and Fusarium patch incidence on five different constructions for football pitches was set down. Both diseases appeared to be efficiently suppressed under a moderate/high nitrogen level (N= 225 kg/ha/yr). The 'pipe/slit' construction type also appeared to contain both diseases effectively, whilst sustaining a healthy, vigorous sward throughout the Winter when subjected to artificial football-type wear treatment. In addition to the field studies, an investigation to isolate potential microbial antagonists for use as biocontrol agents against Fusarium patch was undertaken; Fusarium patch was identified as the most economically important disease on winter sports turf from the original survey. A number of known antagonists and indigenous fungi and bacteria isolated from the phylloplane and rhizosphere of Lolium perenne were screened in vitro on turfgrass extract agar against Fusarium patch. This in vitro assay identified which species effectively suppressed disease growth. These potential antagonists were further tested in vivo to determine efficacy under field conditions. Fungi from the genus Trichoderma and bacteria from the genera Bacillus and Pseudornonos appeared the most effective antagonists against Fusarium patch in the in vivo study. In all cases where an antagonist was present, Fusarium patch severity was significantly lower than the untreated control, e. g. the indigenous Bacillus sp. reduced disease severity by 76. 1 %. The results obtained from the field trials are encouraging and suggest that the use of species/cultivar mixtures, disease tolerant cultivars and a balanced <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regime</b> on a freely-draining construction type can successfully be incorporated into an IDM plan. An IDM strategy will help to effectively suppress both red thread and Fusariurn patch on winter sports turf. Biological control of Fusariurn patch was successful on an experimental basis, although further research is required to identify an appropriate formulation and optimum application technique for successful commercial use. The use of IDM on winter sports turf will help reduce reliance on chemical control, may delay the onset of fungicide resistance and reduce non-target impacts of fungicides. IDM will also help limit the need for potentially hazardous chemicals in recreational areas open to the public...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{microbial}} {{communities can}} influence plant productivity, chemistry and even diversity. Intensive farming practices have caused widespread soil degradation, raising concerns regarding soil health {{and need for}} sustainable agriculture. Although soil microbe-plant interactions have been extensively studied, the relationships between soil microbial communities and higher trophic levels, such as herbivorous insects, are poorly understood. This thesis reports {{the findings of a}} series of mesocosm experiments which used a model system of Derby Day cabbages (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata), peach-potato aphids (Myzus persicae), and soil sourced from an agricultural field site. Firstly, I conducted an exploratory study of the soil microbial community response to different <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> and cabbage growth using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of the 16 S rRNA gene. This was complemented by concomitant measurements of the plant and aphid performance in order to identify potential soil-plant-insect relationships. The results revealed that the diversity and composition of bacterial communities were more strongly influenced by the cabbage age and fertiliser treatment than aphid herbivory. Several bacteria exhibited enhanced abundance in rhizosphere of older cabbages, including sulphur-oxidising bacteria (SOB) of the Thiobacillus genus. A member of this genus was then selected as an inoculant in the subsequent experiment to test its plant growth promoting potential for B. oleracea. Brassica plants produce a class of secondary metabolites called glucosinolates, which have multiple beneficial properties including anti-herbivory and anti-carcinogenic attributes. As this compound is rich in sulphur (S), it was hypothesised that soil inoculation with the SOB Thiobacillus thioparus may enhance glucosinolate production in B. oleracea, thereby improving its defence against aphid feeding. Analysis revealed a promotional effect of enhanced SOB populations on glucosinolate content of leaves. Although an accompanying significant effect on aphid populations was not detected, this experiment shows the potential for the modulation of plant chemical defences by the soil microbial community...|$|R
40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted on the effect of nutrition on flowering of sugarcane plants used for breeding new varieties. Some problems with panicle emergence and survival being experienced at Mount Edgecombe are presumed to be due to incorrect nutrition of the cane plants. A preliminary investigation by the author revealed that nutrient balances within the plant could {{play an important role in}} the flowering of potted sugarcane plants. This prompted a further investigation into the impact of nutrition on panicle and seed production in the crossing programme at Mount Edgecombe. Potted plants of variety N 29 were grown in 10 <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> involving two calcium, magnesium and micronutrient (CaMgMicro) treatments (−/+) by five macronutrient treatments. Four macronutrient treatments involved the removal of N, NK, NP, or NPK from the fertiliser used during plant establishment, while in the fifth treatment plants received NPK until anthesis. The fertiliser treatments significantly influenced the flowering and seed set of N 29. No significant difference was observed between treatments for panicle initiation. Weekly application of nitrogen or CaMgMicro until anthesis significantly increased flowering, and a significant phosphorus by CaMgMicro interaction was observed. The application of potassium when CaMgMicro was not applied delayed flowering significantly. Weekly application of nitrogen until anthesis significantly reduced the percent pollen stained as well as the number of viable seeds per gram of fuzz. However, stalks receiving nitrogen or CaMgMicro until anthesis produced significantly heavier panicles, and significant interactions involving phosphorus, potassium and CaMgMicro were observed. Significantly more viable seeds were obtained per panicle or per gram of fuzz where potassium or CaMgMicro were not applied until anthesis. In addition, more viable seeds per panicle were obtained when no CaMgMicro was applied...|$|R
40|$|There {{is concern}} over the {{sustainability}} and environmental impact of mineral fertilisers and crop protection inputs used in intensive arable crop production systems. However, replacing mineral with organic fertilisers (animal and green manures) and restricting the use of chemosynthetic crop protection may significantly reduce crop yields. The effects of (a) replacing mineral with composted cattle manure fertiliser input and (b) omitting pesticide-based crop protection on potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber yield, leaf and tuber mineral nutrient content and leaf protein profiles were investigated. Switching to organic fertiliser had a greater effect on yield and protein profiles than the omission of chemosynthetic crop protection. Leaf N and P composition were significant drivers of protein expression, particularly proteins involved in photosynthesis such as the large subunit of RuBisCO, RuBisCO activase and the photosystem I reaction centre, which were at higher abundances in potato leaves grown under mineral <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes.</b> Proteins known to be induced in response to stress, such as dehydroascorbate reductase and Glutathione S-transferases, were also shown to be up-regulated under mineral fertilisation, possibly associated with higher Cd composition, whereas two proteins known {{to be involved in}} biotic stress (1, 3 -β-d-glucan glucanohydrolase; putative Kunitz-type tuber invertase inhibitor) were more abundant under compost fertilisation. Results showed that switching from mineral to organic fertilisers led to reduced N availability, a significant change in leaf protein expression and lower tuber yield. In contrast, omission of chemosynthetic crop protection inputs had limited effects on protein expression and no significant effect on tuber yield. This study provides information on the effects of changes in nutrient supply on protein expression patterns. It is a prerequisite for the development of functional molecular markers for a directed strategy to inform breeding programmes to improve potato nutrient use efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the agricultural and downstream processing sectors in the New Zealand economy, there is no tradition of using partial or general equilibrium models to evaluate policies or other measures directed at the agricultural sector. Policy-makers have instead relied on the development of ad hoc scenarios of land use change, farm budget models, and simple multiplier analysis of flow-on effects. To redress this situation, we have developed a catchment-scale partial equilibrium framework based on the US REAP model, which we have thus far calibrated for two different catchments. In this paper, we present an application of the model to the Hurunui Catchment in North Canterbury in which we assess several scenarios for the development of irrigated area under several water storage options. This application is timely, given that there are increasing pressures on water resources in the catchment, and frequent conflicts between abstractive users (mainly pastoral), recreational users (e. g. kayaking, fishing) users, and environmental needs. Currently, a private consortium are pursuing storage options similar to those that we have modelled, while a newly constituted Water Management Zone Committee is tasked with developing a strategic approach to managing water in the Hurunui and adjacent Waiau catchments. In addition, water quality limits are also being developed in the Hurunui catchment. Our modelling approach includes pastoral (dairy, sheep, beef and deer), arable, horticultural and forestry enterprises along with an array of management including various irrigation and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes.</b> The model allows us to test policy scenarios for addressing environmental issues such as mitigating climate change and improving water quality, and changes in resource constraints such as water availability. Using a profit maximizing objective function we compare the impact of the proposed irrigation scenarios in the Hurunui catchment on total catchment profits and a variety of environmental parameters like greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient losses.

40|$|Crop {{recovery}} of nitrogen (N) fertiliser in flooded rice systems is low relative to fertiliser N recoveries in aerobic crops, and the N losses have environmental consequences. Recent water shortages {{across the globe}} have seen a move towards alternative water management strategies such as delayed permanent water (DPW, also known as delayed flood). To investigate whether N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> used in DPW systems result in greater {{recovery of}} N fertiliser than traditional continuously flooded (CF) rice systems, we conducted a multi-N rate field trial using 15 N-labelled urea. Around 27 % of the 15 N-labelled fertiliser was recovered in aboveground biomass at maturity, regardless of water <b>regime</b> or N <b>fertiliser</b> rate, and approximately 20 % recovered in the soil to 300 mm depth. Plants in the CF system accumulated more total N at each rate of applied N fertiliser than plants in the DPW system due to greater exploitation of native soil N reserves, presumably because the earlier application of N fertiliser in the CF systems led to greater early growth and higher crop N demand. The greater crop biomass production {{as a result of}} higher N uptake in the CF system did not increase grain yields above those observed in the DPW system, likely due to cold weather damage. In the following season at the same site, a single N rate (150 kg N ha− 1) trial found no significant differences in crop N uptake, biomass yields, grain yields or 15 N-labelled urea recovery in DPW, CF and drill sown-CF (DS-CF) treatments. However, owing to higher 15 N fertiliser recovery in the 0 – 100 mm soil horizon, total plant + soil recovery of 15 N was significantly higher in the CF treatment (63 %) than the DS-CF and DPW treatments (around 50 % recoveries). The loss of 40 – 50 % of the applied N (presumably as NH 3 or N 2) in both seasons regardless of watering regime suggests that new fertiliser N management strategies beyond optimising the rate and timing of urea application are needed, particularly in light of increasing N fertiliser prices...|$|R
30|$|In {{agricultural}} systems {{the natural}} biogeochemical cycles can be supplemented {{by the addition}} of readily available, inorganic fertilisers. Agricultural productivity in Ireland has historically been limited by P, but the application of fertiliser P, which peaked in the 1970 s, has resulted in an increase in levels of available soil P such that about 50 % of Irish grassland soils no longer respond to added P (Culleton et al. 2002). Overall fertiliser consumption in Ireland is now falling, from 430, 000, 62, 000 and 151, 000 tonnes N, P, K respectively (N:P 6.9) in 1994 to the latest available figures of 307, 000, 20, 000 and 52, 000 tonnes (N:P 15.2) in 2008 (DAFF 2008). In 2002 Irish grasslands received an average of 123, 11 and 27 kg N, P, K ha− 1 year− 1 (N:P 11.2) (Coulter et al. 2004). Even so, the majority of P in typical grassland soil is present as organic P which represents a large pool of potentially available nutrient (Bourke et al. 2008). Although the agronomic objective of the added nutrients is to increase plant production, they will also be available to the soil microbial biomass. The soil microorganisms will see an indirect increase in soil C, from increased rhizodeposition and increased residue incorporation from the extra plant growth, and a direct increase in N and P from the added nutrients. Microorganisms can compete effectively with plants for these nutrients (Schimel et al. 1989; Zak et al. 1990). Applied inorganic N, for example, is rapidly taken up by the soil microbial biomass (Nannipieri et al. 1990) which can be limited by nutrients and not just C (Kaye and Hart 1997; Wang and Bakken 1997), although the outcome of the plant–microorganism competition depends on the spatial heterogeneity of the system (Korsaeth et al. 2001). Previous work on cut, rather than grazed, grassland showed clearly that both microbial biomass P and the biomass C:P ratio were sensitive to long-term (> 100 years) <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> (He et al. 1997). Growth experiments using environmental isolates of bacteria recently demonstrated that their stoichiometry is very flexible, with a four-fold change in C:P ratio between P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions (Scott et al. 2012). This could result in a less homeostatic variation in C:N:P ratios within a site than suggested by the meta-analysis of (Cleveland and Liptzin 2007).|$|R
40|$|Published {{research}} showed {{there was}} {{a link between the}} abundance of septoria diseases (Zymoseptoria tritici and Parastagonospora nodorum) and sulphurous acid in acid rain. Historical records showed that P. nodorum was at a peak in 1970 s while Z. tritici became more abundant at 1980 s. Another, small scale, study showed that both pathogens were affected by sulphur, but Z. tritici was reduced more by sulphur than P. nodorum. These studies suggested it could be useful to investigate the effect of sulphur fertilizer under larger scale, field, conditions. Thus, the aim of this project was to study if sulphur fertilizer affects the abundance of these pathogens, and to study if sulphur fertilization alters the yield and quality of wheat under disease pressure. A further question was whether silicon fertilizer affects both pathogens and the yield and quality of wheat. A final aspect of this thesis was to develop a way to quantify pathogens by using qPCR assay on large field samples. A glasshouse experiment showed that all wheat cultivars were susceptible to available pure isolates of both pathogens, but the proportion of leaves infected by these isolates varied between cultivars. Cv. Paragon showed a high proportion of infected leaves in comparison with Gallant and Maris Huntsman (M. Huntsman). Three successive field experiments were conducted. Z. tritici infected all plots, so {{it was not possible to}} estimate changes in competitive effects due to the <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes.</b> In the field experiments a variety of measurements were used at different growth stages to assess the diseases. The proportion of leaves infected with, and disease severity of, Z. tritici were not significantly affectedly by sulphur fertilization in 2013. In two further experiments, proportion of leaves infected with, and spore concentration of, Z. tritici were reduced by sulphur fertilization. In the 2014 - 2015 experiment disease severity of Z. tritici was significantly reduced by sulphur fertilization. Although autumn spray and seed inoculation with P. nodorum did not succeed, a spring spray inoculation was successful in the 2014 - 2015 experiment. In this experiment, proportion of leaves infected and disease severity of both fungi were reduced by sulphur fertilization. but Z. tritici was reduced more than P. nodorum. These results agree with the historical trends. Yield and quality measurements results showed that sulphur fertilization increased yield and the wheat quality was improved.

The identification of crop production methods that maximise energy efficiency and minimise greenhouse gas emissions is vital. Sugar beet is grown in a variety of locations and under a variety of agronomic conditions within the UK. This study identified thirteen production scenarios, representative of over 90 % of the UK beet crop, which included five soil types, nine <b>fertiliser</b> <b>regimes</b> and nine crop protection strategies. The fossil energy input, the overall energy efficiency and the global warming potential (GWP) of each production scenario was assessed. This study did not consider the processing of the beet to extract sugar. The overall energy input of the UK beet crop ranges between 15. 72 and 25. 94 GJ/ha. It produces between 7. 3 and 15. 0 times as much energy in dry matter at the sugar factory gate as consumed in its production, with an average ratio of 9. 7. It has an average GWP of 0. 024 eq. t CO 2 per tonne of clean beet harvested, equivalent to 0. 0062 eq. t CO 2 per GJ output. The energy input into each scenario was dictated largely by the energy associated with crop nutrition. The smallest energy inputs per hectare were to crops grown under organic conditions or conventional crops grown on fertile soils (clay loam, silt or peat) or sand soil with broiler manure applied. Those crops with the greatest energy input were grown on sand soil that was irrigated and had mineral fertiliser applied. Although the organic scenario grown on sandy loam soil had one of the smallest energy inputs per hectare, the low yield meant that the energy input was similar per tonne of beet harvested to the conventional crops grown on sandy loam soil. The extra distance travelled by organic beet from the farm to the factory increased the energy input per tonne above that of the conventional scenarios. The GWP was smallest for the conventional crops on the fertile peat and silt soils and greatest on the irrigated sand soils and the sandy loam soils. The organic scenario had a similar GWP to the conventional scenarios on sandy loam to the farm gate, although the greater diesel requirement for transport increased the GWP overall. The GWP per GJ of output for sugar beet in England is similar to published values for wheat...|$|R

Results and discussion Biochar application improved kernel quality by increasing the fraction of the highest commercial grade kernels (grade ‘Jumbo’) but did not affect photosynthesis and yield of peanut. Biochar application also increased soil total C (TC), total nitrogen (TN) and C/N ratio, and changed soil C and N stable isotope composition. Soil K and Zn content was higher in biochar treatments, which partially explains the observed kernel grade improvement. Fertilisation did not improve peanut performance, and irrigation generally had a negative effect on crop yield and physiology, but these data were compromised by high rainfall during cropping.
