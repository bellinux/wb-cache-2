50|$|Adaptive Recognition - {{a method}} {{based on a}} {{combination}} of two types of printed character recognition algorithms: multifont and omnifont. The system generates an <b>internal</b> <b>font</b> for each input document based on well printed characters using a dynamic adjustment (adaptation) to the specific input symbols. Thus, the method combines the omnitude and the technological efficiency of the omnifont approach with the high font recognition accuracy that dramatically improves the recognition rate.|$|E

50|$|Outline fonts or vector fonts are {{collections}} of vector images, consisting of lines and curves defining {{the boundary of}} glyphs. Early vector fonts were used by vector monitors and vector plotters using their own <b>internal</b> <b>fonts,</b> usually with thin single strokes instead of thick outlined glyphs. The advent of desktop publishing brought {{the need for a}} universal standard to integrate the graphical user interface of the first Macintosh and laser printers. The term to describe the integration technology was WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). The universal standard was (and still is) Adobe PostScript. Examples are PostScript Type 1 and Type 3 fonts, TrueType and OpenType.|$|R

Its plan {{consists of a}} four-bay nave, a short chancel with a vestry beneath, and a northeast tower. The tower {{is located in the}} angle between the nave and the chancel, and is buttressed. It contains a clock face and louvred lancet bell openings. At the summit is a pyramidal cap with a weathervane. The nave windows are small, with three lights and trefoil heads. On the sides of the chancel are two lancet windows. Beneath the chancel, the vestry has a door with a Caernarvon arch, and a two-light mullioned window. The east end is buttressed and contains a triple lancet window. At the west end are four lancet windows with trefoil heads, with a quatrefoil window above, and an entrance doorway leading to an <b>internal</b> porch.The <b>font</b> is octagonal, and is carried on eight clustered shafts. Above the altar is a 17th-century painting of the Petition of the Repentant Sinners. The east window contains stained glass dated 1882 by Kempe, which is a memorial to Sir Philip de Malpas Grey-Egerton and his wife. [...] There are other windows containing glass by Kempe, dated between 1885 and 1895.|$|R
