El Mundo writer Javier Dalmases {{believed that}} the route was purposefully less mountainous so that an Italian would win the race, citing that this route favored the likes of Giuseppe Saronni or Moreno Argentin. La Stampas Gian Paolo Ormezzano thought overall <b>easiness</b> of the course — the few mountains and summit finishes — added some mystery as to who could win.|$|E
500|$|Music critics {{received}} the song positively, complimenting Beyoncé's vocal performance, and the <b>easiness</b> {{as well as}} the confidence she displays while singing her lyrics. A reviewer from the UK website Contactmusic.com described [...] "Check on It" [...] as a [...] "booty shaking anthem" [...] and complimented Beyoncé for switching to a club song after [...] "Stand Up for Love". Bret McCabe of Baltimore City Paper noted that the song is [...] "less a DC joint than a Beyoncé sex-kitten solo". He praised the lyrics of the song and the <b>easiness</b> with which Beyoncé sings, highlighting her [...] "million-selling R pipes". James Blake of BBC Music wrote that the lyrics are pleasantly aggressive and critical of women.|$|E

Physically he was perfectly made for the job, good and strong from the hips down and firm but slender from the waist to the shoulders." ...|$|E
500|$|QuackShot {{received}} a mostly positive response from critics upon release. GameRankings, an aggregator for video game reviews, assigned the game {{a score of}} 77% based on 2 reviews. Mega placed the game at #7 in their [...] "Top Mega Drive Games of All Time" [...] list. MegaTech magazine praised the game's graphics, but criticized the game's <b>easiness.</b> Damian Butt from Sega Pro also praised the graphics, and noted the game's various puzzles, explaining that [...] "ven if the ideas are not original, {{the way they are}} strung together to accelerate the pace to overload is nothing short of breath-taking." [...] Levi Buchanan from IGN gave QuackShot a 7.3/10, also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing.|$|E
500|$|The game {{released}} without online {{support for}} co-operative play, but Rare promised {{to add the}} feature as a free patch and did so in April 2006. The patch let two players play the story simultaneously when their consoles were connected through Xbox Live or System Link. It also added new achievements. For a fee, players could download a series of costume packs that change the visual appearance of the game's characters. In September 2006, Rare released the Kameo [...] "Power Pack", which added leaderboards, a costume pack, new achievements, and three new modes of gameplay: Expert, Time Attack, and Rune Battle. Expert Mode remasters six of the game's levels with added difficulty. Time Attack Mode lets two co-op players (local or online) attempt to finish levels as fast as possible. Rune Battle Mode pits two co-op players against each other to collect the most rune items. Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica wrote that Rare [...] "did a good job" [...] of supporting Kameo with post-release content. He {{liked the idea of}} the time-based mode and thought that the Expert mode would allay criticism of the game's <b>easiness.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Many reviews found the game avoided some of Aerosmith's [...] "more popular sugar-coated hits...like 'Amazing', 'Crazy', or 'I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing'", but felt that other major Aerosmith songs could {{have also been}} included. Game Informer noted that [...] "creating a band specific game was smart", but that [...] "very little has changed from the base game". They also complimented the great job that Activision did with their motion captures of Aerosmith. The difficulty of the game {{was not to be}} found as hard as Guitar Hero III due to the [...] "very riff-friendly guitarist" [...] Joe Perry; while reviewers felt this was a good correction from the previous game, they also noted that the <b>easiness</b> of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith led to some bland tiers, repetitive musical sections, and lack of any significant difficulty curve. The length of the game was poorly received, with reviewers commenting {{that it is difficult to}} justify the title priced equivalently as other next-generation console full games. Eurogamer commented that one's appreciation for the game [...] "lives or dies based on [...] fondness for Aerosmith", and that ultimately, with other available music games that offer additional downloadable songs, a game that focuses on a single band would need [...] "to offer gameplay innovations, spectacular fan service, or a lot more material" [...] than what Guitar Hero: Aerosmith provides. Reviews also noted the sparseness of downloadable content.|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{praised the}} story {{and the number of}} lightsaber combos but criticized the game's <b>easiness</b> and hack-and-slash gameplay. It also praised the Wii version for its story and Force powers, but criticized the game's lightsaber {{controls}} and linear gameplay. GameSpot noticed visual glitches and problematic audio compression that detracted from the Wii version's [...] "mature and exciting" [...] story, adding that the reduced number of Force-manipulable objects helps mitigate the targeting problems experienced on other platforms. Referring to the Wii remote and nunchuck controls, GameSpot also speculated that The Force Unleashed is [...] "possibly the most waggle-heavy" [...] Wii game. Zero Punctuation criticized the Wii version's graphics and compared lightsaber combat to [...] "trying to follow an aerobics routine with both your arms tied to different windmills". The ability to upgrade Starkiller's abilities in the PS2 version, according to IGN, is not as [...] "robust" [...] as it should be, and the game's targeting system is sometimes frustrating. IGN said the PS2's real-time cutscene rendering made Starkiller seem emotionless, and that pre-rendered cutscenes would have been better. GameSpot found the DS version's plot interesting but the storytelling itself [...] "lackluster". While the DS version is easy, with Starkiller killing enemies [...] "like a hot knife through butter", GameSpot said the player's sense of power is not matched by a sense of freedom. GameSpot called the PSP version's camera [...] "unwieldy", but added that smaller and less cluttered environments make the targeting system less frustrating than on other platforms. The Wii version was a nominee for multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in its 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Voice Acting.|$|E
500|$|Now {{he discovers}} that the self he chooses has a {{boundless}} multiplicity within itself inasmuch {{as it has}} a history, a history in which he acknowledges identity with himself. This history is of a different kind, for in this history he stands {{in relation to other}} individuals in the race, and to the whole race, and this history contains painful things, and yet he is the person he is only through this history. That is why it takes courage to choose oneself, for {{at the same time as}} he seems to be isolating himself most radically he is most radically sinking himself into the root by which he is bound up with the whole. This makes him uneasy, and yet it must be so, for when the passion of freedom is aroused in him-and it is aroused in the choice just as it presupposes itself in the choice-he chooses himself and struggles for this possession as for his salvation, and it is his salvation. Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself, he steps, as it were, in the way of that first self, halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object, and summons it back from the external. In order to prompt the first self to this withdrawal, the deeper self lets the surrounding world remain what it is-remain dubious. This is indeed the way it is; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment, and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish. The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self. Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self, to render it forgotten, whereby the whole matter is given up; or it must admit that the deeper self is right, because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction, and as soon as one confesses that it changes, it can of course, change in that same moment. However much that first self shrinks from this, there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought-twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self’s eternal claim. There is only one way out, and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out. Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses, 1845, Hong translation, p. 314Just as a man changes his clothes for celebration, so a person preparing for the holy act of confession is inwardly changed. It is indeed like changing one’s clothes to divest oneself of multiplicity in order to make up one’s mind about one thing, to interrupt the pace of busy activity in order to put on the repose of contemplation in unity with oneself. And this unity with oneself is the celebration’s simple festive dress that is the condition of admittance. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Søren Kierkegaard, 1847, Hong, p.19If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly, if anxiety creates confusion, and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back, then he may go to his friend and say, [...] "My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me, but I confided everything to you; you remember it, so please explain the past to me again." [...] But if a person has no friend, he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him, if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him. [...] And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times, perhaps was filled with self-loathing, which is even more oppressive, upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all, even though he had listened, had not sensed what was making him anxious, but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life. But this would never happen with God; who would dare to venture to think this of God, even if he is cowardly enough to prefer to forget God-until he stands face-to-face with the judge, who passes judgment on him but not on the one who truly has God as a witness, because where God is the judge, there is indeed no judge if God is the witness. It by no means follows that a person’s life becomes easy because he learns to know God in this way. On the contrary, it can become very hard; it may become more difficult than the contemptible <b>easiness</b> of sensate human life, but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning.

In an interview, he detailed that he began growing it out in 2011, and remarked at the <b>easiness</b> in maintaining it, with [...] "a hard shampoo {{every once in a}} while".

2500|$|The {{price of}} labour, {{it must be}} observed, cannot be ascertained very {{accurately}} anywhere, different prices being often paid {{at the same place}} and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the <b>easiness</b> or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so.

2500|$|Edge, {{while giving}} the game a {{positive}} score of 7/10, criticized {{the lack of}} traditional Mario charm, poor graphical detail and overall <b>easiness.</b> GamesRadar, who also scored the game of 7/10, argued that the game lacked the creativity {{of others in the}} series. The A.V. Club gave it a negative score of C+, calling it [...] "the least essential Mario title to date", and stating that the game lacks a strong concept and shows an underlying repetitiveness in Mario games. Nintendo Power argued that the game works as a sequel because it maintains what made the original Mario games great while adding new features.|$|E
2500|$|The Livadia left Greenock on October 3 with Popov, Tideman, Edward James Reed and William Houston Stewart on board. She safely reached Brest on October 7, {{where she}} picked up General Admiral of the Imperial Navy Grand Duke Constantine. [...] On October 8 the Livadia sailed into the Bay of Biscay and was soon caught in a violent storm. According to Reed, sailing {{straight}} into the storm to test the ship was Constantine's idea and that no Russian dared to argue. Waves of six to seven meters failed to upset the Livadia: transverse roll did not exceed 3.5 degrees, longitudinal pitch was within 5.5 degrees. Stewart praised {{the comfort of the}} Livadia: [...] "I never was in so comfortable a ship at sea in a gale of wind ... the absence of rolling, the <b>easiness</b> of motion, the great comfort on board, and the handiness of steering, were such as I have never seen before in any other ship under similar circumstances of weather and sea".|$|E
