40|$|It {{is by now}} an {{established}} fact, that the so-called <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> have experienced growth rates way above average through most years. <b>High</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> share of the world manufacturers export has risen from 12 per cent in 1970 to 25 per cent in 1995. More than one-third of Japan's manufacturing export and more than 40 per cent of America's manufacturing export are products from <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries,</b> and this development has increasingly led to an international obsession with <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries.</b> In {{a number of countries}} R&D indicators have by now become the object of intense discussions. Great efforts are devoted to improve a bad relative standing. The aim {{of this paper is to}} questioned whether a national specialisation towards <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> is the only way by which the mature, developed countries can hope to sustain and augment their economic position. I claim that in contrast to much of the assumptions in contemporary politics and in the majority of the contemporary academic literature on the subject the countries without a specialisation in <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> are not left in the backwaters of economic development. Quite the contrary seems to be the case as many advanced, high-cost countries experience an above average economic performance even when specialising in the bottom end of the low-tech industries. The argument is illustrated with empirical material from the wooden furniture industry in general - and the rather successful Danish wooden furniture industry in particular. The possible reasons behind this apparent paradox are discussed. International competitiveness, industrial clusters, wooden furniture <b>industry,</b> level of <b>technology...</b>|$|R

40|$|As the {{barriers}} to international trade melt away and globalization both deepens and proliferates, competition intensifies. Focusing on competition within <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries,</b> this study argues {{that the key to}} surviving competition and overcoming the challenges of globalization lies in innovation. To establish this argument, two <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> are used as case studies: the computer and the telecommunications industry. R&D is the key to technological innovation and innovation, in turn, is the basis upon which corporations cement their market presence and expand their market shares. While the historical importance of innovation in <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> has always been incontrovertible, globalization has maximized its importance. The reason, quite simply, lies in that the intensification of competition translates into the maximization of the importance of innovation as the key to market survival. Having established the aforementioned, the study looks towards the role of both domestic and foreign research and development in promoting US <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries.</b> Employing the Grossman and Helpman theoretical models, the study undertakes a comprehensive exploration of the named industries for the purposes of determining the role of foreign investment and knowledge in motivating and promoting domestic R&D and ensuring that the US computer and <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> retain a pronounced presence in international markets...|$|R
2500|$|As {{governor}} of Massachusetts, Romney favored {{the use of}} economic stimulus measures, using both federal funding and state funding to help lift the state's sluggish economy. Just months into his tenure as governor, in April 2003, while he shied away from any public endorsement of the tax cuts proposed by the Bush Administration, he argued for federal funds to stimulate the local economy: [...] "I very much support an economic stimulus.... An economic stimulus {{is a good thing}} for Massachusetts." [...] That same year, he proposed his own economic stimulus package of tax credits and grants to promote the state's <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industry,</b> ultimately totaling $100 million when agreed to by the legislature. Two years later, in February 2005, he proposed a much larger stimulus package, totaling $600 million, that he said would create 20,000 jobs over 5 years. The most controversial provision would have devoted $37 million to stimulate job creation by paying businesses $30,000 for each new employee hired.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} stability, specialisation and divergence in manufacturing industries' export patterns for EU 15 countries at both industry and country level, distinguishing between intra and extra EU 15 exports as well as different technological categories. Both countrywide and industrywide analyses suggest that specialisation patterns, on average, are rather sticky. Furthermore, as proposed, intra-EU 15 specialisation patterns are less persistent, particularly in <b>higher</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries.</b> From an industry specific point, such non-persistence within intra-EU 15 patterns is reflected as convergence of countries, whereas persistent extra-EU 15 patterns are reflected as divergence of countries, which again are more common in <b>higher</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries.</b> Specialisation; Convergence; Comparative Advantage...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} divided into two parts. The first part is an {{examination}} of the OECD classification of industries into high, medium and low <b>technology</b> <b>industries,</b> to look at the basis for this classification and to use that as a benchmark with which to classify the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data for the UK into similar groupings. The industries are ranked according to their research intensities and the rankings between the two datasets are compared. Some features of the UK rankings are highlighted and anomalies between the two datasets pointed out. The second part of the paper goes on to use the OECD classification into high, medium and low <b>technology</b> <b>industries,</b> applied to the CIS dataset, to contrast patterns of innovation in <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> with those in low <b>technology</b> <b>industries.</b> We build on the three types of innovation surveyed in the CIS, namely product, process and organisational innovation and contrast those types across <b>high</b> and low <b>technology</b> sectors. The expected relationship between <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> and product innovation holds - that enterprises tend to do more product innovation, the higher their research intensity. But process innovation does not conform to this pattern and there is not such a clear division between <b>high</b> and low <b>technology</b> <b>industries.</b> However the way they do process innovations differs with <b>high</b> <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> more reliant on internal resources whereas lower <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> tend to do it using external resources in collaboration with others. Organisational innovation is more complex, with certain types of innovation done as widely by lower <b>technology</b> <b>industries</b> as by the more research intensive industries. This supports the idea that all types of innovation should be considered, with the diffusion of ICTs making an impact across the technological spectrum of industries and showing up in various forms of organisational innovation...|$|R
