5|$|A vastly {{different}} application {{can be seen}} in the study of cognitive flexibility and video games. Examining the trait under the guise of “,” Dutch researchers observed that players of first-person shooter games (e.g. Call of Duty, Battlefield) exhibited greater “mental flexibility” on a series of measures than did non-gamers. The researchers posit that, while video game play may be controversial due to frequently graphic content, <b>harnessing</b> the effect of such games could lead to similar gains in various populations (e.g. the elderly, who face cognitive decline) and is therefore socially relevant.|$|E
5|$|Persona 4 {{takes place}} in a fictional Japanese {{countryside}} and is indirectly related to earlier Persona games. The player-named protagonist is a high-school student who moved into the countryside from the city for a year. During his year-long stay, he becomes involved in investigating mysterious murders while <b>harnessing</b> the power of summoning Persona. The game features a weather forecast system with events happening on foggy days to replace the moon phase system implemented in the previous games.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 {{exhibition}} of Gauguin's work left Picasso {{more than ever}} in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by <b>harnessing</b> his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping {{a new source of}} divine energy.|$|E
50|$|Sled dog <b>harnesses</b> vary {{depending}} on whether the dog is hauling freight or racing. <b>Harnesses</b> come in three main types: the freight <b>harness,</b> the H-back <b>harness,</b> and the X-back <b>harness.</b> Dog sports are growing and more types of <b>harnesses</b> are being developed, including the Y-back style and guard or distance <b>harness.</b> This type of <b>harness</b> is quickly becoming a favorite for those who enjoy skijoring.|$|R
50|$|<b>Harnesses</b> also vary {{according}} to the need of the pilot, and thereby come in a range of designs, mostly: Training <b>harness</b> for beginners,Pax <b>harness</b> for tandem passengers that often also doubles as a training harness,XC <b>Harness</b> for long distance cross country flights,All round <b>harness</b> for basic to intermediate pilots,Pod <b>harness,</b> which is for intermediate to pro pilots that focus on XC.Acro <b>harnesses</b> are special designs for acrobatic pilots,Kids tandem <b>harnesses</b> are also now available with special child-proof locks.|$|R
50|$|Doctor Octopus has {{possessed a}} total of three {{different}} <b>harnesses</b> during his career: the original titanium <b>harness,</b> a more powerful adamantium <b>harness,</b> and a carbonanium <b>harness</b> with tentacles bearing an octopus-like motif. The original and adamantium <b>harnesses</b> were both destroyed in the Lethal Foes of Spider-Man miniseries.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} approach to Arctic exploration had relied on large-scale forces, with a presumption that European techniques could be successfully transplanted into the hostile polar climate. Over the years this strategy had brought little success, and {{had led to}} heavy losses of men and ships. By contrast, Nansen's method of using small, trained crews, and <b>harnessing</b> Inuit and Sami expertise in his methods of travel, had ensured that his expedition was completed without a single casualty or major mishap.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two major}} but {{divergent}} scientific articles about jet stream power. Archer & Caldeira claim that the Earth's jet streams could generate a total power of 1700 terawatts (TW) and that the climatic impact of <b>harnessing</b> this amount would be negligible. However, Miller, Gans, & Kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 TW and that the climatic impact would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of <b>harnessing</b> {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he has removed from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} {{climbing}} warrant particular features for <b>harnesses.</b> Sport climbers typically use minimalistic <b>harnesses,</b> some with sewn-on gear loops. Alpine climbers often choose lightweight <b>harnesses,</b> perhaps with detachable leg loops. Big Wall climbers generally prefer padded waist belts and leg loops. There are also full body <b>harnesses</b> for children, whose pelvises {{may be too}} narrow to support a standard <b>harness</b> safely. These <b>harnesses</b> prevent children from falling even when inverted, and are either manufactured for children or constructed out of webbing. Some climbers use full body <b>harnesses</b> {{when there is a}} chance of inverting, or when carrying a heavy bag. There are also chest <b>harnesses,</b> which are used only in combination with a sit harness; this combination provides the same advantages as a full body <b>harness.</b> However, test results from UIAA show that chest <b>harnesses</b> can put more impact on the neck than sit <b>harnesses,</b> making them slightly more dangerous to use.|$|R
5000|$|A kite <b>harness</b> {{comes in}} seat (with leg loops), waist or vest types. The <b>harness</b> {{together}} with a spreader bar attaches the rider to the control bar. By hooking in, the <b>harness</b> takes most of the strain of the kite's pull off of the rider's arms, and spreads it across {{a portion of his}} body. This allows the rider to do jumps and other tricks while remaining attached to the kite via the control bar. Waist <b>harnesses</b> are by far the most popular <b>harnesses</b> among advanced riders, although seat <b>harnesses</b> make it possible to kitesurf with less effort from the rider and vest <b>harnesses</b> provide both flotation and impact protection. Kite <b>harnesses</b> look similar to windsurfing <b>harnesses,</b> but are actually much different; a windsurfing <b>harness</b> used for kiteboarding is likely to break very quickly, which could result in injury and/or gear loss.|$|R
5000|$|The racing <b>harness,</b> {{like the}} show <b>harness,</b> is a breastcollar <b>harness.</b> Horses are hitched {{to a very}} {{lightweight}} two-wheeled cart, called a sulky. Most race <b>harnesses</b> incorporate a running martingale and an overcheck. Sometimes <b>harness</b> racing horses are raced with an [...] "open" [...] bridle, {{one that does not}} have blinkers. Specialized equipment, called pacing hobbles, are added to the <b>harness</b> of race horses who pace in order to help them maintain their gait.|$|R
5|$|Domesticated {{horses were}} present in Bronze Age Britain from around 2000BC. Bronze Age horse trappings {{including}} snaffle bits have been found which were used in <b>harnessing</b> horses to vehicles; Bronze Age cart wheels have been found at Flag Fen and Blair Drummond, the latter dating from around 1255–815BC, though these may have belonged to vehicles pulled by oxen. Early Bronze Age evidence for horses being ridden is lacking, though bareback riding may have involved materials which have not survived or have not been found; but horses were ridden in battle in Britain by the late Bronze Age. Domesticated ponies were on Dartmoor by around 1500BC.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age– {{defined by}} the use of metal– began around 2500 BC, with {{technology}} changing people's everyday lives during this period through innovations such as the wheel; <b>harnessing</b> oxen; weaving textiles; brewing alcohol; and skilful metalworking, which produced new weapons and tools, along with fine gold decoration and jewellery, such as brooches and torcs. According to John T. Koch and others, Ireland in the Late Bronze Age was part of a maritime trading-network culture called the Atlantic Bronze Age that also included Britain, western France and Iberia, and that this is where Celtic languages developed. This contrasts with the traditional view that their origin lies in mainland Europe with the Hallstatt culture.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn had {{technically}} impressive hardware at {{the time}} of its release, but its complexity made <b>harnessing</b> this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, Virtua Fighter used one CPU for each character, while Nights used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.|$|E
5000|$|Physically smaller {{systems that}} are built many times may use a cable <b>harness.</b> A {{full-sized}} to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable <b>harness.</b> This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable <b>harnesses.</b> <b>Harnesses</b> can be inserted into to their equipment as an assembly. Cable <b>harnesses</b> that are reused many times, like automobile wiring <b>harnesses,</b> are created with automated machinery.|$|R

40|$|Quadratic <b>harnesses</b> are {{typically}} non-homogeneous Markov processes with time-dependent state space. Using an appropriately defined affine transformation {{we show that}} all bridges of a given quadratic <b>harness</b> can be transformed into other standard quadratic <b>harnesses.</b> Conversely, each such bridge is an affine transformation of a standard quadratic <b>harness.</b> We describe quadratic <b>harnesses</b> that correspond to bridges of some Levy processes. We determine all quadratic <b>harnesses</b> that may arise from stitching together a pair of q-Meixner processes...|$|R
5|$|The {{rules and}} scoring in ski flying are mostly {{the same as}} they are in ski jumping, and events under the {{discipline}} are usually contested as part of the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but the hills (of which there are only five remaining, all in Europe) are constructed to a different standard in order to enable jumps of up to 66% longer in distance. There is also a stronger emphasis on aerodynamics and <b>harnessing</b> the wind, as well as an increased element of danger due to athletes flying much higher and faster than in ski jumping.|$|E
5|$|The war {{of words}} would {{continue}} for another 130 years with endless commentary from doctors, poets, playwrights and authors all arguing for their favorite region and their polemics being reproduced in advertisements for Burgundy and Champagne. On a few occasions, the two regions were {{on the brink of}} civil war. A turning point occurred when several Champagne wine makers abandoned efforts to produce red wine in favor of focusing on <b>harnessing</b> the effervescent nature of sparkling Champagne. As the bubbles became more popular, doctors throughout France and Europe commented on the health benefits of the sparkling bubbles which were said to cure malaria. As more Champenois winemakers embarked on this new and completely different wine style, the rivalry with Burgundy mellowed and eventually waned.|$|E
5|$|After overhearing a {{government}} radio broadcast with disguised references to nuclear weapons, Lois sneaks on board Air Force One. She manipulates {{her way into}} the room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. <b>Harnessing</b> the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and makes his way to the Fortress of Solitude. There, the spirit of his father, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.|$|E
50|$|The STABO harness/rig was a machine-stitched, {{skeletonized}} <b>harness,</b> {{very similar}} to that of a standard parachute <b>harness.</b> The <b>harness</b> webbing was made of heavy duty nylon, identical to the type used in the manufacture of parachute <b>harnesses.</b> The STABO rig served two main functions: it was itself an extraction <b>harness</b> and also served as the base for the operator's load bearing equipment in the field. Later versions of the STABO <b>harness</b> were made in small, medium and large sizes.|$|R
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} <b>harness</b> loom-one where any one <b>harness</b> or combination of <b>harnesses</b> was lifted while the other <b>harnesses</b> remained stationary. This type of loom {{is known as a}} rising shed loom, and examples include the table loom, dobby loom or the Jack loom. The other method used in <b>harness</b> looms is where some <b>harnesses</b> are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected <b>harnesses</b> because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed loom. Counterbalance and countermarch looms are of this second type.|$|R
50|$|A {{full-body}} <b>harness</b> is {{the combination}} of a sit <b>harness</b> and a chest <b>harness</b> which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of <b>harness</b> normally offers a wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations, and also commonly used by small children instead of a sit <b>harness</b> which is easier to slip out of.|$|R
5|$|The soils {{in which}} plants grow are {{inhabited}} by microbial communities, with one gram of soil containing around 109-1010 microbial cells which comprise about one gigabase of sequence information. The microbial communities which inhabit soils {{are some of}} the most complex known to science, and remain poorly understood despite their economic importance. Microbial consortia perform a wide variety of ecosystem services necessary for plant growth, including fixing atmospheric nitrogen, nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and sequester iron and other metals. Functional metagenomics strategies are being used to explore the interactions between plants and microbes through cultivation-independent study of these microbial communities. By allowing insights into the role of previously uncultivated or rare community members in nutrient cycling and the promotion of plant growth, metagenomic approaches can contribute to improved disease detection in crops and livestock and the adaptation of enhanced farming practices which improve crop health by <b>harnessing</b> the relationship between microbes and plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, slate {{quarrying}} began to expand rapidly, {{most notably in}} north Wales. The Penrhyn Quarry, opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant, was employing 15,000 men by the late 19th century, and along with Dinorwic Quarry, it dominated the Welsh slate trade. Although slate quarrying {{has been described as}} 'the most Welsh of Welsh industries', it is coal mining which has become the single industry synonymous with Wales and its people. Initially, coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but, with the opening of canal systems and later the railways, Welsh coal mining saw a boom in its demand. As the south Wales coalfield was exploited, mainly in the upland valleys around Aberdare and later the Rhondda, the ports of Swansea, Cardiff and later Penarth, grew into world exporters of coal and, with them, came a population boom. By its height in 1913, Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal. As well as in south Wales, there was also a significant coalfield in the north-east of the country, particularly around Wrexham. As Wales was reliant on the production of capital goods rather than consumer goods, it possessed few of the skilled craftspeople and artisans found in the workshops of Birmingham or Sheffield in England and had few factories producing finished goods – a key feature of most regions associated with the Industrial Revolution. However, there is increasing support that the industrial revolution was reliant on <b>harnessing</b> the energy and materials provided by Wales and, in that sense, Wales was of central importance.|$|E

50|$|A parrot <b>harness</b> or bird flight <b>harness</b> may {{enable a}} tame pet or {{companion}} parrot {{to be taken}} outdoors, but some parrots may dislike wearing a <b>harness</b> and bite at it. Parrots that are <b>harness</b> trained from {{a very young age}} may accept them willingly, but more often, parrots must be very carefully and gradually accustomed and trained to wear a <b>harness.</b> Care must be taken that the parrot does not feel threatened. Properly trained parrots often appear to enjoy wearing their <b>harnesses</b> if they associate them with going outdoors; some owners report their birds will bring their <b>harnesses</b> to them when they want to go outside.|$|R
50|$|Safety is {{the biggest}} {{consideration}} for tree stands. A body <b>harness</b> {{is the most important}} part of tree stand safety. Many different styles of <b>harness</b> can keep hunters safe. One <b>harness</b> compiled of a belt around the waist of the person and one around tree with a strap between the two can keep the hunter safe. Another <b>harness</b> is a full body <b>harness,</b> which has shoulder straps and straps around the legs. The full body <b>harness</b> attaches to the tree the same way the belt <b>harness</b> does. Attaching the <b>harness</b> as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt. The strap between the <b>harness</b> and strap around the tree should be long enough to allow the hunter to move a little and short enough so if the hunter falls they do not fall too far.|$|R
