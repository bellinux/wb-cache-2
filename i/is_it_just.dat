2500|$|London's critics almost uniformly panned the show, criticising {{the concept}} and direction. The Guardian wrote that the premise [...] "really is as sixth form as it sounds", called the {{production}} [...] "ruthlessly packaged and manufactured" [...] and opined that the [...] "sometimes funny" [...] libretto exists mainly to [...] "devise more unlikely ways to wring out another Queen song." [...] The Daily Mirror wrote that [...] "Ben Elton should be shot for this risible story." [...] The Daily Telegraph described it as [...] "guaranteed to bore you rigid" [...] and [...] "prolefeed at its worst." [...] However, some individual performances received praise and the production remains a popular success. In their popular book <b>Is</b> <b>It</b> <b>Just</b> Me Or Is Everything Shit, Steve Lowe and Alan MacArthur derided the show as having [...] "a plot similar to the Rush concept album 2112".|$|E

2500|$|When {{he ran for}} {{governor}} in 2002, Romney strongly advocated stem-cell research, and he promised to lobby then-President George W. Bush to embrace it. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, he renounced his prior position {{and said that he}} agreed with Bush's decision to ban federal funding for research on excess embryos. He said that his views had been drastically altered in 2004 after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at Harvard University. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning. [...] According to Romney, Melton declared that the research [...] "is not a moral issue because we kill the embryos at 14 days." [...] "I looked over at Beth Myers, my chief of staff, and we both had exactly the same reaction, which <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> hit us hard," [...] recalled Romney.

2500|$|Eno is {{frequently}} {{referred to as}} one of popular music's most influential artists. Critic Jason Ankeny at AllMusic argues that Eno [...] "forever altered {{the ways in which}} music is approached, composed, performed, and perceived, and everything from punk to techno to new age bears his unmistakable influence." [...] Eno has spread his techniques and theories primarily through his production; his distinctive style affected a number of projects in which he has been involved, including Bowie's [...] "Berlin Trilogy" [...] (helping to popularise minimalism) and the albums he produced for Talking Heads (incorporating, on Eno's advice, African music and polyrhythms), Devo, and other groups. Eno's first collaboration with David Byrne, 1981's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, pioneered sampling techniques that would prove to be influential in hip-hop, and broke ground by incorporating world music into popular Western music forms. Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies have been used by many bands, and Eno's production style has proven influential in several general respects: [...] "his recording techniques have helped change the way that modern musicians– particularly electronic musicians– view the studio. No longer <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> a passive medium through which they communicate their ideas but itself a new instrument with seemingly endless possibilities." ...|$|E

And from that point forward, I said to the people of Massachusetts, 'I will continue to honor what I pledged to you, but I prefer to call myself pro-life.'" [...] Melton disputes Romney's account of the meeting, declaring [...] "Governor Romney has mischaracterized my position; we didn't discuss killing or anything related to it ... I explained my work to him, told him about my deeply held respect for life, and explained that my work focuses on improving the lives of those suffering from debilitating diseases." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see?
