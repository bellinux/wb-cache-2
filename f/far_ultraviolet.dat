5|$|Studies {{made with}} the NASA <b>Far</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectroscopic Explorer have {{discovered}} that the disk around Beta Pictoris contains an extreme overabundance of carbon-rich gas. This helps stabilize the disk against radiation pressure which would otherwise blow the material away into interstellar space. Currently, there are two suggested explanations for {{the origin of the}} carbon overabundance. Beta Pictoris might be in the process of forming exotic carbon-rich planets, in contrast to the terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which are rich in oxygen instead of carbon. Alternatively it may be passing through an unknown phase that might also have occurred early {{in the development of the}} Solar System: in the Solar System there are carbon-rich meteorites known as enstatite chondrites, which may have formed in a carbon-rich environment. It has also been proposed that Jupiter may have formed around a carbon-rich core.|$|E
25|$|A special <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> camera, the <b>Far</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Camera/Spectrograph, {{was taken}} to the lunar surface on Apollo 16 and {{operated}} {{in the shadow of the}} Apollo Lunar Module (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.|$|E

40|$|ORFEUS (Orbiting and Retrievable <b>Far</b> and Extreme <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectrometer) is a 1 m normal {{incidence}} telescope for spectroscopic investigations of cosmic {{sources in the}} <b>far</b> and extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> spectral range. The instrument will {{be integrated into the}} freeflyer platform ASTRO-SPAS. ORFEUS-SPAS is scheduled with STS ENDEAVOUR in September 1992. We describe the telescope with its two spectrometer and their capabilities i. e., spectral range, resolution and overall sensitivity. The main classes of objects to be observed with the instrument are discussed and two examples of simulated spectra for the white dwarf HZ 43 and an O 9 -star in LMC are shown...|$|R
25|$|STS-67 Endeavour (March 2–18, 1995) was {{the second}} flight of the ASTRO observatory, a unique {{complement}} of three telescopes. During this 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> {{light is}} absorbed {{effectively}} by the neutral {{components of the}} ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic hydrogen lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition. Therefore, {{it is nearly impossible}} to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|The aurorae of Saturn {{are highly}} variable. Their {{location}} and brightness strongly {{depends on the}} Solar wind pressure: the aurorae become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar wind pressure increases. The bright auroral features are observed to rotate with the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by the aurorae is about 50GW in the <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (80–170nm) and 150–300GW in the near-infrared (3–4μm—H3+ emissions) parts of the spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Columbia {{carried into}} orbit two {{satellites}} that were released and recaptured {{after some time}} alone. The first was the Orbiting and Retrievable <b>Far</b> and Extreme <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectrometer-Shuttle Pallet Satellite II (ORFEUS-SPAS II). The main component of the satellite, the ORFEUS telescope, had two spectrographs, for <b>far</b> and extreme <b>ultraviolet.</b> Another spectrograph, the Interstellar Medium Absorption Profile Spectrograph, was also on board the satellite. Several payloads not relevant to astronomy rounded out the satellite. It performed without problems for its flight, taking 422 observations of almost 150 astronomical bodies, ranging from the moon to extra-galactic stars and a quasar. Being the second flight of ORFEUS-SPAS II allowed for more sensitive equipment, causing it to provide {{more than twice the}} data of its initial run.|$|R

50|$|Another payload on {{this mission}} was the Orbiting Retrievable <b>Far</b> and Extreme <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectrometer (ORFEUS) {{telescope}} {{mounted on the}} Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) payload carrier. ORFEUS was designed to provide information on how stars are born and how they die, while studying gaseous interstellar clouds. Also in the cargo bay was the Limited Duration Space Environment Candidate Materials Exposure (LDCE) experiment.|$|R
25|$|At low frequencies, {{molecules}} in polar dielectrics are polarized by an applied electric field, which induces periodic rotations. For example, at the microwave frequency, the microwave field causes the periodic rotation of water molecules, sufficient to break hydrogen bonds. The field does {{work against the}} bonds and the energy is absorbed by the material as heat. This is why microwave ovens work very well for materials containing water. There are two maxima of the imaginary component (the absorptive index) of water, one at the microwave frequency, and the other at <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) frequency. Both of these resonances are at higher frequencies than the operating frequency of microwave ovens.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of the diamond anvil cell, static high-pressure apparatus required large hydraulic presses which weighed several tons and required large specialized laboratories. The simplicity and compactness of the DAC meant that it could be accommodated {{in a wide variety of}} experiments. Some contemporary DACs can easily fit into a cryostat for low-temperature measurements, and for use with a superconducting electromagnet. In addition to being hard, diamonds have the advantage of being transparent to a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from infrared to gamma rays, with the exception of the <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> and soft X-rays. This makes the DAC a perfect device for spectroscopic experiments and for crystallographic studies using hard X-rays.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, comets {{were found}} to emit X-rays. This greatly {{surprised}} astronomers because X-ray emission is usually associated with very high-temperature bodies. The X-rays are generated by the interaction between comets and the solar wind: when highly charged solar wind ions fly through a cometary atmosphere, they collide with cometary atoms and molecules, [...] "stealing" [...] one or more electrons from the atom in a process called [...] "charge exchange". This exchange or transfer of an electron to the solar wind ion is followed by its de-excitation into the ground state of the ion by the emission of X-rays and <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> photons.|$|E

During STS-80 {{the crew}} {{deployed}} and retrieved the Wake Shield Facility (WSF) and the Orbiting Retrievable <b>Far</b> and Extreme <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectrometer (ORFEUS) satellites. The ORFEUS instruments, {{mounted on the}} reusable Shuttle Pallet Satellite, studied the origin and makeup of stars. Mission duration was a record breaking 17 days, 15 hours, 53 minutes.|$|R
25|$|Alice is an {{ultraviolet}} {{imaging spectrometer}} {{that is one}} of two photographic instruments comprising New Horizons Pluto Exploration Remote Sensing Investigation (PERSI); the other being the Ralph telescope. It resolves 1,024wavelength bands in the <b>far</b> and extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> (from 50–), over 32view fields. Its goal is to determine the composition of Pluto's atmosphere. This Alice instrument is derived from another Alice aboard ESA's Rosetta spacecraft.|$|R
40|$|We discuss higher {{dimensional}} effective operators describing {{interactions between}} fermionic dark matter and Standard Model particles. They are typically suppressed {{compared to the}} leading order effective operators, which can explain why no conclusive direct dark matter detection has been made so <b>far.</b> The <b>ultraviolet</b> completions of the effective operators, which we systematically study, require new particles. These particles can potentially have masses at the TeV scale and can therefore be phenomenologically interesting for LHC physics. We demonstrate that the lowest order options require Higgs-portal interactions generated by dimension six operators. We list all possible tree-level completions with extra fermions and scalars, and we discuss the LHC phenomenology of a specific example with extra heavy fermion doublets.

500|$|... 31 Crateris (which was {{originally}} placed in Crater by Flamsteed) is a 5.26 magnitude star {{which was once}} mistaken for a moon of Mercury. On 27 March 1974, the Mariner 10 mission detected emissions in the <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> from the planet (suggesting a satellite), but they were found to emanate from the star. It is in reality a remote binary star system with a hot blue-white star of spectral type B1.5V and a companion about which little is known. The two stars orbit each other every 2.9631 days. The primary is possibly a blue straggler of the Hyades group. The primary is around 15.5 times as massive as the Sun and 52262 times as luminous.|$|E
500|$|The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate {{breakfast and}} began {{preparations}} for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the [...] "porch" [...] of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human {{to walk on the}} Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: [...] "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure glad they got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." [...] Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: [...] "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" [...] The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the <b>Far</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Camera/Spectrograph (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a [...] crater on the rim of Flag crater, about [...] across. There, at a distance of [...] from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator William R. Muehlberger. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about [...] from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16 mm movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.|$|E

2500|$|The E {{layer is}} the middle layer, [...] to [...] above {{the surface of the}} Earth. Ionization is due to soft X-ray (1–10nbsp&nm) and <b>far</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) solar {{radiation}} ionization of molecular oxygen (O2). Normally, at oblique incidence, this layer can only reflect radio waves having frequencies lower than about 10nbsp&MHz and may contribute a bit to absorption on frequencies above. However, during intense sporadic E events, the Es layer can reflect frequencies up to 50nbsp&MHz and higher. The vertical structure of the E layer is primarily determined by the competing effects of ionization and recombination. At night the E layer weakens because the primary source of ionization is no longer present. After sunset an increase in the height of the E layer maximum increases the range to which radio waves can travel by reflection from the layer.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the explosive blast, called the arc blast of such a fault, destruction also arises from the intense radiant heat produced by the arc.
