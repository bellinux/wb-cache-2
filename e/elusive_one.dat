60|$|It {{seemed as}} if he would scarce ever again {{discover}} the carnate dwelling-place of the haunting minion of his imagination. Having gone so near to matrimony with Marcia as to apply for a licence, he had felt for a long while morally bound to her by the incipient contract, and would not intentionally look about him in search of the vanished Ideality. Thus {{during the first year of}} Miss Bencomb's absence, when absolutely bound to keep faith with the <b>elusive</b> <b>one's</b> late incarnation if she should return to claim him, this man of the odd fancy would sometimes tremble at the thought of what would become of his solemn intention if the Phantom were suddenly to disclose herself in an unexpected quarter, and seduce him before he was aware. Once or twice he imagined that he saw her in the distance--at the end of a street, on the far sands of a shore, in a window, in a meadow, at the opposite side of a railway station; but he determinedly turned on his heel, and walked the other way.|$|R

6000|$|We {{all know}} how much mythus {{there is in the}} Shakspere {{question}} as it stands to-day. Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are certainly engulf d far more dim and <b>elusive</b> <b>ones,</b> of deepest importance-- tantalizing and half suspected--suggesting explanations that one dare not put in plain statement. But coming at once to the point, the English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as dramatic performances (my maturest judgment confirming the impressions of my early years, that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside not in his vaunted dramas of the passions, but those founded on the contests of English dynasties, and the French wars,) but form, as we get it all, the chief in a complexity of puzzles. Conceiv'd out of the fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism--personifying in unparallel'd ways the mediaeval aristocracy, its towering spirit of ruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance (no mere imitation)--only one of the [...] "wolfish earls" [...] so plenteous in the plays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be the true author of those amazing works--works in some respects greater than anything else in recorded literature.|$|R

5000|$|Religions {{may have}} syncretic {{elements}} to their beliefs or history, but adherents of so-labeled systems often frown on applying the label, especially adherents {{who belong to}} [...] "revealed" [...] religious systems, such as the Abrahamic religions, or any system that exhibits an exclusivist approach. Such adherents sometimes see syncretism as a betrayal of their pure truth. By this reasoning, adding an incompatible belief corrupts the original religion, rendering it no longer true. Indeed, critics of a specific syncretistic trend may sometimes use the word [...] "syncretism" [...] as a disparaging epithet, as a charge implying that {{those who seek to}} incorporate a new view, belief, or practice into a religious system actually distort the original faith. Non-exclusivist systems of belief, on the other hand, may feel quite free to incorporate other traditions into their own. Others state that the term syncretism is an <b>elusive</b> <b>one,</b> and can be applied to refer to substitution or modification of the central elements of a dominant religion by beliefs or practices introduced from somewhere else. The consequence under this definition, according to Keith Ferdinando, is a fatal compromise of the dominant religion's integrity.|$|E

We conclude with a short example of the method in action and a discussion of some of the practical issues that researchers will face. ...|$|R
