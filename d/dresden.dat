5|$|At around 19:30, von Spee ordered <b>Dresden</b> and Leipzig {{to launch}} a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. <b>Dresden</b> {{increased}} speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted Glasgow as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. <b>Dresden</b> then encountered Leipzig; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. Dresdens crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, <b>Dresden</b> {{and the other two}} light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. <b>Dresden</b> had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served {{extensively}} on foreign stations; Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron from her commissioning, and <b>Dresden</b> was sent to Caribbean waters in 1913. <b>Dresden</b> was due to return to Germany for periodic maintenance shortly before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but this became impossible with the onset of hostilities. She therefore operated as a commerce raider, before linking up with Vizeadmiral Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron. <b>Dresden</b> thereafter participated in the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 and the Battle of the Falkland Islands the following December. She was the only German vessel to escape destruction at the latter engagement, and she remained at large for several more months. <b>Dresden</b> finally put into the Chilean island of Más a Tierra in March 1915 owing to worn-out engines. A pair of British cruisers violated Chilean neutrality and attacked <b>Dresden</b> while she lay at anchor; the Germans scuttled their ship to prevent her capture.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, Wilders held {{a speech}} for Pegida in <b>Dresden.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, a {{scholarship}} {{in memory of}} Marwa El-Sherbini was awarded for the first time. It is jointly funded by the city administration of <b>Dresden</b> and the state government of Saxony. The Marwa El-Sherbini Stipendium für Weltoffenheit und Toleranz aims at developing future leaders who support freedom, democracy, and human rights. It is awarded to postgraduate students enrolled at an institution {{of higher education in}} <b>Dresden.</b>|$|E
5|$|Still {{struggling}} with writer's block, Irving traveled to Germany, settling in <b>Dresden</b> {{in the winter}} of 1822. Here he dazzled the royal family and attached himself to Mrs. Amelia Foster, an American living in <b>Dresden</b> with her five children. Irving was particularly attracted to Mrs. Foster's 18-year-old daughter Emily and vied in frustration for her hand. Emily finally refused his offer of marriage in the spring of 1823.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} ban {{that had}} been placed on Wagner in Germany after he had fled <b>Dresden</b> was fully lifted in 1862. The composer settled in Biebrich, on the Rhine near Wiesbaden in Hesse. Here Minna visited him for the last time: they parted irrevocably, though Wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in <b>Dresden</b> until her death in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Wagner {{lived in}} <b>Dresden</b> {{for the next}} six years, {{eventually}} being appointed the Royal Saxon Court Conductor. During this period, he staged there Der fliegende Holländer (2 January 1843) and Tannhäuser (19 October 1845), the first two of his three middle-period operas. Wagner also mixed with artistic circles in <b>Dresden,</b> including the composer Ferdinand Hiller and the architect Gottfried Semper.|$|E
5|$|An aria for soprano II and obbligato violin {{express the}} praise and adoration of God in vivid coloraturas. It {{has been argued}} that Bach might have thought of the <b>Dresden</b> taste and the {{specific}} voice of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E
5|$|Cöln and <b>Dresden</b> {{joined the}} High Seas Fleet in 1918, which limited their service careers. They were {{assigned}} to the II Scouting Group, and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys. They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle {{in the final days of}} the war, but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan. The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919. Both <b>Dresden</b> and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dresden</b> saw {{action in}} the Battle of Coronel in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the Battle of the Falkland Islands in December, where {{she was the only}} German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into Robinson Crusoe Island in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers, so the ship's captain {{contacted}} the local Chilean authorities to have <b>Dresden</b> interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent Glasgow. The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the Battle of Más a Tierra. The Germans scuttled <b>Dresden</b> and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile {{for the duration of the}} war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dresden</b> {{spent most}} of her career on foreign stations. After her commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 as part of Germany's {{delegation}} to the Hudson-Fulton Celebration. She returned to North American waters in late 1913, when she was stationed off the Mexican coast to protect German nationals during the Mexican Revolution. Following the rebels' victory the following year, <b>Dresden</b> evacuated the former dictator Victoriano Huerta to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. In need of repairs, the cruiser was scheduled to return to Germany in July 1914, but the outbreak of World War I prevented this from taking place. Instead, <b>Dresden</b> operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic in the first months of the war before moving to the Pacific Ocean in September and thereafter joining Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Świerczewski halted his force's {{advance on}} <b>Dresden,</b> and ordered it {{to pull back}} and secure the breach. On 22 April he ordered the 1st Armored Corps to change direction, retreat from <b>Dresden</b> and support the centre. The 8th Infantry Division was also recalled; however, the 9th {{remained}} near <b>Dresden.</b> For a while Świerczewski was out of communication with his superiors, including Marshal Konev. Konev also sent his chief of staff, General Ivan Yefimovich Petrov, and his chief of operations, General Vladimir Ivanovich Kostylev, {{to look at the}} situation. Petrov managed to re-establish communications, and left Kostylev in charge. Świerczewski was briefly relieved of his command for incompetence. To stabilize the situation, Konev ordered eight divisions from the Ukrainian Front to reinforce the Polish positions. Soviet 14th and Soviet 95th guards rifle divisions, as well as the Soviet 4th Guards Tank Corps, were ordered to attack toward Kamenz, Königswartha and Sdier to stop the Germans from advancing further north. The 2nd Air Army was also assigned to this theater.|$|E
5|$|Germany's most-visited {{landmarks}} include e.g. Neuschwanstein Castle, Cologne Cathedral, Berlin Bundestag, Hofbräuhaus Munich, Heidelberg Castle, <b>Dresden</b> Zwinger, Fernsehturm Berlin and Aachen Cathedral. The Europa-Park near Freiburg is Europe's {{second most}} popular theme park resort.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} first foreign voyage in 1748, when he {{accompanied}} the Russian army as it advanced to Germany. During that trip he visited Aachen and the Netherlands. Later that year {{he returned to the}} Commonwealth, stopping in <b>Dresden.</b>|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were the}} reigning European Cup champions after {{defeating}} Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 {{to win the}} 1977 European Cup Final. Liverpool were also the reigning English champions, having won the English league during the 1976–77 season. As reigning European Cup champions, they received a bye in the first round. They were drawn against East German champions Dynamo <b>Dresden</b> in the second round. Liverpool were expected to win the first leg, played at Anfield, their home ground, and they did so with a score of 5–1. <b>Dresden</b> won the second leg 2-1 at their home ground, Glücksgas Stadium, giving Liverpool a 6–3 win on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Mölders joined an {{infantry}} regiment of the Reichswehr in Allenstein, East Prussia on 1 April 1931. After {{completing his}} basic military training in October 1932, {{he transferred to}} the Military School <b>Dresden.</b> On 1 June 1933, he successfully completed his training in <b>Dresden</b> and was promoted to ensign. He again was transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the Pioneer School in Munich. During his training years, Mölders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit for flying. He tried again and was given conditional permission (bedingt tauglich—with constraints) to begin flight training.|$|E
5|$|On 20 July, {{after the}} Huerta regime was toppled, <b>Dresden</b> carried Huerta, his vice president, Aureliano Blanquet, and their {{families}} to Kingston, Jamaica, where Britain had granted them asylum. Upon arriving in Kingston on the 25th, Köhler learned of the rising political tensions in Europe during the July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. By this time, the ship {{was in need of}} a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, Karlsruhe, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, the following day. Lüdecke, who had arrived in command of Karlsruhe, traded places with Köhler aboard <b>Dresden.</b> The Admiralstab initially ordered <b>Dresden</b> to return to Germany for overhaul, but the heightened threat of war by the 31st led the staff to countermand the order, instead instructing Lüdecke to prepare to conduct Handelskrieg (trade war) in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|On May23, 1927, the Department of Highways {{assumed the}} unpaved road between Highway7 at Reece's Corner and Highway3 at Morpeth, via <b>Dresden,</b> Thamesville and Ridgetown as Provincial Highway21; this {{was changed to}} the current King's Highway21 in 1930.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 March, Kent and Glasgow {{approached}} Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to <b>Dresden</b> by one of her pinnaces, which {{had been sent to}} patrol the entrance to the bay. <b>Dresden</b> was unable to maneuver, owing to her fuel shortage, and Lüdecke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded this message, as well as a Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. Glasgow opened fire, in violation of Chile's neutrality; Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located <b>Dresden</b> in Chilean territorial waters. Shortly thereafter, Kent joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners fired off three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Dresden</b> Triptych was {{probably}} {{in the possession of}} the Giustiniani family in the mid- to late-15th century. It is mentioned in a May 10, 1597 record of a purchase by Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and was then sold with the Gonzaga Collection to Charles I of England in 1627. After Charles's fall and execution, the painting went to Paris and was owned by Eberhard Jabach, the Cologne-based banker and art dealer for Louis XIV and Cardinal Mazarin. A year after Jabach's death in 1695, it passed to the Elector of Saxony, and next appears in a 1754 inventory of the <b>Dresden</b> Collection, attributed to Albrecht Dürer, until the German historian Aloys Hirt in 1830 established it as a van Eyck. In the mid-19th century the <b>Dresden</b> catalogues first attribute it to Hubert van Eyck (d.1426) and a few years later to Jan.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is scored for five-part choir, woodwinds and strings. As the <b>Dresden</b> Mass style required, it {{opens with a}} short homophonic section, followed by an extended fugue in two sections, which both begin with an instrumental fugue.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} {{in the third round}} were Dynamo Berlin of East Germany. The first leg at Dynamo's home ground the Sportforum ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg at Anfield was more eventful Liverpool took the lead through Phil Boersma in the first minute and Dynamo equalised six minutes later. Two further goals for Liverpool secured a 3–1 victory in the match and on aggregate. In the quarter-finals Liverpool again faced East German opposition, their opponents were Dynamo <b>Dresden.</b> Liverpool won the first leg 2–0 at Anfield, and they won the second leg 1–0 in East Germany, to beat <b>Dresden</b> 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Together with others, El-Sherbini {{founded a}} {{registered}} voluntary {{association with the}} aim of establishing an Islamic cultural and education centre in <b>Dresden.</b> At the time of her death, El-Sherbini was three months pregnant, expecting her second child.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's {{involvement}} in left-wing politics abruptly ended his welcome in <b>Dresden.</b> Wagner was active among socialist German nationalists there, regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor August Röckel and the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. He was {{also influenced by}} the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Ludwig Feuerbach. Widespread discontent {{came to a head}} in 1849, when the unsuccessful May Uprising in <b>Dresden</b> broke out, in which Wagner played a minor supporting role. Warrants were issued for the revolutionaries' arrest. Wagner had to flee, first visiting Paris and then settling in Zürich where he at first took refuge with a friend, Alexander Müller.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving <b>Dresden</b> and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, <b>Dresden</b> and Leipzig were detached for a stop in Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, <b>Dresden</b> and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of Orel, Model withdrew to the Dnieper as the Red Army went on the {{offensive}} from Smolensk in the north to Rostov in the south. He was relieved of command of the Ninth Army {{at the end of}} September, and took the opportunity to go on three months' leave in <b>Dresden</b> with his family. It was the last Christmas he would spend at home.|$|E
5|$|As a corps commander, Klenau led key {{elements}} of the Austrian army in its victory at Aspern-Esslingen and its defeat at Wagram, where his troops covered the retreat of the main Austrian force. He commanded the IV Corps at the 1813 Battle of <b>Dresden</b> and again at the Battle of Nations at Leipzig, where he prevented the French from outflanking the main Austrian force {{on the first day}} of the engagement. After the Battle of Nations, Klenau organized and implemented the successful <b>Dresden</b> blockade and negotiated the French capitulation there. In the 1814–15 campaign, he commanded the Corps Klenau of the Army of Italy. After the war in 1815, Klenau was appointed commanding general in Moravia and Silesia. He died in 1819.|$|E
5|$|As of September 13, Andretti {{was unable}} to travel to Germany from his Nazareth, Pennsylvania residence, since his planned September 11 flight had been grounded. Andretti was able to arrange a charter flight to Germany and landed in <b>Dresden</b> the next day.|$|E
5|$|Avery Brundage had no {{children}} with either of his wives. During his first marriage, however, Brundage fathered two sons out of wedlock with his Finnish mistress, Lilian <b>Dresden.</b> His affair with <b>Dresden</b> was one of many. The children were born in 1951 and 1952, at precisely the time that Brundage was being considered for {{the presidency of the}} IOC. Though he privately acknowledged paternity, Brundage took great pains to conceal the existence of these children, concerned that the truth about his extra-marital relationships might damage his chances of election: he requested that his name be kept off the birth certificates. Brundage visited his two sons periodically in the 1950s, visits that tailed off to telephone calls in the 1960s and nothing in his final years. He did establish a trust fund for the boys' education and start in life, but after his death, unnamed in his will, they sued and won a small settlement of $62,500 each out of his $19 million estate.|$|E
5|$|Bindrich {{attended}} the 12th Neckar Open in 2008 and finished first out of over 300 participants, with 7½/9, finishing {{only half a}} point ahead of Leon Hoyos, Dgebuadze, Lauber, Graf, Krämer, Peralta, Chatalbashev, Erdos, and Fedorchuk, who all finished the tournament with 7.0/9. He also played for Germany in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in <b>Dresden,</b> where his team placed 13th out of 146 overall teams.|$|E
5|$|Born in Zittau, Bindrich {{became a}} FIDE Master {{at the age}} of 13. He earned his International Master title in 2006 and his {{grandmaster}} title a year later. He played in the 2008 Chess Olympiad, held in <b>Dresden,</b> where his German team placed 13th. He has competed in several other prestigious chess events, such as the 2008 Bundesliga and the 2010 Chess Olympiad.|$|E
5|$|By 1932, US-36 {{headed west}} from Norton toward Oberlin instead of {{southwest}} toward Selden, {{and all of}} what is K-383 became part of US-83. The entire route from Selden to Nebraska had been straightened, mostly paralleling the railroad instead of following section lines, except for through Oronoque and Jennings. US-83 was a gravel road from Selden to the NortonPhillips county line, east of which the highway remained a dirt road until it was graveled in 1937. The highway was relocated straight through Jennings and to a path with fewer turns through Oronoque in 1938; that same year, the highway was paved with a bituminous surface along the US-36 concurrency. US-83 was paved from the US-36 split to the Nebraska state line in 1940. The highway was paved from Selden to <b>Dresden</b> by 1945 and from <b>Dresden</b> to US-36 west of Norton in 1948. US-383 {{was assigned to the}} entire length of the K-383 corridor and beyond in both directions by 1945.|$|E
5|$|Crossair Flight 498 was a {{commuter}} flight from Zurich, Switzerland, to <b>Dresden,</b> Germany, that crashed two minutes after takeoff in the Swiss municipality of Niederhasli on 10 January 2000. The seven passengers and three crew members aboard the two-turboprop engine Saab 340B aircraft all died on impact. It {{was the first}} fatal crash for the Swiss regional airline Crossair in its 25-year history.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dresden</b> {{spent much}} of her career overseas. After commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 during the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, before {{returning}} to Germany to serve in the reconnaissance force of the High Seas Fleet for three years. In 1913, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Division. She was then sent to the Caribbean to protect German nationals during the Mexican Revolution. In mid-1914, she carried the former dictator Victoriano Huerta to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. She was due to return to Germany in July 1914, but was prevented by the outbreak of World War I from doing so. At the onset of hostilities, <b>Dresden</b> operated as a commerce raider in South American waters in the Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific Ocean in September and joined Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dresden</b> was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and she did not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. <b>Dresden</b> was to have participated in a climactic sortie {{in the final days of}} the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E
5|$|During the War in Defence of the Constitution in 1792, Piattoli {{found himself}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission to <b>Dresden,</b> where he stayed after the Commonwealth's defeat {{at the hands of}} Imperial Russia resulted in the Second Partition of Poland. In <b>Dresden</b> and nearby Leipzig, Piattoli was active in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Kolłątaj. In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service. In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, and in negotiations with the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland into a second republic in Europe. At the same time, he was involved in much more conservative negotiations with Russians.|$|E
