50|$|For 2010 Triple Eight {{had hired}} Renault Cup {{champion}} Phil Glew and a last minute deal with Fabrizio Giovanardi. Uniq {{would be the}} main sponsor along with WD40 and DUNLOP. The season started sensationally for Giovanardi, winning the first two races at Thruxton and a fifth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final race gave him a lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> championship. Phil Glew also started well finishing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top 10 <b>in</b> both races only to retire <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final race. While Triple Eight were looking like contenders for the championship, the team was turned on its head. Before the next round at Rockingham, Uniq puled out sponsorship, as a result a lack of money meant that both Fabrizio Giovanardi and Phil Glew were forced to leave the team. James Nash was hired to race {{for the remainder of}} the season and Triple Eight ran a second car at times during the season driven by Daniel Lloyd (Round 5), Jeff Smith (Round 8) and Sam Tordoff (Round 10). The season was a disappointment for Triple Eight with changes in sponsors and lack of results, a third at Oulton Park by James Nash was only the real result of the season since Giovanardi's two wins at Thruxton. James Nash finished the season 8th and 12th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Trophy and outright championship. Fabrizio Giovanardi finished 12th and 14th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Trophy and outright championship. Phil Glew finished 14th and 16th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Trophy and outright championship (Phil Glew also drove for Special Tuning UK using a Seat Leon at Silverstone Round 7). Daniel Lloyd finished 18th and 17th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Trophy and outright championship. Sam Tordoff finished 23rd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Trophy and outright championship. Jeff Smith finished equal 24th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Trophy and outright championship. Triple Eight finished 5th and 7th <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Independents</b> Team Trophy and Teams championship.|$|R
