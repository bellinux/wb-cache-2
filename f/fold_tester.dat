5000|$|The term [...] "double fold" [...] {{refers to}} the test used by many librarians and {{preservation}} administrators to determine the brittleness and [...] "usability" [...] of paper. The test consists of folding down {{the corner of a}} page of a book or newspaper, then folding it back in the opposite direction - one double fold. The action is then repeated until the paper breaks or is about to break. The test yields a fold number. (In the late 1960s, preservation founding father William Barrow was fond of using a machine-run <b>fold</b> <b>tester</b> to back up his claims about the number of endangered books.) This experiment was used by library officials to identify their institution's brittle books, and, in some case, to justify withdrawing items from the shelves or replacing them with another format (most often microfilm). Baker describes the double fold test as [...] "...utter horseshit and craziness. A leaf of a book is a semi-pliant mechanism. It was made for non-acute curves, not for origami." [...] (p. 157).|$|E
50|$|Folding {{endurance}} {{is especially}} applicable for papers used for maps, bank notes, archival documents, etc. The {{direction of the}} grain {{in relation to the}} folding line, the type of fibres used, the fibre contents, the calliper of the test piece, etc., as well as which type of <b>folding</b> <b>tester</b> that is used affect how many double folds a test piece can take.|$|R
50|$|The total {{folding angle}} (about the folding line) differs {{depending}} on which <b>folding</b> <b>tester</b> is used, for instance the Köhler-Molin instrument folds about 156° {{on each side of}} the vertical line, resulting in a complete oscillation of about 2 &times; 312° for each double fold, while the MIT instrument employs a folding angle of about 135° on each side (that is, a complete oscillation of about 2 &times; 270° for each complete double fold).|$|R
50|$|Laboratory {{papermaking}} tests conducted {{recently and}} other results {{reported in the}} literature (3,4) indicate that the pulp yield from loblolly-bay was acceptable (52 percent), the bulk of the paper was low (1.46 cm/g or 2.53 in/oz), and the strength acceptable. One laboratory test indicated a breaking length of 11,525 m (37,800 ft), a tensile strength of 10.2 kgf/15 mm (38.1 lbf/in), and a count of 836 folds using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paper <b>folding</b> <b>tester</b> (1 kg or 2.2 lb). Although further testing needs to be done, these tests do not indicate any problems in making kraft paper from loblolly-bay pulp. Pulp mills in the lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina include loblolly-bay in their hardwood pulp.|$|R

The objective of this research is to study the performance of polypropylene hinges with the influence hot air in the fabricated chamber and high humidity condition. The performance of this sample was analysed by using <b>folding</b> endurance <b>tester</b> with hot air chamber, adopting the Design of Experiment L 9 (3 4) Taguchi Method for the selected factors which are temperature, relative humidity, breaking time and motor speed. All of these factors were selected with a constant force. Based on the findings, the best combination of parameters which signify the performance of folding endurance test in humidity environment is 70 0 C for temperature, 60 N for relative humidity, 2 days of breaking time and 850 rpm for motor speed. As for hot air environment, the best setting is 70 0 C for temperature, 55 N for relative humidity, 3 days of breaking time and 700 rpm for motor speed. For Signal to Noise ratio, the result showed that the temperature was the most influential factor for humidity effects and hot air environment, whereby the Signal to Noise ratio value obtained for the humidity and hot air environment are 129. 5 dBi and 130. 5 dBi respectively. The conclusion of this research is the polypropylene hinges have performed better with hot air environment as compared with higher humidity environment condition...|$|R

Three {{different}} crops had been studied which include the pineapple (Ananas Comosus) leaf, corn (Zea mays) stalk and Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum). Those crops were characterized as agro waste material in Malaysia and have a high potential to become an alternative fiber. The objective of this work was to analysis the chemical composition which are pineapple leaf, corn stalk and Napier grass; to investigate the properties of hand sheet made from those crops; to determine the influence of different pulping process and process variables on the physical and chemical properties. Every chemical components analyse; Cellulose, Hemicellulose, Ash and Lignin content by TAPPI Test Method. All of three samples were undergo acidic and alkali pulping process. Fiber Analyser was used for fiber analysis and SEM use for observation on sample. From pulping process, the step will continue for papermaking. Lastly, tensile, bursting, <b>folding,</b> and tearing <b>tester</b> machine will test paper production. Result shows that pineapple leaf gives high cellulose content (66. 2 %) and lower lignin content (4. 2 %) compared corn stalk and napier grass. Alkaline pulping shows a quality of pulp rather than acidic pulping process due to the pulp strength and colour of fiber. Corn stalk gives a high potential to be an alternative for mechanical properties viewed. High tensile index (90. 99 Ndg), burst index (6. 64 kpa*m 21 g) and fold index (3. 51 Nm) by corn stalk paper rather than pineapple leaf and napier grass but lower in tear index (2. 85 ~ m ~ l gT) h. is wass due to the long fiber length by pineapple leaf about 13. 36 mm fi-om SEM images. This arrangement form and effect a structure of fiber. Based on all tests, corn stalk materials have high potential to be fiber substitution but pineapple leaf and napier grass have their own characteristic to be alternative fiber. This research also promote green technology where one of the solid waste material technology for waste from agricultural residue...|$|R
