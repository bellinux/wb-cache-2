40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quantitative}} correlation {{study was to examine}} the association between participation in the <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> program with academic achievement and college enrollment for low SES students. The non-experimental design for this quantitative correlation study assessed associations between participation in the <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> program, academic achievement, and college enrollment for low SES students in New Jersey. Archival data was retrieved from NCES and NCCEP on the <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> program <b>and</b> analyzed for the results. The results showed that there is a significant relationship between participation in <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> <b>and</b> college entrance for low SES students, and there is a significant relationship between participation in <b>GEAR</b> <b>UP</b> <b>and</b> academic achievement for low SES students...|$|R
50|$|Several {{scenarios}} were {{suggested in}} the inquiry. One such suggestion was an engine failure, however after {{an investigation of the}} power plants and the propeller governors, this idea was eliminated. It was also suggested that the landing gear may have been operated incorrectly, however the inquiry established that the nose wheel and starboard undercarriage were <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> <b>and</b> whilst they could not definitely prove that the port undercarriage was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked,</b> the board decided that it was likely <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>locked.</b>|$|R

50|$|Some modern {{gearboxes}} {{such as the}} Alfa Romeo Sportronic have {{a traditional}} automatic shift pattern to the right, with a special position to the left in which movement of the stick forwards and backwards increments the <b>gears</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down respectively.

25|$|In 1942, the German command {{tended to}} devalue the combat {{capability}} of the United States Army Air Forces. Hitler repeatedly refused to accept reports from the German military attaché in Washington, suggesting that the United States war industry was <b>gearing</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> able to produce thousands of first-rate aircraft. However, Göring reassured Hitler, that the B-17 was of miserable fighting quality, and the Americans could only build proper refrigerators.|$|R

50|$|The {{aircraft}} crashed {{with its}} landing <b>gear</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> all passengers {{had been prepared}} for an emergency, as they were strapped into their seats.

5000|$|The {{prototype}} {{vehicle design}} on X2 allows riders to spin 360-degrees forwards and backwards, {{independent of the}} train's primary movement. Weighing 5 tons, each vehicle has a wing-shaped design that spans 20 ft. Riders sit {{on the outside of}} the coaster track in pairs. Four, 1 ft tall rack <b>gears</b> move <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down following the profile of the seat rotation rails below the vehicle. This gear rotates the seats forwards and backwards throughout the ride. Unlike traditional roller coasters, 4th Dimension roller coasters, like X2, have four rails. The seat rotation rails bend <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down slightly pushing the rack <b>gear</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down which in turn rotates the seats. [...] These [...] "rotation" [...] rails don't support the train. The other two rails are for the weight-bearing wheels, capable of supporting these heavy trains.|$|R

40|$|Most {{young people}} who are put into custody are aged 16 and 17 – they are not children; they are often large, {{unpleasant}} thugs, and they are frightening to the public.

5000|$|In some modern sports cars, {{the gear}} lever has been {{replaced}} entirely by [...] "paddles", which are a pair of levers, usually operating electrical switches (rather than a mechanical connection to the gearbox), mounted {{on either side of}} the steering column, where one increments the <b>gears</b> <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> the other down.

50|$|From the CVR data, 16 {{seconds before}} the crash, the Captain called for a go-around, <b>gear</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> flaps before the crash. A warning horn then sounded {{followed}} by a 'too low gear' aural sound. Apparently, the pilots had difficulty in sighting the runway and should have carried a missed approach on the Decision Altitude of 307 ft instead of continuing descent below 204 ft. The flaps were retracted and the gear was extended. But the gear was locked. The 'too low gear' warning then appeared again, and a Ground Proximity Warning System followed.|$|R
