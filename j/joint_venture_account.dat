40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to look at}} a <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> (JV) set up by a Portuguese {{company and}} a global {{corporation}} (GC) in the hospitality sector. The paper seeks to examine how, and why the JV's managers introduced variations in the management control (MC) rules and procedures in institutionalizing the global MC system imposed by the GC. Design/methodology/approach – The paper relies on qualitative data collected through a case study of the JV over a period of two years. Insights from recent neo-institutional work in accounting, complemented by the notion of multiple logics and the Orton and Weick perspective on loose coupling, are drawn on to interpret the case findings. The MC literature in GCs is also reviewed to explore whether and how practice variation can occur in these complex institutional settings. Findings – Although institutional and technical criteria were not in dialectical tension, the global MC system was adapted by the JV's managers. They developed loosely coupled MC rules and procedures to satisfy the multiple logics informing it. Research limitations/implications – More qualitative studies on the adoption of externally imposed practices in other global/local settings are needed to refine the understanding of this phenomenon. Originality/value – The present study extends the scope of neoinstitutional analysis in accounting by showing and explaining how and why individual organizations, which are dependent on dominant others, can introduce variations in imposed systems and practices. In so doing, the paper also contributes to a fuller understanding of MC practices in GCs. Control, Hospitality management, <b>Joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> Management <b>accounting,</b> Portugal...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{increasing}} tend towards, {{and importance}} of, inter-organisational collaborative agreements, such as <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> is widely recognised. While {{the benefits of}} <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> have been extensively promoted, many such ventures continue to fail. Research into <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> {{has been described as}} either focusing on an in-depth analysis of a selected narrow issue or sweeping generalisations of a more general magnitude, with emphasis on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> formation motives, <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> structuring and partner selection and characteristics. More recently, a growing volume of literature strongly supports the notion that <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance might be more fully understood by the examination of the behavioural characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team. This study aims to establish how the behaviours of an engineering <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team influence the venture’s performance. The methodology applied in this study is qualitative, interpretive research using the case study method. The qualitative case study investigated the implementation of an international engineering <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> between Hatch Africa, Mott Macdonald and Goba engineering companies for the delivery of the Transnet mega projects programme in South Africa. The researcher utilised semi-structured interviews and documentary investigation to construct a rich database in order to provide a holistic view of how behavioural characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team influences <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Seven key behavioural groupings, consisting of commitment, trust, cooperation/coordination/interdependence/reciprocity, communication, conflict resolution, role of management/management style and learning were analysed. Four key themes emerged namely: organisational hierarchy; the effect of time; organisational set up and design; and the current market conditions. Organisational and individual learning, communication and the role of management/management style emerged as the behavioural groupings which had the greatest affect, either positively or negatively, on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Commitment, cooperation and coordination also emerged as having a significant impact on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance while trust was found to have an indirect influence on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Interdependence, conflict resolution and reciprocity were found to have less of an impact on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. ii By considering the results of this research, managers of <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> partner firms and <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> management teams themselves can focus their attention, both at the commencement and set up stage of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> as well as during the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> development, on the behaviours which have the biggest impact on the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance, thereby improving the probability of success in the <b>joint</b> <b>venture...</b>|$|R
