The Gyalwang Drukpa would likely agree with Ackermann’s assertion {{that we need}} to “find our common need to resuscitate and nurture all living beings” (Ackermann 1997, 52). Similarly, Ackermann points out with respect to Christian theology that “the <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> all <b>living</b> <b>things</b> is simply not understood and injustice and rapaciousness continue” (Ackermann 1997). The <b>interdependence</b> <b>of</b> all <b>living</b> <b>things</b> (and non-living things) is a fundamental tenet of Buddhism (Newland 1999) and therefore is seen to concord with the Christian principle. Whether the core Buddhist principle <b>of</b> <b>interdependence</b> results in comparatively better environmental stewardship among Buddhists remains a question open for empirical investigation.|$|R

In Experiment 1, the hypothesis that visual and functional knowledge play different roles in the representation <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> and nonliving things is tested and confirmed. A parallel distributed processing model of semantic memory in which knowledge is subdivided by modality into visual and functional components is described. In Experiment 2, the model is lesioned, and {{it is confirmed that}} damage to visual semantics primarily impairs knowledge <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things,</b> and damage to functional semantics primarily impairs knowledge of non!iving things. In Experiment 3, it {{is demonstrated}} that the model accounts naturally for a finding that had appeared problematic for a modality-specific architec-ture, namely, impaired retrieval of functional knowledge about <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Finally, in Experiment 4, it is shown how the model can account for a recent observation of impaired knowledge <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> only when knowledge is probed verbally...|$|R

40|$|Several {{cases of}} category-specific {{semantic}} deficits for <b>living</b> <b>things</b> {{have now been}} reported, {{most of whom have}} a greater difficulty with knowledge of visual properties <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> than with non-visual properties. This has motivated two different kinds of account of category-specific deficits for <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> One account is that theimpairment forliving things arises as a result of general damage to visual properties, and so it predicts that impairment for visual properties <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things</b> will be accompanied by some degree of impairment for visual properties of other categories. The second account posits explicit category-based organisation of semantic memory, such that visual properties <b>of</b> <b>living</b> and non-living <b>things</b> are stored separately, and so can be independently impaired. We investigated the semantic impairment of a patient SE, who had received a diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis several years previously, resulting in a mild category-specific semantic deficit for <b>living</b> <b>things.</b> Both off-line and on-line tasks revealed that SE had a highly selective impairment for the visual properties <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>things,</b> with no sign of problems for the visual properties of non-living things. This raises a challenge for models in which category-specific deficits emerge {{as a result of a}} general deficit determined by some other factor. We suggest one way in which these models may account for the data by encoding inter-relations between the function and form of objects in semantic memory.
