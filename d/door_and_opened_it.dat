2500|$|On February 16, 2009, Travis {{attacked}} Sandra Herold's 55-year-old friend Charla Nash, inflicting devastating {{injuries to}} her face and limbs. Travis had left the house with Sandra Herold's car keys, and Nash came to help get the chimp back in the house; upon seeing Nash holding {{one of his favorite}} toys, Travis immediately attacked her. [...] Travis was familiar with Nash, who had also worked at the Herolds' towing company, although Nash had a different hair style {{at the time of the}} attack. [...] The chimp had been taking medication for Lyme disease. Herold, then 70 years old, attempted to stop Travis by hitting him with a shovel and stabbing him with a butcher knife. [...] "For me to do something like that – put a knife in him – was like putting one in myself," [...] Herold later said. The chimp turned around, she said, as if to say, [...] "'Mom, what did you do?'" [...] The ape was angered more. Herold then called 9-1-1 and pleaded for help. Travis' screams can be heard in the background of the tape as Sandra pleads for police, who initially believed the call to be a hoax, until she started screaming, [...] "He's eating her!" [...] Emergency medical services waited for police before approaching the house. Travis walked up to the police car when it arrived, tried to open a locked passenger door, and smashed a side-view mirror. Then he went calmly around to the driver's-side <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> at which point Officer Frank Chiafari shot him several times. Travis retreated to the house, where he was found dead next to his cage.|$|E
60|$|Squire Paget {{moved toward}} the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> for Dan Pickley, his visitor.|$|E
60|$|The guide {{knocked at}} the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> Rochester and Pauline passed in....|$|E
6000|$|... (The knock is repeated. DR. JONATHAN {{goes to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> [...] Enter, in {{the order}} named, HILLMAN, RENCH and FERSEN.) ...|$|R
60|$|PRAED. Certainly. [He {{goes to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> Frank {{sits down}} in Vivie's chair to scribble a note]. My dear Kitty: come in: come in.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. MILER {{comes out}} with her hat on, passes enigmatically to [...] the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> A man's voice says: [...] "Mr. Malise? Would [...] you give him these cards?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> just as the {{horseman}} {{stopped in}} front.|$|E
60|$|She {{ran to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and a glad {{voice was}} heard crying.|$|E

500|$|Nina {{receives}} {{a standing ovation}} from the audience and, after surprising Thomas with a passionate kiss, returns to her dressing room. While changing, Nina hears {{a knock at the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> to find Lily congratulating her. Realizing the fight never occurred and that she stabbed herself, Nina quietly continues changing.|$|R
60|$|Her passionate speech still rang {{throughout}} {{the room when}} there came footsteps on the porch. Helen hurried to raise the bar from the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> just as a tap sounded on the door-post. Roy's face stood white out of the darkness. His eyes were bright. And his smile made Helen's fearful query needless.|$|R
50|$|A young priest, Fr. Daniel Bresson (played by Jimmi Simpson), runs a {{homeless}} shelter. After {{he gives a}} man a sweater to keep warm, Bresson begins drinking at a dangerous rate.

60|$|The senator's son {{came to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> Dave {{entered the}} stateroom, which was dark.|$|E

60|$|Adam {{moved away}} from the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> but when Arthur reached the step, he stopped again and leaned against the door-post.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{will believe}} what you tell me. Now, do you resume your place at the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> as usual at his signal. Say no word and make no sign which may lead him to know of our {{presence}} here. Mind, my eye will be upon you, and your life will pay for any treachery." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. Open the door, you old silly. [She {{begins to}} blow up the balloon again. The AMAH goes to the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> LEE TAI steps in.] Lee Tai.

60|$|Ann {{went to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> She {{looked down}} the passage, then, {{satisfied}} as to its emptiness, returned to her seat.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{crossed the}} little wood bridge in front, {{went up to}} the cottage <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> without knock or signal of any kind.|$|E
6000|$|The Doctor {{considered}} this. At last {{he went to}} the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "All right, Corporal. You may go now. And {{thanks for}} your time." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{knock at}} the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> Mullins <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to admit the adjutant's orderly, who came stiffly to attention.|$|R
60|$|The girl, cowed and wretched, goes to {{the fire}} and puts a log on. Mrs. Dudgeon unbars the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> letting into the stuffy kitchen {{a little of the}} {{freshness}} {{and a great deal of}} the chill of the dawn, also her second son Christy, a fattish, stupid, fair-haired, round-faced man of about 22, muffled in a plaid shawl and grey overcoat. He hurries, shivering, to the fire, leaving Mrs. Dudgeon to shut the door.|$|R
60|$|SERGIUS (shivering as if {{a bullet}} had struck him, and {{speaking}} with quiet but deep indignation). I will prove that that, at least, is a calumny. (He goes with dignity to the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it.</b> A yell of fury bursts {{from him as}} he looks out. He darts into the passage, and returns dragging in Louka, whom he flings against the table, R., as he cries) Judge her, Bluntschli--you, the moderate, cautious man: judge the eavesdropper.|$|R
60|$|The girl came {{slowly to}} the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> several inches, showing a mass of disheveled hair, and cheeks that had traces of tears on them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night all," [...] he ses. Then {{he went to}} {{the front}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it,</b> and arter {{standing}} there a moment came back as though he 'ad forgotten something.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly as you choose!" [...] And {{he went to}} the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> for her to go out. The {{movement}} {{gave her}} a terrible sense of his turning her off.|$|E
50|$|Chime of VisitorsThis simple metal stick is 3 {{inches long}} and made of a silvery metal. It keeps time as a chime of time but with an unusual side effect. If it rings while within 60 feet of any {{ordinary}} or otherwise known door, all creatures hearing the chime must make a saving throw vs. spells; all victims who fail the throw {{must go to the}} nearest <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> or attempt to do so for at least six rounds.|$|R
50|$|The {{confusing}} mix {{of signals}} is suddenly cut out. Rani wakes {{up to find}} her parents missing, and there is no-one in sight outside. Sarah Jane is also gone, and Mr Smith no longer {{appears to be in}} the computer that houses him. Rani searches for another person, finding that nothing has a signal anymore. She prays that she is not alone, when she hears a knock at the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it</b> to find Clyde. They head into town to look for someone besides them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady's maid," [...] I {{heard him}} whisper to himself. [...] "A fine woman to look at, but a damned bad one to deal with." [...] I turned round on him, rather angry at his cool ways, and looked hard at him just before I opened the library door. Mr. Dark looked hard at me. [...] "All right," [...] says he. [...] "I can show myself in." [...] And he knocks at the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> goes in with another wicked wink, {{all in a}} moment.|$|R
60|$|Percy {{saw that}} it was safe now. He went to the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b> Ralph was {{standing}} outside, in readiness; and in another moment his mother was in his arms.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past ten {{when there}} came a ring {{at the front door}} bell. Fouquier-Tinville, half expecting citizen Chauvelin to pay him a final visit, shuffled to the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
60|$|Nelly {{went to the}} <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>it</b> to Lord Ballindine, who {{had left}} his gig in charge of his servant. He asked for Martin, who in a short time, joined him in the parlour.|$|E
60|$|In {{the shades}} {{of the wet}} road she soon discerned her mother with tall 'Liza-Lu and Abraham. Mrs Durbeyfield's pattens clicked up to the <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> Tess <b>opened</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{only have}} two dreams. One dream {{is that someone}} will knock on the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> I will <b>open</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> they give me a check for $150,000 for the magazine. Second dream is that someone knocks at the <b>door</b> <b>and</b> I <b>open</b> <b>it</b> up <b>and</b> {{he gives me a}} corned beef sandwich. Those are my only two dreams. I'm not asking for much. Really, I'm not. And I think they're both reachable." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{his memory}} of that childish {{experience}} ran, he did at the very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion, an attraction, a desire {{to get to the}} <b>door</b> <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> walk in. And {{at the same time he}} had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise or it was wrong of him-- he could not tell which--to yield to this attraction. He insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from the very beginning--unless memory has played him the queerest trick--that the <b>door</b> was unfastened, <b>and</b> that he could go in as he chose.|$|R
