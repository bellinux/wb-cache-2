5|$|In 1905, {{members of}} the Armenian Revolutionary Federation {{organized}} the failed Yıldız Attempt, an assassination plot on Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{in the capital of}} the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople (modern day Istanbul); the explosion missed its target by a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> Dashnaksutiun founder Kristapor Mikaelian was lost by an accidental explosion during the planning of the operation.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce {{the gap between the}} two countries.|$|E

5|$|After the 'panic party' {{had taken}} to the boats and the ship {{appeared}} to be sinking, the U-boat approached to within 80 yards of her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and Prize opened fire. Within a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>the</b> submarine was on fire and her bows rose in the air, whilst Prize was further damaged. The U-boat disappeared from sight, and was {{believed to have been}} sunk by the crew of Prize and by several of the German crew (including her captain) who had been blown or jumped into the sea. However, neither of the crippled ships had sunk, with Prize being towed in flames back to Kinsale. U-93 struggled back to the Sylt nine days later.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the unidentified man into the museum twice within a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

5|$|The final moult of the nymph {{is not to}} {{the full}} adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that {{physically}} resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and genitalia are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting {{one or two days}} but in some species only a <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> <b>the</b> subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} universe has reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> (<b>the</b> time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> <b>the</b> request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} swallows, pairing and {{copulation}} displays are normally brief, taking just a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> male calls {{to a female}} and attempts to lead her to the nest, where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head, dropped wings and ruffled throat. If he is successful, the female calls and allows him to mount her, usually in the nest. Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double-brooded. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female {{does most of the}} incubation, which normally lasts 14–16 days. The newly hatched chicks are altricial, and after a further 22–32 days, depending on weather, the chicks leave the nest. The fledged young stay with, and are fed by, the parents for about a week after leaving the nest. Occasionally, young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood.|$|E
5|$|O'Donnell {{attempted}} {{to probe the}} Viet Cong flank, and after locating it on the high ground he committed 1 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Rod Smith—to conduct a right flanking attack. Beginning at 11:30 the Australian assault soon ran into another Viet Cong platoon conducting a similar manoeuvre, and they became involved in an intense battle at close quarters with each side blocking the manoeuvre of the other. A heavy monsoon rain began, drenching the men as they faced each other at a range of just , with seven Viet Cong machine-guns facing six Australian machine-guns {{at the height of}} the battle as the two Viet Cong platoons clashed with two Australian platoons. The Australians suffered heavily, losing two section commanders killed and a dozen men wounded in the first <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> fighting continued for another two hours as both forces traded shots, with neither the Australians nor the Viet Cong able to achieve a decisive advantage.|$|E

25|$|By May 5, 2005, {{the highest}} point on the new dome was 7,675feet (2,339m), 688feet (210m) below {{the highest point}} of the volcano.

25|$|At midnight, with {{ammunition}} running low, Captain Hector Waller {{ordered his}} ship {{to try to}} force a way through.

25|$|Gamma {{radiation}} in the TeV range {{emanating from}} the Crab Nebula was first detected in 1989 by the Whipple Observatory at Mt. Hopkins, in Arizona in the USA. Modern Cherenkov telescope experiments like H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, and CANGAROO III can detect the Crab Nebula in a <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> <b>The</b> most energetic photons (up to 16 TeV) observed from an extragalactic object originate from the blazar, Markarian 501 (Mrk 501). These measurements were done by the High-Energy-Gamma-Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) air Cherenkov telescopes.|$|E
