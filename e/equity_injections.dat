We identify a range of factors that strengthen or weaken the possibility of contagion and bailout. Recapitalization with common stock rather than preferred <b>equity</b> <b>injection</b> dilutes existing shareholder interests and gives the bank a greater incentive to hold capital to cope with potential contagion.

But when the authorities cannot close banks and must rely on financial incentives to induce banks to liquidate their NPLs, recapitalisation using equity (Tier 1 capital) would be the second-best policy, whereas recapitalisation using subordinated debt (Tier 2 capital) is suboptimal.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 10 years the three Baltic republics have {{undertaken}} significant restructuring of their banking sectors, {{supported by the}} World Bank through three projects: the Financial Institutions Development Project in Estonia, the Enterprise and Financial Sector Restructuring Project in Latvia, and the Enterprise and Financial Sector Project in Lithuania. These projects included a credit line, channeled through local commercial banks, to provide long-term funding and complementary technical assistance to private enterprises. In parallel, the government of Sweden injected equity into the commercial banks from Swedfund Financial Markets (SFM). The projects and the accompanying Swedfund equity were aimed at promoting sound banking systems in the three Baltic countries-by strengthening the equity in the banks and thereby expanding medium- and long-term financing. Meigas examines the role of SFM-which provides development-oriented equity investment (DEI) to Baltic banks-in {{the context of the}} World Bank programs. She examines the arguments for deploying DEI as a development vehicle by gauging its impact in the three Baltic countries on banking skills and services, on capitalization, and on shareholder structure and board membership. She draws out the role of technical assistance and compares its impact with that of DEI, and explores the possibilities offered by DEI for imposing sound corporate governance. The author also describes the necessary ingredients for successful DEI. The author's analysis shows that the Baltic projects were valuable initiatives that could in principle be replicated in other transition or developing economies whose banking sector faces serious restructuring challenges. A development-oriented equity investment, like that made by SFM, can address the important deficiencies in a banking sector that is still in a rudimentary state, lacking both capital and banking skills. SFM's most effective tool was the imposition of sound corporate governance on the institutions that received the <b>equity</b> <b>injection.</b> This approach provided a powerful supplement to the banking supervisory functions. Rather than relying on the external enforcement power of state supervision, SFM targeted internal processes to change business practices. As a result, the DEI led to improvements in the corporate culture and broader risk management and thus in the quality of banking services-not only meeting the institutional development objectives but also ensuring an adequate return on the invested capital. The potential of good corporate governance for easing the work of banking supervisors has been stressed by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision. Thispotential is particularly valuable in countries still developing the supervisory function, and DEI, the author argues, is well suited for the task of improving corporate governance.

40|$|Thesis (MBA (Business Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2010. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: NamPower is {{the current}} power utility in Namibia and needs to access the debt capital markets {{over the next few}} years, in order to be {{successful}} to finance its capital expenditure programme of NAD 13. 9 billion. NamPower intends to raise the funding from its operations, shareholders <b>equity</b> <b>injection</b> and debt, in the form of bonds and development finance. In order to be successful in its bond issuance programme, NamPower must at least maintain an investment grade credit rating. Credit Rating Agencies play an important role to provide investors with their credit ratings and reports. Many investors base their investment decision making on certain levels of credit ratings. A credit rating is the probability that an issuer or instrument will default on its debt repayment obligation. Depending on the circumstances, investors usually require a minimum of an investment grade rating (AFP, 2009 : 20). Looking at the current financial crisis investors felt left down by the credit rating agencies, as investors relied on the credit rating reports and the underlying credit rating. Investors literally lost billions in financial crisis of 2007 - 8 / 9 as corporate and structured products defaulted on meeting financial obligations. As a result of the defaults and financial crisis the credit rating agencies have been criticised for inadequate disclosure and potential conflicts of interest. Many critics argue that credit rating agencies are not asking inquisitive questioning and probing into issues when doing credit reviews. Evidence was not that conclusive, but big corporate failures like Enron and WorldCom are examples of the credit rating agencies’ failures. Furthermore, credit rating agencies are not particular about creating predictions of future developments, but the last crisis has shown that credit rating agencies were fairly successful with corporate or issuer ratings as default has been fairly limited to the higher credit rating categories. Evidence provided in the research supports that investors still rely on credit ratings more so for corporate, institutions and fixed income products, but are very insure about structured products, due to recent market failures. Therefore it is still of critical importance for NamPower to maintain its investment grade credit rating. NamPower has maintained and even improved on its local national scale credit rating. Investors are still risk adverse since the financial crisis but as economic conditions improve investors should be coming back to emerging markets. To bring back the investors to invest in the emerging markets will require a certain appetite returning to the investor, but surely there will be a premium or funding will be more costly in future and not in demand as previously. As for NamPower, the opinion is therefore that although smaller in size, it poses as an attractive investment opportunity for investors as there is shortage in investment grade assets in Sub-Sahara Africa to fill the portfolio gaps and give diversification...|$|R

40|$|As {{illustrated}} by liquidity support, <b>equity</b> <b>injections</b> and asset repurchases in financial crises and by IMF credit lines to countries, authorities often intervene {{in order to}} revive markets that have dried up or to create new ones. In such situations, agents participate only if they receive from the governmental scheme {{more than in the}} marketplace, while the market outcome depends on who joins the scheme. The paper provides a first analysis of market jumpstarting and its two-way interaction between mechanism design and participation constraints. In the model, sellers in need of cash have private information about the value of their legacy asset. The absence of buyer confidence forces authorities to intervene to jump-start the market. We characterize the optimal intervention, and draw two main implications. First, the government should clean up the market, through buybacks of the weakest assets and then through some <b>equity</b> <b>injections,</b> and leave the agents with the strongest legacy assets to the market. In particular, authorities should not substitute fully for the market, even when they have no comparative disadvantage in acquiring assets or shares thereof. Second, the government creates its own competition by cleaning up the market from its most toxic pieces. At the optimal intervention the government always strictly overpays for the legacy asset. Yet, and unlike what would be suggested by Coasian profit evasion, the existence of a later market imposes no welfare cost. While it is cast in a public intervention context, the analysis of mechanismdependent reservation utilities also admits important private sector applications...|$|E
40|$|The Australian Government has {{committed}} to provide $ 29. 5 billion in equity funding to NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) for the rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) by 2020.   The Government also recently agreed to provide NBN Co with a loan of $ 19. 5 billion to complete the NBN rollout at an estimated total cost of $ 49 billion. As at 30 June 2016, the Government had contributed $ 20. 3 billion in equity funding to NBN Co.   The Commonwealth’s equity in NBN Co at that time stood at $ 13. 1  billion, representing a $ 7. 2 billion deterioration in the Commonwealth’s equity holding in NBN Co. The deterioration in the Commonwealth’s equity is principally due to NBN Co accumulating losses totalling $ 8. 3 billion as at 30 June 2016 (see Figure 2 – 2, page  7).   These losses reflect {{the early years of}} the rollout of the NBN. The deterioration in the Commonwealth’s equity in NBN Co is reflected in the Commonwealth’s aggregate net worth in its balance sheet and the Department of Communications and the Arts’ annual financial statements.   It is not separately identified in the budget papers. The annual cost to the budget of the Government’s investment in the NBN is estimated at around $ 580 million in 2016 – 17.   Following the final drawdown of the $ 29. 5 billion in equity and assuming the loan is drawn down from 2017 – 18 and paid back in full in 2020 – 21, the annual cost is estimated to rise to over $ 730  million in 2019 - 20 and to $ 2. 1 billion by 2026 – 27 (see Figure 2 – 1, page  5).  These costs, while significantly impacting the budget bottom line, are not separately identified in the budget papers. The key driver of the annual cost to the Commonwealth of the NBN is the public debt interest payments associated with the government’s <b>equity</b> <b>injection</b> in NBN Co.   The provision of additional funding through a loan at an interest rate above the government’s cost of borrowing provides a partial offset to this annual cost. The final cost of the Commonwealth’s financing of NBN Co will not be known until NBN Co is privatised and the market places a value on the NBN.   Until then the Commonwealth will continue to bear an annual cost associated with its financing of NBN Co.   If the sale price of NBN Co is less than the Commonwealth’s cumulative cost of financing NBN Co, then the NBN would have an enduring cost to the budget. There is also a risk, albeit rated by the Government as small (less than five per cent probability), that the Government could be called upon to meet contingent liabilities it has entered into in relation to the NBN rollout.   These contingent liabilities totalled $ 15. 5  billion as at 30 June 2016...|$|R
