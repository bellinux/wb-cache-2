Many sociological studies have neglected to study men’s role {{and participation in}} <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> and focused mainly on women’s position.  This thesis builds on social movement theories and previous research conducted within this field.   This study aims to reveal factors that motivate men’s participation and roles played by them in contemporary <b>feminist</b> <b>movements.</b> Qualitative interviews are used for data collection. The data indicate that men’s role in <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> is designated to support the movements.

40|$|Vernet and Fabrizio Butera Women, women’s {{rights and}} <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> Abstract. This article contends that <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> {{are victims of}} social cryptomnesia: while women’s rights are {{nowadays}} largely approved, the role of <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> in obtaining these rights is not recognized, and feminist groups are still stigmatized. This social cryptomnesia is believed to hinder further progress towards equality between men and women. Indeed, although women’s rights are officially protected, men–women differences in status still exist; however, the potential of <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> to achieve real equality is blocked by social cryptomnesia, which describes feminists as extremists who do not realize that women’s rights have already changed. We review some of the achievements of two waves of <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> in obtaining women’s rights; the obstacles to a third wave of movements claiming real equality are discussed {{in relation to the}} social cryptomnesia phenomenon. Key words. Collective movements – Discrimination – Feminists – Guilt – Minorities...|$|R

5|$|After Wollstonecraft's death, her widower {{published}} a Memoir (1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation {{for almost a}} century. However, {{with the emergence of}} the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important. Today Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and feminists often cite both her life and work as important influences.|$|E
5|$|French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir {{provided}} a Marxist solution and an existentialist view {{on many of}} the questions of feminism with the publication of Le Deuxième Sexe (The Second Sex) in 1949. The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice. Second-wave feminism is a <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> beginning in the early 1960s and continuing to the present; as such, it coexists with third-wave feminism. Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending gender discrimination.|$|E

5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a questioning of the patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global <b>feminist</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|The social {{rigidity}} of the 1950s {{and early}} 1960s encountered a backlash as social movements {{to improve the}} standing of African Americans, the poor, women, and gays all became prominent. Of the latter two, the gay rights movement and the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> connected after a violent confrontation occurred in New York City in the 1969 Stonewall riots. What followed was a movement characterized by a surge of gay activism and feminist consciousness that further transformed the definition of lesbian.|$|E
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement.</b> The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E

5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E
5|$|Women's music (or womyn's {{music or}} wimmin's music) {{is the music}} by women, for women, and about women. The genre emerged as a musical {{expression}} of the second-wave <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> {{as well as the}} labour, civil rights, and peace movements. The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near. Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement</b> were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

40|$|What {{explains}} the inconsistency of female empowerment in South America, despite {{high levels of}} institutional inclusion? Generally, the social sciences tend to lean on the tenets of liberal feminism {{in order to measure}} the development of gender-inclusive policy changes; however, their findings indicate that higher levels of institutional inclusion does not necessarily translate into the empowerment of women as a group. Further, within political science, there is little research addressing the relationship between <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> and the <b>feminist</b> opinion of individuals within a state. I argue that strong <b>feminist</b> social <b>movements</b> provide a context in which feminist opinion is magnified, and where individuals {{will be more likely to}} support progressive policy changes. Using questions from the World Values Survey, I operationalize progressive policies as the Justifiability of Abortion. My primary independent variables are the presence <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> and the presence of feminist opinion, which is measured by support for female sexual freedom. After using a multilevel mixed-effects linear regression, I find support for my hypotheses, indicating that feminist opinion is magnified by the presence of <b>feminist</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R
5|$|At this point, Murray had no {{experience}} in field archaeology, and so during the 1902–03 field season, she travelled to Egypt to join Petrie's excavations at Abydos. Petrie and his wife, Hilda Petrie, had been excavating at the site since 1899, having taken over the archaeological investigation from French Coptic scholar Émile Amélineau. Murray at first joined as site nurse, but was subsequently taught how to excavate by Petrie and given a senior position. This led to some issues {{with some of the}} male excavators, who disliked the idea of taking orders from a woman. This experience, coupled with discussions with other female excavators (some of whom were active in the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement)</b> led Murray to adopt openly feminist viewpoints. While excavating at Abydos, Murray uncovered the Osireion, a temple devoted to the god Osiris which had been constructed by order of Pharaoh Seti I during the period of the New Kingdom. She published her site report as The Osireion at Abydos in 1904; in the report, she examined the inscriptions that had been discovered at the site to discern the purpose and use of the building.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{also became}} closely {{involved}} in the first-wave <b>feminist</b> <b>movement,</b> joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, {{the theory that the}} witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging new religious movement of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to London, Murray took {{an active role}} in the <b>feminist</b> <b>movement,</b> volunteering and financially donating to the cause and taking part in feminist demonstrations, protests, and marches. Joining the Women's Social and Political Union, she was present at large marches like the Mud March of 1907 and the Women's Coronation Procession of June 1911. She concealed the militancy of her actions in order to retain the image of respectability within academia. Murray also pushed the professional boundaries for women throughout her own career, and mentored other women in archaeology and throughout academia. As women could not use the men's common room, she successfully campaigned for UCL to open a common room for women, and later ensured that a larger, better-equipped room was converted for the purpose; it was later renamed the Margaret Murray Room. At UCL, she became a friend of fellow female lecturer Winifred Smith, and together they campaigned to improve the status and recognition of women in the university, with Murray becoming particularly annoyed at female staff who were afraid of upsetting or offending the male university establishment with their demands. Feeling that students should get nutritious yet affordable lunches, for many years she sat on the UCL Refectory Committee.|$|E
5|$|<b>Feminist</b> <b>movements</b> have campaigned and {{continue}} to campaign for women's rights, {{including the right to}} vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between the Brazilian Women's Policy Agency (WPA), the Secretaria Especial de Politicas para as Mulheres- SPM (the Special Secretariat for Public Policies for Women), and the <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> in two policy debates in 2003 - 2006. This study analyses the level of policy impact the <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> had through the SPM in two contrasting case studies, abortion and Violence against Women (VA W). These cases were selected because they were both considered high priority for the <b>feminist</b> <b>movements,</b> and they both received government attention prior to, and during 2003 - 2006. However, they differed substantially in the level of contentiousness, which indicated different probabilities for movements' success. Loosely informed by the Research Network on Gender and the State (RNGS) framework, this study explores the interaction between <b>feminist</b> <b>movements</b> and, the SPM through focussing on the policy environment, the characteristics of the <b>feminist</b> <b>movements,</b> and the activities and characteristics of the SPM. My findings are based upon primary and secondary source material, including elite interviews, participant observations and the analysis of academic and activist material. In the abortion debate, feminists gained access to, and impacted upon the policy debates about decriminalization, though the partnership between the SPM and the movements did not result in a change of policy. In the case of VAW however, the SPM facilitated the creation of Brazil's first law regulating V A W. I conclude that although the SPM was less able to enable feminist impact in the abortion debate than in V A W, I nevertheless argue that the SPM secured a high level of feminist impact on policy debates in both cases...|$|R
