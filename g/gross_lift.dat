It is suitable for upgrading low-temperature level industrial waste-heat to a higher temperature level for reuse. In this paper, the thermodynamic performance of the double-effect absorption heat-transformer (DEAHT) using TFE/E 181 as the working fluid is simulated, based on the thermodynamic properties of TFE/E 181 solution. The results show that, when {{the temperature in the}} high-pressure generator exceeds 100 Â°C and the <b>gross</b> temperature <b>lift</b> is 30 Â°C, the coefficient of performance (COP) of the DEAHT is about 0. 58, which is larger than the 0. 48 of the single-stage absorption heat-transformer (SAHT), the increase of COP is about 20 %. But it is still less than 0. 64 of the DEAHT using LiBr-H 2 O as the working fluid. Meanwhile, the COP of the DEAHT decreases more rapidly with increases of the absorption temperature than that for the SAHT. The range of available gross temperature-lift for the DEAHT is narrower than that of the SAHT. The higher the temperature in the high-pressure generator, the larger the gross temperature-lift could be.

There is a consensus in the test community that compressed EU and derived parameter data presented in realtime can significantly reduce total test costs because test engineers can make realtime judgements on the validity of a given test point (mode). Classical telemetry preprocessors usually cannot handle these more demanding realtime processing requirements because, when they were designed, it was assumed that raw data was in a single PCM word and only a simple mx+b EU conversion, or simple data compression was required. Present preprocessors typically use special bit slice technology to speed up the realtime process and they’re only one or two bus systems whose processing capacity is typically less than 300 k to 400 k parameters per second. Furthermore, many cannot handle word concatenation (except for adjacent PCM words) and none can handle complex derived parameters such as thrust, <b>lift,</b> <b>gross</b> weight, center of gravity, stall speed, harmonic analysis, etc. To address these limitations, a massively parallel computer system has been developed based on up to sixty, general purpose, 1 MFLOP floating point computers operating in parallel to support realtime processing of any type, at aggregate throughputs up to 1. 5 Mwps.

We used this analysis to identify the least effective promotions and conducted a controlled field test to demonstrate the impact of eliminating them before chainwide implementation. Our key findings are as follows. First, approximately 45 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>lift</b> from promotions is incremental for CVS. Further, for every unit of <b>gross</b> <b>lift,</b> 0. 16 unit of some other product is purchased elsewhere in the store. Still, more than 50 % of promotions are not profitable because the lower promotional margin is not sufficiently offset by incremental units. Second, there is substantial variation in net profit impact across categories. Our field test shows that eliminating promotions chainwide in 15 of the worst performing categories will decrease sales by about $ 7. 8 million but will improve profit by approximately $ 52. 6 million.

40|$|A {{composite}} skid {{landing gear}} design investigation has been conducted. Limit Drop Test as per Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 27. 725 and Crash test as per MIL STD 1290 A (AV) were simulated using ABAQUS to evaluate performance of multiple composite fiber-matrix systems. Load factor developed during multiple landing scenarios and energy dissipated during crash were computed. Strength and stiffness based constraints were imposed. Tsai-Wu and LaRC 04 physics based failure criteria {{were used for}} limit loads. Hashin s damage initiation criteria with Davila-Camanho s energy based damage evolution law were used for crash. Initial results indicate that an all single-composite skid landing gear may not be feasible due to strength concerns in the cross member bends. Hybridization of multiple composites with elasto-plastic aluminum 7075 showed proof of strength under limit loads. Laminate tailoring for load factor optimization under limit loads was done by parameterization of a single variable fiber orientation angle for multiple laminate families. Tsai-Wu failure criterion was used to impose strength constraints. A quasi-isotropic N = 4 (pi/ 4) 48 ply IM 7 / 8552 laminate was shown to be the optimal solution with a load factor under level landing condition equaling 4. 17 g s. LaRC 04 predicts that failures will be initiated as matrix cracking under compression and fiber kinking under in-plane shear and longitudinal compression. All failures under limit loads being reported in the metal-composite hybrid joint, the joint was simulated by adhesive bonding and filament winding, separately. Simply adhesive bonding the metal and composite regions does not meet strength requirements. Filament wound bolted metal-composite joint shows proof of strength. Filament wound composite bolted to metal cross member radii is the final joining methodology. Finally, crash analysis was conducted as per requirements from MIL STD 1290 A (AV). Crash at 42 ft/sec with 1 design <b>gross</b> weight (DGW) <b>lift</b> was simulated using ABAQUS. Plastic and friction energy dissipation in the reference aluminum skid landing gear were compared with plastic, friction and damage energy dissipation in the hybrid metal-composite design. Damage in composites was modeled as progressive damage with Hashin s damage initiation criteria and Davila-Camanho s energy based damage evolution law. The latter meets requirements of aircraft kinetic energy dissipation up to 20 ft/sec (67. 6 kJ) as per MIL STD 1290 A (AV). Weight saving possibility of up to 49 % over conventional metal skid landing gear is reported. The final design recommended includes Ke 49 /PEEK skids, 48 ply IM 7 / 8552 cross member tapered beams and, Al 7075 cross member bend radii bolted to the filament wound composite tapered beam.

40|$|Hybrid {{propulsion}} {{has been}} investigated as an enhancing technology for a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) concept as part of potential Mars Sample Return (MSR) because of its high specific impulse, restartability, {{and the ability to}} operate and survive at extremely low temperatures. A new wax-based hybrid fuel formulation has been developed that could withstand the harsh and variable Mars environment protected solely by a minimal layer of passive insulation. This formulation could provide substantial energy savings for a notional lander and is critical for rover mobility. Preliminary thermal cycle testing has determined that the formulation can survive the expected temperature extremes and lifetime thermal testing is currently underway. A complete preliminary design using this new fuel formulation combined with a low temperature oxidizer such as Mixed Oxides of Nitrogen (MON 30) is presented.

Both methods are applied to the multidisciplinary design of an aerospike nozzle which consists of a computational fluid dynamics model and a finite-element model. Error analysis of the response surface and kriging models is performed along with a graphical comparison of the approximations, and four optimization problems are formulated and solved using both sets of approximation models.

In Nordic countries stumps are generally uprooted with crawler excavators, which have strong cranes (ca. 400 kNm <b>gross</b> <b>lift</b> torque), but are not designed for moving in forest terrain. Their use is based on practical experience with available and tested machine types rather than thorough examinations of requirements, partly due to limited knowledge of force requirements for uprooting of stumps. Therefore, in this work mean and maximum forces required to vertically uproot stumps of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and birch (Betula spp.) were quantified together {{with the effects of}} various soil types and uprooting methods. The used excavator’s crane-mounted uprooting device enabled comparisons between usage of solely crane force, and a method in which preparatory loosening forces were applied prior to crane force. Uprooting stumps in single pieces proved difficult; 61 % split unintentionally. Force requirements were similar across tree species, increasing curve-linearly with stump diameter, and stumps uprooted in a single piece required more force than split stumps. Preparatory loosening reduced crane force requirements and, surprisingly, less force was required to uproot stumps from a mesic, till soil than from a moist, finer-textured soil. No stump required more than 60 kN crane force and functions for maximum force requirements indicate that powerful harvesters and forwarders (gross crane lifting capacity of 273 and 155 kNm, respectively) should be able to uproot all stumps with ≤ 61 cm and ≤ 32 cm diameter, respectively, in one piece.
