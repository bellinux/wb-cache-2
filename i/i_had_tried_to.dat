25|$|The {{success of}} William's {{invasion}} of England rapidly {{led to the}} coalition he had long desired. On 12 May 1689 the Dutch and the Holy Roman Emperor had signed an offensive compact in Vienna, the aims of which were no less than to force France back to her borders as {{they were at the}} end of the Franco-Spanish War (1659), thus depriving Louis XIV of all his gains since his assumption of power. This meant for the Emperor and the German princes the reconquest of Lorraine, Strasbourg, parts of Alsace, and some Rhineland fortresses. Leopold <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> disentangle himself from the Turkish war to concentrate on the coming struggle, but the French invasion of the Rhineland had encouraged the Turks to stiffen their terms for peace and make demands the Emperor could not conceivably accept. Leopold I's decision to side with the coalition (against the opposition of many of his advisers) was, therefore, a decision to intervene in the west while continuing to fight the Ottomans in the Balkans. Although the Emperor's immediate concerns were for the Rhineland, the most important parts of the treaty were the secret articles pledging England and the States-General to assist him in securing the Spanish succession should Charles II die without an heir, and to use their influence to secure his son's election to succeed him as Emperor.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} {{influence of the}} Commons originally lay in their right to grant taxes. The financial demands of the Hundred Years' War were enormous, and the king and his ministers tried different methods of covering the expenses. The king had a steady income from crown lands, and could also take up substantial loans from Italian and domestic financiers. To finance warfare on Edward III's scale, the king {{had to resort to}} taxation of his subjects. Taxation took two primary forms: levy and customs. The levy was a grant of a proportion of all moveable property, normally a tenth for towns and a fifteenth for farmland. This could produce large sums of money, but each such levy had to be approved by parliament, and the king had to prove the necessity. The customs therefore provided a welcome supplement, as a steady and reliable source of income. An [...] "ancient duty" [...] on the export of wool had existed since 1275. Edward <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> introduce an additional duty on wool, but this unpopular maltolt, or [...] "unjust exaction", was soon abandoned. Then, from 1336 onwards, a series of schemes aimed at increasing royal revenues from wool export were introduced. After some initial problems and discontent, it was agreed through the Ordinance of the Staple of 1353 that the new customs should be approved by parliament, though in reality they became permanent.|$|E
500|$|The band {{contributed to}} Bosnian relief efforts to enhance {{humanitarian}} and {{public awareness of}} the issue, and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It was some kind of a defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was the feeling. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way." [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym [...] "Passengers".|$|E

2500|$|In 1905, Standing Bear {{decided to}} leave. He {{was no longer}} willing to endure {{existence}} {{under the control of}} an overseer. Luther sold his land allotment and bought a house in Sioux City, Iowa, where he worked as a clerk in a wholesale firm. After a brief job doing rodeo performances with Miller Brothers 101 Ranch in Oklahoma, he moved to California to seek full-time employment in the motion picture industry. In later years, Luther reflected upon his decision to leave the reservation: “Sixteen years ago I left reservation life and my native people, the Oglala Sioux, because I was no longer willing to endure existence under the control of an overseer. For about the same number of years <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> live a peaceful and happy life; tried to adapt myself and make re-adjustments to fit the white man’s mode of existence. [...] But I was unsuccessful. I developed into a chronic disturber. [...] I was a bad Indian, and the agent and I never got along. I remained a hostile, even a savage, if you please. And I still am. I am incurable.” [...] While Standing Bear left the confinement of the reservation, he continued his serious responsibilities and as an Oglala Lakota chief, fighting to preserve Lakota heritage and sovereignty through public education.|$|E
