5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives {{returned}} to {{power at the}} 1924 General Election. In January 1925 Eden, disappointed {{not to have been}} offered a position, went {{on a tour of the}} Middle East, meeting Emir Feisal of Iraq. Feisal reminded him of the “Czar of Russia & (<b>I)</b> <b>suspect</b> that his fate may be similar” (a similar fate did indeed befall the Iraqi Royal Family in 1958). He inspected the oil refinery at Abadan, which he likened to “a Swansea on a small scale”.|$|E
25|$|My {{favorite}} {{king was}} King Melchior, {{because he was}} the oldest and had a long white beard. My brother's favorite was King Kaspar. He insisted that this king was a little crazy and quite deaf. I don't know why he was so positive about his being deaf. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> it was because dear King Kaspar never brought him all the gifts he requested. He was also rather puzzled by the fact that King Kaspar carried the myrrh, which appeared to him as a rather eccentric gift, for he never quite understood what the word meant.|$|E

6000|$|... "No;--by heavens! Poor dear. If <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> her, {{there would}} be an end of all things with me. I could never get over that. No; <b>I</b> don't <b>suspect</b> her!" [...] Sir Marmaduke had now dropped his {{affected}} tone, and was speaking with natural energy.|$|R
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that I {{know more}} of the English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
500|$|Martin {{offered the}} {{following}} hint {{as to how}} the series would conclude during a Q at the Guadalajara International Book Fair. [...] "I'm {{not going to tell you}} how I'm going to end my book, but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> the overall flavor is going to be as much bittersweet as it is happy." ...|$|E

500|$|Former ATypI {{president}} John Berry commented of Gill Sans' modernised spacing that [...] "both {{the regular}} weight {{and especially the}} light weight look much better when they're tracked loose". In contrast, Walter Tracy wrote that he preferred the later spacing: [...] "the metal version... was spaced, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> {{as if it were}} a serif face".|$|E
500|$|Conservative MP {{and animal}} lover Alan Clark was {{suspicious}} {{about the way}} Humphrey's retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive: [...] "Humphrey is now a missing person. Unless I hear from him or he makes a public appearance, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> he has been shot." [...] This led to rumours that Humphrey had been put down on the orders of Mrs Blair.|$|E
500|$|... "Apprentices {{were not}} {{supposed}} to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present," [...] wrote make-up artist Dick Smith, who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. [...] "During his years at RKO <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> these rules were probably overlooked often." [...] By 1940 Seiderman's uncredited film work included Winterset, Gunga Din, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Swiss Family Robinson and Abe Lincoln in Illinois. [...] "Seiderman had gained {{a reputation as one of}} the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood," [...] wrote biographer Frank Brady.|$|E

500|$|Donald Zec in the Daily Mirror {{was equally}} damning of Lazenby's acting abilities, {{comparing}} him unfavourably to Connery: [...] "He looks uncomfortably {{in the part}} like a size four foot in a size ten gumboot." [...] Zec was kinder to Lazenby's co-star, saying that [...] "there is style to Diana Rigg's performance and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that the last scene which draws something of a performance out of Lazenby owes much to her silken expertise." [...] The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement." ...|$|E
500|$|The Prime Minister's absolutist views proved {{extremely}} unpopular, {{even within}} his own party. Less than two weeks after Wellington made these remarks, on 15 November 1830 {{he was forced to}} resign after he was defeated in a motion of no confidence. Sydney Smith wrote, [...] "Never was any administration so completely and so suddenly destroyed; and, I believe, entirely by the Duke's declaration, made, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> in perfect ignorance of the state of public feeling and opinion." [...] Wellington was replaced by the Whig reformer Charles Grey, who had by this time the title of Earl Grey.|$|E
500|$|Lawson {{spent some}} of her {{childhood}} in the Welsh village of Higher Kinnerton. She had to move schools nine times {{between the ages of}} 9 and 18, and consequently she described her school years as difficult. [...] "I was just difficult, disruptive, good at school work, but rude, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> and too highly-strung", Lawson reflected. She was educated at several independent schools, at among other places, Ibstock Place School, Queen's Gate School and Godolphin and Latymer School. She worked for many department stores in London, and went on to graduate from the University of Oxford with a degree in medieval and modern languages. She lived in Florence, Italy, for a time.|$|E

500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Laurent should have {{received}} the nomination at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards saying, [...] "In drawing attention to one performer, in particular, whom they {{left out of the}} Best Supporting Actress category, [...] I flat-out adore this performance and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that many others do too," [...] and further lauding Laurent's performance added, [...] " [...] is radiant and, in a unique Tarantino way, heartbreaking. Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor. Putting out fire – and setting it. It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement, a sign that Laurent, as Shosanna, has found her destiny." ...|$|E
500|$|Passing sentence, Rafferty said: [...] "You robbed three {{innocent}} {{ladies of}} their lives. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that their families will suffer the more as they simply don't {{understand why you}} did. The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness with which you dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E
500|$|The Tet Offensive was {{launched}} prematurely {{in some areas}} on 30 January. On the following night, a massive wave of NVA/NLF attacks swept throughout South Vietnam, everywhere except Khe Sanh. The launching of the largest enemy offensive thus far in the conflict did not shift Westmoreland's focus away from Khe Sanh. A press release prepared {{on the following day}} (but never issued), at the height of Tet, showed that he was not about to be distracted. [...] "The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue... <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> he is also trying to draw everyone's attention away from the greatest area of threat, the northern part of I Corps. Let me caution everyone not to be confused." ...|$|E

500|$|UVA's student {{newspaper}} The Cavalier Daily described mixed reactions {{from the student}} body, stating: [...] "For some, the piece is an unfounded attack on our school; for others, it is a recognition of a harsh reality; and for what <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> is {{a large majority of}} us, it falls somewhere in between." [...] Cavalier columnist Dani Bernstein rejected Erdely's portrayal of UVA's student body as sharing equal blame with the administration. Bernstein also said that regardless of its veracity, the Rolling Stone article underscored preexisting and recurrent complaints about the school's inadequate handling of sexual assault and their [...] "deference to Greek life". She argued that [...] "the school has been unbelievably slow to investigate Phi Kappa Psi despite many allegations of sexual assault".|$|E
500|$|Lloyd Grove, gossip {{columnist}} for the New York Daily News, said that Colbert [...] "bombed badly", and BET founder Bob Johnson remarked, [...] "It was an insider crowd, as insider a crowd as you'll ever have, and [...] didn't do the insider jokes". Congressional Quarterly columnist and CBS commentator Craig Crawford found Colbert's performance hilarious, but observed that most other people at the dinner did not find the speech amusing. Time magazine TV critic James Poniewozik thought that Colbert's critics missed the point: [...] "Colbert wasn't playing to the room, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> but to the wide audience {{of people who would}} later watch on the Internet. If anything, he was playing against the room." [...] Poniewozik called the pained, uncomfortable reactions to Colbert's jokes [...] "the money shots. They were the whole point." ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{there came}} another minute of respite. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> {{they had gone}} to get bigger stones, and I dreaded the giving way of the whole door.|$|R
