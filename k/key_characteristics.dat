5|$|S. freyi {{remained}} {{as the sole}} member of Sphecomyrma until a fossil closely resembling the species was collected in Canadian amber deposits in 1985. Wilson provided the first description of the fossil, naming it S. canadensis. He notes that the close resemblance of the fossils to S. freyi in <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> strongly support its inclusion in Sphecomyrminae. He further notes that the specimens are the first ants recorded in Canadian amber, but a vast diversity of insects {{have been found in}} the amber prior to the discovery, stretching {{as far back as the}} 19th century. The discovery of the specimens from Canada indicates that the subfamily was widespread through much of the northern hemisphere during the late Cretaceous. In 2005, new fossils of an undescribed Sphecomyrma ant and S. freyi were collected in the White Oaks outcrop in Sayreville, New Jersey. The specimens were later donated to the American Museum of Natural History and studied by palaeoentomologists Michael Engel and David Grimaldi, who both provided the first description of the undescribed ant in an American Museum Novitates journal article, naming it Sphecomyrma mesaki. The age of these fossils are estimated at 79 to 92 million years.|$|E
25|$|Clerid beetles {{fall under}} the {{suborder}} Polyphaga. <b>Key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Polyphaga are that the hind coxa (base of the leg), do not divide {{the first and second}} abdominal/ventral plates which are known as sternites. Also, the notopleural suture (found under the pronotal shield) is not present. To further identify Clerid beetles, a few additional characteristics need to be examined.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{of using}} blow flies in {{developing}} a post mortem interval estimate is the succession of insects that colonize the body.

25|$|Three <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{of fiber}} optic waveguides can be {{affected}} by environmental conditions: strength, attenuation and resistance to losses caused by microbending. External optical fiber cable jackets and buffer tubes protect glass optical fiber from environmental conditions that can affect the fiber’s performance and long-term durability. On the inside, coatings ensure {{the reliability of the}} signal being carried and help minimize attenuation due to microbending.|$|E
25|$|Wings of this fly are {{specialized}} {{having a}} sharp bend {{halfway through the}} wing and they are also known to have a well-developed calypter. Blow flies are {{about the size of}} a house fly or a little larger, many are metallic blue or green. <b>Key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of this species include black gena, mostly white calypteres and anterior thoracic spiracles that appear to be orange yellow due to being surrounded by bright orange setae.|$|E

The <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Marxism in philosophy are its materialism and its commitment to political practice as the end goal of all thought.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Figaro, the ventral {{crest of}} denticles on the caudal fin, is {{also present in}} several species of the genus Parmaturus, {{as well as the}} Springer's sawtail {{catshark}} (G. springeri) and the mouse catshark (G. murinus). Figaro also closely resembles the genus Asymbolus in several morphological characters, including the fusion of the pelvic fin inner margins in adult males. More research is required to elucidate the relationships between Figaro, Galeus, Asymbolus, and Parmaturus.|$|E

25|$|However, a {{study of}} <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the taxon and a {{cladistic}} study of the subfamily Apocynoideae and the family Asclepiadaceae (before its merging with the Apocynaceae), demonstrates that this closed association is not warranted. True, both are succulent plants and pachycaul. According to Leeuwenberg however, Adenium is maintained in the subtribe Neriinae, placed underneath the tribe Wrightieae whereas Pachypodium is placed beside them in the subtribe Pachypodiinae, within the tribe Echiteae. Though related, these taxa means that the two are not intimately related.|$|E
25|$|All ULDs are {{identified}} by their ULD number. A three-letter prefix identifies its type, {{followed by a}} 4 or 5 digit serial number (4 if prior to October 1, 1993; either 4 or 5 if after October 1, 1993) to uniquely identify it from others of the same type, and ending with a two character (alpha-numerical) suffix identifying the ULD's owner (if an airline, often the same as IATA designator codes). For example, AKN 12345 DL means that the ULD is a forkliftable LD3 with the unique number 12345 and its owner is Delta Air Lines. IATA uses three letter codes (in upper case letters) to describe <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of ULDs.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness or {{are not able to}} distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called alexithymia). Further, people with anorexia experience abnormally intense cardiorespiratory sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the illness.|$|E

25|$|This left John Parkin, {{the local}} {{architect}} {{who would have}} worked with the American Bunshaft, to design Toronto-Dominion Centre. His firm put forward a model showing a 100-storey, all-concrete tower—to be {{the largest in the}} Commonwealth—standing over a plaza with a sunken courtyard containing a circular banking pavilion. It was at this point that Phyllis Lambert insisted that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (whom she knew from having been the director of planning on his Seagram Building) be called for an interview. Mies was unimpressed by Parkin's concept and wondered why one would design a building to be entered through its basement. With this, the Parkin proposal was scrapped and Allen Lambert was convinced to bring Mies on board. Though he was technically commissioned as the design consultant to the local architects (who were still John B. Parkin and Associates, but partnered with Bregman + Hamann Architects), the project was essentially Mies' design in its entirety, demonstrating all the <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the architect's unique style.|$|E

500|$|The {{origins of}} viruses in the {{evolutionary}} history {{of life are}} unclear: some may have evolved from plasmids—pieces of DNA that can move between cells—while others may have evolved from bacteria. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity. Viruses are considered {{by some to be}} a life form, because they carry genetic material, reproduce, and evolve through natural selection; however, they lack <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> (such as cell structure) that are generally considered necessary to count as life. Because they possess some but not all such qualities, viruses have been described as [...] "organisms at the edge of life", and as replicators.|$|E

The episode marked the first appearance of Satan, who would become a recurring South Park character, as well as the character of Damien himself, who was inspired by the antagonist of the 1976 horror film The Omen. Parker and Stone also said the episode introduced several <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the Cartman character that have endured {{throughout the rest of the}} series.

500|$|Josquin wrote both {{sacred and}} secular music, {{and in all}} of the {{significant}} vocal forms of the age, including masses, motets, chansons and frottole. During the 16th century, he was praised for both his supreme melodic gift and his use of ingenious technical devices. In modern times, scholars have attempted to ascertain the basic details of his biography, and have tried to define the <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> of his style to correct misattributions, a task that has proved difficult, as Josquin liked to solve compositional problems in different ways in successive compositions—sometimes he wrote in an austere style devoid of ornamentation, and at other times he wrote music requiring considerable virtuosity. Heinrich Glarean wrote in 1547 that Josquin was not only a [...] "magnificent virtuoso" [...] (the Latin can be translated also as [...] "show-off") but capable of being a [...] "mocker", using satire effectively. While the focus of scholarship {{in recent years has been}} to remove music from the [...] "Josquin canon" [...] (including some of his most famous pieces) and to reattribute it to his contemporaries, the remaining music represents some of the most famous and enduring of the Renaissance.|$|E
500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's <b>key</b> <b>characteristics</b> is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way. Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
