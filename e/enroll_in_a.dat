5|$|Following graduation, Brown {{sought to}} <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> college {{outside of the}} South. His principal, Nathaniel Burger, advised he attend an all-black college, as his brother Marvin Brown had done, however, he ended up enrolling at Ohio State University as his {{childhood}} role model, Jesse Owens, had done. Burger told Brown only seven African Americans had graduated from the school that year, but Brown nonetheless was determined to enroll, feeling he would compete well with white students.|$|E
5|$|Rubin was {{inspired}} to pursue an undergraduate education at the currently all-women's school, Vassar College, because Maria Mitchell had been a professor there. She also ignored advice she had received from a high school science teacher to avoid a scientific career and become an artist. She earned her bachelor's degree in astronomy in 1948, the only graduate in astronomy that year. She attempted to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> graduate program at Princeton, but was barred due to her gender. Princeton would not accept women as astronomy graduate students for 27 more years. Rubin also turned down an offer from Harvard University due to her husband, Robert Rubin's, position {{as a graduate student}} at Cornell University.|$|E

The second award, received in 2007, was for the development of a PhD Prep Track to prepare MAcc students to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> PhD program after graduation. For 2013, the bachelor's degree in the School of Accountancy received two #3 rankings, one by Public Accounting Report and the other by U.S. News & World Report. The same two reporting agencies also ranked the school's MAcc program #2 and #7 in the nation, respectively.|$|E

After a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, {{and the next year}} with her father in Warsaw, where she did some tutoring. Unable to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister Bronis≈Çawa became involved with the clandestine Flying University (sometimes translated as Floating University), a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.|$|E
5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when she indicated that she was not interested in him.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} secure a {{position}} as a teacher, erudite in the capital, or government official, a student could choose one of several paths to become well educated. Perhaps the most prestigious path was enrollment in the Imperial University. Students had to be above the age of eighteen to enroll, and were selected by the Minister of Ceremonies from those recommended by local authorities. Other students could choose to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> school sponsored by the local commandery government. A professional teacher who opened a private school {{in a small town}} or village could sometimes gather a following of several hundred to over a thousand students. Students were expected to pay tuition, thus a teacher enjoyed a significant salary. His standing in the local community was usually paramount, and was even sought as an arbiter in disputes. Although the size of the Imperial Academy was greatly expanded in Eastern Han, private schools grew in importance as the imperial government lost authority and its academy's persecution of Old Text tradition drove many to pursue Old Text studies in private institutions.|$|E

5|$|Graduating from Richardson High in 1959, Rice {{completed}} {{her freshman year}} at Texas Woman's University in Denton and transferred to North Texas State College for her sophomore year, but dropped out when {{she ran out of}} money and was unable to find employment. She soon decided to move to San Francisco, and received permission from her friend, Dennis Percy, to stay with his family there until she found work as an insurance claims processor. She persuaded her former roommate from Texas Woman's University, Ginny Mathis, to join her, and they found an apartment in the Haight-Ashbury district. Mathis acquired a job at the same insurance company as Rice. Soon after, they began taking night courses at University of San Francisco, an all-male Jesuit school that allowed women to take night courses. For Easter vacation Anne returned home to Texas, rekindling her relationship with Stan Rice. After her return to San Francisco, Stan Rice came for a week-long visit during summer break. He returned to Texas, Rice moved back in with the Percys, and Mathis left San Francisco in August to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nursing program in Oklahoma. Some time later, Anne received a special delivery letter from Stan Rice asking her to marry him. They married on October 14, 1961, in Denton, Texas, soon after she turned twenty years old, and when he was just weeks from his nineteenth birthday.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract {{is not without}} its problems; the 1999 contract called for the Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, it was discovered that Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to <b>enroll</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E
