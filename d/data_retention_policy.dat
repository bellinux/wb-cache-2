Data loss can be a common experience of computer users; a 2008 survey found that 66% of respondents had lost files on their home PC.

40|$|The {{problem of}} records {{retention}} is {{often viewed as}} simply deleting records when they have outlived their purpose. However, {{in the world of}} relational databases there is no standardized notion of a business record and its retention obligations. Unlike physical documents such as forms and reports, information in databases is organized such that one item of data may be part of various legal records and consequently subject to several (and possibly conflicting) <b>retention</b> <b>policies.</b> This thesis proposes a framework for records retention in relational database systems. It presents a mechanism through which users can specify a broad range of protective and destructive <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> <b>policies</b> for relational records. Compared to naïve solutions for enforcing records management policies, our framework is not only significantly more efficient but it also addresses several unanswered questions about how policies can be mapped from given legal requirements to actions on relational data. The novelty in our approach is that we defined a record in a relational database as an arbitrary logical view, effectively allowing us to reduce several challenges in enforcing <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> <b>policies</b> to well-studied problems in database theory. We argue that our expression based approach of tracking records management obligations is not only easier for records managers to use but also far more space/time efficient compared to traditional metadata approaches discussed in the literature. The thesis concludes with a thorough examination of the limitations of the proposed framework and suggestion for future {{research in the area of}} records management for relational database management systems...|$|R

The review of these discourses demonstrates that, in understanding policies involving a significant technological component such as communications <b>data</b> <b>retention,</b> <b>policy</b> alternatives may be evaluated only with an appreciation of technological characteristics alongside the traditional concerns of legislators, civil society and the business community. While academia has developed many forms of analysis for political, international, and regulatory discourses, the same must be undertaken for technological discourse, i. e. the interactions between the policies in question, the actors, and the technologies. Developing forms of analysis for technological discourses will likely lead to further understanding of both the policy problem and the actors' interests. The paper also shows how current institutions are slowly developing the necessary skills to incorporate the technological aspects of policy into political debate, and calls for a similar development for the law.

40|$|Professional Doctorate - Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) This paper {{focused on}} website design factors {{with respect to}} online {{websites}} access by consumers resulting in collecting personal information. In today’s information age, focusing on personal data privacy protection issues will undoubtedly be a priority in promoting electronic commerce in Asia Pacific. Hong Kong is a pioneer in legislating comprehensive data privacy protection law amongst the common-law regimes. Hong Kong enacted the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance way back in 1995. In the Asia Pacific region, Australia and Hong Kong are two jurisdictions supporting the nine principles of the APEC Electronic Commerce Steering Group framework by passing comprehensive data privacy protection laws. Singapore is lagging behind and only promulgates a Model Data Protection Codes (MDPC) without any legislative support. When comparing the underlying principles of the MDPC with those stipulated in the data privacy regulatory framework of Hong Kong Australia, they are similar. This study examined websites’ data privacy design factors {{and the extent of}} the privacy policy information found in the websites. The first observatory survey visited a random sample of 307 websites with roughly equal number in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The survey used a questionnaire to guide the collection of design factors related to the manner of personal data collection, the format and location of the privacy policy statement, and the types of information provided in such statement. The second survey was an email survey. Eighty seven website operators gave valid responses to a questionnaire collecting their views on personal data privacy related website design issues. Data analysis for both surveys involved counting frequencies, calculating percentages, and using Chi-square tests. This study proposed the hypotheses that were used to examine the extent of personal data privacy intrusion and the level of the privacy policy information disclosure of the websites. The proposed hypotheses assumed that these privacy related website design factors were largely influenced by the regulatory framework implemented by the government. Results of the first survey revealed that most websites collected personal data on a non-voluntary way, and there was no significant country difference. However, most websites in Australia and Hong Kong provided some form of the privacy policy statement. Singapore is the only country using a legislative threat approach instead of actual legislation to regulate personal data privacy. The results revealed that 61. 8 % of Singaporean websites did not provide any form of the privacy policy information. The country difference in the format and location of the privacy policy statement found in websites was significant. The results revealed that more websites in Australia and Hong Kong provided information about the purpose of collection, use of personal data, right to ensure accuracy of data stored, and data transmission security than those in Singapore. The country difference did not show up on the other types of information including the use of cookies, right to refuse promotional materials, divulge of personal data, and <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> <b>policy.</b> Results of the second survey were not conclusive. Hence, the website operators email survey results did not support the hypothesis that legislative and non-legislative approach would have different effects on influencing the views of the website operators...|$|E

40|$|A {{few days}} ago, Anonymous activists hacked into AAPT, stole 40 GB of data {{including}} customer information and forced offline ten Australian government websites, write Mark Gregory in The Conversation.   Anonymous members stated {{in an online}} internet relay chat (IRQ) interview with the ABC that the hacking attacks {{were part of an}} ongoing campaign against the government’s proposed changes to privacy laws. Privacy changes One of the proposed changes being discussed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) in an inquiry into potential reforms of national security legislation is a requirement for internet service providers (ISPs) to store user online activity for two years. This means that everything you do, from social networking, emails, web browsing, chat sessions, Skype sessions and so on would be monitored, stored and made available to government intelligence agencies as and when needed. Last week, it was reported on the website Slashdot that Microsoft had made Skype easier to monitor. Lauren Weinstein, co-founder of People for Internet Responsibility, a privacy advocacy group, was quoted in The Washington Post as saying: The issue is, to what extent are our communications being purpose-built to make surveillance easy? When you make it easy to do, law enforcement {{is going to want to}} use it more and more. If you build it, they will come. During the ABC IRQ interview, Anonymous representatives made the following statement against increased government surveillance of the online world: Whilst our own rights to privacy dwindle, corporate rights to commercial confidentiality and intellectual property skyrocket. Whilst we no longer know about many of the activities of our governments, our governments have the means to accumulate unprecedented vast banks of data about us […] The attacks are a way to draw attention to the msg we wish to deliver to the ppl of au. The hacking attacks by Anonymous on government websites and AAPT were designed to highlight to the Australian public the difficulty of keeping stored data private. By carrying out hacking attacks and then making public pronouncements Anonymous hopes to convince Australians not to support changes to the current privacy laws. <b>Data</b> <b>retention</b> <b>policies</b> vary around the world. The European Union has had a <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> directive since 2006 that specifies types of data that are to be retained for periods of between six months and two years. In recent weeks, the United Kingdom government has begun debating a draft Communications Data Bill that includes compulsory <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> for a wide range of information, such as websites visited, for a period of one year. Spy games So why are governments around the world increasing internet surveillance? Four reasons spring to mind: 1) Terrorism. The threat of terrorists using the internet to plan, support and carry out terrorist acts has prompted the Attorney-General’s Department to discuss the need to increase the powers of organisations such as the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD). 2) Cyber warfare. On July 19, in the first public address by a head of ASIS, Nick Warner, identified cyber warfare as a major threat: The field of cyber operations is one of the most rapidly evolving and potentially serious threats to our national security in the coming decade. Government departments and agencies, together with corporate Australia, have been subject to concerted efforts by external actors seeking to infiltrate sensitive computer networks. Developments in cyber are a two-edged sword for an agency like ASIS. They offer new ways of collecting information, but the digital fingerprints and footprints which we all now leave behind complicate the task of operating covertly. 3) Cybercrime. Criminals use the internet for their everyday activities much as any modern business does. In 2011 Symantec, a provider of internet security software, estimated the cost of cybercrime to Australians had reached about A$ 4. 6 billion annually. 4) Hacking. Copyright and intellectual property theft over the internet has become endemic. Much of the hacking remains unreported and business has become decidedly worried about the effects of competitors gaining access to intellectual property. Control Governments around the world are slowly regulating the internet. Failure to do so will come at an unbearable cost to the nation, business and to individuals. There is nothing Anonymous can do to stop this inevitable process – so why can’t they get on board? The group could highlight weaknesses in the internet, websites and business systems so that appropriate action can be taken. To put it simply, there’s no need for Anonymous to steal data from a company and then post this data on a public website. This action is counterproductive and strengthens the government’s argument for greater regulation. But the point Anonymous is trying to make, that Australian companies and the government cannot be trusted to securely implement a <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> scheme, is probably very true. In the past two years, many large Australian companies have been hacked and customer information stolen including credit card details. The penalties to companies for a data breach are minor and therefore very little effort is expended by business to adequately protect customer information. Governments around the world are stumbling forward with <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> <b>policies</b> without adequate plans for how the data is to be secured, how the <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> process is to be audited and by whom, and what the penalties will be for failure to ensure the data remains secure. We are in a new phase online where the blind are leading the blind, trying to find a path towards a more secure and regulated internet that enshrines our right to privacy.

40|$|Running title: <b>Data</b> <b>retention</b> {{and social}} {{forgetfulness}} Abstract: Modern information systems not only capture {{a seemingly endless}} amount of transactional data, but also tend to retain it for indefinite periods of time. We argue that privacy policy must address not only collection and access to transactional information, but also its timely disposal. One unintended side-effect of <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> is the disappearance of social forgetfulness. Social forgetfulness allows individuals a second chance, {{the opportunity for a}} fresh start in life. We examine three domains in which social policy has explicitly recognized the importance of such a principle: bankruptcy law, juvenile crime records, and credit reports. In each case, we frame the issue not solely in terms of individual privacy protection, but rather in terms of the social benefits of forgetfulness. We examine how different policy approaches to privacy might handle the <b>retention</b> of <b>data</b> and propose a general framework for constructing <b>retention</b> <b>policies.</b> The broad conclusion of the paper is that <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> and disposal should be addressed as a fundamental characteristic of information, not in piecemeal fashion, or as an afterthought...|$|R
