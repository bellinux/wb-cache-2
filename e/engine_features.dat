5|$|Funcom {{decided to}} instead use a recent {{version of the}} Dreamworld engine, the same version used for their 2008 MMORPG Age of Conan. This new <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> {{improved}} water rendering, particle effects, and character animation. It also includes incremental improvements to technologies already used in Anarchy Online, such as the dynamic weather system. No new release date has been announced, although periodic status updates are published in the game's official weekly development blog Friday With Means.|$|E
5|$|The Loudest <b>Engine</b> <b>features</b> a sound {{adapted to}} the genres of folk and rock, {{more so than the}} {{previous}} two Howling Bells records. Juanita explained that the band relied less on the sound technology that was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E
5|$|Thief was {{developed}} with the Dark Engine, a proprietary game engine. It was written during the game's development, {{rather than as}} a separately budgeted project, which led to time constraint issues. An emphasis was placed on simulating real life physics; arrows would arc through the air rather than fly straight. The <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> alpha blending, texture filtering and lighting techniques. Motion capture technology was integrated to allow for realistic character animation. The engine's renderer—which draws the graphics—was largely written by Looking Glass Studios programmer Sean Barrett in fall 1995. While the renderer was expected to be finished before the game's release date, Barrett left the company in 1996. He later performed contract work for the company, and assisted in writing features like hardware support. However, the renderer was never fully addressed, and was less advanced than others of the time.|$|E

25|$|The <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> a cat-back {{exhaust system}} from the Ford Performance. This {{specifically}} gives the model a throatier sound. A “Shelby-GT-H” engine plaque is also added {{as well as an}} engine cap kit. The chassis has also been updated via the Ford Racing Handling Pack which helps deliver a race-like driving experience. The package adds lowered springs, special-tuned dampers and revised sway bars.|$|E
25|$|The Mongoose is a five-cylinder, single-row, {{air-cooled}} radial piston engine. The <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> twin forward-mounted ignition magnetos and enclosed valve rockers, {{the cylinders}} being {{the same as}} those used for the earlier Jaguar engine. An unusual feature of the Mongoose is the vertical position of the lower cylinder, a design thought likely to promote oil fouling of the spark plugs.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the Storm was restyled {{to have a}} {{smoother}} front fascia without the pop-up headlight covers on earlier models. The 1992–93 base models retained the same <b>engine,</b> <b>features,</b> and price {{that were on the}} earlier car, with slight interior changes such as different stereos, revised rear speaker locations, and interior trim and upholstery. The GSi version from these years cost considerably more ($13,645–14,560) but this price included a larger 1.8L 140hp (104kW) engine.|$|E

25|$|The {{fourth-generation}} Prius {{is designed}} to deliver significantly improved fuel economy in a more compact package that is lighter in weight and lower in cost. These objectives were achieved {{through the development of}} a new generation of powertrains with significant advances in battery, electric motor and gasoline engine technologies. It features improved batteries with higher energy density; smaller electric motors, with higher power density than the previous Prius motors; and the gasoline <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> a thermal efficiency greater than 40% (that of the third-generation Prius is 38.5%). The Prius fuel economy has improved on average by about 10% each generation, and Toyota has set the challenge to continue to improve at this rate.|$|E
25|$|Some of the company's first promotional {{vehicles}} appeared {{about the}} same time as the museum pieces, and though they were not brass era, they were yet molded in plastic. One model was the Audi 100 sedan, the real car being one of the first Audis to be exported to the United States around 1969. This model was slightly larger than 1:43 scale, in a silver box with black lettering. The car was well detailed in styrene plastic, especially the front grille and also the floorpan and <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> on the plastic chassis. This model may have been one of the first promotionals offered by Cursor, and perhaps somewhat rare, because it is not mentioned in Force's (1990) book.|$|E
500|$|On 4 August 2009, Holden {{announced}} the MY10 {{revisions to the}} VE and WM range {{to be released in}} September. For the VE Omega and Berlina, the 3.6-litre Alloytec V6 has been downsized to 3.0-litres, the lowest engine displacement of a Commodore since the straight-six engine fitted to the 1986 VL series. This smaller capacity <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) technology, and is officially claimed to reduce fuel consumption by up to 12percent depending on the variant. Power increases to , although torque is reduced to [...] Along with the 3.0-litre engine, a 3.6-litre version of the same, producing [...] and , was also unveiled. Other than the manual transmission version of the SV6, all SIDI V6 models are coupled to GM's 6L50 automatic and fall under Holden's EcoLine banner. Benefits to fuel economy for the 3.6-litre SIDI can also be attributed to an improved [...] "deceleration fuel cut" [...] system, which terminates the fuel supply during engine coasting; a higher efficiency alternator and voltage regulator; a 50rpm lower idle speed (to 550rpm); and a new [...] "turbine damper" [...] for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpms, thus enabling earlier upshifts. Omega versions of the Ute and all bi-fuel versions retain the existing 3.6-litre and four-speed automatic combination, although the LPG engine has been tweaked for further efficiency gains.|$|E

500|$|Machinima creators {{have used}} {{different}} methods to handle limited character expression. The most typical ways that amateur-style machinima gets around limitations of expression include {{taking advantage of}} speech bubbles seen above players' heads when speaking, relying on the visual matching between a character's voice and appearance, and finding methods available within the game itself. Garry's Mod and Source Filmmaker include the ability to manipulate characters and objects in real-time, though the former relies on community addons {{to take advantage of}} certain <b>engine</b> <b>features,</b> and the latter renders scenes using non-real-time effects. In the Halo video game series, helmets completely cover the characters' faces. To prevent confusion, Rooster Teeth's characters move slightly when speaking, a convention shared with anime. Some machinima creators use custom software. For example, Strange Company uses Take Over GL Face Skins to add more facial expressions to their characters filmed in BioWare's 2002 role-playing video game Neverwinter Nights. Similarly, Atussa Simon used a [...] "library of faces" [...] for characters in The Battle of Xerxes. In some cases, some game companies may provide such software; examples include Epic Games' Impersonator for Unreal Tournament 2004 and Valve Corporation's Faceposer for Source games. Another solution is to blend in non-machinima elements, as nGame did by inserting painted characters with more expressive faces into its 1999 film Berlin Assassins. It may be possible to point the camera elsewhere or employ other creative cinematography or acting. For example, Tristan Pope combined creative character and camera positioning with video editing to suggest sexual actions in his controversial film Not Just Another Love Story.|$|E

First {{introduced}} at the Railway Interchange Expo 2015 at BNSF North Town Yard, Minneapolis, Minnesota, from October 4 to October 7, 2015. This new engine is first used on SD70ACe-T4, the new Tier 4 freight locomotive from EMD. This <b>engine</b> <b>features</b> a two-stage turbocharging system consisting of three turbochargers: one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM range and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM range. The results are bigger power throughout a broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission.|$|E
2500|$|Republic {{addressed}} the problems by fitting a rearwards-sliding canopy {{that could be}} jettisoned in an emergency, a pressurized ignition system, and new all-metal control surfaces. The deficient maintenance access to the Double Wasp radial on the B-series subtypes {{had to wait until}} the P-47C introduced a new engine mount. While the engineers worked frantically to get their [...] "dinosaur" [...] to fly right, the USAAF ordered 171 P-47Bs. An engineering prototype P-47B was delivered in December 1941, with a production prototype following in March 1942, and the first production model provided in May. Republic continued to improve the design as P-47Bs were produced, and although all P-47Bs had the sliding canopy and the new General Electric turbosupercharger regulator for the R-2800-21 <b>engine,</b> <b>features</b> such as all-metal control surfaces were not standard at first. A modification on the P-47B, also required for the early marks of the U.S. Navy's Grumman F4F Wildcat and Grumman F6F Hellcat was the radio mast behind the cockpit that was slanted forward to maintain the originally designed antenna wire length in spite of the new sliding canopy.|$|E
