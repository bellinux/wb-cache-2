25|$|The husband, too, is {{indirectly}} implied to {{have some}} responsibilities to his wife. The Torah obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity; if the <b>husband</b> <b>does</b> not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement {{for a man to}} provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.|$|E
25|$|Zhao nuxu is a {{practice}} where the son-in-law moves {{in with the}} wife's family. Some marriages between Han and Hui are conducted this way. The <b>husband</b> <b>does</b> not need to convert, but the wife's family follows Islamic customs. No census data documents this type of marriage, reporting only {{cases in which the}} wife moves in with the groom's family. In Henan province, a marriage was recorded between a Han boy and Hui girl without the Han converting, during the Ming Dynasty. They had two children who became Muslim. Steles in Han and Hui villages record this story and Hui and Han members of the Lineage celebrate at the ancestral temple together.|$|E

25|$|Ancient {{texts of}} Hinduism offer {{different}} views on adultery. For example, Wendy Doniger notes Rigveda verse 4.5 as declaring adultery is evil. A more nuanced view {{is expressed in}} some smritis. Richard W. Lariviere notes that verse 13.60-61 of Nāradasmṛti qualifies when adultery is not a punishable crime; for example, if a woman comes to a man's house on her own volition and has consensual sex with him {{even though she is}} not married to him, then it is not adultery. Further, sex with a married woman was not a punishable crime provided the woman initiates the sex of her own volition, and she has been abandoned by her husband or if her husband is eunuch or her <b>husband</b> <b>does</b> not care. Another text, Manusmriti, declares adultery by husband or wife to be wrong, as well as includes a discussion about sex outside marriage after both the husband and wife consent.|$|E

500|$|Mikea encampments are {{typically}} family groups. These consist of an elder couple, their married sons and daughters-in-law, the grandchildren of these marriages, and the elder couple's own unmarried children of any age. Adult daughters typically move {{to join their}} husband's family encampment upon marriage, but married couples often share their time between the husband's or wife's parents' encampments. Family unions are formed through a fandeo ceremony in which the man is presented to his intended bride's family, and the acceptance of her parents legitimizes the union. Children of the marriage are legitimized by the husband's bestowal of presents to his wife's parents. The relationship between the wife's brother (renilahy, [...] "male mother") and her children can be very strong in Mikea marriages, and the renilahy will commonly adopt children that his sister's <b>husband</b> <b>does</b> not legitimize. Both the husband and the wife {{have the right to}} divorce at any time and remarry. Polygamy is also practiced.|$|E
2500|$|Within marriage, regular sexual {{relations}} are expected and encouraged. [...] "The husband should give {{to his wife}} her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the <b>husband</b> <b>does.</b> Likewise the <b>husband</b> <b>does</b> not have authority over his own body, but the wife does." [...] As “one flesh,” {{the husband and wife}} share this right and privilege; the New Testament does not portray intimacy as something held in reserve by each spouse to be shared on condition. [...] "Stop depriving one another, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control." [...] A stated reason for maintaining marital relations is to reduce the temptation to adultery.|$|E
2500|$|In Paula A. Treichler's article [...] "Escaping the Sentence: Diagnosis and Discourse in 'The Yellow Wallpaper'", {{she places}} her {{focus on the}} {{relationship}} portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as {{something along the lines}} of [...] "[...] [...] the 'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of neurasthenia, the narrator's unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy," [...] Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the story Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the [...] "[...] [...] sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes." [...] While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse, and the woman found in the wallpaper could be the [...] "[...] [...] representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the right to speak." [...] In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported in the fact that John, the narrator's <b>husband,</b> <b>does</b> not like his wife to write anything, which is the reason her journal containing the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.|$|E
