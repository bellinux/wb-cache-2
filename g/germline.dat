5|$|<b>Germline</b> {{mutations}} in KIF11 cause Microcephaly {{with or without}} chorioretinopathy, lymphedema, or mental retardation (MCLMR). This syndrome is observed as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable expressivity but can also be sporadic. It is characterized by mild-to-severe microcephaly, often associated with developmental delay, ocular defects and lymphedema, usually on the dorsum of the feet. Phenotypic evaluation of patients (n = 87) revealed microcephaly in 91%, eye anomalies in 72%, intellectual disability in 67% and lymphedema in 47% of the patients. Unaffected carriers were rare (4 out of 87: 5%). Family history is not a requisite for diagnosis; 31% (16 out of 52) were de novo cases. All inherited cases, and 50% of sporadic cases of MCLMR are due to <b>germline</b> KIF11 mutations.|$|E
5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. In these cases, called <b>germline</b> mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from <b>germline</b> mutations in genes coding for DNA repair enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E

40|$|Alternation {{of generations}} underpins all plant life {{histories}} and is held to possess important adaptive features. A {{wide range of}} data have accumulated {{over the past century}} which suggest that alternation from sporophyte to gametophyte in angiosperms includes a significant phase of 'informational reprogramming', leaving the founder cells of the gametophyte developmentally uncommitted. This review attempts to bring together results from these historic studies with more recent data on molecular and epigenetic events which accompany alternation, gametophyte development and gametogenesis in angiosperms. It is striking that most members of the other principal group of multicellular eukaryotes [...] the animals [...] have a completely different a life history: animals generate their gametes directly from diploid <b>germlines,</b> often set aside early in development. Nevertheless, a comparison between animal <b>germlines</b> and angiosperm gametophyte development reveals a number of surprising similarities at the cytological and molecular levels. This difference in life history but similarity in developmental process is reviewed {{in the context of the}} very different life strategies adopted by plants and animals, and particularly the fact that plants do not set aside diploid <b>germlines</b> early in development...|$|R

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: <b>Germline</b> mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have {{been implicated in}} familial neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
5|$|While small interfering RNAs (siRNA; 20-25nt) {{are often}} {{produced}} by breakdown of viral RNA, {{there are also}} endogenous sources of siRNAs. siRNAs act through RNA interference in a fashion similar to miRNAs. Some miRNAs and siRNAs can cause genes they target to be methylated, thereby decreasing or increasing transcription of those genes. Animals have Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNA; 29-30nt) that are active in <b>germline</b> cells and {{are thought to be}} a defense against transposons and play a role in gametogenesis.|$|E
40|$|Abiotic stress {{conditions}} such as drought, salt and high temperature reduce yields of crop plants {{by as much as}} 70 %. Therefore, advancement of salt-tolerance in cotton requires the identification of plant genetic diversity that exists, theoretically, in cultivars, which are adapted to arid growing regions. The exotic race stock accessions should possess salt-tolerant genes since many of these Gossypium hirsutum <b>germlines</b> were collected in the arid regions of Mexico and Central America. The objective of this project was to develop a screening technique to identify the cultivars and exotic <b>germlines</b> that possessed salt-tolerant genes. Since the early stages of a plant`s life cycle are generally believed to be the most sensitive stages, we screened several conventional cultivars as controls and several exotic race stock accessions for their ability to tolerate increased salt levels during seed germination-radical elongation (growth chamber) and seedling maturation (hydroponic conditions in a greenhouse). It was concluded that this screening technique resulted in the identification of plants that survived these conditions and represent likely candidates for use in our plant-breeding program...|$|R
40|$|PIWI (P-element-induced wimpy testis) {{proteins}} are {{a subset}} of the Argonaute proteins and are expressed predominantly in the <b>germlines</b> of a variety of organisms, including Drosophila and mammals. PIWI proteins associate specifically with PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small RNAs that are also expressed predominantly in <b>germlines,</b> and silence transposable DNA elements and other genes showing complementarities to the sequences of associated piRNAs. This mechanism helps to maintain the integrity of the genome and the development of gametes. PIWI proteins have been shown recently to contain symmetrical dimethyl arginines (sDMAs), and this modification is mediated by the methyltransferase PRMT 5 (also known as Dart 5 or Capsuleen). It was then demonstrated that multiple members of the Tudor (Tud) family of proteins, which are necessary for gametogenesis in both flies and mice, associate with PIWI proteins specifically through sDMAs in various but particular combinations. Although Tud domains in Tud family members are known to be sDMA-binding modules, involvement of the Tudor family at the molecular level in the piRNA pathway has only recently come into focus...|$|R
40|$|POEMS {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} plasma cell disorder characterized by peripheral neu-ropathy, monoclonal gammopathy, {{and high levels of}} serum vascular endothelial growth factor, the pathogenesis of which remains unclear. A unique feature of this {{syndrome is}} that the proliferating mono-clonal plasma cells are essentially -restricted. Here we determined com-plete nucleotide sequences of monoclo-nal immunoglobulin light chain (IGL) variable regions in 11 patients with POEMS syndrome. The V-region of the Ig gene of all 11 patients was restricted to the V 1 subfamily. Searching for ho-mologies with IGL <b>germlines</b> revealed that 2 <b>germlines,</b> IGLV 1 - 44 * 01 (9 / 11) and IGLV 1 - 40 * 01 (2 / 10), were identified, with an average homology of 91. 1 %. The IGLJ 3 * 02 gene was used in 11 of 11 re-arrangements with an average homology of 92. 2 %.

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the <b>germline.</b> To explain how new variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between <b>germline</b> and somatic mutations {{is important in}} animals that have a dedicated <b>germline</b> to produce reproductive cells. However, it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants, which lack dedicated <b>germline.</b> The distinction is also blurred in those animals that reproduce asexually through mechanisms such as budding, because the cells {{that give rise to}} the daughter organisms also give rise to that organism's <b>germline.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March, scientists, {{including}} an inventor of CRISPR, urged a worldwide moratorium on <b>germline</b> gene therapy, writing “scientists should avoid even attempting, in lax jurisdictions, <b>germline</b> genome modification for clinical application in humans” until the full implications “are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations”.|$|E

Since then, several studies have identified various piRNAs and piwi-pathways involved in transposon silencing in various species. Two such genome defense systems against transposons are the silencing of the MuDR transposon in maize and the silencing of P elements in Drosophila.|$|R

40|$|Epigenetic marks are {{fundamental}} to normal development, but {{little is known}} about signals that dictate their placement. Insights have been provided by studies of imprinted loci in mammals, where monoallelic expression is epigenetically controlled. Imprinted expression is regulated by DNA methylation programmed during gametogenesis in a sex-specific manner and maintained after fertilization. At Rasgrf 1 in mouse, paternal-specific DNA methylation on a differential methylation domain (DMD) requires downstream tandem repeats. The DMD and repeats constitute a binary switch regulating paternal-specific expression. Here, we define sequences sufficient for imprinted methylation using two transgenic mouse lines: One carries the entire Rasgrf 1 cluster (RC); the second carries only the DMD and repeats (DR) from Rasgrf 1. The RC transgene recapitulated all aspects of imprinting seen at the endogenous locus. DR underwent proper DNA methylation establishment in sperm and erasure in oocytes, indicating the DMD and repeats are sufficient to program imprinted DNA methylation in <b>germlines.</b> Both transgenes produce a DMD-spanning pit-RNA, previously shown to be necessary for imprinted DNA methylation at the endogenous locus. We show that when pit-RNA expression is controlled by the repeats, it regulates DNA methylation in cis only and not in trans. Interestingly, pedigree history dictated whether established DR methylation patterns were maintained after fertilization. When DR was paternally transmitted followed by maternal transmission, the unmethylated state that was properly established in the female <b>germlines</b> could not b...|$|R

40|$|The recent, {{unexpected}} {{discovery of}} a functional DNA methylation system in the genome of the social bee Apis mellifera underscores the potential importance of DNA methylation in invertebrates. The extent of genomic DNA methylation {{and its role in}} A. mellifera remain unknown, however. Here we show that genes in A. mellifera can be divided into 2 distinct classes, one with low-CpG dinucleotide content and the other with high-CpG dinucleotide content. This dichotomy is explained by the gradual depletion of CpG dinucleotides, a well-known consequence of DNA methylation. The loss of CpG dinucleotides associated with DNA methylation also may explain the unusual mutational patterns seen in A. mellifera that lead to AT-rich regions of the genome. A detailed investigation of this dichotomy implicates DNA methylation in A. mellifera development. High-CpG genes, which are predicted to be hypomethylated in <b>germlines,</b> are enriched with functions associated with developmental processes, whereas low-CpG genes, predicted to be hypermethylated in <b>germlines,</b> are enriched with functions associated with basic biological processes. Furthermore, genes more highly expressed in one caste than another are overrepresented among high-CpG genes. Our results highlight the potential significance of epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, in developmental processes in social insects. In particular, the pervasiveness of DNA methylation in the genome of A. mellifera provides fertile ground for future studies of phenotypic plasticity and genomic imprinting...|$|R
40|$|Imprinted {{genes are}} an {{exceptional}} cluster of genes which {{are expressed in}} a parent-of-origin dependent fashion. This allele-specific expression is dependent on differential DNA methylation which is established in the parental <b>germlines</b> in a sex-specific manner. The DNA methylation imprint is accompanied by heterochromatin modifications which must be continuously maintained through development. This review summarises the factors which are important for protecting the epigenetic modifications at imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs), including PGC 7, ZFP 57 and the ATRX/Daxx/H 3. 3 complex. We discuss how these factors maintain heterochromatin silencing, not only at imprinted DMRs, but also other heterochromatic regions in the genome...|$|R
40|$|Prior to the meiotic divisions, dynamic {{chromosome}} reorganizations including pairing, synapsis, and recombination {{of maternal}} and paternal chromosome pairs must {{occur in a}} highly regulated fashion during meiotic prophase. How chromosomes identify each other's homology and exclusively pair and synapse with their homologous partners, while rejecting illegitimate synapsis with non-homologous chromosomes, remains obscure. In addition, how the levels of recombination initiation and crossover formation are regulated so that sufficient, but not deleterious, levels of DNA breaks are made and processed into crossovers is not understood well. We show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the highly conserved Serine/Threonine protein phosphatase PP 4 homolog, PPH- 4. 1, is required independently to carry out four separate functions involving meiotic chromosome dynamics: (1) synapsis-independent chromosome pairing, (2) restriction of synapsis to homologous chromosomes, (3) programmed DNA double-strand break initiation, and (4) crossover formation. Using quantitative imaging of mutant strains, including super-resolution (3 D-SIM) microscopy of chromosomes and the synaptonemal complex, we show that independently-arising defects {{in each of these}} processes in the absence of PPH- 4. 1 activity ultimately lead to meiotic nondisjunction and embryonic lethality. Interestingly, we find that defects in double-strand break initiation and crossover formation, but not pairing or synapsis, become even more severe in the <b>germlines</b> of older mutant animals, indicating an increased dependence on PPH- 4. 1 with increasing maternal age. Our results demonstrate that PPH- 4. 1 plays multiple, independent roles in meiotic prophase chromosome dynamics and maintaining meiotic competence in aging <b>germlines.</b> PP 4 's high degree of conservation suggests it may be a universal regulator of meiotic prophase chromosome dynamics...|$|R
