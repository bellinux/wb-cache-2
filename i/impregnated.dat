5|$|At {{the start}} of the fourth series, Nikita is shown without a mate after the death of Hannibal. Nikita is <b>impregnated</b> by Seacrest, a Whiskers roving male, in the third episode of the fourth series. In the fourth, she accepts Whiskers rover Zorro as the groups {{dominant}} male, and allows his four brothers to join the group.|$|E
5|$|Because {{ovulation}} is {{not always}} triggered by a single mating, females may not be <b>impregnated</b> by the first male with which they mate. Furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate {{with more than one}} male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study compares two {{different}} <b>impregnating</b> methods {{to investigate the}} influence of carbonization rate on the tribological properties of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} bulk density, hardness, infiltration efficiency and friction coefficient of pressure <b>impregnating</b> specimens are higher than those of vacuum <b>impregnating</b> specimens. In comparison with the vacuum <b>impregnating</b> specimens, the pressure <b>impregnating</b> specimens also show the lower apparent porosity and weight loss. Studies on the tribological properties of the specimens with different carbonization rate show that the specimens with the higher carbonization rate exhibit the lower bulk density and infiltration efficiency, but the higher porosity and friction coefficient. These results are attributed by the defect induced by the thermal stress during the higher carbonization rate process. In addition, the pressure <b>impregnating</b> method produces a more notable effect on the properties of C/C composites than that of the carbonization rate...|$|R
40|$|A {{family of}} {{composite}} sorbents was prepared by <b>impregnating</b> silica gel in {{the solution of}} the hygroscopic salt CaCl 2 for solar heat storage. The characteristics of water adsorbed on the composite sorbents prepared under different <b>impregnating</b> conditions were measured by a micromeritics gas adsorption analyzer, a Calvet-type microcalorimeter and an open-type gravimetric method. From the results of these dynamic sorption measurements, the effects of <b>impregnating</b> variables on the characteristics of water adsorbed on the composite sorbents were evaluated. The composite sorbents prepared under different <b>impregnating</b> conditions were also tested on an open-type sorption storage system. The composite sorbent prepared by <b>impregnating</b> in the CaCl 2 solution of 30 % showed a high and stable storage capacity of 1020 J g- 1 at the charging temperature of about 90 °C. This study demonstrates a great potential in controlling the sorption characteristics as well as the storage properties of the composite sorbents by optimizing the <b>impregnating</b> variables to meet the specific demands of solar heat storage.

After Bacchus, Stimula's unborn child, became an adult and the god of wine, he honored his deceased mother by placing a wreath in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Ellen Louise Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is {{the primary}} protagonist of the main Alien series. The mother of Amanda Ripley and a warrant officer on the Nostromo, she and the cat Jones are the sole {{survivors}} of the expedition. After putting herself and the cat in cryosleep, she is rescued fifty-seven years later and relieved of duty by Weyland-Yutani {{for the destruction of}} the Nostromo and her outlandish claims about the Alien. After communication is lost with LV-426, Ripley is sent with a unit of colonial marines on the Sulaco to investigate; the entire expedition, except Ripley, Corporal Hicks, the orphan Newt and the android Bishop, is lost. In cryosleep on the Sulaco, Ripley is <b>impregnated</b> with a queen by a facehugger Alien morph; this triggers a fire, which causes the ship to crash on the prison planet Fiorina 161, killing all aboard, save for Ripley. As the sole human survivor of the crash, Ripley helps the prisoners incarcerated on the planet to defeat an Alien created from an animal <b>impregnated</b> by a second facehugger. Weyland-Yutani arrives to claim the queen incubating in Ripley, prompting her to sacrifice herself by diving into the furnace.|$|E

5|$|Various texts relate {{that in the}} forest, Kalmashapada {{encounters}} a young Brahmin couple engaged in coitus. Kalmashapada disturbs the act before climax and captures the Brahmin youth. His wife pleads that her husband has not <b>impregnated</b> her yet, {{and that it is}} improper to kill a Brahmin. However, Kalmashapada devours the youth. The chaste Brahmin widow wails and curses Kalmashapada that he will die if he touches any woman with amorous intent. The wife cremates her husband and commits sati by jumping into his funeral pyre.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) is {{the squad}} {{leader of the}} Colonial Marines sent to {{investigate}} LV-426. During the first incursion into the atmospheric processor, he enforces Gorman's orders not to use pulse rifle and smartgun ammunition. Shortly after finding a surviving, cocooned colonist whose chest bursts to reveal an Alien, Apone grabs a flamethrower from Frost to incinerate it. In the subsequent Alien attack, he is captured alive. Hudson later states that the life sign computer readouts indicate that Apone was not killed in the attack; presumably <b>impregnated</b> by an Alien, he died when the atmosphere processor exploded or from an Alien gestating in his body.|$|E

5|$|Match, non-friction: The {{earliest}} type {{of match}} for lighting fire {{was made in}} China by 577 AD, invented by Northern Qi (550–577) court ladies as they desperately looked for materials to light fires for cooking and heating as enemy troops of Northern Zhou (557–581) and the Chen Dynasty (557–589) besieged their city from outside. Early matches in China were designed to be lit by an existing flame and carried to light another fire. They were pinewood sticks <b>impregnated</b> with sulfur and needed only a slight touch from a flame to light. This {{was written in the}} Records of the Unworldly and Strange by Tao Gu in 950 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period).|$|E
5|$|Millipede bodies may be {{flattened}} or cylindrical, and {{are composed}} of numerous metemeric segments, each with an exoskeleton consisting of five chitinous plates: a single plate above (the tergite), one at each side (pleurites), and a plate on the underside (sternite) where the legs attach. In many millipedes, these plates are fused to varying degrees, sometimes forming a single cylindrical ring. The plates are typically hard, being <b>impregnated</b> with calcium salts. Because they lack a waxy cuticle, millipedes are susceptible to water loss and must {{spend most of their}} time in moist or humid environments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A novel wood-based composite, Wood-PSt Composite, {{combining}} both {{advantages of}} wood and polymer was fabricated by <b>impregnating</b> styrene monomer into wood pores, followed by in-situ polymerization through a catalyst-thermal treatment inspired from the special porous structure. The manufacturing craft involving the <b>impregnating</b> craft and the polymerizing craft was studied and its structure was also observed by SEM. The analysis {{results indicated that the}} optimum <b>impregnating</b> condition was pressure: 0. 5 MPa, and time: 20 min; and the monomer loading linearly correlated with pressure described as Y= 201 X+ 8. 9, and linearly correlated with time described as Y= 3. 4 X+ 31. 4, respectively. The optimum polymerization craft was temperature: 80 ℃, time: 8 h and AIBN: 3 %. SEM observation showed that polystyrene generated in situ wood cellular structure and filled up wood pores under the optimum <b>impregnating</b> and polymerizing crafts, which was in accordance with the optimum manufacturing craft...|$|R
5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where the survivors of the party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was <b>impregnated</b> by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E
5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of <b>impregnated</b> material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) {{is special}} {{projects}} director of Weyland-Yutani Corporation's Special Services Division {{and the primary}} antagonist of Aliens. After telling Ellen Ripley about her daughter's death and hearing her account of the Nostromo incident, Burke uses the information to have LV-426's colonists rendezvous with the Derelict and trigger an Alien outbreak. He persuades her to join the Colonial marine expedition, to destroy (not extract) specimens, as an adviser in exchange for her regaining her flight license. Burke accompanies the squad aboard Sulaco to safeguard the company's investment in the terraforming colony. His ulterior motives are discovered by Ripley; his rationale is that the Aliens are an important species they cannot exterminate and the facility is a significant investment. Burke tries to have Ripley and Newt <b>impregnated</b> by imprisoned facehuggers, but the Colonial Marines intervene. Although most of the survivors press for Burke's execution, Ripley protests; the Aliens cut the power and use an architectural-design flaw {{to break into the}} room. He escapes, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to die, but is confronted by an Alien in the locked medical lab and his screams are heard by those outside.|$|E
5000|$|Enlil and Ninlil is {{a nearly}} {{complete}} 152-line Sumerian poem describing the affair between Enlil and the goddess Ninlil. First, Nunbarshegunu instructs Ninlil to go bathe in the river. Ninlil {{goes to the}} river, where Enlil seduces her and <b>impregnates</b> her with their son, the moon-god Nanna. Because of this, Enlil is banished to Kur, the Sumerian underworld. Ninlil follows Enlil to the underworld, where he impersonates the [...] "man of the gate". Ninlil demands to know where Enlil has gone, but Enlil, still impersonating the gatekeeper, refuses to answer. He then seduces Ninlil and <b>impregnates</b> her with Nergal, the god of death. The same scenario repeats, only this time Enlil instead impersonates the [...] "man of the river of the nether world, the man-devouring river"; once again, he seduces Ninlil and <b>impregnates</b> her with the god Ninazu.

5|$|Daisy {{is another}} of Flower's daughters {{and the first to}} be <b>impregnated</b> by roving Lazuli male Carlos. When the Whiskers were {{temporarily}} split into two groups after a goshawk attack {{in the middle of the}} series, Daisy assumed the role of dominant female of the splinter group, but lost the role when her evicted sister Tosca found the group and took control. When the splinter group rejoined the main Whiskers, Flower discovered Daisy's pregnancy but allowed her to remain in the group. Daisy gave birth in an empty burrow, and after Yossarian found her, he helped to carry her newborn pups to the real burrow. The next day, Flower initiated a burrow move. In order to remain with her family, Daisy left the pups behind to die in the abandoned burrow.|$|E
5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes three to four months. Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring. Other species of cockroaches, however, can produce far more eggs; in some cases a female needs to be <b>impregnated</b> only once to be able to lay eggs {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

The group manages to contact the surface, and open and close doors to various rooms in LeMU to move the water around, allowing them to escape. After having played the game as both Takeshi and the Kid, the player accesses the final route, in which it is revealed that while the events Takeshi experienced took place in 2017, those the Kid experienced were a recreation, and took place in a rebuilt LeMU in 2034. The You of 2017, whose full first name is Yubiseiharukana, had artificially <b>impregnated</b> herself and given birth to Yubiseiakikana, who took the role of You during the recreation. Pipi had escaped LeMU in 2017, carrying with it the disk with Sora's memories and footage of Coco being trapped in IBF. Sara and the Kid are revealed to be Tsugumi and Takeshi's children, and the Kid's real name turns out to be Hokuto.
