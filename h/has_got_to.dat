25|$|In {{the above}} {{quotation}} {{there is a}} contrast between the anapaestic first two lines, where the double short syllables suggest bustle and hurry, and the last two lines, where the repeated trochaic rhythm emphasises how everything <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be when it is ready.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, the Prince accompanies Chevalley to the station. As {{they walk}} {{through the streets of}} early morning Donnafugata, both of them overwhelmed by the squalor and despair surrounding them, both men think the situation <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> change, but where Chevalley believes it will, the Prince is convinced it won't.|$|E

We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> make this place a sight snugger than it is now, for, I tell you, when the winter sets in in earnest, it will be cold enough here to freeze a buffalo solid in an hour. We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> set to work to make a roof all over this place, and we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hunt to lay in a big stock of meat. We <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get a big store of food for the horses, for we must be mighty careful with our flour now. We can wait a {{fortnight}} to see how things go, but if it is clear then that we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fight it out here through the winter, we must shoot the pack-ponies at once, and I reckon the others will all have to go later. However, we will give them a chance as long as we can." ...|$|R

25|$|What he <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{is that we were}} speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because of yesterday. It's too little, too late. It's fine to apologise afterwards. They just don't want their names in any more sleaze. No, his apology doesn't mean a thing to me.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the VGC {{started to}} {{concentrate}} its efforts on bilingual families, though {{the improvement of}} the Flemish schools had an unexpected effect; monolingual French-speaking families also began {{to send their children to}} Flemish schools. This effect increased bit by bit, as bilingualism began to be thought of as normal. Even today, the Flemish educational system continues to attract those with a first language other than Dutch; in 2005, 20% of students go to Dutch-speaking high schools, and for daycares, that figure reaches 23%. In fact, it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the point where those with Dutch as a first language are now a minority in the Flemish schools, and as a result, measures have needed to be taken to sustain the quality of education.|$|E

For my part I would much rather let him go. She is a finer artist every way, and she is more {{important}} {{to the success of the}} piece. But it would be more difficult to replace him than it would be to replace her, and he knows it. We could get Miss Pettrell at once for Salome, and we should have to look about for a Haxard. Still, I am disposed to drop Godolphin, if Mr. Maxwell feels as I do." ...|$|R

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution.

500|$|With Gallup's {{departure}} from the Cure and Smith's work with Siouxsie and the Banshees, rumours spread that the Cure had broken up. In December 1982, Smith remarked to Melody Maker, [...] "Do the Cure really exist any more? I've been pondering that question myself [...] it <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> a point where I don't fancy working in that format again." [...] He added, [...] "Whatever happens, it won't be me, Laurence and Simon together any more. I know that." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Der Spiegel following the judgement, Mosley said: [...] "Strictly speaking Google <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> obey German courts in Germany and French courts in France. But {{in the end it}} has to decide whether it wants to live in a democracy. Google behaves like an adolescent rebelling against the establishment. The company has to recognise that it is a part of society and it must accept the responsibility which comes with that." [...] Mosley then launched proceedings against Google in the UK. All the cases were eventually settled in May 2015.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{lesson of}} the wickedness and immorality of {{international}} power-politics was burnt 'yes, very literally burnt' into my mind and heart. The main lesson I learnt was that when you are weak you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be very patient. You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> accept humiliation. You <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take {{the worst kind of}} insults. But in your inner heart you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> love your country, have faith in its people and believe in their destiny as well as yours. If you do so, there is always a little ray of hope left which kindles in your conscience and inspires you {{to make the best of}} the worst possible circumstances and save whatever little you can of your land and its inheritance. That is the key to human survival amidst overwhelming difficulties." ...|$|R

500|$|Cast {{members were}} more {{critical}} of Eve's later appearances on the show. Ross reacted negatively to Eve's involvement in Vincent's storylines. She said that Vincent giving birth to his father's child made her [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and she could only complete the birth scenes after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Eve's incorrect reattachment of Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore. Westmore cited it {{as a reason for}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "This <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?".|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Shankly wrote: [...] "Right {{from the}} start as a manager (i.e., {{when he was at}} Carlisle) I tried to show that the fans are the people that matter. You've got to know how to treat them (and) have them on your side". This was {{particularly}} true at Liverpool and Shankly said he was [...] "made for Liverpool (where) the people that matter most are the ones who come through the turnstiles". He added that [...] "a manager <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> identify himself with the people (because) football is their whole life". In return, he said, the support of the Liverpool fans for their team had been [...] "incredible".|$|E
500|$|On release, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone {{highlighted}} [...] "Photograph" [...] {{as one of}} the album's [...] "three {{most wonderful}} songs", along with the Lennon-composed [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] and the Harrison–Mal Evans collaboration [...] "You and Me (Babe)". Gerson noted how the song's intro provided an effective [...] "pull on the listener" [...] and wrote that, while the lyrics had a sorrowful quality, [...] "the effect is warming". Billboards album reviewer praised Perry's [...] "stunning production" [...] on [...] "the best Ringo album ever", adding: [...] "We all know already that 'Photograph' <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be a No. 1 single this month, right?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Evil Dick" [...] {{focuses on}} male promiscuity. Its lyrics {{describe}} {{a married man}} who is led to seek strange women after his [...] "evil dick" [...] tells him [...] "Don't sleep alone, don't sleep alone." [...] "Momma's Gotta Die Tonight" [...] follows the account of a black teenager who murders and dismembers his racist mother after she reacts negatively when he brings a white girl home. In The Ice Opinion: Who Gives a Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song's lyrics are metaphorical, explaining that [...] "Whoever is still perpetuating racism <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> die, not necessarily physically, {{but they have to}} kill off that part of their brain. From now on, consider it dead. The entire attitude is dead." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 31, Tancredo shifted {{momentarily}} {{to a new}} issue. On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got {{to step up to the}} plate and take some initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> come to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|During World War II, Citizen Kane was {{not seen}} in most European countries. It was shown in France {{for the first time}} on July 10, 1946 at the Marbeuf theatre in Paris. Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas we all know that cinema <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be in the present tense." ...|$|E

500|$|Later that year, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin {{reported}} that the September 18 show in Honolulu {{would be the last}} performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Reznor told the newspaper [...] "at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. [...] Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. [...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't want it to go stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E
500|$|Other Passions {{cast members}} {{had a more}} {{uncertain}} understanding of the character. Tracey Ross, who portrayed Eve Russell, responded negatively to Vincent's involvement in her character's storylines. While discussing the filming of the scenes in which Vincent gives birth to his father's child, Ross said she felt [...] "physically nauseous" [...] and could only complete them after the show's acting coach, Maria O'Brien, convinced her of [...] " [...] comedic possibilities". Vincent's manipulation of Eve to incorrectly reattach Julian's penis was criticized by co-star McKenzie Westmore, ("This <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be the worst storyline ever done, what are they doing?"), who cited it {{as a reason for}} the show's cancellation. Kim Johnston Ulrich, who played Ivy Winthrop, said she was confused by Vincent's story arcs even though she was a fan of the series' supernatural elements.|$|E
500|$|On release, Meddle {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stones Jean-Charles Costa wrote: [...] "Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's {{emergence as a}} real shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into the growth track again", and the NME called it [...] "an exceptionally good album". Steve Peterson of Hit Parader cited [...] "Fearless" [...] as its best song and said of the album, [...] "This <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be their best ever." [...] Ed Kelleher of Circus called it [...] "another masterpiece by a masterful group", noting [...] "Fearless" [...] as [...] "fascinating" [...] and praising [...] "Echoes" [...] as [...] "a tone poem that allows all four group members much time to stretch their muscles". However, Melody Maker was more reserved, describing it as [...] "a soundtrack to a non-existent movie".|$|E
