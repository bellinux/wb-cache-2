40|$|Infection of pigs with {{influenza}} A H 1 N 1 2009 virus (A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09) {{was first}} detected in England in November 2009 following global {{spread of the}} virus in the human population. This paper describes clinical and epidemiological findings in the first English pig farms in which A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 influenza virus was detected. These farms showed differences in disease presentation, spread and duration of infection. The factors likely to influence these features are described and relate to whether pigs were housed or outdoors, {{the age of the}} pigs, <b>inter-current</b> <b>disease</b> and the management system of the unit. Infection could be mild or clinically inapparent in breeding pigs with more typical respiratory disease being identified later in their progeny. Mortality was low where disease was uncomplicated by environmental stresses or concurrent infections. Where deaths occurred in pigs infected with A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 influenza, they were mainly due to other infections, including streptococcal disease due to Streptococcus suis infection. This paper demonstrates the ease with which A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus was transmitted horizontally and maintained in a pig population...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Spontaneous self-aggressive b haviors Were {{observed}} in five adult male rhesus mon-keys (Macaca mulatta) housed {{at a university}} facility [...] all were individually caged, were free of <b>inter-current</b> <b>disease,</b> and were being utilized in ongoing research studies. The self-aggressive b haviors ob-served included self-biting, self-clasping, self-slapping, self-rubbing and threatening of body parts. In several cases, wounds were inflicted and medical treatment was required ue to {{the severity of the}} lesions. A review of the animals ' clinical histories revealed an increased level of self-aggressive b hav-ior in four of five monkeys during such stressful or stimulating conditions as movement of the animal tO a new cage, movement of animals out of the room or escape of other monkeys from their cages. The frequency with which these behaviors occurred was quantitated experimentally. The results re-vealed an increased level of self-aggressive b havior in two of these animals during the videotaped sessions in response to aggressive contacts with the investigator. In contrast, one monkey exhibited self-aggressive behavior both clinically and experimentally in the absence of environmental stimuli or human contact. Clinical management of self-aggressive monkeys included housing monkeys only with physically smaller primates, decreasing the level of environmental stimuli, and drug therapy. Haloperidol was used with success in one animal that exhibited severe self-aggressive b havior...|$|E
40|$|OUR {{knowledge}} of the pathological changes in the rheumatoid type of arthritis of so-called " unknown vetiology " (synonyms: rheumatoid, atrophic and proliferative arthritis) has been hitherto founded chiefly upon the descriptions of Nichols and Richardson (1910), Strangeways (1918), and others. It is important to realise, however, that these observations are largely based upon investigations in the later stages of the disease, or even the stage of " sequels. " The rheumatoid type of arthritis is rarely fatal per se, so that opportunities for investigation of the pathological changes in the earlier or acute stages seldom occur, {{and many of the}} existing pathological descriptions are based upon post-mortem examinations of elderly sufferers who have died of some <b>inter-current</b> <b>disease</b> and in which the essential pathological features have become obscured by secondary osteo-arthritic or other changes. The same criticism applies to material hitherto ob-tained at operation, since there were few indications for surgery in the active stages of rheumatoid disease. Post-mortem exam-inations of patients who have succumbed to rheumatic fever are, of course, frequently performed, but few would deny that the changes in the joints in such cases have not received the con-sideration that they deserve. SOURCE OF MATERIAL The author has found that the operation of arthrotomy followed by lavage with an antiseptic solution is of great value in certain acute or subacute forms of arthritis of the rheumatoid type, particularly when such large and comparatively superficial joints as the knee are principally affected. In some subacute cases, partial synovectomy has been performed. The results in th...|$|E
