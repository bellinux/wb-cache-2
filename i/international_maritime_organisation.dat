25|$|HMAS Success (OR 304) is a Durance-class {{multi-product}} replenishment oiler {{serving in}} the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, Australia, during the 1980s, {{she is the only}} ship of the class to be constructed outside France, and the only one to not originally serve in the Marine Nationale (French Navy). The ship was part of the Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, and was deployed to East Timor in response to incidents in 1999 and 2006. The ship was fitted with a double hull {{during the first half of}} 2011, to meet <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organisation</b> standards.|$|E
25|$|According to the <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organisation</b> {{oil spills}} can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention {{recognized}} that most oil pollution resulted from routine shipboard operations {{such as the}} cleaning of cargo tanks. In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply to wash the tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of oil and water into the sea. OILPOL 54 prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended {{by means of an}} amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO. Meanwhile, IMO in 1965 set up a Subcommittee on Oil Pollution, under the auspices of its Maritime Safety committee, to address oil pollution issues.|$|E
2500|$|Estonias {{distress}} beacons or EPIRBs required manual activation, {{which did}} not happen. Had they been activated automatically, {{it would have been}} immediately obvious that the ship had sunk and the location would have been clear. All EPIRBs were subsequently required to deploy automatically and the accident was [...] "instrumental in the move to legislate Voyage Data Recorders". New <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organisation</b> (IMO) Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) liferaft regulations for rescue from listing ships in rough water were introduced, though launching such craft, even in training exercises, remains dangerous for the crew.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 2009, the Department of Defence {{released}} a request for tender for modification of Success into a double hull vessel, allowing her to meet <b>International</b> <b>Maritime</b> <b>Organisation</b> standards for oil tankers. The tender was awarded to Singapore-based ST Marine (a subsidiary of ST Engineering), with the conversion to be made during 2011. The ship sailed to Singapore in November for a naval exercise, after which she was to enter dock for the 14-week conversion, but problems in the contract delayed the dockyard start date, and Success was ordered back to Sydney, via [...] in Western Australia, so the ship's company could take leave with family while the contract was finalised. Work on the ship started in late December 2010, with the main conversion work completed {{by the end of}} April 2011. In May 2011, a civilian contractor working on the ship died after falling overboard. Success left Singapore in late May, and returned to Sydney.|$|E
