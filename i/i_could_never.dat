Roger would often cast against type in those days. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before. However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film was no exception.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

After her son's death, she commissioned the building of a palace in Corfu which she named the Achilleion, after Homer's hero Achilles in The Iliad. After her death, the building was purchased by German Emperor Wilhelm II. Later it was acquired by the nation of Greece and converted to a museum.|$|E

500|$|Pfeiffer {{starred in}} Amy Heckerling's romantic comedy <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Never</b> Be Your Woman (2007), with Paul Rudd and Saoirse Ronan, portraying [...] Rosie, a 40-year-old {{divorced}} mother {{working as a}} scriptwriter and producer for a television show {{who falls in love}} with a much younger man (Rudd). Her reported salary was US$1 million, with an advance on 15 percent of the gross. However, the film was only distributed on home video markets. Reviews for <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Never</b> Be Your Woman were moderately positive, with critic James Berardinelli finding Pfeiffer and Rudd to [...] "have adequate chemistry to pull off the romance" [...] in what he described as an [...] "enjoyable romantic comedy that has enough going for it to make it worth a recommendation". She next starred in Personal Effects (2009), opposite Ashton Kutcher, playing two grieving people coping with the pain and frustration of their loss whose bond spawns an unlikely romance. The drama premiered at Iowa City's Englert Theatre.|$|E

Matthías Matthíasson, Director of Samtökin '78, Iceland's gay and lesbian rights group, has commented: [...] "He says things <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> say.

500|$|During {{his brief}} {{career in the}} NFL, Leaf {{appeared}} in 25 games and made 21 starts. He completed 317 of 655 (48.4%) passes for 3,666 yards, with 14 touchdowns and 36 interceptions and a career quarterback rating of only 50.0. After hearing of Leaf's retirement, Rodney Harrison, {{one of his most}} outspoken critics on the Chargers, said, [...] "He took the money and ran.

500|$|Smetana {{initially}} went to Gothenburg without Kateřina. Writing to Liszt, he {{said that}} the people there were musically unsophisticated, but he saw this as an opportunity [...] "...for an impact <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> have achieved in Prague." [...] Within a few weeks of his arrival, he had given his first recital, opened a music school that was rapidly overwhelmed by applications, and become conductor of the Gothenburg Society for Classical Choral Music. In a few months Smetana had achieved both professional and social recognition in the city, although he found little time for composition; two intended orchestral works, provisionally entitled Frithjof and The Viking's Voyage, were sketched but abandoned.|$|E
500|$|Along with The Dark Knight Returns, Tim Burton has {{mentioned}} that The Killing Joke influenced his film adaptation of Batman: [...] "I {{was never a}} giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't {{know if it was}} dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved The Killing Joke, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1963 {{he picked}} up his second film nomination, the Golden Globe for Best Comedy Actor for his {{portrayal}} of Spender in The Mouse on the Moon. He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: Terry-Thomas in Tuscany, Terry-Thomas in the South of France and Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland. He did not enjoy the producer's role, complaining that [...] "for some extraordinary reason that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> understand, everybody was always out to do the producer of any film whoever he was. I had to be on the watch the whole time". He worked consistently during 1963, appearing in television programmes {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic; these included Terry-Thomas, a one-off variety show on BBC Television in July that included Donald Sutherland.|$|E

500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing the damn thing, I was just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>never</b> understand.

500|$|... "Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song.

[...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live. He confessed; [...] "I like the ending, you know, I like the big heavy part and I always say, 'Let's put the heavy ending at the end of [...] "Chemical Warfare" [...] and just do the last half.'

Still, the experienced composer completed the music in four days, on 5 November 1899, and it was published by Enoch & Sons for the Daily Mail. The first public performance was sung by John Coates, under Sullivan's baton, at the Alhambra Theatre on 13 November 1899, to a [...] "magnificent reception" [...] of an overflowing theatre.
