40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the reliability of corneal thickness measurements derived from SOCT Copernicus HR (Fourier domain OCT). Methods: Thirty healthy eyes of 30 subjects were evaluated. One eye of each patient was chosen randomly. Images were obtained of the central (up to 2. 0 [*]mm from the corneal apex) and paracentral (2. 0 to 4. 0 [*]mm) cornea. We assessed corneal thickness (central and paracentral) and epithelium thickness. The intra-observer repeatability data were analysed using the <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient (ICC) for a range of 95 per cent within-subject standard deviation (SW) and the within-subject coefficient of variation (CW). The level of agreement by Bland–Altman analysis was also represented for the study of the reproducibility between observers and agreement between methods of measurement (automatic versus manual). Results: The mean value of the central corneal thickness (CCT) was 542. 4 ± 30. 1 [*]μm (SD). There was a high intra-observer agreement, finding the best result in the central sector with an <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient of 0. 99, 95 per cent CI (0. 989 to 0. 997) and the worst, in the minimum corneal thickness, with an <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient of 0. 672, 95 per cent CI (0. 417 to 0. 829). Reproducibility between observers was very high. The best result was found in the central sector thickness obtained both manually and automatically with an <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient of 0. 990 in both cases and the worst result in the maximum corneal thickness with an <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient of 0. 827. The agreement between measurement methods was also very high with <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient greater than 0. 91.

At present {{it is unclear}} to what extent different IP based estimations yield different results, and reliability and validity have not been investigated in older persons without a specific medical condition. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare reliability and validity of four different IP based estimations of mean step length in independent-living older persons. Participants were assessed twice and walked at different speeds while wearing a tri-axial accelerometer at the lower back. For all step-length estimators, test-retest <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlations</b> approached or were above 0. 90. <b>Intra-class</b> <b>correlations</b> with reference step length were above 0. 92 with a mean error of 0. 0 cm when (1) multiplying the estimated center-of-mass displacement during a step by an individual correction factor in a simple IP model, or (2) adding an individual constant for bipedal stance displacement to the estimated displacement during single stance in a 2 -phase IP model. When applying generic corrections or constants in all subjects (i. e. multiplication by 1. 25, or adding 75 % of foot length), correlations were above 0. 75 with a mean error of respectively 2. 0 and 1. 2 cm. Although the results indicate that an individual adjustment of the IP models provides better estimations of mean step length, the ease of a generic adjustment can be favored when merely evaluating intra-individual differences. Further studies should determine the validity of these IP based estimations for assessing gait in daily life. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution {{isotropic}} three-dimensional reconstructions {{of human}} brain gray and white matter structures {{can be characterized}} to quantify aspects of their shape, volume and topological complexity. In particular, methods based on fractal analysis have been applied in neuroimaging studies to quantify the structural complexity of the brain in both healthy and impaired conditions. The usefulness of such measures for characterizing individual differences in brain structure critically depends on their within-subject reproducibility {{in order to allow}} the robust detection of between-subject differences. This study analyzes key analytic parameters of three fractal-based methods that rely on the box-counting algorithm with the aim to maximize within-subject reproducibility of the fractal characterizations of different brain objects, including the pial surface, the cortical ribbon volume, the white matter volume and the grey matter/white matter boundary. Two separate datasets originating from different imaging centers were analyzed, comprising, 50 subjects with three and 24 subjects with four successive scanning sessions per subject, respectively. The reproducibility of fractal measures was statistically assessed by computing their <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlations.</b> Results reveal differences between different fractal estimators and allow the identification of several parameters that are critical for high reproducibility. Highest reproducibility with <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlations</b> in the range of 0. 9 – 0. 95 is achieved with the correlation dimension. Further analyses of the fractal dimensions of parcellated cortical and subcortical gray matter regions suggest robustly estimated and region-specific patterns of individual variability.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to examine the test-retest {{reliability}} of the Rolimeter measurement procedure in the acute time phase, following a substantial knee trauma. In total, 15 participants with acute knee trauma were examined by one single observer at three different time-points with the Rolimeter using a maximum force. The selected time-points were: baseline (0 – 7 days after the trauma), midpoint (3 – 4 weeks after the trauma), and endpoint (3 – 4 weeks after the trauma). The anterior-posterior displacement was recorded where the endpoint evaluation was used as the reference value. The mean anterior laxity scores remained constant over the measurement time-points for both knees, with an anterior laxity that was 2. 7 mm higher (on average) in the injured than the noninjured knee (9. 5 mm vs. 6. 8 mm). The mean difference (i. e., bias) between laxity scores, for the injured knee, measured at endpoint versus baseline was 0. 2 ± 1. 0 mm and − 0. 2 ± 1. 1 mm when measured at endpoint versus midpoint, with average typical errors of 0. 7 and 0. 8 mm and <b>intra-class</b> <b>correlations</b> that were very strong (both r=~ 0. 93).
