25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, most {{discussion}} of feminism {{centered on the}} relationships between men and women, child-centric spheres, and wages. After that time period, bodies, personal needs, and sexuality emerged. Some feminist scholars since the 1980s have evaluated the historic record on women and shown that they were participants in shaping {{in the history of}} the country. In 1987, Julia Tuñón Pablos wrote Mujeres en la historia de México (Women in the History of Mexico), which was the first comprehensive account of women's historical contributions to Mexico from prehistory through the Twentieth Century. Since that time, extensive studies have shown that women were involved all areas of Mexican life. From the 1990s, <b>gender</b> <b>perspective</b> has increasingly become a focus for academic study.|$|E

The result of the mapping reveals an absence of <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> in the journal. Only 2. 5 percent of the articles included gender in the analysis. <b>Gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> are mainly applied on subjects such as Family, Theory and Methods in Future Studies, Development in the Third World or in articles describing Future Worlds in terms of Eco feministic visions. These visions consists of upgraded ”feminine” values which are assumed {{to make the world}} more peaceful enabling the two sexes, men and women, to live in harmonic relation {{to each other and to}} nature. A concept map is also developed aiming to define the different characters of the <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> found in the material. The two dimensions used in the mapping define, on one hand, constructivist views on gender from essentialist views and, on the other hand, <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> including a power analysis from <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> without any power analysis. The majority of the articles were found to be using a constructivist view on gender and including a power analysis, but the variation was significant.

25|$|With the 1994 {{formation}} of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN) (Zapatista Army of National Liberation), indigenous women in Chiapas advocated for gender equality {{with the leaders of}} the uprising. On 1 January 1994, the Zapatistas announced the Ley Revolucionaria de Mujeres (Women's Revolutionary Law), which in a series of ten provisions granted women rights regarding children, education, health, marriage, military participation, political participation, protection from violence and work and wages. While not recognized by official state or federal governments, the laws were an important gain for these indigenous women within their native culture. In 1997 a national meeting of indigenous women titled “Constructing our History” resulted in the {{formation of}} the Coordinadora Nacional de Mujeres Indígenas (CNMI) (National Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Women) among communities from Chiapas, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Mexico City, Michoacán, Morelos, Oaxaca, Puebla, Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, Sonora, and Veracruz. The purpose of the organization is to strengthen from a <b>gender</b> <b>perspective</b> the leadership opportunities, networking potential and skills of indigenous women, within their communities and nationally, and sensitize indigenous peoples on indigenous women’s human rights.|$|E

40|$|Although peacebuilding aims {{to address}} {{root causes of}} conflict, while {{constructing}} stable institutions and social relations, conventional peacebuilding’s negligence of gender in post-conflict societies and peace processes has restricted its potential. Most actors that contribute to peacebuilding efforts have participated in this ignorance, causing an outburst of feminist literature highlighting the severe need to integrate <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> into peacebuilding. However, existing literature provides few specific recommendations and insufficiently examines mechanisms for integrating gender into state-led peacebuilding. Major actors, such as the United States, have recently embarked on attempts to incorporate <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> into peacebuilding, creating large scopes of policy in need of analysis. This paper investigates the integration of <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> into US Department of State peacebuilding strategies under Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who significantly elevated the importance of women’s rights and brought attention to gender considerations in US foreign policy. Through the review of policy changes {{and the study of}} US peacebuilding in Afghanistan, this paper concludes that the integration of <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> in Department of State peacebuilding efforts is incomplete, leaving policy altered, but not transformed, and inhibiting hopes for gender equality and inclusive, sustainable peace...|$|R

[...] Emo's popularity and its [...] "lonely boy's aesthetic" [...] have led to a litany of one-sided songs in which men vent their fury at the women who have wronged them. Some emo bands' lyrics disguise violent anti-women sentiments with a pop-music veneer.|$|E

It is a strategy for making women’s as well as men’s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated.

50|$|The {{integration}} of a gender in SSR contributes to different {{objectives of the}} reform process: better delivery of security and justice services; more representative institutions; respect for human rights; strengthened oversight and accountability and local ownership of the SSR process itself. The {{integration of}} <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> is generally pursued through two complementary strategies: gender mainstreaming, and measures to promote the equal participation {{of men and women}} in security sector institutions and SSR processes. <b>Gender</b> <b>perspectives</b> can be included in both the SSR process itself (e.g. by consulting men and women on SSR, or training personnel responsible for SSR policy on gender issues) and in the institutions undergoing reform (e.g. in efforts to recruit more women, pursue gender-sensitive service delivery or provide gender training to new recruits).|$|R
40|$|Sex {{differentials}} in {{infant mortality}} vary widely across nations. Because newborn girls are biologically advantaged in surviving {{to their first}} birthday, sex differentials in infant mortality typically arise from genetic factors that result in higher male infant mortality rates. Nonetheless, there are cases where mortality differentials arise from social or behavioral factors reflecting deliberate discrimination by adults in favor of boys over girls, resulting in atypical male to female infant mortality ratios. This cross-national study of 93 developed and developing countries uses such macro-social theories as modernization theory, <b>gender</b> <b>perspectives,</b> human ecology, and sociobiology/evolutionary psychology to predict gender differentials in infant mortality.
