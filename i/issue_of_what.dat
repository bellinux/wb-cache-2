5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for the parkway from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for the parkway was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. The parkway, while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do with truck traffic. The parkway, if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E

These include: unfavourable economics {{compared to other}} sources of energy, slowness in addressing climate change, industrial bottlenecks and personnel shortages in the nuclear sector, and the contentious <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do with nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel. There are also concerns about more nuclear accidents, security, and nuclear weapons proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there has}} been no Supreme Court {{decision}} on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law.

25|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>What</b> If? {{revolved}} around the Cosmic Carnage where the Carnage symbiote remained bonded to the Surfer, forcing Spider-Man and the Avengers to battle him until Firestar {{was able to use}} her powers to disrupt the symbiote's control over the Surfer.

25|$|A common paradox {{occurs with}} {{mathematical}} idealizations such as s which describe physical phenomena well at distant or global scales but break {{down at the}} point itself. These paradoxes are sometimes seen as relating to Zeno's paradoxes which all deal with the physical manifestations of mathematical properties of continuity, infinitesimals, and infinities often associated with space and time. For example, the electric field associated with a point charge is infinite {{at the location of}} the point charge. A consequence of this apparent paradox is that the electric field of a point-charge can only be described in a limiting sense by a carefully constructed Dirac delta function. This mathematically inelegant but physically useful concept allows for the efficient calculation of the associated physical conditions while conveniently sidestepping the philosophical <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> actually occurs at the infinitesimally-defined point: a question that physics is as yet unable to answer. Fortunately, a consistent theory of quantum electrodynamics removes the need for infinitesimal point charges altogether.|$|E

25|$|Another {{reason for}} the differing views of Catholics and certain Protestants on concupiscence is their {{position}} on sin in general. Certain Protestants (for instance the magisterial reformers) hold that one can be guilty of sin {{even if it is}} not voluntary; The Catholic Church, by contrast, traditionally has held that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. Since human nature (and therefore concupiscence) is not voluntarily chosen, the Catholic Church does not teach that it is sinful; some Protestants believe that, since some sins are involuntary, it can be.|$|E

500|$|Scholars have {{differed}} on the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{is to be}} made of Mr. Dooley and {{the often}} bizarre things Dunne placed in his mouth: whether Dooley is intended to believe that he is a cousin of Admiral Dewey, or that [...] "Mack" [...] (as he calls President McKinley) has actually said the seemingly unlikely things that the barkeeper relates. Walter Blair, in his 1942 volume on American humor, considered Mr. Dooley too much of a provincial innocent to grasp that referring to the president so familiarly might be a [...] Many Dooley pieces commence [...] "I see by the papers", that is, the newspapers Dooley subscribes to for his customers to read and which the bartender peruses at slack times, constituting a major source of information for him. Blair contended that Dooley knows only what he reads in the Evening Post and other papers, and gullibly believes quotations he has heard without attribution from his customer Hogan were made up by that bookish patron. Dunne wrote in 1898 that Dooley [...] "reads the newspapers with solemn care, heartily hates them, and accepts all they print for the sake of drowning Hennessy's rising protests against his logic".|$|E
500|$|Besides {{the factual}} {{issues that the}} jury was called on to adjudicate, there was a legal <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{constituted}} [...] "seduction" [...] under the law. [...] The basis of the claim was a two-hundred-year-old tort which allowed a man to sue anybody who impregnated his female servant. [...] The basis for damages under such a claim was the servant's inability to perform her duties {{to the detriment of}} the employer. [...] The tort was later broadened to allow the seductee's father to sue; only in statute in 1903 was the law amended to give standing to the woman herself. [...] At issue was what damage, if any, she needed to show in order to have a cause of action. [...] The defence argued that in all precedents there had been a pregnancy resulting, and that without one the plaintiffs could not claim damages. [...] In response, MacLean emphasized the not entirely consensual nature of the alleged relationship. [...] Brownlee himself responded that if the alleged relationship had been non-consensual, he should have been charged under the criminal law for rape, not sued for seduction; that the plaintiffs had not attempted to press criminal charges was evidence, he believed, of their bad faith and financial motivation.|$|E
500|$|The 1873 act {{eliminated}} the provisions allowing depositors of silver bullion {{to have their}} metal struck into standard silver dollars; they could now only receive Trade dollars, which were not legal tender beyond $5. [...] As the price of silver then was about $1.30 per ounce, there was no outcry from silver producers. [...] Beginning in 1874, however, the price dropped; silver would not again sell for $1.2929 or more {{on the open market}} in the United States until 1963. [...] Advocates of silver both sought a market for the commodity and believed that [...] "free silver" [...] or bimetallism would boost the economy and make it easy for farmers to repay debts. [...] Many in Congress agreed, and the first battle over the issue resulted in a partial victory for silver forces, as the 1878 Bland–Allison Act required the Mint to purchase large quantities of silver on the open market and strike the bullion into dollar coins. [...] The Mint did so, using a new design by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, which {{came to be known as}} the Morgan dollar. [...] The <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> monetary standard would be used occupied the nation for the rest of the 19th century, becoming most acute in the 1896 presidential election. [...] In that election, [...] the unsuccessful Democratic candidate, William Jennings Bryan, campaigned on [...] "free silver", having electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech, decrying the gold standard. [...] The issue was settled for the time by the Gold Standard Act of 1900, making that standard the law of the land.|$|E
