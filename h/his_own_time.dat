5|$|EdwardIII was a temperamental man but {{capable of}} unusual clemency. He {{was in many}} ways a {{conventional}} king whose main interest was warfare. Admired in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> and for centuries after, Edward was denounced as an irresponsible adventurer by later Whig historians such as William Stubbs. This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> Bede was as {{well known}} for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, {{as well as other}} {{theological}} works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint.|$|E

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> Whitman {{attracted}} {{an influential}} coterie of disciples and admirers. Some, like Oscar Wilde and Edward Carpenter, viewed Whitman {{both as a}} prophet of a utopian future and of same-sex desire – the passion of comrades. This aligned with their own desires for a future of brotherly socialism.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{that we do not}} have Ine's laws in their original 7th-century form. Alfred mentions in the prologue to his laws that he rejected earlier laws which he disliked. He did not specify what laws he omitted, but if they were the ones no longer relevant in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> it cannot be assumed that the surviving version of Ine's laws is complete.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{earned his}} living collaborating with more {{established}} sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural {{pieces in the}} style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> he worked on studies leading to the creation of his next important work, St. John the Baptist Preaching.|$|E

He that writes the history of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times,</b> if he adheres steadily to truth, will write that which <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>times</b> will not easily endure.

5|$|Rojhaz, {{looking more}} like the Captain America of old (or of the future, {{as the case may}} be), refuses to go back through the rift: he hopes to build a better America from the beginning. Fury tricks Rojhaz by playing on the trust that Captain America had for the Nick Fury of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> knocks him {{unconscious}} and carries the body back through the rift, thus going into the future himself.|$|E
5|$|Warwick's {{historical}} legacy {{has been a}} matter of much dispute. Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self-centred and rash, and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king. It is generally agreed, however, that in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society, and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support.|$|E
5|$|William Chapman {{was born}} in Clarksburg, Virginia, (now West Virginia) on August 11, 1808. His father died when William was fourteen, at which time he left home to earn his own way.

5|$|At the airport, Cole {{leaves a}} last message telling the {{scientists}} that in following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys {{they are on}} the wrong track, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose, an acquaintance from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> who gives Cole a handgun and ambiguously instructs him to follow orders. At the same time, Railly spots Dr. Peters, and recognizes him from a newspaper photograph as an assistant at Goines' father's virology lab. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities that match the locations and sequence of the viral outbreaks.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, writers, artists, {{and architects}} in Italy {{were well aware}} of the transformations that were taking place and were using phrases such as modi antichi (in the antique manner) or alle romana et alla antica (in the manner of the Romans and the ancients) to {{describe}} their work. In the 1330s Petrarch referred to pre-Christian times as antiqua (ancient) and to the Christian period as nova (new). From Petrarch's Italian perspective, this new period (which included <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time)</b> was an age of national eclipse.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr. In June, {{he decided to take}} private flying lessons at Hendon Aerodrome, which would give him an outlet for his interest in engineering and possibly help him to see action in France sooner. He paid to undertake pilot training in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} consider Staunton's {{understanding of}} positional play {{to have been}} far ahead of his contemporaries'. Although not an all-out attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his Chess-Player's Handbook (1847) was a reference for decades. The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time,</b> and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand, he maintained good working relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.|$|E
5|$|Stańczyk, {{the male}} figure {{depicted}} in the painting, was the court jester when Poland was {{at the height of}} its political, economic and cultural power during the era of the Renaissance in Poland, during the reign of King SigismundI the Old (reigned 1506–1548). He was a popular figure; besides his fame as a jester he has been described as an eloquent, witty, and intelligent man, using satire to comment on the nation's past, present, and future. Unlike jesters of other European courts, Stańczyk has always been considered as much more than a mere entertainer. Stańczyk's fame and legend were strong in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time</b> and enjoyed a resurgence in the 19th century, and he remains well-known to this day.|$|E
5|$|Symeon's {{theological}} and ethical treatises were original written works, {{as compared to}} many of his other writings that were taken from his talks. They cover his positions on various controversial issues of theology. Many of them were directed at Stephen, his main antagonist in the church, along with other church officials whom Symeon saw as taking an overly theoretical approach to Christianity. In these pieces Symeon defended {{the traditions of the}} early Byzantine mystical theologians from the teachings of the church officials of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> Central to this defense was Symeon's view that the revelation of scripture could only be understood through the experience of divine grace given to the pure of heart during contemplation.|$|E

5|$|The climax {{takes place}} at the beauty pageant. After a frantic race against the clock the family arrives at the hotel, and are curtly told by a pageant {{organizer}} that they are a couple minutes past the deadline. A sympathetic hired hand instead offers to register Olive on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> As Olive prepares for the pageant, the family sees Olive's competition: slim, hypersexualized pre-teen girls with teased hair and capped teeth. They wear lip gloss, adult-like swimsuits, and glamorous evening wear while performing highly elaborate dance numbers with great panache. It quickly becomes apparent that Olive (plain, chubby, wearing large eyeglasses, and untrained in beauty pageant conventions) is a mere amateur by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E
5|$|Bush left Tufts in 1919, {{although}} he remained employed by AMRAD, {{and joined the}} Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT, where he worked under Dugald C. Jackson. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on Principles of Electrical Engineering, an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>time.</b> AMRAD's management {{was not interested in}} the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.|$|E
