5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union, Russia <b>drastically</b> cut military spending, and restructuring the economy left millions unemployed. The capitalist reforms culminated in a recession in the early 1990s more severe than the Great Depression as experienced by the United States and Germany.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Patriots {{switched}} the block numbers {{to a more}} modern rounded number font with a dropshadow. The Patriots {{were one of the}} first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow <b>drastically</b> over the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 22nd century, rising sea levels from global warming have wiped out coastal {{cities such as}} Amsterdam, Venice and New York, and <b>drastically</b> reduced the population. A new type of robots called Mecha, {{advanced}} humanoids capable of thoughts and emotions, have been created.|$|E
5|$|The {{school year}} lasts for nine months, and {{is divided into}} two terms: autumn and spring. Students attend around 32–40 lessons a week, each lasting 40–80 minutes. This can vary <b>drastically</b> between institutions.|$|E
5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping the dimension with his body <b>drastically</b> mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy as weapons, while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul Edge that soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|Aided by {{the monsoon}} trough, the outer rainbands of Typhoon Ruby brought an {{extended}} period of heavy rains across eastern Taiwan. According to press reports, one person was killed and another was initially reported as missing. River levels rose <b>drastically,</b> which led to flooding along low-lying areas. High seas associated with the outer rainbands of the storm were responsible for $9.89million in destruction to the Fujian Province.|$|E
5|$|Astana changed <b>drastically</b> {{between the}} 2007 and 2008 seasons, with its former manager Marc Biver {{replaced}} by Johan Bruyneel from the dissolved Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. Following Bruyneel to Astana were several riders from that team, including Alberto Contador and Levi Leipheimer, who had finished first and third, respectively, in the 2007 Tour de France for Discovery. Numerous riders also left the team, including Matthias Kessler, Andrey Kashechkin, and Alexander Vinokourov, who had all {{tested positive for}} doping.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{estimate}} that the Solar System {{as we know it}} today will not change <b>drastically</b> until the Sun has fused almost all the hydrogen fuel in its core into helium, beginning its evolution from the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and into its red-giant phase. Even so, the Solar System will continue to evolve until then.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been <b>drastically</b> reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an indicator species {{for the presence}} of the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii.|$|E
5|$|CNET also {{reviewed}} TuneUp Utilities 2009 {{and gave}} it 5 stars out of 5. “To call TuneUp Utilities 2009 useful would <b>drastically</b> understate the situation”, said Seth Rosenblatt, an associate editor with CNET. He assessed TuneUp Utilities as a powerful and easy-to-use set of tools, with its disk cleanup and registry cleaner the “bread-and-butter” of the entire set.|$|E
5|$|Credit Information: The {{use of the}} Lebanese Identity Card can {{enable the}} banks in the Republic of Lebanon to easily {{establish}} persons credit-worthiness from the Credit Referencing Agencies any time they apply for a loan. This may lead <b>drastically</b> to the reduction in bank rates on loans since the banks can establish whether they are already servicing a loan from another bank which {{will result in a}} reduction in the incidents of bad debts.|$|E
5|$|Early COBOL compilers were {{primitive}} and slow. A 1962 US Navy evaluation found compilation speeds of 3–11 statements per minute. By mid-1964, they had increased to 11–1000 statements per minute. It was observed that increasing memory would <b>drastically</b> increase speed and that compilation costs varied wildly: costs per statement were between $0.23 and $18.91.|$|E
5|$|Elephants, lions, buffalo, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, giraffes, antelopes, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, {{and many}} species of snakes are found here, {{although}} most large carnivore populations have been <b>drastically</b> reduced since the early 20th century. Elephant poaching, particularly {{in the south of}} the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem. The small group of surviving West African crocodiles in the Ennedi Plateau represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} storm had {{weakened}} <b>drastically</b> by this time, Tess killed 37people in Vietnam, destroyed thousands of homes, and inflicted $11million in damage. Following Tess, Philippine President Corazon Aquino visited the provinces of Pangasinan and Pampanga, both situated {{to the north of}} Manila to tour damaged areas, distribute relief, aid and inaugurate an infrastructure project. A mere few days after Tess, Typhoon Skip became the third cyclone to hit the archipelago in two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Freight {{trains to}} the various {{industrial}} companies along the line remained until the 1980s, when traffic sank <b>drastically.</b> From 1988, the line was closed from Foss-Eigeland, although the line from there to Ganddal was kept for use for a cement factory. Until 2001 only the three first kilometers (two first miles) of the line were used, for transport of concrete structures, but then the Norwegian National Rail Administration stopped all traffic on the line.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics of populations undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can <b>drastically</b> affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies <b>drastically,</b> and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from quantum field theory, eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, {{the use of}} cyclodienes as seed {{dressings}} for autumn-sown cereals {{was banned}} in 1975 and the levels of the chemicals present in the bird population began to fall. The population has largely recovered to pre-decline levels, with an increase seen in many areas, for example northern Europe. In Sweden, the population also decreased <b>drastically</b> from the 1950s, but recovered again once organochlorines were banned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|More than 340 Eagle Boys {{stores were}} {{operating}} across Australia at the pizza chain's peak, in 2013. Outlet numbers fell <b>drastically</b> {{between the end}} of 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. At July2014, Eagle Boys was the third largest pizza chain in Australia, with 12% share of Australia's pizza market. By the end of 2014, Eagle Boys' visitation rate dropped below that of Crust Pizza, and fewer than 130 stores remained open.|$|E
5|$|New Orleans {{was settled}} on a natural high ground along the Mississippi River. Later {{developments}} that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into {{the interior of the}} city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower <b>drastically.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could <b>drastically</b> alter the climate in some regions of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E
5|$|On 29 October Banksy's art was {{displayed}} in a shop window, unbeknownst to the owners. Banksy had purchased a very basic painting of a landscape, added his own special touch {{in the form of}} a Nazi in full uniform resting on a bench and enjoying the view, and donated it back to the store, <b>drastically</b> increasing their patronage for the day.|$|E
5|$|Rankings tend to {{concentrate}} on representing MBA schools themselves, but some schools offer MBA programs of different qualities and yet the ranking will only rely upon information from the full-time program (e.g., a school may use highly reputable faculty to teach a daytime program, but use adjunct faculty in its evening program or have <b>drastically</b> lower admissions criteria for its evening program than for its daytime program).|$|E
5|$|Robert Johnson was Vin Lanana's first hire, {{originally}} to lead throws, hurdles, and sprints, then in 2009, {{was named}} the associate head coach for women's track. The University of Oregon was historically known for its rich tradition in distance running but had never been known for sprinting. Robert Johnson <b>drastically</b> transformed this during his tenure.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{week after}} Agitos release, it was {{announced}} that the game had 500,000 registered users in Japan. By November of that year, the figure had expanded to one million players. Later, Touch Arcade reported that active player numbers had dropped <b>drastically</b> after long-term poor impressions.|$|E
5|$|The drop in export {{is caused}} by the loss of {{competitiveness}} against other major export countries including Japan and Germany, where the currency had been <b>drastically</b> devalued during the previous quantitative easing operations. It sparked a new round of devaluation among Asian currencies, including the Vietnam dong and the Kazakhstan tenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band had a {{tendency}} to change <b>drastically</b> between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as {{part of the reason for}} these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.|$|E
5|$|The rare floods that do {{break free}} of the dams and weirs of the Murray-Darling system have their {{magnitude}} and duration deliberately curtailed by river regulators. Increasing research indicates this management practice is very harmful and <b>drastically</b> reduces the general ecosystem benefits and breeding and recruitment opportunities for Murray cod and other Murray-Darling native fish species these now rare floods can provide.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that <b>drastically</b> undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at State Junior High School 1 in Surabaya, Estianty took up modelling; in 1990 she won the Yess Modelling Competition for Teenagers, which {{provoked}} a number of modelling offers. She also began working part-time at a radio station and learned {{how to be a}} disc jockey. At a birthday party while in junior high school, a friend introduced her to Ahmad Dhani; Estianty and Dhani began writing songs for the piano together. Having received good marks in elementary school and junior high school, while in senior high school she began dating, first with a classmate then with Dhani, and her scores dropped <b>drastically.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing {{the mouth of the}} Rio Grande by early on October3. The storm is estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure area to the north, it slowed <b>drastically</b> and recurved sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by <b>drastically</b> cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, <b>drastically</b> reducing fire intervals and resulting in the disappearance of the species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
5|$|Before long, Nerva's {{expenses}} strained {{the economy}} of Rome and, although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by Syme, necessitated {{the formation of a}} special commission of economy to <b>drastically</b> reduce expenditures. The most superfluous religious sacrifices, games and horse races were abolished, while new income was generated from Domitian's former possessions, including the auctioning of ships, estates, and even furniture. Large amounts of money were obtained from Domitian's silver and gold statues, and Nerva forbade that similar images be made in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} <b>drastically</b> altered the game. Checkmate became a {{requirement}} to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} <b>drastically</b> altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager to see its movie conclusion.|$|E
