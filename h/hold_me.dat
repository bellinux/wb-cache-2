5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when you touch me like this, and you <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E

She appeared in a television commercial for the program, featuring students from Darcy Road Primary School in Wentworthville, New South Wales. Later that month, it was announced that Coulter was the new Australian face for international cosmetics brand CoverGirl, replacing model Jennifer Hawkins who had been with the brand since 2006.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, {{under the}} name Puff Daddy, Combs {{recorded}} his first commercial vocal work as a rapper. His debut single, [...] "Can't Nobody <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Down", spent 28 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number one. His debut album, No Way Out, was released on July 1, 1997, through Bad Boy Records. Originally titled Hell up in Harlem, the album underwent several changes after The Notorious B.I.G. was killed on March 9, 1997. Several of the label's artists made guest appearances on the album. No Way Out was a significant success, particularly in the United States, where it reached {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 in its first week of release, selling 561,000 copies. The album produced five singles: [...] "I'll Be Missing You", a tribute to The Notorious B.I.G., was the first rap song to debut at number one on the Billboard Hot 100; it remained {{at the top of the}} chart for eleven consecutive weeks and topped several other charts worldwide. Four other singles; [...] "Can't Nobody <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Down", [...] "It's All About the Benjamins", [...] "Been Around the World", and [...] "Victory", were also released. Combs collaborated with Jimmy Page on the song [...] "Come with Me" [...] for the 1998 film Godzilla.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you <b>hold</b> <b>me,</b> and you love me..." [...] That {{was the last thing}} you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is a {{departure}} from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: [...] "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." [...] The hook continues this metaphor: [...] "So shine bright, tonight, you and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [...] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as [...] "I choose to be happy" [...] and [...] "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line [...] "When you <b>hold</b> <b>me,</b> I'm alive", and admits [...] "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, [...] "When you <b>hold</b> <b>me,</b> I'm alive," [...] and [...] "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." [...] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} that {{a close friend}} of hers was dealing with issues in her romantic life, Oh Land took it upon herself to write a song that had the power to liberate the friend. However, she forgot about the track until that friend reminded the singer of it nearly an entire year later. Oh Land completed recording the song and decided to include it on Earth Sick. Acknowledging the clichés in the pre-chorus, Michael Cragg remarked that they [...] "somehow sound enriching". The lyrics feature encouraging and helpful mantras: [...] "No heavy rain's going to <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> down any more". The chorus consists of the phrase [...] "high up" [...] sung repeatedly.|$|E
500|$|Clayton has sung on some occasions, {{including}} on {{the song}} [...] "Endless Deep", the B-side {{to the single}} [...] "Two Hearts Beat As One" [...] from 1983. Clayton also sang backup vocals on [...] "I Will Follow" [...] during live performances in 1983 and 1984. He also spoke the last verse of [...] "Your Blue Room". Clayton can be heard speaking on [...] "Tomorrow ('96 Version)" [...] (a rerecording of [...] "Tomorrow" [...] that he arranged) a song from U2's 1981 album October. He plays the guitar on a few occasions, most notably the song [...] "40", where he and guitarist The Edge switch instruments. He also plays the keyboards on [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] and [...] "Iris (<b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Close)".|$|E
500|$|On August 18, 1938, police {{magistrate}} A. H. Gibson, who had {{presided over the}} prosecution of Unwin and Powell, was dismissed without cause by provincial Order in Council. Gibson believed that his dismissal was due to [...] "the government's resentment over my action in the Powell-Unwin case {{and the fact that}} they <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> more or less to blame for the fact that the accused men were sent to jail." [...] Aberhart's Social Crediters were re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1940 provincial election; Aberhart remained premier until his 1943 death. Unwin was defeated in 1940 by Labour candidate Angus James Morrison. Though he lived until January 4, 1987, Unwin remains most remembered for his involvement in the Bankers' Toadies incident.|$|E

500|$|Since 2013, Murphy {{has played}} {{the lead role}} in the BBC {{television}} series Peaky Blinders, a series about a criminal gang in post WW1 Birmingham. He explained his enthusiasm for the show {{in an interview with}} The Independent: [...] " [...] were so compelling and confident, and the character was so rich and complex, layered and contradictory. I was like, 'I have to do this.'" [...] Peaky Blinders was critically praised and a ratings success. A second series began broadcasting on the BBC in October 2014. Also in 2013, Murphy made his directorial debut with a music video for the band Money's single <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Forever. The video features dancers from the English National Ballet and was filmed at The Old Vic Theatre in London.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles signed Epstein's first {{management}} contract, but Epstein did not. He {{later told}} Taylor, [...] "Well, {{if they ever}} want to tear it up, they can <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> but I can't hold them". (Note: English law would have enforced the contract through the doctrine of part performance). The contract stated that Epstein would receive a management commission of 25 per cent of the group's gross income after a certain financial threshold had been reached. The Beatles argued for a smaller percentage, but Epstein pointed {{out that he had}} been paying their expenses for months without receiving anything in return. On 1 October 1962, four days before the release of [...] "Love Me Do", Epstein signed Lennon and McCartney to a three-year NEMS publishing contract.|$|E
500|$|Though {{many critics}} and fans saw Revenge of the Sith as the strongest {{of the three}} prequels, some saw it as more or less on par with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. Much of the {{criticism}} for the film was directed towards the dialogue, particularly the film's romantic scenes, and for Hayden Christensen's performance (which won him his second Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor). Critics and fans alike were quick to jump on such lines as [...] "Hold me, Ani. <b>Hold</b> <b>me,</b> like you did by the lake on Naboo...where {{there was nothing but}} our love..." [...] Critics have claimed this demonstrated Lucas's weakness as a writer of dialogue, a subject with which Lucas openly agreed when receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Film Institute.|$|E

500|$|Staff from E! Online seemed {{impressed}} with the video's concept and choice of background scenery. They said [...] "what better place for some introspection than the desert, right? No sexy bikini-clad ladies or blue-haired Nicki Minajs to distract you, and when you're done, just call up the helicopter {{to pick you up}} (Pro tip: Hang your leg outside of the chopper for extra cool points.)". Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said [...] "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's – then Puff Daddy – first solo video, [...] "Can't Nobody <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Down," [...] which featured him and Mase introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert." [...] While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single [...] "Been Around the World", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed with the number of videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.|$|E
500|$|... "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft {{beat with}} piano accompaniment." [...] Written during a {{difficult}} time in Carey's personal life, the song boasts inspirational lyrics of self-worth and achievement. The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register. The track opens with Mill, whose verse quickly sums up {{the theme of the}} track: [...] "The only way {{to make it to the}} top is if you go and get it from the bottom ... I remember they said that it ain't my turn/ Just look at me now/ Try to <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> down, but I ain't gonna stop/ 'Cause I'm gonna climb to the mountaintop." [...] During the song's chorus, Carey sings of not being able to be torn down by others and [...] "staying triumphant", before continuing: [...] "Don't let 'em ever count you out/ Realize all things are possible/ In your heart who's the greatest/ Reach for the stars/ Be all that you are." ...|$|E
500|$|Opening track [...] "The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)" [...] pays {{tribute to}} Joey Ramone, the Ramones' lead singer who was {{particularly}} influential on Bono. During their teenage years, U2 snuck into a Ramones concert, {{and the experience of}} watching Joey perform made Bono feel less self-conscious about his own singing. [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] is about the difficulty of [...] "giv yourself completely to another person", with lyrical characters who are [...] "addicted to sort of failure and rebirth". [...] "California (There Is No End to Love)" [...] recalls the group's first visit to Los Angeles and how the city contrasted with their native Dublin. [...] "Song for Someone" [...] is a love song Bono wrote for his wife Ali Hewson, who he met when they were teenagers. [...] "Iris (<b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Close)" [...] is written about Bono's mother, Iris, who died after suffering a cerebral aneurysm at her father's funeral when Bono was 14 years old. The lyrics liken her influence over her son to a star that died long ago but whose light is still reaching earth. Bono rewrote the song's lyrics after reading a letter that journalist James Foley wrote in captivity to his family prior to his being killed by ISIS; the letters made Bono realize that [...] "we will all be remembered by the least-profound moments. The simplest moments." ...|$|E
