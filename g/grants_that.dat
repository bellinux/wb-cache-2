5|$|During November 2002, Metropolitan Partners filed a grant {{request to}} the West Virginia Economic Development Grant Committee. It {{received}} $10.6 million in infrastructure improvements.

5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1749, Benning Wentworth, New Hampshire's governor, was selling land grants {{in the area}} west of the Connecticut River, to which New Hampshire had always laid {{somewhat}} dubious claim. Many of these grants were sold at relatively low prices to land speculators, with some land kicked back to Wentworth. In 1764, King George issued an order resolving the competing claims of New York and New Hampshire in favor of New York. New York, which had also issued land <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> overlapped some of those sold by Wentworth, insisted that holders of the Wentworth grants pay a fee to New York to have their grants validated. As this fee approached the original purchase price, {{and many of the}} holders were land-rich and cash-poor, {{there was a great deal}} of resistance to this demand. By 1769 the situation in the Grants had deteriorated to the point where surveyors and other figures of New York authority were being physically threatened and driven from the area.|$|E
5|$|As secretary, Zahorchak {{implemented}} {{state funding}} for pre-kindergarten and full-day kindergarten, training for principals, and easier ways to transfer college credits from one school to another. He has managed $200million in Accountability Block <b>Grants</b> <b>that</b> {{were used for}} tutoring, math and literacy coaching, and led the development of Pennsylvania Inspired Leadership, a legislative initiative to develop and support educational leaders in the state. In 2008, Rendell and Zahorchak unveiled the first new school funding formula in about two decades, which set out to more fair than previous formulas and better meet {{the specific needs of}} individual school districts. The formula would give more money to districts with large numbers of children living in poverty. Other factors considered under the formula were cost of living, district size, enrollment growth and the number of students learning to speak English. The formula originally called for increasing Pennsylvania education spending by $2.6billion over the next six years, starting with an additional $291million in 2008–09, although the final budget passed by the state reduced that expenditure to $274million.|$|E

But we can have but little hope for him; it is but too probable that he was put to death with his brother, within five years {{of the time when}} St. Paul warned him of judgment to come,--too probable that that was his last chance of salvation, and that he threw it away for ever, as too many sinners do.|$|R

5|$|In February 1223, Maulay {{forfeited}} Upavon to the king. This {{was part}} of a string of confiscations that struck at supporters of des Roches, including William de Cantilupe, Breauté, and Robert de Vieuxpont, by taking back <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> had been made earlier and which were held at the king's will. The seizures were made to teach the nobles a lesson and curb their dissension from the royal government, which was in the hands of Roches' rival de Burgh. Most of the manors, including Upavon, were returned to their previous holders in April after a settlement between de Burgh and those who resented his government. Around this time Maulay began work on Mulgrave Castle, in Yorkshire, which {{was part of}} his wife's inheritance. In June and July 1224, Maulay was present at on the royal side at the siege of Bedford Castle, which was held by de Breauté against the government. In 1225 Maulay claimed that he had sworn to King John that he would not give up custody of the royal castles until after John's son came of age. Maulay lost Upavon to the king again in 1229, with the king regranting Upavon to Gilbert Basset. This grant to Basset was by charter, with the lands to be held in fee. Maulay claimed that he only gave up his tenure because of threats by de Burgh.|$|E
5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E

25|$|The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway , often {{referred}} to as the Santa Fe or AT, was one of the larger railroads in the United States. Chartered in February 1859, the railroad reached the Kansas-Colorado border in 1873 and Pueblo, Colorado, in 1876. To create a demand for its services, the railroad set up real estate offices and sold farm land from the land <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> it was awarded by Congress. Despite the name, its main line never served Santa Fe, New Mexico, as the terrain was too difficult; the town ultimately was reached by a branch line from Lamy.|$|E
25|$|The {{colony of}} Queensland {{came into being}} on 6 June 1859, when it was {{established}} as a separate entity from New South Wales. The task of raising a military force for the new colony was commenced shortly after this and the first formation, a troop of mounted rifles, was established in early 1860. Together {{with a small amount}} of infantry and artillery, the colony's military forces totalled about 250 men at this time, who were based primarily in Brisbane and Ipswich. Although they were maintained through the volunteer system, these soldiers were partially paid through a system of subsidies and <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> were provided to enable them to buy the equipment and ammunition required to perform their duties. In 1867, the Spring Hill and Fortitude Valley Volunteer Rifle Corps was raised.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of grants of representation, each one designed to cover a particular circumstance. The most common cover the two most common situations—either the deceased died leaving a valid will or they did not. If someone left a valid will, it is more than likely that the grant is a grant of probate. If there was no will, the grant required {{is likely to be a}} grant of administration. There are many other <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> can be required in certain circumstances, and many have technical Latin names, but the general public is most likely to encounter grants of probate or administration. If an estate has a value of less than £5,000.00 or if all assets are held jointly and therefore pass by survivorship, for example to a surviving spouse, a grant is not usually required.|$|E
