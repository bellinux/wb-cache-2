The mobile phase {{was a mixture of}} acetonitrile or methanol and a buffer solution (pH= 4. 5) of sodium acetate (0. 02 M) and acetic acid. Seven amines with different chemical structures were added respectively into the buffer solution in order to modify the peak tailing and retention behavior of the compounds analyzed. Significant improvement in peak shape and retention time of basic drugs was observed by adding some amines, while in the case of their degradated acids these properties were not modified. Triethylamine was chosen to analyze all the pharmaceuticals studied in this work except for <b>drofenine</b> where di-n-butylamine appeared the best amine...|$|E
