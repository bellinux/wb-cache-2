App., 1978) that the November 1974 zoning regulations had been properly adopted <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{fit with the}} NCPC's master plan.

Then, in an unrelated case, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals issued a ruling on December 2 regarding zoning on Capitol Hill. The D.C. appellate court held that the D.C.

The GCA immediately refiled with the superior court, citing the Capitol Hill case and seeking to overturn the November 1974 zoning regulations.|$|E

For his part, Moscovici was in contact with centrist newspaper proprietors such as Grigore Filipescu, who wanted to organize their own solidarity strike against censorship. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not take part in organizing the actual workers' strike, the PS men were immediately identified as culprits by the authorities, who amassed a Chasseurs' Regiment around the Sfântul Ionică building. It was at that moment, on December 26, that Moscovici and other moderates took the initiative, and sent couriers at factories throughout the city, calling union men to leave their stations and rally on the army-occupied street.|$|E

At 2 A.M. she was awakened when more than forty armed policemen and National Guardsmen showed up at her doorstep. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not have a search warrant they {{proceeded}} to search the house, and confiscated her papers and speeches.

The police claimed that their actions were justified under the provisions of the Gag Law (Law 53) of Puerto Rico, known as the Ley de la Mordaza. Reynolds was taken into custody along with Carmen María Pérez Roque and Olga Viscal Garriga. She was held for various days at police headquarters before she was transferred to La Princesa Prison.|$|E
25|$|On 13 August 1689 William's army under Marshal Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg {{landed at}} Ballyholme Bay in County Down and, after {{capturing}} Carrickfergus, marched unopposed to Dundalk. James's viceroy Tyrconnell, commanding the main Jacobite army, blocked Schomberg's passage southwards {{but did not}} give battle. The two armies remained encamped opposite each other in cold, wet weather for several weeks before they withdrew to winter quarters. The Williamites lost several thousand men from disease in this campaign, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not fight a single major engagement with the Jacobites. Moreover, they found themselves harassed throughout the winter of 1689 and in the following two years by Irish Catholic guerrillas known as rapparees. Schomberg's troops continued to die from disease in their winter quarters because of the harsh weather and poor food supplies. The lack of food was partly from bad management, {{but also because the}} Jacobites devastated the countryside as they retreated.

Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment.

However, in 1992, the IUPAC Trans-fermium Working Group (TWG) officially recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium, concluding that while the 1961 Berkeley experiments were an important step to lawrencium's discovery, they were not yet completely convincing; and while the 1965, 1968, and 1970 Dubna experiments {{came very close to}} the needed level of confidence taken together, only the 1971 Berkeley experiments, which clarified and confirmed previous observations, finally resulted in complete confidence in {{the discovery of}} element 103. Because the name [...] "lawrencium" [...] had been in use for a long time by this point, it was retained by IUPAC, and in August 1997, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) ratified the name lawrencium and the symbol [...] "Lr" [...] during a meeting in Geneva.|$|E

500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] is a [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that is {{influenced}} by pop and R music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of G5. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D–Bm7–G–A. [...] The song features a [...] "double voice" [...] effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone {{throughout the rest of}} the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her lover.

500|$|The {{doctrine}} of substantive legitimate expectation {{has not yet}} been explicitly acknowledged as part of Singapore law. In Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997), the Singapore Court of Appeal had to decide whether life imprisonment in the Penal Code meant imprisonment for 20 years, which was the prevailing understanding, or whether it meant imprisonment for the remaining period of the convicted person's natural life. The Court concluded that the latter interpretation was correct, but overruled the former interpretation prospectively such that it only took effect from the date of the judgment and did not apply to the appellant. One of the reasons the Court relied on for doing so was the administrative law {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation. It recognized that [...] "certain legitimate expectations could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not acquire the force of a legal right". Since for many years life imprisonment had been reckoned as 20 years' incarceration, this had given rise to a legitimate expectation according to which individuals had arranged their affairs. Thus, the Court ought to give effect to the expectation by prospectively overruling the prior interpretation. Nonetheless, the Court stated: [...] "e were not concerned with judicial review, nor were we deciding whether any claim of a legitimate expectation could estop the Prisons Department in future from applying the interpretation which we gave to life imprisonment. That was a separate matter which was not under consideration here." ...|$|E

500|$|Additional awards were {{presented}} to the British fleet: Nelson was awarded £2,000 (£ as of [...] ) a year for life by the Parliament of Great Britain and £1,000 per annum by the Parliament of Ireland, although the latter was inadvertently discontinued after the Act of Union dissolved the Irish Parliament. Both parliaments gave unanimous votes of thanks, each captain {{who served in the}} battle was presented with a specially minted gold medal and the first lieutenant of every ship engaged in the battle was promoted to commander. Troubridge and his men, initially excluded, received equal shares in the awards after Nelson personally interceded for the crew of the stranded Culloden, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not directly participate in the engagement. The Honourable East India Company presented Nelson with £10,000 (£ as of [...] ) in recognition of the benefit his action had on their holdings and the cities of London, Liverpool and other municipal and corporate bodies made similar awards. Nelson's own captains presented him with a sword and a portrait as [...] "proof of their esteem." [...] Nelson publicly encouraged this close bond with his officers and on 29 September 1798 described them as [...] "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers", echoing William Shakespeare's play Henry V. From this grew the notion of the Nelsonic Band of Brothers, a cadre of high-quality naval officers that served with Nelson for the remainder of his life. Nearly five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E
