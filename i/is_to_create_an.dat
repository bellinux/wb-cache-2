25|$|When in space, {{the purpose}} of a {{propulsion}} system is to change the velocity, or v, of a spacecraft. Because this is more difficult for more massive spacecraft, designers generally discuss momentum, mv. The amount of change in momentum is called impulse. So the goal of a propulsion method in space <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> impulse.|$|E
25|$|Lessig {{supports}} {{copyright laws}} but {{believes that there}} must be fundamental changes. If elected, he would convene an impartial Creative Rights Commission to create new copyright laws that allow more open access of information. He also has a similar proposal for an Invention Commission for changes to the current patent laws. His final proposal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> Innovation Council that reviews copyright and patent policies {{to make sure that they}} achieve their goals. Lessig has written several books on intellectual property, and in 2002 argued in front of the Supreme Court for copyright limitations.|$|E

500|$|Blumenthal's bacon-and-egg ice cream, {{now one of}} his {{signature}} dishes, along with his other unique flavours, has given him a reputation as [...] "The Wizard of Odd" [...] and has made his restaurant a magnet for food enthusiasts. In the 2006 New Years Honours List, Blumenthal was awarded Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE), the United Kingdom's fourth highest order of chivalry, for his services to food. Blumenthal has stated that one ambition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> ice cream with flavours released in time-separated stages; for example, bacon and egg followed by orange juice or tea. Once he perfects the technique of separating the flavours, he would attempt mussels followed by chocolate.|$|E

2500|$|A {{compiler}} is {{a computer}} program or set of programs that transforms source code written in a computerized source [...] language into another computer language often having a binary form known as an object code. The most common reason for wanting to transform source code <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> executable program. The first compiler written for the A-0 programming language is attributed to its inventor, Grace Hopper in 1949.|$|E

2500|$|One way to {{work around}} this problem, which works well when complex records (such as in a {{relational}} database) are being sorted by a relatively small key field, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> index into the array and then sort the index, rather than the entire array. (A sorted version of the entire array can then be produced with one pass, reading from the index, but often even that is unnecessary, as having the sorted index is adequate.) [...] Because the index is {{much smaller than the}} entire array, it may fit easily in memory where the entire array would not, effectively eliminating the disk-swapping problem. This procedure is sometimes called [...] "tag sort".|$|E
2500|$|According to Herbert Read, {{this has}} the effect of [...] "revealing the structure" [...] of the object, or of {{presenting}} fragments and facets of the object to be visually interpreted in different ways. Both of these effects transfer to sculpture. Although the artists themselves did not use these terms, the distinction between [...] "analytic cubism" [...] and [...] "synthetic cubism" [...] could also be seen in sculpture, writes Read (1964): [...] "In the analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque, the definite purpose of the geometricization of the planes is to emphasize the formal structure of the motif represented. In the synthetic Cubism of Juan Gris the definite purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> effective formal pattern, geometricization being a means to this end." ...|$|E
2500|$|Currently, {{there are}} plans to vacate and {{dismantle}} Eilat Airport due to the plans for Ramon Airport, and develop the area. The new Ramon Airport is expected to open in early 2018, [...] north of Eilat and replace both Eilat Airport and Ovda Airport. Hotels and apartment buildings, containing a total of 2,080 hotel rooms and 1,000 apartments will be constructed on the site, as well as 275 dunams of public space and pedestrian paths. The plans also set aside space for the railway line and an underground railway station. The plan's goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> urban continuum between the city center and North Beach, as well as tighten the links between the city's neighborhoods, which are currently separated by the airport.|$|E

Fortunately, the company has big plans {{for many of the}} current structures on the brewery property, with the hopes to attract businesses as well as River Walk tourists. [...] The dream of Silver Ventures is that once completed, the former brewery will be a village within eyesight of the skyscrapers of Downtown San Antonio. [...] In a local article, [...] Bill Shown, the development's managing director, described an area that would house an event hall, schools, and retail, office, and residential space. [...] The idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> area where people can live, shop, and work, yet a community close-knit enough where residents know the shop owners.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} {{a new version}} of Direct3D, called Direct3D 10. It adds scheduling and memory virtualization capabilities to the graphics subsystem and forgoes the current DirectX practice of using [...] "capability bits" [...] to indicate which features are active on the current hardware. Instead, Direct3D 10 defines a minimum standard of hardware capabilities which must be supported for a display system to be [...] "Direct3D 10 compatible". Microsoft's goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> environment for developers and designers where they can be assured that the input they provide will be rendered in exactly the same fashion on all supported graphics cards. This has been a recurring problem with the DirectX 9 model, where different video cards have produced different results, thus requiring fixes keyed to specific cards to be produced by developers.|$|E

2500|$|Humanistic {{psychology}} {{tends to}} look beyond the medical model of psychology in order to open up a nonpathologizing view of the person. This usually implies that the therapist downplays the pathological aspects of a person's life in favour of the healthy aspects. Humanistic psychology tries to be a science of human experience, focusing on the actual lived experience of persons. [...] Therefore, a key ingredient is the actual meeting of therapist and client and the possibilities for dialogue to ensue between them. The role of the therapist <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> environment where the client can freely express any thoughts or feelings; he does not suggest topics for conversation nor does he guide the conversation in any way. The therapist also does not analyze or interpret the client’s behavior or any information the client shares. The role of the therapist is to provide empathy and to listen attentively to the client.|$|E
2500|$|The leafy {{foliage of}} a grapevine's canopy will be {{dependent}} on the particular grape variety and its propensity for vigorous growth. These leaves emerge from shoots on the fruiting cane {{in a manner similar}} to the grape clusters themselves. A vine is described as [...] "vigorous" [...] if it has a propensity to produce many shoots that are outwardly observable as a large, leafy canopy. The ability of the grapevine to support such a large canopy is dependent on the health of its root system and storage of carbohydrates. If a vine does not have a healthy and extensive root system in proportion to its canopy, then it is being overly vigorous with parts of the vine (most notably the grape clusters) suffering due to lack of resources. While it may seem that more foliage would promote increased photosynthesis (and such carbohydrate production), this is not always the case since the leaves near the top of the canopy create excess shading that hinders photosynthesis in the leaves below. One of the objectives of vine training <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> [...] "open canopy" [...] that allows limited excess leaf growth and allows plenty of sunlight to penetrate the canopy.|$|E
60|$|Internationalism is in {{any case}} hostile to democracy. I do not say it is {{incompatible}} with it; but any {{combination of the two}} will be a compromise between the two. The only purely popular government is local, and founded on local knowledge. The citizens can rule the city because they know the city; but it will always be an exceptional sort of citizen who has or claims the right to rule over ten cities, and these remote and altogether alien cities. All Irishmen may know roughly the same sort of things about Ireland; but it is absurd to say they all know the same things about Iceland, when they may include a scholar steeped in Icelandic sagas or a sailor who has been to Iceland. To make all politics cosmopolitan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> aristocracy of globe-trotters. If your political outlook really takes in the Cannibal Islands, you depend of necessity upon a superior and picked minority {{of the people who have}} been to the Cannibal Islands; or rather of the still smaller and more select minority who have come back.|$|E
