In 1999, Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit, citing that it had a better sound than a new kit, and was cheaper. Coghill uses Avedis Zildjian cymbals. He says that he has been offered sponsorship, but opted for older drums as a matter of preference. Despite this assertion, as of 2007 Coghill's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster.|$|E

5|$|Hanneman's {{interest}} in German war medals and Nazi Germany was illustrated {{by many of}} his lyrics. Those interests in the Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS began with medals given to <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> father, including some taken from a dead German soldier. His most prized medal was his Knight's Cross, which he had bought from a Slayer fan for $1000. While touring with Motörhead, Hanneman discovered Motörhead vocalist Lemmy's {{interest in}} medals, and the two discussed medal designs, weapons and tactics used by the Wehrmacht.|$|E

5|$|James Device {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murders by {{witchcraft}} of Anne Townley and John Duckworth.

5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to Iraq {{to quell the}} Kharijites. Following Umar's death and the accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to deliver his provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E
5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had {{died when he was}} eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was highly intelligent, and a brilliant future was forecast for <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|During {{principal}} photography, Noonan {{asked that}} no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene. Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building {{to prepare for the}} role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels {{from the rest of the}} cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann.|$|E

5|$|Erison Hurtault {{competed for}} Dominica in the men's 400meters dash. In Beijing, Hurtault {{was the only}} Dominican {{participating}} in the event. Born in Matawan, a New Jersey suburb of New York, and attending Columbia University, Hurtault initially tried out for the United States Olympic team, but failed to qualify, before taking the berth offered to <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> parents' homeland. Hurtault was 23 {{at the time of}} his competition in Beijing, and had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the 17 August qualification round, the Dominican-American athlete was placed in the fourth heat. He finished in fourth place with a time of 46.10seconds, displacing Uruguay's Andres Bayron Silva (46.32seconds) but falling behind Jamaica's Ricardo Chambers (45.22seconds). The leaders of Hurtault's heat included Great Britain's Martyn Rooney (45.00seconds) and Australia's Sean Wroe (45.17seconds). Overall, he ranked 34th out of the 55 athletes who completed the qualification round of the event. Hurtault did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|His {{first study}} of {{mathematics}} began with papers by George Pólya {{and by the}} crystallographer Friedrich Haag on plane symmetry groups, sent to <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> brother Berend, a geologist. He carefully studied the 17 wallpaper groups, and created periodic tilings with 43 drawings {{of different types of}} symmetry. From this point on he developed a mathematical approach to expressions of symmetry in his art works using his own notation. Starting in 1937, he created woodcuts based on the 17 groups. His Metamorphosis I (1937) began a series of designs that told a story through the use of pictures. In Metamorphosis I, he transformed convex polygons into regular patterns in a plane to form a human motif. He extended the approach in his piece Metamorphosis III, which is four metres long.|$|E
5|$|Living a worldly {{life during}} the day, he {{reportedly}} spent his evenings in vigils and prayer, putting into practice {{the writings of}} two authors—Marcus Eremita and Diadochos of Photiki—that were given to <b>him</b> <b>by</b> <b>his</b> spiritual father. It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later {{in one of his}} Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to the prayers of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct personal experience of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E
