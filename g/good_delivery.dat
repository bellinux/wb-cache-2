25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a <b>good</b> <b>delivery,</b> two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
25|$|England’s bowlers {{worked hard}} {{throughout}} days 1 and 2, but {{were unable to}} replicate the successes they had previously achieved against India’s powerful batting line up. Dinesh Karthik continued his good form to score 91, and Rahul Dravid scored 55 before he was clean bowled by a <b>good</b> <b>delivery</b> from James Anderson. England’s cause was not helped by dropped catches from the wicketkeeper Matt Prior – first off Sachin Tendulkar {{when he was on}} 20, and then VVS Laxman when he was on 41. Tendulkar went on to make 82, and Laxman 51. Prior also conceded five lots of four byes on day 1, though some of these might conceivably have been signalled wide.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{continued}} their dominance throughout the second day. Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey {{continued their}} partnership, putting together 209. Flintoff finally took Hussey's wicket {{when he was}} on 86, bowled through the gate, with the off-stump out of the ground, when he had looked set for a century. Matthew Hoggard finally made a significant breakthrough in the afternoon, taking the wickets of Ponting (for 196) and Adam Gilchrist (for a duck) in the same over, both men out lbw. Gilchrist, in particular, was out to a ball bowled from around the wicket from the right-arm bowler Hoggard, a continuation of England's tactics against him in the 2005 Ashes series, which had restricted him to a top score of 49*. Ponting's 196 allowed him to surpass Graham Gooch as the seventh highest Test runscorer of all time (Gooch scored 8900 runs). Michael Clarke crafted a solid 56 before falling to James Anderson, edging a <b>good</b> <b>delivery</b> to slip. Australia's tail wagged, with Brett Lee scoring 43 and Stuart Clark hitting a quick-fire 39 off 23 balls before having his leg stump knocked out of the ground by Flintoff. His innings included two huge sixes off the bowling of James Anderson, who ended the innings with figures of 141 runs for just one wicket. Australia were able to declare their innings with the score 9/602 after tea.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{research}} is to develop models to understand the marginal impacts on emissions and vehicle miles traveled for <b>goods</b> <b>delivery</b> under various logistics scenarios. Generalized models and heuristics help develop the intuition to understand the interactions between <b>goods</b> <b>delivery</b> strategy decisions and the environmental impacts within {{the constraints of the}} transportation system. These types of models have some benefits over traditional analysis techniques, including high level indications of the most important factors to consider when vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and emissions reduction are of concern.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{paper is}} aimed {{to analyze the}} {{functioning}} of the existing railway informational system, as the data storage, consideration of the ways to changeover to intelligent management system, including the application of semantic approach. It is necessary to change the paradigm of automated traffic management; this determines changing the paradigm in railway operation management. The development and introduction of new Business-Intelligence-type system requires the formalized knowledge on railway transportation process to be implemented, including in the form of ontology as the model and means to formalize the knowledge. New knowledge requires using the terms and concepts to describe the new processes and management objects in railway operations. Methodology. Formalizing the knowledge one should abstract away from classical definitions such as marshaling or freight station, train station, division station, dead-end station, railway junction, railway hub etc. Unified Modeling Languages for engineering the automated systems use the definitions: the objects’ categories, the class diagrams, statechart diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, component diagrams, link diagrams in properties etc. These concepts enable formalizing the knowledge, bringing to homogeneous representing and using them for modeling the management processes of <b>goods</b> <b>delivery.</b> Findings. The data on timing the events of <b>goods</b> <b>delivery</b> process, breakings of schedule are taken into account in set-theoretical model on scripting scenarios for <b>goods</b> <b>delivery</b> process. One of the concepts in the model on breaking of schedule (from the knowledge base of the system ASK VPUZ-E enables {{to take into account the}} influence of possible factors and the real railway operations conditions.
