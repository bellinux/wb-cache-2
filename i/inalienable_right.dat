5|$|We {{believe that}} it is the <b>inalienable</b> <b>right</b> of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full {{opportunities}} of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E
5|$|The High Court quickly {{assembled}} at Nikli. Guy de la Roche {{presented himself}} before it {{accompanied by his}} own knights, but the assembled barons decided {{that they did not}} have the authority to judge him, and referred the matter to King Louis IX of France (r. 1226–1270). Guy travelled to France in 1259, but Louis not only pardoned him, but awarded him the title of Duke, which he and his successors were to bear thereafter. The renegade Geoffroy de Bruyères too was brought for judgement before William, and it was only the determined and passionate intercession of the other barons that saved his life and secured a pardon from the vengeful prince. He was however deprived of the possession of his domains by the <b>inalienable</b> <b>right</b> of conquest, and retained them henceforth as a gift from the Prince, meaning that they would be forfeit upon his death unless he had any immediate descendants.|$|E

500|$|Mary Dyer's time in England {{lasted for}} over five years, and during her stay {{she had become}} deeply taken by the Quaker {{religion}} established by George Fox around 1647. [...] Formally known as the Society of Friends, the Quakers {{did not believe in}} baptism, formal prayer and the Lord's Supper, nor did they believe in an ordained ministry. [...] Each member was a minister {{in his or her own}} right, women were essentially treated as men in matters of spirituality, and they relied on an [...] "Inner Light of Christ" [...] as their source of spiritual inspiration. [...] In addition to denouncing the clergy, and refusing to support it with their tithes, they also claimed liberty of conscience as an <b>inalienable</b> <b>right</b> and demanded the separation of church and state. [...] Their worship consisted of silent meditation, though those moved by the Spirit would at times make public exhortations. [...] They minimized the customs of bowing or men removing their hats, they would not take an oath, and they would not fight in wars. [...] The Puritans in Massachusetts viewed Quakers as being among the most reprehensible of heretics, and they enacted several laws against them.|$|E
500|$|Between July 16 and July 19, {{at home on}} her {{own writing}} desk, Stanton edited the grievances and resolutions. Henry Brewster Stanton, a lawyer, {{politician}} and Stanton's husband, helped substantiate the document by locating [...] "extracts from laws bearing unjustly against woman's property interests." [...] On her own, Stanton added a more radical point {{to the list of}} grievances and to the resolutions: the issue of women's voting rights. To the grievances, she added [...] "He has never permitted her to exercise her <b>inalienable</b> <b>right</b> to the elective franchise", and to the Sentiments, she added a line about man depriving woman of [...] "the elective franchise, thereby leaving her without representation in the halls of legislation..." [...] Stanton then copied the Declaration and resolutions into final draft form for presentation at the meeting. When he saw the addition of woman suffrage, Henry Stanton warned his wife [...] "you will turn the proceedings into a farce." [...] He, like most men of his day, was not in favor of women gaining voting rights. Because he intended to run for elective office, he left Seneca Falls to avoid being connected with a convention promoting such an unpopular cause. Elizabeth Cady Stanton asked her sister Harriet Cady Eaton to accompany her; Eaton brought her young son Daniel.|$|E
500|$|Partially as {{a result}} of his {{association}} with British Dissenters, Johnson became involved in publishing tracts and sermons in defence of the American revolutionaries. He began with Priestley's Address to Protestant Dissenters of All Denominations, on the Approaching Election of Members of Parliament (1774), which urged Dissenters to vote for candidates that guaranteed the American colonists their freedom. Johnson continued his series of anti-government, pro-American pamphlets by publishing Fast Day sermons by Joshua Toulmin, George Walker, Ebenezer Radcliff, and Newcome Cappe. Braithwaite describes these as [...] "well-articulated critiques of government" [...] that [...] "were not only unusual but potentially subversive and disruptive", and she concludes that Johnson's decision to publish so much of this material indicates that he supported the political position it espoused. Moreover, Johnson published what Braithwaite calls [...] "probably the most influential English defence of the colonists", Richard Price's Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty (1776). Over 60,000 copies were sold in a year. In 1780 Johnson also issued the first collected political works of Benjamin Franklin in England, a political risk as the American colonies were in rebellion by that time. Johnson did not usually reprint colonial texts—his ties to the revolution were primarily through Dissenters. Thus, the works published by Johnson emphasized both colonial independence and the rights for which Dissenters were fighting—"the right to petition for redress of grievance, the maintenance and protection of equal civil rights, and the <b>inalienable</b> <b>right</b> to liberty of conscience".|$|E

[...] Article 1, § 1 of the California Constitution recognizes <b>inalienable</b> <b>rights,</b> and articulated some (not all) of those rights as [...] "defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy." [...] However, there is still much dispute over which [...] "rights" [...] are truly natural rights and which are not, and the concept of natural or <b>inalienable</b> <b>rights</b> is still controversial to some.|$|R
