6000|$|Suppose, now, {{that you}} had a dog which would not be taught, or broken in, or cured of biting, or made useful, or bearable in any way, what would you do to that dog? I suppose that you would kill it; you would say: [...] "It is an ill-conditioned animal, and there is no making it any better; so the only thing is to put it out of the way, and not let it eat food which might be better spent." [...] Now, does God deal so with sinners? When young people rush headlong into sin, and become a {{nuisance}} to themselves and their neighbours, does God kill them at once, that better men may step into their place? No. And why? Just because they are not dumb animals, which cannot be made better, but God's children, who can be made better. If there were really no hope of a sinner repenting and amending, I think God would not leave him long alive to cumber the ground. But there is hope for every one; because God the Father loves all; the loving heart of the Lord Jesus Christ yearns after all; the Holy Spirit, which proceeds from the Father and the Son, strives with the hearts of all; therefore God, in His patience and tender mercy, tries to bring his foolish children to their senses. And how? Often in the very same way, in which Ezekiel says He tried to bring the Jews to their senses, by letting them go on in the road of sin, till they see what an ugly pit that same road ends in. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>child</b> would not believe you when you warned and assured him that the fire would burn him, would it not be the very best way of bringing him to his senses, to tell him: [...] "Very well; go your own way; put your hand into the fire, and see what comes of it; you will not believe me; you will believe your own feelings, when your hand is burnt." [...] So did the Lord to those rebellious Jews when they would go after their fathers' sins. He gave them statutes which were not good, and judgments by which they could not live, to the end that they might know that He was the Lord. God did not make them commit any sins. God forbid! He only took away His Spirit, His light and teaching, from them, and let them go on in the light of their own foolish and bewildered hearts, till their sin bred misery and shame to them, and they were filled with the fruit of their own devices. Then, after all their wealth was gone, and their land was wasted by cruel enemies, and they themselves were carried away captive into Babylon, they began to awake, and say to themselves: [...] "We were wrong after all, and the Lord was right. He knew what was really good for us better than we did. We thought that we could do without Him, disobey Him. But He is the Lord after all. He has been too strong for us; He has punished us. If we had listened to His warnings years ago, we might have been saved all this misery." ...|$|E

We are providing this information in the hope that parents will better understand the issues involved in this complex subject. This will help you make informed decisions about <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> health. <b>Your</b> <b>child’s</b> growth should be carefully tracked on a growth chart. The growth chart permits <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> height to be compared to that of a large population of normally growing <b>children.</b> For example, <b>if</b> <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> height is located on the growth chart at the 50 th percentile, this means that 50 %, or one half, of children of that age are taller than <b>your</b> <b>child</b> and 50 % of children of that age are shorter than <b>your</b> <b>child.</b> Normally growing children can be at any percentile on the growth chart.

In reality, however, we know that discipline is one of the necessary, if sometimes unpleasant, parts of our job as parents. When you discipline <b>your</b> <b>child,</b> you are teaching the right way to behave. This {{is an important part of}} child development. Children Need Discipline Children need discipline to protect them from danger, to learn how to get along with others, to learn acceptable and appropriate behavior, and to learn that society has certain common rules that everyone is expected to live by. Discipline also helps children learn to think in an orderly fashion and to understand the logical consequences of their actions. Most important, positive discipline helps a child learn self-control, which builds healthy self-esteem. Parents and School Discipline The discipline a child learns at home is the foun-dation for behavior at school. Be familiar with your school’s discipline policy. <b>If</b> <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> teacher reports a discipline problem, talk with <b>your</b> <b>child</b> and the teacher to work on a solution together. Discipline Tips for Parents ■ Emphasize “do’s ” rather than “don’ts. ” ■ Put limits on <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> behavior, but be careful not to make too many rules. ■ Be consistent. A predictable environment helps children to feel safe, since they know what to expect. ■ Keep a sense of humor. It helps you keep a proper perspective about what is really important. ■ Praise <b>your</b> <b>child’s</b> accomplishments. ■ Listen to <b>your</b> <b>child</b> and help him or her work through a problem. ■ Encourage independence.

That the modern child demonstrates such effortless and marked ease with electronic devices stymies adults even further.
