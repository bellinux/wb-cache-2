40|$|We {{report a}} method to profile the {{torsional}} spring properties of proteins {{as a function of}} the angle of rotation. The torque is applied by superparamagnetic particles and has been calibrated while taking account of the magnetization dynamics of the particles. We record and compare the torsional profiles of single Protein G-Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG-IgG complexes, sandwiched between a substrate and a superparamagnetic particle, for torques in the range between 0. 5 × 103 and 5 × 103 pN·nm. Both molecular systems show torsional stiffening for increasing rotation angle, but the elastic and <b>inelastic</b> <b>torsion</b> stiffnesses are remarkably different. We interpret the results in terms of the structural properties of the molecules. The torsion profiling technique opens new dimensions for research on biomolecular characterization and for research on bio-nanomechanical structure-function relationships...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the elastic-plastic uniform torsion {{analysis}} of composite cylindrical bars of arbitrary cross-section consisting of materials in contact, {{each of which}} can surround {{a finite number of}} inclusions, taking into account the effect of geometric nonlinearity is presented employing the boundary element method. The stress-strain relationships for the materials are assumed to be elastic-plastic-strain hardening. The incremental torque-rotation relationship is computed based on the finite displacement (finite rotation) theory, that is the transverse displacement components are expressed so as to be valid for large rotations and the longitudinal normal strain includes the second-order geometric nonlinear term often described as the "Wagner strain". The proposed formulation does not stand on the assumption of a thin-walled structure and therefore the cross-section's torsional rigidity is evaluated exactly without using the so-called Saint Venant's torsional constant. The torsional rigidity of the cross-section is evaluated directly employing the primary warping function of the cross-section depending on both its shape and the progress of the plastic region. A boundary value problem with respect to the aforementioned function is formulated and solved employing a BEM approach. The influence of the second Piola-Kirch-hoff normal stress component to the plastic/elastic moment ratio in uniform <b>inelastic</b> <b>torsion</b> is demonstrated. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|UnrestrictedTo {{evaluate}} inelastic torsional {{response of}} buildings due to different parameters such as unsymmetrical distribution of mass or lateral load resisting {{elements in the}} plan of the structure or inelastic behavior of resisting elements and loss of the resistance of such an element during an earthquake, a full three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analysis is a powerful tool to evaluate such a nonlinear response.; The results of nonlinear dynamic analyses of two actual steel moment frame buildings that were damaged during the 1994 Northridge earthquake are subjected to recorded ground motions from the Northridge and Loma Prieta earthquakes. The importance of different parameters such as discontinuity of lateral resisting elements (setbacks), unsymmetrical distribution of mass or resistance in the plan of structure, intensity and frequency content of the earthquake ground motions, accidental eccentricity as prescribed by code {{and the effect of}} geometric nonlinearity (P-Delta) on the inelastic lateral-torsional response of the structures is discussed. Response parameters considered include lateral story displacement, Interstory drift index, plastic hinge rotation demand and torsional rotation of each floor.; The analysis procedures use three-dimensional nonlinear dynamic analytical models developed for the PERFORM 3 -D computer program.; Study of the results for different models with different eccentricities clearly shows the effect of <b>inelastic</b> <b>torsion</b> in comparison with elastic torsion on the response of structures. The torsional rotation of floors considered as a main parameter of the torsional response of the building has an average increase of 30 to 60 percent for material nonlinearity. By adding geometric nonlinearity (P-Delta), this increases to as much as 70 to 100 percent of elastic torsional rotation. This clearly shows the inelastic torsional response of structures may be significantly underestimated by a linear dynamic analysis, especially for large value of mass or stiffness eccentricity and intensity of the ground motion...|$|E
40|$|The {{last years}} have seen a few severe cases of {{structural}} damage to buildings in the Netherlands. A recent case was the shopping mall ‘t Loon in Heerlen. It would be beneficial if structural failures could be avoided, or at least be predicted. New satellite technology, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), proves {{that it is possible}} to detect structural deformation in buildings at the level of millimeters and to receive weekly updates. TU Delft has shown that for the Heerlen case, the deformation could already be detected years before the collapse. The InSAR data was also used for forensic research at Heerlen. The previously discussed developments resulted in the main research question of this thesis: How can InSAR data contribute to forensic engineering and building monitoring in general? The objective is to determine in which cases data provided by radar interferometry can be used, and how this data should be interpreted for building monitoring and forensic engineering. A literature review is conducted to identify the general properties and limitations of InSAR. To research the potential contribution to forensic engineering, an analysis of a damage database is made to determine InSAR’s potential as a forensic engineering tool. The database is assessed according to the guiding principles of forensic engineering using InSAR as laid out by this thesis: opportunistic character, large deformations and no sudden deformations. A research methodology for forensic engineering with InSAR is proposed and tested with a couple of case studies. Building monitoring is subdivided into object-driven building monitoring and data-driven building monitoring. Conventional building monitoring techniques are analysed to research the potential of InSAR as a building monitoring tool. To research object-driven building monitoring, a literature study is conducted to examine the different variables that cause building movement that influence the InSAR data. One dominant variable is analysed to research the relation between a variable and the InSAR data. To research data-driven buildings monitoring, general building limits for deformations are discussed. InSAR data of Delft, provided by the TerraSAR-x satellite, is used to analyse the potential of InSAR as a data-driven building monitoring tool. Deformation areas with very high deformation rates are examined to find out how to work with InSAR as a data-driven building monitoring tool. ? The development of the movements caused by <b>torsion,</b> <b>inelastic</b> deformation, fracture, second order effects and buckling are hard to detect with InSAR. Deformation caused by failure needs to be visible on the outer shell of the structure. Damage on the outer shell is visible to InSAR, as are damages that influence the supporting structure of the building. Deformations of the supporting structure can be damped in the outer shell; this is caused by the structural integrity. One fifth of the damage cases of the damage database have potential to be researched with InSAR. Only failures caused by aging and structural errors were suitable for research. Deformation measurements for buildings is one of the building monitoring fields in which InSAR can compete. Competitors in this field are Lidar, photogrammetry, levelling, and tachymetry. One of the main advantages of monitoring with InSAR is that large areas can be monitored with one measurement, and no one needs to be present at the site. Object-driven monitoring of buildings can be done by monitoring a building and identifying explanations for building movements. The movement of a Persistent Scatter point (PS-point) is caused by forces that work on a building and by the resistance of the building. Forces that do not change over time will not make the building move, unless there is degradation of the building elements. InSAR measurements are most suitable for vertical deflection monitoring because of the sensitivity of the satellite measurements. Factors that are suitable to monitor with InSAR are temperature, settlement and groundwater change. Data-driven monitoring is most suitable for monitoring foundation problems. The movements are often gradual over time, and large deformations limits are allowed. Attention should be paid to the translation of the top structure of the movement. Movements of 3 mm/year of a PS-point in vertical direction, or 1. 5 mm/year relative to another PS-point on a building, are alarming. InSAR can become an addition to conventional monitoring techniques for building research. For forensic engineering InSAR can indicate which parts of building elements were influenced by the failure, and when deformation started to develop. InSAR can support evidence for the possible cause of the failure, when the failure is expressed in deformation. For building monitoring InSAR may support the indication of the development of deformation that may cause damage. The monitoring of vertical deformations is limited by the sensitivity and the phase ambiguity. These boundaries make InSAR most suitable for monitoring gradual deformations, often found in deformations of foundations.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} inelastic local {{buckling}} of I-beam flanges made of steel. The main {{focus is on}} the theoretical description of the buckling process, and the influence of various parameters, e. g. the plastic modulus, yield plateau, yield stress etc., on the buckling process. In the thesis, discussion on the relevancy of different constitutive models for the inelastic behaviour of steel are discussed, and a theoretical model for the inelastic local flange buckling is presented. In the theoretical models of the inelastic local buckling problem presented in the past, there has been quite some confusion about what constitutive model is applicable. The incremental theory has been applied by some, the deformation theory of plasticity has been used by others also relatively recently, and the theory of Lay has been used by others. In this thesis, it is concluded that the incremental theory of plasticity based on an isotropically hardening von Mises yield surface in combination with the associated flow rule is applicable for the modelling of inelastic local flange buckling. The theory of Lay is concluded nonvalid. A simple slip plane theory which in distinction to the mathematical theory of plasticity is based on the physical mechanism of plastic deformation, and in its present form valid for a subspace of stress containing shear and normal stress, has been developed in the thesis. This slip plane theory is in good agreement with the incremental theory of plasticity. For the modelling of the flange buckling, the buckling process is assumed to consist of three phases without any distinct borders in between. The first phase is considered related to mainly torsional deformations and can hence be seen as a torsional buckling phase. The second phase is associated with progressively lesser shear stiffness of the material and plate bending is introduced. In the third phase, the shear stiffness is wiped out and plate bending is assumed to resist the buckling entirely. The first phase is modelled as the inelastic torsional buckling of a thin plate, restrained so as to avoid any other instability mode. This includes the description of the <b>inelastic</b> <b>torsion</b> of a thin plate. For that purpose, the plate is assumed to be composed of an infinite number of rectangular hollow cross sections. This first phase mainly governs the buckling stress and the ductility of the flange. Herein, the term ductility is used for deformation capacity in general, and hence by ductility of a compressed flange is ment the amount of axial shortening during which the flange is able to resist a compressive mean stress equal to or exceeding the yield stress. The second phase is not considered in the modelling. Instead, the first phase is directly followed by the third phase in the model. In this third phase, the flange buckle is considered as a yield line mechanism. In this yield line buckle model, the effect of stress redistribution is accounted for. The two models are linked together to a unified model and hence this model is able to approximately describe the mean stress-mean strain relation of a locally buckling flange. Using this model, a parametric study is performed in order to investigate the dependence of the flange buckling behaviour on various parameters. It is concluded that parameters like the plastic modulus, length of yield plateau, initial imperfections, and residual stresses have only a relatively moderate effect on the buckling process. Quite naturally, the parameters that has the most effect on the buckling behaviour is the width to thickness ratio and the yield stress. However, according to the procedure in the codes, these parameters are combined in the definition of a so called slenderness parameter, defined as the square root of the yield stress over the critical stress. Hence this parameter is in the codes assumed as the only governing parameter with respect to local buckling. The parameter study however reveals this approach as not entirely correct. From the theoretical model, it seems like this approach is unfavourable to high strength steel. In order to verify the conclusions from the theoretical modelling, experiments were made on crusiform stub columns. In all 22 specimen were compressed and the specimen were made of two materials, namely Weldox 700, with a nominal lower yield strength of 700 MPa and hence representing high strength steel, and SS 1312, with a nominal lower yield strength of 220 MPa thereby representing the ordinary steel grades. Hence for each material 11 stub columns with varying slenderness with respect to flange buckling were tested. The experimental results agreed fairly well with the results from the theoretical model.
