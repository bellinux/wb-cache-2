NY38 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, utilizing all of pre-1930 NY42, the Freeville–Moravia portion of NY26, and a previously unnumbered highway north to Sterling. Originally, NY38 extended south <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>village</b> of Owego by way of an overlap with NY96. It was truncated to its current southern terminus by 1994.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{left his}} {{headquarters}} at Keynsham Abbey and moved towards Bath, which {{had also been}} occupied by royalist troops, making entry into the city impossible. Monmouth camped in Philips Norton (now Norton St Philip), where his forces were attacked on 27 June by the leading elements of Feversham's forces, which had now combined into a larger force, but were still awaiting their artillery. The Duke of Grafton led some cavalry, dragoons, and 500 musketeers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>village,</b> where they were surrounded by the rebels and had to hack through hedges to escape. They were rescued by Churchill and withdrew with approximately twenty casualties on each side; however, each side believed that the other had taken greater losses.|$|E
