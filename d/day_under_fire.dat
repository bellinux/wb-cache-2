2500|$|On the left, {{the three}} attacking battalions of the 92nd Brigade were {{subjected}} to a [...] "tremendous" [...] barrage on their assembly-positions, just before zero hour which caused much disorganisation.

The right-hand battalion was unable to advance and troops in the centre and left flank battalions found areas of uncut wire and lost many casualties, when they bunched up at the gaps before reaching the wood, which they found to be full of fallen trees covered in barbed wire. The British troops were then cut off and captured or forced back with many casualties. Many of the troops were stranded in no man's land and had to wait all <b>day</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from snipers, machine-guns and artillery until nightfall, before completing the retirement. A German counter-attack pushed the 92nd Brigade back and retook Gavrelle Windmill for a short time, until forced back by another British attack.

He then entered another period of retirement from active service, during which time he studied at the University of Caen, and travelled through both France and Portugal. With the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France in February 1793 Hamilton again returned to active service, being assigned to Lord Howe's flagship, the 100-gun first rate [...] By July he had moved to his brother, Sir Charles Hamilton's ship, the 28-gun , and was commissioned as a lieutenant on 29 October 1793. [...] While serving on the Dido he helped in the capture of a privateer and her crew. He took a boat, crewed by only eight sailors, and captured the grounded privateer, put out the fire that had been set by her crew to destroy her, and then went ashore to capture her escaped crew. [...] He was later present at the siege of Bastia, and was given command of 100 British and 300 Corsican soldiers at Girolate. Here he constructed a number of batteries within pistol shot of the enemy, from which he was able to subject them to continuous bombardment.

During the breakthrough of German defenses in the village of Sirotino Khvatkov reportedly cleared two paths through German minefields and barbed wire. He reportedly defused 64 mines. Khvatkov was reportedly among the first to reach the Western Dvina near the village of Uzrechye and quickly built a raft from logs and <b>under</b> heavy German <b>fire</b> crossed to the opposite bank with a heavy [...] machine gun. During the <b>day</b> <b>under</b> heavy <b>fire</b> Khvatkov ferried troops and equipment over the river.

On 25 June he was killed during the crossing. Khvatkov was buried in a mass grave in Uzrechye.

Despite widespread criticism for his slowness and caution, Pratt pressed on towards Te Arei, creating the most extensive field-engineering works ever undertaken by British troops in New Zealand. Five more redoubts were built as the saps continued {{to the edge of the}} cliff above the Waitara River, but ceased after the intervention of Kingite chief Wiremu Tamihana, who helped negotiate a truce. A ceasefire was formally effected on 18 March 1861, ending the first phase of the Taranaki War. For his actions on 18 March, Colour-Sergeant John Lucas was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|R

The Liverpool Scottish moved to the Somme in mid-July and relieved the 18th King's near Montauban on the 31st. After spending six <b>days</b> <b>under</b> constant artillery <b>fire</b> undertaking auxiliary duties in the vicinity of Bernafay and Trônes Woods, the Liverpool Scottish moved to Mansel Copse in preparation for an assault on Guillemont.
