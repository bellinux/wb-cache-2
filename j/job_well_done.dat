25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a <b>job</b> <b>well</b> <b>done</b> if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future.

2500|$|Two {{days after}} the {{commencement}} of the Operation Barbarossa (Hitler's attack on his own ally, the Soviet Union), Braemer was appointed the [...] or supreme military commander of the so-called Reichskommissariat Ostland, a Nazi régime established in the combined occupied territory of the Baltic states, parts of northeastern Poland and western ByeloRussia, headquartered in Riga, the capital of Latvia (again in the general region of his birth, 380km to the north-east of his native Königsberg). He was to hold this office {{during the period of}} about 2years and 10months between 24June 1941 and 20April 1944. In some reports his appointment to this post was already finalized in the planning stages on 27May 1941. In this capacity Braemer was heavily implicated in the mass murder of the Jewish population in the territories under his command. He was responsible for, among other things, promulgating legislation that laid the legal and operational groundwork on the basis of which whole Jewish communities numbering thousands of people were exterminated in the Holocaust. Thus for example, on 25September 1941 Braemer issued his [...] "Guidelines for Military Security and Maintenance of Quiet and Order" [...] which specifically stipulated the [...] "imperative elimination" [...] of, among others, [...] "Jews and philosemitic elements (judenfreundliche Kreise)". The pivotal role that Braemer played in the Holocaust of the Jewish populations in Byelorussia has been described by the German historian Hannes Heer. Braemer has been shown to possess the notorious distinction of having originated the first annihilation operations against the Jewish ghettos in ByeloRussia: the Smilavichy ghetto, whose 1,338 inhabitants were murdered on 14October 1941; the Koidanovo ghetto, with its 1,000 victims on 21October 1941; followed by the murder of 5,900 people in the predominantly Jewish town of Slutsk on 27 and 28October 1941 in a massacre sometimes euphemistically referred to as the [...] "Slutsk Affair" [...] and that just to begin with. Braemer's service in the Ostland was considered so meritorious by both the Wehrmacht and the SS that he was rewarded with two military promotions, viz., to Generalleutnant (a rank roughly corresponding to major-general) on 1July 1941, just a week after arrival, and later, 14months into his tour of duty, on 1September 1942, as a reward for a <b>job</b> <b>well</b> <b>done,</b> to General der Kavallerie z.v. ("general of the cavalry", the second-highest general officer rank roughly equivalent to lieutenant general, a [...] "prestigious" [...] cachet within the echelons of the German military); and then again {{on the last day of}} his assignment with an SS promotion to the rank of Gruppenführer, the third-highest SS rank overall.

Yet one has only to see these men and talk with them to be convinced of the truth that human happiness and even human health thanks to modern science--are not dependent upon an existence in a Garden of Eden. I do not mean exactly that these men would choose {{to spend the rest of}} their existences in this waste, but they are happy in the consciousness of a <b>job</b> <b>well</b> <b>done.</b> It was really inspiring to encounter here the familiar conductors and brakemen, engineers and firemen, who had voluntarily, and for an ideal, left their homes in a remote and peaceful republic three thousand miles away, to find contentment and a new vitality, a wider vision, in the difficult and dangerous task they were performing. They were frequently under fire--when they brought back the wounded or fetched car-loads of munitions to the great guns on the ridiculous little trains of flat cars with open-work wheels, which they named--with American humour--the Federal Express and the Twentieth Century Limited. And their officers were equally happy. Their colonel, of our regular Army Engineer Corps, was one of those broad-shouldered six-footers who, when they walk the streets of Paris, compel pedestrians to turn admiringly and give one a new pride in the manhood of our nation. Hospitably he drew us out of the wind and rain into his little hut, and sat us down beside the stove, cheerfully informing us that, only the night before, the gale had blown his door in, and his roof had started for the German lines. In a neighbouring hut, reached by a duck board, we had lunch with him and his officers baked beans and pickles, cakes and maple syrup. The American food, the American jokes and voices in that environment seemed strange indeed! But as we smoked and chatted about the friends we had in common, about political events at home and the changes that were taking place there, it seemed as if we were in America once more. The English officer listened and smiled in sympathy, and he remarked, after our reluctant departure, that America was an extraordinary land.|$|E
40|$|Book synopsis: The {{politics}} of war reporting: Authority, authenticity and morality challenges the assumptions that reporters and their audiences {{have about the}} way the journalistic trade operates and how it sees the world. It unpacks the taken-for-granted aspects of the lives of war correspondents, exposing the principles of interaction and valorisation that usually go unacknowledged. Is journalistic authority really only about <b>doing</b> the <b>job</b> <b>well?</b> <b>Do</b> the ethics of war reporting emerge simply from the ‘stuff’ of journalism? This book asks why it is that the authoritative reporter increasingly needs to appear authentic, and that success depends not only on getting things right but being the right sort of journalist. This, in turn, depends on the uncalculating mastery of practices both before and during a journalist’s career. This book includes interviews with war correspondents and others with an active stake in the field and combines them with the critical sociology of Pierre Bourdieu to construct a political phenomenology of war reporting – the power relations and unspoken ‘rules of the game’ underpinning the representation of conflict and suffering by the media. It considers the recent phenomena of pooling and embedding journalists as well as the impact of new technologies, and asks what changes in the journalistic area can tell us about authority, authenticity and morality in the cultural industries more broadly. Interdisciplinary in its approach, The Politics of War Reporting will be of interest to scholars and students in the fields of media and cultural studies, sociology and political theory...|$|R

40|$|Background: The nurse {{leadership}} {{of a hospital}} is identified as {{the single most important}} aspect of the practice environment that impacts nurse outcomes. When nurses are satisfied with their jobs, they tend to remain with their employers and become more productive in their workplaces. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between leadership, job satisfaction and intentions to leave among registered nurses (RNs) working in hospitals in the North West and Free State provinces of South Africa. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was adopted. The population (N = 680) with the sample (n = 204) included RNs in medical–surgical units in both private and public hospitals in the two provinces. Data were collected using the RN 4 CAST questionnaire. Results: RNs were satisfied with the items pertaining to leadership except for praise and recognition (55. 7 %). They also indicated high levels of overall job satisfaction (70. 5 %) but were dissatisfied with wages (50 %), study leave (40. 9 %) and opportunities for advancement (40. 1 %). Furthermore, 46. 1 % of the RNs intended to leave their current hospitals. The results indicated a relationship between leadership and job satisfaction (r = 0. 47; p = 0. 00) and between intention to leave and job satisfaction (d = 0. 50). Conclusion: The nurse managers played a significant role influencing RN’s level of job satisfaction, while job satisfaction was highly correlated with intention to leave. The nurse leadership can improve job satisfaction by giving praise and recognition to the RNs for <b>jobs</b> <b>well</b> <b>done,</b> and RNs should be afforded the opportunity to advance their careers through further studies.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. This {{study is}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} effect job satisfaction (or dissatisfaction) has on the employees of Xstrata Alloys. Specifically, the focus falls on the supervisors employed at Xstrata’s Boshoek plant. The supervisors form {{the first line of}} management and therefore have the opportunity to influence the work force, be it intentionally or unintentionally, either positive or negative. It is the responsibility of every organisation to put measures in place to ensure a workforce of satisfied employees as the productivity and performance of the entire company could rest on this. This research study focuses on the quantitative method to obtain the necessary data. The Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) short form is specifically used in the collection of data for this study. A few interesting findings are evident: supervisors that have been in a certain line of work for longer periods of time, perceive themselves to experience less praise for <b>jobs</b> <b>well</b> <b>done,</b> whereas employees who have been appointed in supervisory positions for longer periods of time, have even lower levels of general satisfaction. The supervisors in the different departments are found to differ in their perceptions of certain job satisfaction items. Supervisors in the Admin and Production departments, harbour more positive feelings about some of the items than the supervisors in the Engineering department. A difference in perception is also noted between the supervisors with Afrikaans and other languages as home language, regarding their perception of some of the items of job satisfaction. It is recommended that future studies should focus on including the whole workforce, opposed to only the supervisors. Master...|$|R
