50|$|Rotationally molded parts have {{to follow}} some {{restrictions}} that are different from other plastic processes.

Some products based on polyethylene can be put in the mold before filling it with the main material. This can help to avoid holes that otherwise would appear in some areas.

These functions are called stationary states, because the time derivative at any point x is always the same, so the amplitude of the wave function never changes in time. Since the overall phase of a wave function is not measurable, the system does not change in time.|$|E
