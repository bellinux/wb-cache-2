5|$|Askarov testified {{himself that}} he had been beaten and {{tortured}} while in police custody, and his lawyer reported that Askarov had further bruises on his back. On 4 November 2010, however, the prosecutor's office held a press conference to <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> beatings had taken place.|$|E
5|$|Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has {{required}} all Norwegian activity in Antarctica, including Peter I Island, to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. All Norwegian citizens who plan activities on Peter I Island must therefore {{report to the}} Norwegian Polar Institute, who may <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> non-conforming activity. All people visiting the island must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> kind of tort.|$|E

5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti {{investigate}} the execution-style {{shooting death of}} a Chinese college student. A friend in his dormitory (Bai Ling) says the victim was a student leader at the Tiananmen Square protest and had been hunted ever since. The detectives go to Washington, D.C. {{to talk to the}} Chinese embassy about the murder, but they <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> knowledge of the incident. Secret Service agent Gruszynski (Ed Lauter) confronts Lewis and Crosetti and tells them not to waste the embassy's time, but agrees to give the detectives a tour of Washington before they go. Crosetti is excited to see the landmarks but Lewis, who believes the Secret Service agent knows who committed the murder, remains confrontational with Gruszynski. When Gruszynski still refuses to help, Crosetti and a frustrated Lewis leave Washington.|$|E
5|$|Father John learns the john's car {{belongs to}} an {{accountant}} named Steven Miller, who tells Father John the prostitute is Linda, an expensive call {{girl who is}} widely considered among the best at her profession. Meanwhile, Linda visits her dying, elderly stepfather Donald Dupree (Tom Carey), who repeatedly raped Linda in her childhood and ultimately set her {{on the path to}} prostitution. Linda confronts him about their past, but claims she has forgiven him his sins, even though he continues to <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> wrongdoing. A drunk Nadine goes to talk to Father John in confession about her loneliness and feelings for him. He admits to caring for her as well, but they agree to remain friends. Later, Father John hires Lloyd Montag (Bruce A. Young), an unemployed boxer at his church, to serve as his bodyguard as he talks to St. Clair. The pimp, who knows Lloyd from his boxing days, tells Father John what neighborhood Linda lives in. There, Father John and Lloyd find Zeke (Tony Papenfuss), a taxi driver who knows they are looking for Linda and agrees to take them to her apartment. Zeke explains he had driven her to the church when she first spoke to Father John at confession, and Zeke later visited the church to watch Father John preach.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E

25|$|The {{events of}} 1909 and 1910 left the Argentine anarchists fatigued. The movement's growth stalled {{as a result}} of state {{repression}} and the country's economic problems. The Law of Social Defense, passed as a reaction to the Falcón assassination, allowed the government to <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> foreigner who committed crimes punishable under Argentine law entry into the country, prohibited the entry of anarchists, banned groups disseminating anarchist propaganda, and granted local authorities the power to prohibit any public meetings which subversive ideas could be expressed at.|$|E
25|$|The {{so-called}} 'Black Rubric' in the 1552 Prayer Book {{which allowed}} kneeling for communion but denied {{the real and}} essential presence of Christ in the elements was omitted in the 1559 edition.

The bread and wine are held to be outward symbols of an inward and spiritual grace received by the faithful as the instruments of God's grace and Jesus' self-offering to the communicant.|$|E

25|$|On 28 May 1971, a Modern Air CV-990A with 45 {{passengers}} on board en route from Berlin Tegel to Bulgaria was unexpectedly denied permission to enter Bulgarian airspace, {{as a result of}} a new policy adopted by that country's then communist government to <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> aircraft whose flight had originated or was going to terminate at a West Berlin airport the right to take off and land at any of its airports. This resulted in the aircraft having to turn back to Berlin, where it landed safely at the city's Tegel Airport.|$|E

There have been claims of air combat between Greek F-5s and Turkish F-102s above the Aegean Sea during the Turkish invasion. A Greek internet website editor, Demetrius Stergiou, {{claims that the}} Greek F-5s had shot down two Turkish F-102s, while the Turkish side has claimed that their F-102s had shot down two Greek F-5s; however, both Greece and Turkey still officially <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> aircraft losses. The F-102 was finally retired from both of those air forces in 1979.|$|E
25|$|While Koperberg {{continues}} to <b>deny</b> <b>any</b> wrongdoing, he was stood {{down from the}} front bench of Parliament the following day while a police inquiry was instigated into the allegations, primarily due to pressure on Iemma to take action {{in light of the}} allegations against Gibson in March. On 9 January 2008, the police handed the results of their investigation into Koperberg to the NSW Director of Public Prosecutions. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that there was speculation Specking and Coad were not prepared to make statements to the police, making it likely Koperberg would be cleared. On 17 January the prospect of any charges being laid was dismissed.|$|E
