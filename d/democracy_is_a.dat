5|$|The French <b>Democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> short 2005 French {{political}} film made by Alex Chan using {{computer animation}} from Lionhead Studios' 2005 business simulation game The Movies. The plot centers on three Moroccan men who turn to rioting after facing {{different forms of}} discrimination. Chan, a French native of Chinese descent, created the film to convey his view that racism caused the riots of the 2005 civil unrest in France. Although Chan was restricted by shortcomings and technical limitations in The Movies, he finished the film after four days of production.|$|E

25|$|Presidential <b>Democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{system where}} the public elects the {{president}} through {{free and fair}} elections. The president serves as both {{the head of state}} and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the debate}} {{about the role of the}} liberal {{democratic}} model in peacebuilding, one side contends that liberal <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve it need to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate yardstick for success. Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.|$|E

25|$|Modern liberal <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{compromise}} between the twin ideals {{of freedom and}} democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the others want me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
500|$|One-nation {{conservatism}} (also {{known as}} one-nationism, or Tory <b>democracy)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> form of British political conservatism that views society as organic and values paternalism and pragmatism. The phrase [...] "One-nation Tory" [...] originated with Benjamin Disraeli (1804–1881), {{who served as}} the chief Conservative spokesman and became Prime Minister in February 1868. He devised it to appeal to working-class men as a solution to worsening divisions in society through introducing factory and health acts, as well as greater protection for workers.|$|E

Already some patrioteers are suggesting that native American sons to whom <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sacred ideal should be exiled." [...] Louis Post at the Department of Labor, which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband's American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well. After initially promising a court fight, she decided not to appeal his ruling.|$|E

The Dead Kennedys were done in by a lawsuit against their inclusion of H. R. Giger's Penis Landscape painting as an insert the album Frankenchrist.

500|$|Although Harding's first {{address to}} Congress called for passage of anti-lynching legislation, he {{initially}} seemed inclined to {{do no more}} for African Americans than Republican presidents of the recent past had; he asked cabinet officers to find places for blacks in their departments. Sinclair suggested {{that the fact that}} Harding received two-fifths of the Southern vote in 1920 led him to see political opportunity for his party in the Solid South. On October 26, 1921, Harding gave a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, to a segregated audience of 20,000 whites and 10,000 blacks. Harding, while stating that the social and racial differences between whites and blacks could not be bridged, urged equal political rights for the African American. Many African Americans at that time voted Republican, especially in the Democratic South, and Harding stated he did not mind seeing that support end if the result was a strong two-party system in the South. He was willing to see literacy tests for voting continue, if applied fairly to white and black. [...] "Whether you like it or not," [...] Harding told his segregated audience, [...] "unless our <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lie, you must stand for that equality." [...] The white section of the audience listened in silence while the black section cheered.|$|E

2500|$|Different {{variants}} of aggregative democracy exist.
