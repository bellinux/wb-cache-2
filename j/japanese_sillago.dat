2500|$|The Japanese whiting, Sillago [...] japonica, (also {{known as}} the <b>Japanese</b> <b>sillago</b> or Shiro-gisu) is a common species of coastal marine fish {{belonging}} to the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. As suggested by its name, the Japanese whiting was first recorded from Japan in 1843, but has subsequently been found to extend to Korea, China and Taiwan.|$|E

50|$|The diet of the goby {{includes}} {{many kinds of}} small organisms, such as copepods, amphipods, mantis shrimp, mysids, small fish, and polychaetes. It has also been known to consume fly larvae, bivalves such as the Asian clam, ostracods, and various detritus. Natural predators of the goby include yellow goosefish (Lophius litulon), ocellate spot skate (Okamejei kenojei), <b>Japanese</b> whiting (<b>Sillago</b> japonica), leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata), ashishirohaze (Acanthogobius lactipes), and suzuki (Lateolabrax japonicus).|$|R
40|$|Tributyltin (TBT) has {{continued}} to pollute the coastal areas therein following global regulation for its use as an anti-fouling agent. The tissue dynamics of TBT in fish have been extensively documented, but few studies on maternal transfer of TBT have been performed. Previously, we reported that TBT was maternally transferred from parent fish to eggs. The present study examined the distribution of TBT in the tissues and spawned eggs of <b>Japanese</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> japonica, after dietary exposure to TBT. The percentage distribution of whole-body TBT in each tissue {{was estimated to be}} 50 % in blood, 29 % in muscle, 1. 7 % in liver, 0. 4 % in brain, 3. 3 % in ovary, and 0. 47 % in eggs spawned in a single day. Of the TBT in whole eggs, 28. 8 % was in the yolk and 13. 5 % in the oil droplet. However, the concentration of TBT in the oil droplet was calculated to be 43 times higher than that in the yolk. These results indicate that blood is an important tissue for the accumulation of TBT in fish and suggest that TBT is maternally transferred along with the egg components...|$|R
