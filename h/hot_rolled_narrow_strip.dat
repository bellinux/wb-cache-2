40|$|Purpose: Model for {{prediction}} of mechanical properties of rolled steel products after final cooling from exitrolling temperature {{is one of}} the basic component of any software for complex computer simulation of rollingtechnologies. Theoretical background and implementation of such software tool is described. Design/methodology/approach: After calculation of cooling curves by any technology dependent Shell thesoftware tool MECHP can be called to predict CCT Diagram from current chemical composition of steel andinitial properties of deformed austenite first than structure shares (percentage of ferrite, pearlite, bainite andmartensite) resulting from austenite decomposition process for given cooling curve and finally mechanicalproperties of final product after cooling (hardness, yield stress, tensile strength) are calculated. Implementationof MECHP tool into the software RollFEM 3 D for 3 D Finite Elements Method simulation of rolling processesis presented. Findings: Comparison of MECHP calculations with measured process data (water cooling and subsequent aircooling of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>narrow</b> plate and wire) shows correspondence that is satisfactory for using in control ofprocess cooling technology. Practical implications: Results of verification showed that the software tool MECHP is implementable asa postprocessor into off-line rolling process simulation software or {{can be used as a}} mechanical propertiespredictor in software for on-line control of cooling. Originality/value: Developing of technology independent Library solving the problem of final mechanicalproperties prediction for various kinds of rolling technologies...|$|R
5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into <b>narrower</b> <b>rolls.</b> There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form <b>narrower</b> <b>rolls.</b> The multiple <b>narrower</b> <b>strips</b> of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For rewind slitting the machine used is called a slitter rewinder, a slitter or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|R
40|$|Use of {{parallel}} flange I beam sections is advantageous than tapered flange I beam sections  due to, increased lateral stiffness, sections {{do not have}} sloping flanges and excessive material  in web and easy to weld and bolt. Nowadays the <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> parallel flange, <b>narrow</b> parallel  flange beams (NPB) and wide parallel flange beams (WPB) sections as per Indian standards,  having yield stress, 300 MPa, 350 MPa and 410 MPa are being manufactured. Available  range of these sections {{can be used for}} steel moment resisting frames (SMRF’s) and  prequalified connections as per AISC codes. When the cross section of a steel shape is  subjected to large compressive stresses, the thin plates that make up the cross section may  buckle before the full strength of the member is attained if the thin plates are too  slender. This failure mode may be prevented by selecting suitable width-to-thickness ratios  of component plates. In the present exercise, a suitability of NPB and WPB section for use in  SMRF’s as per width-to-thickness limitations of AISC 341 - 2010 and AISC 341 - 2005 codal  provisions is studied. </p...|$|R
