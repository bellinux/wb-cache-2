25|$|When Suzuki entered {{school he}} became aware that his family was very poor. Suzuki was {{sensitive}} and kind but prone to quick bursts of anger.

His teacher told him that he should <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great man, and to do this he needed to leave Kanagawa Prefecture and study hard.|$|E
25|$|The young {{crown prince}} grew {{up having to}} live up to a prophecy at his birth, which claimed that he would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> great warrior just like Minye Kyawswa. (According to the prophecy, Tabinshwehti was the reincarnation of a prince named Minye Kyawswa who was put to death by his father King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy. The prince {{supposedly}} prayed the same prayer as Prince Bawlawkyantaw of Hanthawaddy before the latter was put to death by his father King Razadarit in 1390. As Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who was believed to be the reincarnate of Bawlawkyantaw, grew up to be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy, Tabinshwehti, believed to be the reincarnate of Minye Kyawswa of Hanthawaddy, the prophecy claimed, would be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy.) The prophecy of a Minye Kyawswa reincarnate may have been popular in the superstitious world of Burmese politics since Upper Burma was going through immense political turmoil and decades-long internecine warfare. Since the 1480s, the once dominant power of Upper Burma, Ava, had been unable to prevent its key vassal states from breaking away. His father, who himself had broken away from Ava since 1510, required his son to receive an education in military arts. Tabinshwehiti along with Ye Htut and other young men at the palace received training in martial arts, horseback riding, elephant riding, and military strategy.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} sportscasters, writers and journalists point to Tunis' books as {{inspiration}} for their careers. Tunis is mentioned by author Daniel Okrent in the dedication for The Ultimate Baseball Book {{as one of}} [...] "those responsible for the earliest roots of this project". Writer and editor Tad Richards says, [...] "I remember telling my mother... 'When I <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> writer, and people ask me about the greatest influence on my writing career, I'm going to say John R. Tunis. Among Tunis' many childhood fans are sports writer and children's author Thomas J. Dygard, Pulitzer Prize finalist Lee Martin, journalist Charles Kuralt [...] and football legend Johnny Unitas. New York Post columnist and editor Pete Hamill picked The Kid From Tomkinsville {{as one of his}} five favorite sports novels, writing that [...] "virtually every sportswriter I know remembers reading it as a boy." [...] In Partial Payment: Essays on Writers and Their Lives, literary critic Joseph Epstein devotes one chapter, [...] "A Boy's Own Author", to Tunis. Epstein admits that re-reading many childhood favorites can be disappointing, but found upon revisiting Tunis that his books are [...] "pretty serious, and I was utterly absorbed in them".|$|E
500|$|Genesis of the Daleks also {{displays}} {{a battle between}} good and evil. Letts enjoyed {{the fact that the}} story did not have clear heroes and villains, but rather a conflict of principle. The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this. Hinchcliffe described it as the [...] "hero meets antihero" [...] moment, with the two engaged in [...] "intellectual grappling". The episode also presents the [...] "moral dilemma" [...] of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks, resulting in the famous [...] "Have I the right?" [...] scene. The Doctor's comparison to knowingly killing a child who would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> dictator shows how the Doctor's ethics are influenced by his non-linear experience of time. (The Twelfth Doctor would again revisit this theme in the 2015 episodes [...] "The Magician's Apprentice" [...] and [...] "The Witch's Familiar".) He considers the good things that may come out of the Daleks, such as that [...] "many future worlds would become allies". The Doctor's conclusion that he does not have the right is an example of utilitarian reasoning, and a [...] "duty-based ethical" [...] position. Sladen recalled that Baker took the scene very seriously, almost [...] "agonising" [...] over the dialogue.|$|E
500|$|In {{the culture}} of the Mbugwe in Tanzania, the spotted hyena is linked to witchcraft. According to Mbugwe folklore, every witch {{possesses}} one or more hyenas, which are referred to as [...] "night cattle" [...] and are branded with an invisible mark. It is said that all hyenas are owned by witches, and that truly wild hyenas are non-existent. Lactating female spotted hyenas are said to be milked by their owners every night to make hyena butter, and are further used as mounts. When a witch acquires a hyena mount, he rides it to distant lands in order to bewitch victims and return safely home before morning. The Mbugwe consider killing hyenas to be dangerous, as the bond between the hyena and its owner is very strong, and will likely result in the witch seeking retribution. In order to obviate this danger, a killed hyena usually has its ears, tail and front legs cut off and buried, as these are the parts which are supposed to be marked by the witches' brand. In the Mtwara Region of Tanzania, it is believed that a child born at night while a hyena is crying will likely <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> thief. In the same area, hyena faeces are believed to enable a child to walk at an early age, thus it is not uncommon in that area to see children with hyena dung wrapped in their clothes.|$|E

2500|$|Byrdmaniax also {{included}} a pair of novelty songs penned by the band's bass player, Skip Battin, and his songwriting partner Kim Fowley. [...] The first of these, [...] "Tunnel of Love", was an organ driven Fats Domino pastiche, while the second, [...] "Citizen Kane", served as a wry comment on Hollywood life and its celebrity legacy during the 1940s and 1950s. [...] Unfortunately, the inclusion of these two songs, along with McGuinn and Levy's jaunty [...] "I Wanna <b>Grow</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Politician", caused the album to suffer from an overabundance of pastiche and whimsy. [...] A third Battin–Fowley song, [...] "Absolute Happiness", was more serious, with its dramatic lyrics providing a Buddhism-inspired meditation on positive values {{and the power of}} nature.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{collaborator}} Van Dyke Parks, Wilson pioneered a now-common {{approach to}} piano in which triad chords are [...] "hammered" [...] in an eighth-note pattern.

Professor of American history John Robert Greene stated that [...] "God Only Knows" [...] (co-written with Tony Asher) remade {{the ideal of the}} popular love song, while [...] "Sloop John B" [...] and [...] "Pet Sounds" [...] broke new ground and took rock music away from its casual lyrics and melodic structures into what was then uncharted territory. He furthermore called it one factor which spawned the majority of trends in post-1965 rock music, the only others being the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965) and Revolver (1966), and the 1960s folk movement.

2500|$|McGuinn's other {{compositional}} {{contributions to}} Byrdmaniax were two songs {{that he had}} written with lyricist Jacques Levy for the pair's aborted Broadway musical, Gene Tryp. [...] Of these, [...] "Kathleen's Song" [...] had originally been intended for {{a scene in which}} the song's eponymous heroine patiently waits for Gene Tryp, her lover, to return home from his travels. [...] "Kathleen's Song" [...] had, in fact, been recorded in June 1970 during the recording sessions for (Untitled) but had been omitted from that album at the eleventh hour, {{due to a lack of}} space. [...] As a result, there are promo copies of (Untitled) known to exist that list the song (under the abbreviated title [...] "Kathleen") on the album sleeve. [...] The Byrds returned to [...] "Kathleen's Song" [...] in January and March 1971, undertaking additional recording work in order to ready the track for release on Byrdmaniax. [...] The second Gene Tryp song included on the album was [...] "I Wanna <b>Grow</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Politician", a whimsical ragtime pastiche that had been written for a scene in the musical in which the hero, Gene Tryp, runs as a presidential candidate. [...] The song found a second lease of life away from the confines of Gene Tryp, however, when its satirical lyrics found favor with America's radical youth, who were rebelling against the Nixon administration during the early 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Spotted hyenas vary {{in their}} folkloric and mythological depictions, {{depending}} on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted hyenas are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped hyenas are often given the same names. In western African tales, spotted hyenas are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth, while West African folklore generally shows the hyena as symbolizing immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits. In Tanzania, there is a belief that witches use spotted hyenas as mounts. In the Mtwara Region of Tanzania, it is believed that a child born at night while a hyena is crying will likely <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> thief. In the same area, hyena faeces are believed to enable a child to walk at an early age, thus it is not uncommon in that area to see children with hyena dung wrapped in their clothes. The Kaguru of Tanzania and the Kujamaat of Southern Senegal view hyenas as inedible and greedy hermaphrodites. A mythical African tribe called the Bouda is reputed to house members able to transform into hyenas. A similar myth occurs in Mansôa. These [...] "werehyenas" [...] are executed when discovered, but do not revert to their human form when killed.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, Byrdmaniax {{was greeted}} {{positively}} by the UK music press but received scathing reviews in the U.S. [...] Richard Meltzer's {{review in the}} August 1971 edition of Rolling Stone magazine was particularly vicious, with Meltzer describing the album as [...] "increments of pus". [...] The same review also described the McGuinn–Levy composition [...] "I Wanna <b>Grow</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>a</b> Politician" [...] as a song that was [...] "degenerating into namby pamby innocuous mickey mouse with latent-blatant political content". [...] Meltzer concluded his withering attack by deriding The Byrds themselves as [...] "a boring dead group." [...] In the UK, Roy Hollingworth's review in the August 14, 1971 edition of Melody Maker was more positive and described the album as [...] "one sweet length of bursting Byrds sunshine, so perfect in quality and quantity you'd feel an absolute heel to ask for more." [...] Record Mirror was also enthusiastic in its praise of the album, describing it as [...] "another fine album by The Byrds." [...] However, not all British reviews of Byrdmaniax were positive, with Richard Green of the NME noting that [...] "When the true history of rock comes to be written, The Byrds will get a deserved place of honour {{on the strength of}} tunes like 'Mr. Tambourine Man', 'Eight Miles High', and 'So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star'. [...] Hopefully the writer will not have listened to Byrdmaniax or he may drastically alter his opinion." [...] Green was also critical of Terry Melcher's use of strings and horns on many of the tracks, concluding that [...] "Orchestration is all very well for some bands, but not, on this showing, for The Byrds." ...|$|E
