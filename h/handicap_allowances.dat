50|$|At {{the end of}} the round, points earned are tallied. The {{total is}} {{subtracted}} from 36, and the resulting number is the golfer's <b>handicap</b> <b>allowance.</b> His net score can then be computed using his System 36 <b>handicap</b> <b>allowance.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Monmouth Park inarguarated the Amory L. Haskell Handicap {{to honor}} its former president, Amory L. Haskell. In 1981, the race became an {{invitational}} handicap for three-year-olds. In 2006, {{the race was}} changed from a <b>handicap</b> to <b>allowance</b> weight conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Disability {{benefits}} were increased, with the 1985 budget raising the <b>Handicapped</b> Child's <b>Allowance</b> by 31% and the disability allowance by 80%. A special earnings exemption of $20 per week was also introduced for severely disabled beneficiaries {{as an incentive}} to personal effort.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{originally}} run as the Knickerbocker Handicap at Aqueduct Racetrack in late October or early November, although the 1962, 1995 and 2001 renewals {{were held at}} Belmont. The race was permanently moved to Belmont Park in 2008 and was changed from a <b>handicap</b> to <b>allowance</b> weight conditions in 2009.|$|R
50|$|It was {{the sixteenth}} Australian Grand Prix {{and the last}} to feature a {{handicap}} start which saw the slower cars starting ahead of the faster cars according to <b>handicap</b> <b>allowance.</b> The first car over the line was the MG TC special of South Australian Steve Tillett. The Australian Grand Prix title was however to be awarded to the driver setting the fastest outright time, regardless of handicap. The scratch race was won by Warwick Pratley driving a George Reed built Flathead Ford V8 powered racing car. It {{would be the last}} Australian Grand Prix victory by an Australian built car until Frank Matich won the 1971 race at the wheel of a Matich A50. Pratley started the race ten minutes and thirty seconds behind the first car to start the race, the Morgan of Colin Uphill. Pratley won the race by 96 seconds over the Delahaye of Dick Bland. Both Tillett and Pratley were awarded Commonwealth Jubilee Trophies for their victories in what was effectively two races in one.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} founded in 1952 as the Milady Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California. Usually run on the dirt, the Milady was run on an {{all-weather}} artificial dirt surface from 2007 to 2013. The race was renamed as the Marjorie L. Everett in 2012. When Hollywood Park was closed {{at the end of}} 2013, the race was moved to Santa Anita and renamed as the Adoration Stakes. The race was also changed from a <b>handicap</b> to <b>allowance</b> conditions, in which horses receive a specified reduction in weight if they satisfy certain conditions.|$|R
50|$|Broadcast and {{television}} license fees were abolished, while {{a wide range}} of new benefits were introduced, such as a <b>handicapped</b> child’s <b>allowance,</b> a special orphan’s pension, and the Supporting Mothers Benefit. Rates of sickness and unemployment benefits were increased to bring them in line with other social security benefits, while funding was provided for child care, women’s refuges, and community health programs. The means test for pensioners over the age of seventy-five was abolished in 1973, and in 1975 the means test was abolished for all pensioners over the age of seventy. As a result of the welfare measures undertaken by the Whitlam Government, social expenditures as a percentage of GDP rose from 12.5% to 17.6% during its time in office.|$|R
50|$|Boats are {{measured}} to determine handicaps. The fastest {{boat in the}} fleet is the scratch boat and has no time allowance. All other boats have time <b>allowance</b> <b>handicaps</b> which are subtracted from the elapsed sailing time. Over the years various handicapping systems have been used including CCA, IOR, PHRF, IMS, IRC and ORR. In 2016 the Cove Island course used the ORR handicap system while the shore course used PHRF. In 2017 the shore course will start using the ORR-EZ handicap system.|$|R
50|$|The Supporting Mother’s Benefit was {{introduced}} in 1973 to alleviate financial deprivation among women whose de facto husbands were in jail, deserted de facto wives, unmarried mothers and other wives separated from their husbands who, for other reasons, were not eligible for the widows’ pension. The Double Orphans’ pension {{was introduced}} that same year, providing $10 a week to the guardian of an orphan who had lost both parents. The <b>Handicapped</b> Children's <b>Allowance,</b> introduced a year later, provided $10 a week to the guardians of severely physically or mentally handicapped children {{who had not been}} placed in an institution. A special discretionary benefit was introduced for lone fathers in August 1974, payable at the unemployment benefit rate. In February 1973, eligibility for the standard rate of pension, payable to widow pensioners with children and single age and invalid pensioners, was extended to Class B widow pensioners (those over the age of fifty with no dependent children). A change was also made ensuring that pensioners would not lose their extra benefits when a student turned twenty-one. The standard age pension rate was increased from 19.5% of average weekly earnings in September 1972 to 24.4% by December 1975. Social welfare administration was also made more efficient and equitable via the establishment of a Social Welfare Commission and benefit appeals tribunals.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of self-reported low vision (LV) and blindness, and their associated disabilities, handicaps and socio-economic consequences for individuals living in institutions are poorly documented. Methods 2, 075 institutions were selected at random and eight individuals were picked at random {{from the list}} of residents. Three groups of individuals were defined: blind, LV, and a control group (CG). These were compared after adjustment for age and co-morbidities. Of the 15, 403 individuals, 14, 603 interviews (94. 9 %) were completed. Results The {{prevalence of}} blindness was 1. 6 % and the LV 13. 4 %. Blind individuals needed assistance more often (OR: 2. 65 to 11. 35) than CG members while the assistance required by LV individuals was similar to that for the CG. Blind individuals required institution adaptation (building and furniture changes) more often than the CG. Blind (57. 9 %) and LV individuals (35. 4 %) were more often registered for social allowances. Monthly social allowances were EUR 86 higher for blind than LV individuals. Monthly family incomes were found to be similar between the three groups (from EUR 782 to 797). Social and demographic data, institution description, income, <b>handicaps,</b> disabilities, social <b>allowances</b> and details of daily activities were collected interviews Conclusion The results demonstrate the impact of self-reported blindness and LV on daily life for patients living in institutions. </p...|$|R
40|$|One major {{thematic}} {{focus in}} the Social Welfare Research Centre has been family care of dependent relatives. To date empirical work has centered on family care of disabled elderly relatives (SWRC Reports and Proceedings Nos. 23 and 35) and this monograph was prepared {{to see if the}} caring issues, identified among families with elderly relatives, were similarly prevalent among families with handicapped young children. This research does this and more. Stuart Rees and Anneke Emerson from the Social Work Department at the University of Sydney prepared this monograph as part of a research contract issued by the SWRC. On three occasions over a twelve month period they interviewed 51 families to examine their use of health and welfare services for their severely handicapped young children. In addition they noted factors relating to the financial and non-financial costs involved in the caring situation. They found, not surprisingly, that parents (but especially mothers) have enormous and almost unbearable stresses on them if they attempt to care adequately for their severely handicapped young children. Such stress is compounded by the poorly structured and poorly co-ordinated service systems in health and welfare. The research shows, in addition to internal family pressures that the 'helping professionals' were not always very helping because they were too much tied up in their own professional worlds and that they operated in bureaucratic settings which did not facilitate co-ordinated activity. Rees and Emerson further found that the extra financial cost of caring at home for a severely handicapped child was almost triple the amount of the <b>Handicapped</b> Child's <b>Allowance</b> paid by the Department of Social Security, and in addition that this allowance was made available and administered with very little rationality or consistency. Two points stand out. First, co-operation between medical and non-medical services is inadequate to handle need and second, parents' ability to provide care in the home depends on the usefulness of non-medical services, yet these services take a shabby second place behind medical services, which themselves are not always appropriate in the circumstances. The authors conclude with a number of policy options relating to service organisation and co-ordination, and family support. This is a pioneering piece in an area in which there is virtually no Australian research. As such anyone hoping for a definitive report on issues relating to the care of handicapped children will not have their expectations met here. They will not, however, be disappointed for this study traces the background and provides valuable data on a small sample. In doing so it adds to our store of knowledge, and in the best of research traditions raises questions about directions for future research in this important area...|$|R
