Braunschweig: Vieweg, 1912 - Book on <b>electrobiology</b> (Treatise that {{provided}} the first quantitative theory of nerve and muscle action based on solid experimentation, precise measurements {{and the use of}} biophysical models).|$|E
5000|$|In 1950, {{a portion}} of the Warrenton estate was {{purchased}} by The Round Table Foundation. The organization was founded by Dr. Henry K. Andrija Puharich to conduct experiments in <b>electrobiology.</b> Its laboratory was initially located in Camden, Maine in a barn owned by Roy Hines. The purchase of the Warrenton property as a permanent location for the laboratory was made possible, in part, by a grant from General Foods Corporation for the purpose of experimentation in [...] "taste physiology". Dr. Puharich and the Round Table Foundation became more widely known for their research in extrasensory perception. [...] Collaborators included famous psychics Peter Hurkos, Harry Stump, and Eileen Garrett. Puharich also hosted a number of celebrities such as author, Aldous Huxley, Alice Astor Bouverie, and Henry Belk.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} IEC {{technical}} committees {{is now more}} than 90, with almost as many subcommittees, {{and there are more}} than 20000 entries in the IEV, covering more than 80 subject areas. The terms and definitions are provided in English and French, and equivalent terms are provided in Arabic, Chinese, Czech, Finnish, German, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian (Bokmål and Nynorsk), Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Serbian, Slovenian, Spanish and Swedish (coverage varies by subject area). Traditionally the IEV was developed and published as a series of International Standards, initially under the reference number IEC 50 and later renumbered as IEC 60050, with each part of the standard covering a given subject, such as circuit theory, live working and <b>electrobiology.</b> The online version of the IEV, known as Electropedia, was launched on 2 April 2007.|$|E
40|$|The {{historical}} significance {{of work with}} electric organs {{for the development of}} <b>electrobiology</b> and our understanding of the cholinergic synapse at the cell and molecular biological level is traced from its earliest beginning in folk medicine, through the controversy on bioelectricity between Galvani and Volta to the present day, the last decades of which have seen the sequencing of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the isolation and biochemical characterization of the cholinergic vesicle and much else. In the concluding section of the review the continued relevance and usefulness of the electromotor system as a model for future neurobiological research is emphasized...|$|E
