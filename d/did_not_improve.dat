5|$|Anti-communist {{resistance}} in Poland was also bolstered, {{and a group}} of opposition leaders and cultural figures founded the Klub Krzywego Koła (Skewed Wheel Club) in Warsaw. It promoted discussions about Polish independence, questioned the efficiency of the state controlled economy, and government disdain and even persecution of veterans of the Polish Armed Forces in the West and the Armia Krajowa resistance during World War II. While the intelligentsia expressed their dissatisfaction with discussions and publications (bibuła), workers took to the streets. The living conditions in Poland <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve,</b> contrary to government propaganda, and workers increasingly found that they had little power compared to bureaucracy of the Party (nomenklatura).|$|E

The Chinese opposed immediate reunification and to that end, began making economic agreements with the Provisional Revolutionary (Communist) Government of South Vietnam (PRGSV). PRGSV head Nguyễn Hữu Thọ was treated well by the Chinese. This policy further damaged relations.

5|$|Leigh {{appeared}} with Robert Taylor, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan in A Yank at Oxford (1938), {{which was the}} first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production, she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, partly because she disliked her secondary role but mainly because her petulant antics seemed to be paying dividends. After dealing with the threat of a lawsuit brought over a frivolous incident, Korda, however, instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve.</b> Her next role was in Sidewalks of London, also known as St. Martin's Lane (1938), with Charles Laughton.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too failed to provide a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began the}} 1888season with {{part-time}} outfielder Dave Rowe as their player-manager.

He was replaced with second baseman Sam Barkley, who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> the team's play, winning 22 of the next 58games. He was replaced with non-playing manager Bill Watkins, who finished the season. Although the Cowboys completed their initial season in last place out of the league's eight teams, there were notable player achievements; on June6, Henry Porter threw a no-hitter, and on June13, Barkley hit for the cycle.|$|E

5|$|Brasenose lost 115 {{men in the}} First World War (including {{a quarter}} of the 1913 year), with its {{undergraduate}} numbers greatly reduced. Lord Curzon's post-War reforms were successfully instituted. The inter-war period was defined by William Stallybrass, who as fellow and eventual Principal (until 1948) dominated college life. Brasenose once again produced top sportsmen– cricketers, rowers, and others. This came at the cost of falling academic standards and poorly performing finances, which would see Stallybrass' authority challenged. He died in a railway accident before he could be forced out, however. After the war, sporting achievements waned (although there were notable exceptions) but academic success <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> significantly, in what was now one of Oxford's largest colleges.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2006 ACC Championship Game, the Gator Bowl Association, which {{administered}} the ACC Championship Game {{during its first}} two years of existence, was awarded a one-year extension to its two-year contract to host the game. The 2006 game suffered from poor attendance, resulting in over $1million in losses for the Gator Bowl Association. In the off-season, the Gator Bowl Association declared that if sales <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> for the 2007 ACC Championship game, the game's Jacksonville future would be in jeopardy. Attendance for the 2006 game was low due to high travel costs stemming from Jacksonville's distance from the participating schools, and the 2007 participants—Boston College and Virginia Tech—faced the same problem.|$|E

The Hokies won their next eight games, finishing {{the season with a}} 10–2 record. With late-season wins over perennial rival, 16th-ranked Virginia, and fellow ACC newcomer, ninth-ranked Miami, Virginia Tech clinched the ACC football championship (the last year in which it would be decided without a conference championship game) and a bid to a Bowl Championship Series game. Because the ACC's normal bowl destination, the Orange Bowl, was hosting the national championship game, Virginia Tech was selected to attend the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, instead.|$|E
5|$|He {{missed the}} 1977–78 {{pre-season}} {{with a knee}} injury, but recovered well enough to make 36 appearances throughout the campaign. Kaye was sacked after a poor start to the season, {{and was replaced by}} Bremner's former Leeds teammate Bobby Collins, who had joined the club as assistant manager in the summer; as at Leeds, Bremner had applied for the vacant managerial role, but was rejected. After being turned down for the job he announced his intention to retire as a player {{at the end of his}} contract in summer 1978. The season was a disaster, and though Collins was sacked and replaced by youth coach Ken Houghton in February, results <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> and Hull were relegated in last place, ten points from safety.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the Kop {{had been}} {{redesigned}} and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. At the time, the Kop {{was the biggest}} football stand in the country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; they scored 90 goals during the 1928–29 season, striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident. He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson. The club's fortunes <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at West Ham United, yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7–2 at Anfield.|$|E

5|$|The F-20 did, however, {{have several}} {{problems}} inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant {{that there was}} limited ground clearance, and {{the position of the}} landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000lb (454kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload/range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.|$|E
5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve</b> their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|Watford's weak {{financial}} position was exposed in 2002–03, following {{the collapse of}} ITV Digital. The club was facing administration, but an agreement by players and staff to a 12% wage deferral helped the club's cash flow, and a run to the FA Cup semi-final generated vital revenue. Financial constraints saw {{a large number of}} players released that summer. After consolidating in 2003–04, the following season started well, with the club in the upper half of the Championship at the end of September. Poor form, however, saw the club drop towards the relegation zone. Despite reaching the semi-final of the League Cup, Watford's league form <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>improve,</b> and Lewington was sacked in March 2005.
