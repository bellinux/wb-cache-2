During his period in office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith took disciplinary measures against some outspoken liberation theologians in Latin America in the 1980s and Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello. In 1983, he issued the Declaration on Masonic Associations which drew on Clarification concerning status of Catholics becoming Freemasons (itself issued by the Congregation 9 months before his becoming its prefect). The Congregation condemned liberation theology twice (in 1984 and 1986), accusing it of Marxist tendencies and of inciting hate and violence. Leonardo Boff, for example, was suspended, while others were reputedly reduced to silence. Cardinal Ratzinger also upheld the teaching against the ordination of women and stated that it belonged to the deposit of the faith, meaning that it was beyond the jurisdiction of any pope to change it.|$|E

40|$|Complexities of {{essential}} {{aspects of the}} teacher-student relationship were identified {{in a group of}} German adolescents and their teachers through participant observation. It is already known that the determinants of the teacher-student relationship cannot be simply categorized and analyzed as univariate features. Using Clifford Geertz’s concept of “thick description,” empirical data were collected during a six-month field study at a secondary school in the south of Germany. Thematic analyses of the extant empirical database identified six sociological principles that constitute fundamental components of the teacher-student relationship: power, dualism, solidarity, productivity, sympathy, and identity. Analyses showed that meaningful ritualized structures limit teachers and students to <b>institutional</b> <b>roles</b> that are incongruent with the general aim of having productive interactions in educational settings. The complexity of educational settings can only be grasped if the teacher-student relationship is understood as an interpersonal process. When reduced to their <b>institutional</b> <b>roles,</b> both teachers and students experienced their relationship and educational settings as unsatisfactory. </p...|$|R

The focus of this paper is on the interplay between the legal and lay discourse types and how judges project their <b>institutional</b> <b>roles</b> through well-initiated turns directed at litigants in person and counsels. As a versatile discourse marker, well provides a good opportunity to explore how judges have to adapt their roles to ensure lay litigants in person receive the necessary support and that their lack of competence does not impede on the fairness of the proceedings. Given the breadth and importance of the topic of litigation in person, I discuss how the tools and approaches of corpus linguistics can be helpful in this multidisciplinary area where multiple functions and uses of individual linguistic features need to be explored in depth...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} twenty-first century, the Chinese {{government}} has been undertaking a series of rural-favored policies and measures to promote comprehensive development in rural China. The fundamental purpose is to accomplish integrated urban-rural development (IURD) given the ever enlarging urban-rural inequalities during the post-reform era. Considering the long time biased policies against the countryside, the paper aims to examine the <b>institutional</b> <b>roles</b> in approaching the IURD. IURD at provincial level in China is assessed by the principal component analysis of selected variables which represent the socioeconomic integration between urban and rural areas. The <b>institutional</b> <b>roles</b> in promoting IURD include three aspects: decentralization in directing local rural development; employment, social security system and material circulation system which influence the free production factor flows between urban and rural areas; education, medical treatment and culture system which influence public services between urban and rural areas. We carry out panel data analysis to investigate the relationship between institutions and IURD at provincial level in China in the period 1980 - 2010. The analysis also controls variables such as locational factors, population density, per capita GDP in each province. The data mainly refers to Comprehensive Statistical Data and Materials on 60 Years of New China and National Statistical Yearbooks in recent years. Research results show significant and dynamic roles of institution in promoting IURD at different time periods...|$|R
