40|$|Magister Economicae - MEconThroughout its development, {{trade has}} been {{regarded}} as a vital component of economic growth and development. Both theoretical and empirical studies consider international trade {{to be a major}} determinant of the growth of any economy. International trade in services has been rising ever since trade in services was incorporated into international trade agreements after the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations in 1994. This, coupled with the ever-improving state of technological innovation, has made services trade an important aspect of the development agenda of most countries. However, just like any other endeavour, offshoring of services has both opportunities as well as threats. The study examines two research questions relating to the growth-enhancing impact of South Africa’s exports and imports of services. Firstly, the study examines the contribution of services exports to economic growth in South Africa. Secondly, the study determines the impact that imported services has had on South Africa’s economic growth. In spite of the global rise of trade in services, South Africa’s export of services accounts for only 14 percent of total exports, while the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> constitutes 20 percent of total imports. Using quarterly time series data for the period 1980 to 2012, the study adopts the ordinary least squares method to estimate the contribution of both exports and imports to output expansion within an aggregation production function setup. The empirical results show that the export of services influences influence South Africa’s economic growth significantly in both the long-run and the short-run. While the relationship is positive in the long-run, it is negative in the short-run. The results also indicate that the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> significantly and positively affects real output growth in both the long-run and the short-run...|$|E

The paper develops an outsourcing measure based on the narrow definition of intermediate imports given by Feenstra and Hanson (1996, 1999). Based on the input-output tables, the study uses 5 -digit industrial-level classifications to measure {{the impact of}} outsourcing on productivity of the manufacturing industries in Singapore from 1995 – 2004. The outsourcing measure is further decomposed by <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> import of IT services and import of business services. This decomposition allows us to study the impact of outsourcing of services {{in addition to the}} cross-border fragmentation of products and components. The results suggest strong positive impact of cross-border sourcing on the productivity of the manufacturing sector. The decomposition of outsourcing measure indicates that the manufacturing industries are more involved in cross-border sourcing of services, particularly in business services.

This is consistent with what might be expected if one motivation for such investments is to internationally source activities previously undertaken within the United States. Inward investment in the US service sector is found to reduce <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> other things being equal, pointing to substitution of trade and investment in services.

All the selected indicators were tested for causality by Granger test. As a result of the study it has been found that the export of Sumy region is directly affected by the volume of industrial production, inflation rate in Ukraine and the world price for wheat. The export of services is affected by the volume of extended credits, income of the population per person, the world prices for corn and wheat. Causality has also been determined between the import of goods in Sumy region and indicators of extended credits, turnover of retail trade and wholesale trade of enterprises. As regards the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> the influence was recorded from the side of the official exchange rate of hryvnia to the US dollar and the price index of industrial producers.

An example of that dependence and the ambiguities it creates is exports <b>of</b> educational <b>services,</b> a domestic activity that becomes an export because students are defined as foreign residents. Since many students later become US residents, the supposedly exported service never leaves the US, or returns to the US unobserved and uncounted. A particularly serious problem of measurement is the growing transfer of intangible US corporate assets to foreign affiliates of US firms, some of which use virtually no foreign factors of production. These transfers, mainly for tax saving purposes, give rise to phantom flows <b>of</b> <b>services</b> from the foreign affiliates to the US and to other countries and remove the exports from the U. S. balance of payments. They make the meaning of measures of the current balances and GDP ambiguous. One possible solution to the measurement problems would be to use measures assigning at least intangible assets to countries of ownership, rather than nominal residence. ...|$|R

40|$|India’s {{service sector}} has grown rapidly since the 1990 s. Domestic demand for {{services}} has increased as incomes have risen, triggering {{the expansion of}} industries such as banking, education, and telecommunications. Exports have also increased rapidly, led by information technology and business process outsourcing (IT-BPO).

The majority of India’s jobseekers are low-skilled, but demand for workers is growing fastest in higher-skill industries. The supply of highly-skilled workers has not kept pace with demand, causing wages to increase faster for these workers than for lower-skilled ones.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{the implications for}} sustainability of the US current account of widespread uptake <b>of</b> new economy <b>services</b> around the world. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to estimate new income elasticities for US exports and <b>imports</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> that have become increasingly internationally tradable on account of the networked information technologies characteristic of the new economy. These elasticity estimates are then incorporated into a simple model of the US current account. Assumptions on the increase in global growth coming from widespread uptake <b>of</b> new economy <b>services</b> around the world are taken from other sources. The new estimates of income elasticities and the assumptions on global growth yield a trajectory for the US current account deficit that is compared to a base case without increased integration <b>of</b> new economy <b>services</b> in international trade and around the world. The paper concludes that although new economy services reduce the asymmetry in estimated income elasticities and contribute to raising global growth, reasonable estimates of these two structural improvements are not sufficient to stabilize the US current account deficit, in part because the share <b>of</b> new economy <b>services</b> in trade is still small. ...|$|R
