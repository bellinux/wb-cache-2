50|$|A Grexit, {{assuming}} that it coincided with adoption <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> currency, would require preparation, for example with capacity for banknote stamping or printing a stock <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes.</b> However, information leaking out on such preparations {{might lead to}} negative dynamic effects, like bank runs. Conversely, leaving the Eurozone, but retaining the Euro as de facto currency, would avoid the practical issues and relieve the country {{of the burden of}} its Eurozone responsibilities.|$|R

50|$|Patel also {{informed}} that the decision had been made about six months ago, and the printing <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> denomination ₹500 and ₹2,000 had already started.

This statement has led to much debate, because the Reserve Bank governor six months before the announcement was Raghuram Rajan, while the <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> have the signature of the newly appointed governor, Urjit Patel.|$|R
25|$|After the Vienna Award, Hungary had {{to supply}} its {{recovered}} territories with money. Since {{increasing the amount}} of silver coins would have been too expensive, 1 and 5 pengő notes were issued in 1941 and 1938, respectively. These notes were of simple design and poor quality. Meanwhile, a series <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> including 2, 5, 10 and 20 pengő denominations was issued. The design represented ornaments based on Hungarian folk art and people.|$|R

50|$|The British Currency School was a {{group of}} British economists, active in the 1840s and 1850s, who argued that the {{excessive}} issuing of banknotes was a major cause of price inflation. They believed that, in order to restrict circulation, issuers <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> should be required to hold an equivalent value of gold as a reserve. This concept was also known as convertibility and the currency principle. They argued that prices were mostly based on quantity of currency in circulation, although proponents did acknowledge that prices were also affected by deposits. Therefore, by controlling prices banks could limit outflow of gold.|$|R

50|$|The {{general public}} {{correctly}} identified 72% of counterfeit banknotes, 80% of genuine $10 banknotes and 89% of genuine $20 banknotes. Commercial cash handlers, such as retail cashiers, correctly identified 86% of counterfeit banknotes, 89% of genuine $10 banknotes and 94% of genuine $20 banknotes. Bank tellers correctly identified 89% of counterfeit banknotes, 91% of genuine $10 banknotes and 95% of genuine $20 banknotes. All groups performed better with high-quality notes (that is, {{those that were}} clean and undamaged) with the exception that the general public misidentified many high-quality genuine $10 banknotes as counterfeit, which was attributed to the public's suspicion <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|From 14 October 1940, <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> {{were printed}} [...] "on {{behalf of the}} National Bank of Denmark."

On 18 December 1940, a Currency Central was {{established}} in order to monitor foreign trade and to secure the solvency of the Faroes. Currency Central was headed by a board of nine, the judge, who was chairman, one representative of Faroe Fish Export, one representative of the Faroese Merchants' Union, one representative of the bank Føroya Banki, one representative of the savings bank Føroya Sparikassi and four representatives of the Løgting.|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of influence of intaglio printing {{on the strength}} characteristics of banknote paper was carried out. The investigation {{was based on a}} comparison of the changes of 1 hryvnia and 2 hryvnia banknotes. These denominations were selected because of their similar physical and functional properties. The only essential distinction is application of intaglio printing for 2 hryvnia banknote production and non-usage of intaglio printing for 1 hryvna banknote production. The experimental investigations showed a considerable worsening of tensile strength when deterioration of banknotes had increased. Though, the worsening of tensile strength because of deterioration is a little less for the 2 hryvna banknotes. On the other hand, in case <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> the tensile strength is higher for 1 hryvna. So, the strengthening effect of intaglio printing becomes apparent in banknotes circulation, so far as the intaglio printing hardens banknotes substrate by means of paper?s structure compaction. ????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????????????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ???????????? ????????, ??? ?????????????????? ?????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ??????? ? ???????...|$|R

The S&Co tokens were issued by a trading store, Strachan and Company, in East Griqualand, after January 1875. However no evidence can be found that the Griquas recognised the S&Co as their official currency. Other less successful tokens were also in circulation. Interestingly, The Standard Bank of British South Africa [...] in Kokstad must have held money in trust in exchange for tokens, as after annexation by the British in 1878 it could not accept it as legal tender. It thus acted as an agent for S&Co, by whom the tokens would be exchanged for legal tender. The tokens were restricted to the Strachan Company. The tokens could not lawfully be dispensed by Standard Bank as the Bank Act of 1844 restricted the issue <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>banknotes</b> and currency only if they were 100% backed by gold.|$|R

50|$|Transactions in the Indian {{agriculture}} sector {{are heavily}} dependent on cash and were adversely affected by the demonetisation of ₹500 and ₹1,000 banknotes. Due to scarcity <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>banknotes,</b> many farmers have insufficient cash to purchase seeds, fertilisers and pesticides needed for the plantation of rabi crops usually sown around mid-November. Farmers and their unions conducted protest rallies in Gujarat, Amritsar and Muzaffarnagar against the demonetisation as well as against restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India on district cooperative central banks which were ordered not to accept or exchange the demonetised banknotes.|$|R
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "polymer" [...] in place of [...] "plastic" [...] to {{describe}} banknotes was introduced on 1 November 1993 by the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the launch of its $10 note.

Having earlier worked in a firm that designed and constructed synthetic fibre plants, Bentley-Johnston recognised the polymer nature <b>of</b> the <b>new</b> <b>banknote</b> and so proposed the use of that term.|$|R
