50|$|A {{group of}} women with {{traumatic}} pasts who have been wronged by various men or groups are taken {{under the protection of}} a slightly older woman (Fei Lei), herself once beaten to a miscarriage. She trains these once mistreated women as professional killers, using their looks to get close to targets, and sends them out on missions of vengeance against the people who wronged them. Their latest mission includes the killing of a 6-year-old girl, and one of the women (Tien Hsin) tries {{to find a way to}} avoid it. She is recognized by a young police officer investigating the murders as his college almost-girlfriend, and he approaches her with the intention of getting her to surrender to the police. In the end, two befriended women find that not all is as it seems, and that vengeance without conscience is worse than the acts committed by their targets. Deception, reversals, and betrayal on all <b>fronts</b> <b>fill</b> this journey into the minds of the abused and the world of the dark art of vengeance killing.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{showed that}} pipe pressurization consequent on a drastic {{reduction in the}} downstream discharge can occur either by a gradual rising of the free-surface (“smooth” pressurization) or by propagation of a <b>front</b> <b>filling</b> the whole cross-section (“abrupt” pressurization). This study examines the free-surface flow characteristics that determine smooth or abrupt pressurization pattern through a theoretical approach using dimensionless variables. A critical flow rate value, which separates the pressurization patterns, exists for any given pipe diameter. For flow rates higher than this specific value, only abrupt pressurization occurs. For lower flow rates, either smooth or abrupt pressurization can take place; smooth pressurization occurs when the free-surface flow depth falls within a specified range, depending on the flow rate itself and the pipe diameter, whereas abrupt pressurization occurs when the depth falls outside this range. The comparison with actual uniform-flow conditions allows one to predict the pressurization pattern and the related pipe surcharge ({{in the case of}} abrupt pressurization). The analysis also shows that, in practice, severe surcharges can be expected even in the case of only partial reduction of the downstream discharge...|$|R

5000|$|On December 1, 1955, after a tiring day at work, Rosa Parks {{took a seat}} in the {{designated}} [...] "colored" [...] section of a city bus in Montgomery, AL. When the [...] "white" [...] section at the <b>front</b> <b>filled</b> up; the driver James Blake, ordered Parks to relinquish her seat, as was the practice. She refused, and was arrested and jailed. Civil rights activists organized a one-day bus boycott the day of her trial (she was fined). With its success, they founded the Montgomery Improvement Association, and began a citywide bus boycott, led by a new local minister, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.. The boycott lasted 381 days, made work by African-American citizens, many of whom made sacrifices of time and energy to walk to work and other destinations. As they comprised the majority of bus passengers, the boycott greatly reduced the profits the bus company earned. Eventually a ruling by the United States Supreme Court in a related case, declared bus segregation unconstitutional. The boycott was important for mobilizing people {{in the civil rights movement}} both in the Deep South and on a nationwide basis across the United States.|$|R

40|$|As Eulerian {{description}} is generally {{used for the}} simulation of filling flow problems in the powder injection molding process, and the governing equation of the filling state {{takes the form of}} an advection equation, the distortion can be easily produced when dealing with the filling process in complex cavities, such as the similar channels in shapes of ⊥ and L, inside which the phenomena of opposite joining and bypass are involved. In order to improve the precision, causes of the unrealistic results were analyzed in the present paper. A notion similar to the upwind method was introduced and a corresponding correction method was proposed to settle this problem. Based on the efficient explicit algorithm for PIM simulation, and by means of systematic operation to modify the fluid velocity field, the untrue impact of air flow, represented by the velocity field in <b>front</b> of the <b>filling</b> <b>fronts,</b> can be weakened. Then, the advection of the filling state can be mainly affected by the flow field behind the <b>filling</b> <b>front.</b> The simulation results show that the correction algorithm can effectively inhibit the distortion. The simulation of the filling processes in the complex cavities, inside which the flow directions will be subject to the sudden changes, can be realized correctly...|$|R

5000|$|The {{convention}} of the time was that if the bus became so crowded that all the so-called [...] "white seats" [...] in <b>front</b> were <b>filled</b> and a white person was standing, any African Americans were supposed to get up from these seats, move to the back, and stand {{if there were no}} free seats. When a white woman who got on the bus was left standing, the bus driver, Robert W. Cleere, commanded Colvin and three other black women in her row to move to the back. The other three moved, but a pregnant black woman, Ruth Hamilton, got on and sat next to Colvin.|$|R
