25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss from a home. The thermal mass properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's thermal mass delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, thermal mass uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and thermal mass to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E
25|$|On August 26, 2003, the CAIB {{issued its}} {{report on the}} accident. The report {{confirmed}} the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in {{the leading edge of}} the left wing, caused by <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> shed during launch. The report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA's decision-making and risk-assessment processes. It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed and that a compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision-making positions. An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager, where one individual was responsible for achieving safe, timely launches and acceptable costs, which are often conflicting goals. The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to mission-compromising consequences. One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating that the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impacts and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight. The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and organizational culture.|$|E

2500|$|Soon after {{completion}} in 1975, problems arose with the roof's exterior. The [...] outer surface of Hypalon and underlying polyurethane foam were improperly applied {{and a second}} attempt to seal the roof with Diathon in the late 1970s did not succeed. Leaks were occurring and wood rot was a potential problem by 1980. An infrared scan of the roof {{in the spring of}} 1981 showed that half of it was moist and the <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> was in poor condition. Various stopgap measures were taken to stop the leaks in 1981. After an extended period of finger-pointing and threatened legal action, an out-of-court settlement was reached. A new superstructure with a composite roof was built over the original. Completed in the fall of 1982, coinciding with the completion of the East End Addition, the second roof shielded the first and solved the problem.|$|E

2500|$|Columbia was {{destroyed}} at about 09:00 EST on February 1, 2003 while re-entering the atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board {{determined that a}} hole was punctured in the leading edge on one of Columbia's wings, made of a carbon composite. The hole had formed when a piece of <b>insulating</b> <b>foam</b> from the external fuel tank peeled off during the launch 16 days earlier and struck the shuttle's left wing. During the intense heat of re-entry, hot gases penetrated {{the interior of the}} wing, likely compromising the hydraulic system and leading to control failure of the control surfaces. [...] The resulting loss of control exposed minimally protected areas of the orbiter to full-entry heating and dynamic pressures that eventually led to vehicle break up. [...] The nearly 84,000 pieces of collected debris of the vessel are stored in a 16th floor office suite in the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center.

30|$|Phosgene (carbonyl dichloride) gas is an {{indispensable}} chemical intermediate used in numerous industrial processes at a global annual production scale of approximately 15 million metric tons. In contrast to most irritant gases, phosgene is poorly soluble in water, reacts by acylation with nucleophilic moieties, and causes pulmonary edema with a typical clinical “latency” or, more appropriately described, an clinically “occult” period. At such production scales, phosgene is commonly produced on demand and solvent-free by high-yield catalyzed gas-phase reactions {{of carbon monoxide}} and chlorine.

This combination results in microstructural determination of the macroscopic coefficients entering into the Biot-Allard theory of wave propagation and dissipation through porous media.

40|$|An {{innovative}} powder-foaming process able {{to produce}} thermal and acoustic <b>insulating</b> <b>foams</b> obtained by sol-gel and a subsequent freeze-drying process was developed. Gel containing glass powder was formed using alginate, a polysaccharide composed of 1 - 4 linked α-L-guluronic acid and β-D-mannuronic acid, capable to form stable gels in presence of calcium cations. In order to obtain a porous foam, gels were frozen and then freeze-dried. Foam properties strongly depend on production parameters, particle dimension and different binder concentrations, their influence was investigated. The resulting glass foams were characterized in order to evaluate structure, density, mechanical and acoustic properties. The results pointed out an improved acoustic insulating performance respect to rock wool. Foams were also subjected to a thermal process to better fix powders into the final glass structure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} {{to accelerate}} simulations of si-multaneous heat and gas transfer in gas-filled <b>insulating</b> <b>foams,</b> {{based on an}} analy-sis of the different transfer processes. This algorithm combines explicit finite dif-ference and over-relaxation schemes: the time step of a simulation is determined by diffusion of gases, which is calculated by the explicit difference scheme; and the over-relaxation scheme is used to handle heat conduction. Calculation ex-amples using a model presented separately [1] show that the results calculated by the fast algorithm agree well with those calculated by the single explicit finite dif-ference scheme. In general, the simulations using the proposed algorithm are much faster than those using a single explicit finite difference scheme. The time step is increased more than 300 and 270 times for the two examples studied.
