40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> on federal, {{state and local governments}} in Germany with a focus on the expenditure side to answer the question, whether <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> will induce vertical fiscal expenditure imbalances. We present estimates of the impact of <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> on public spending based on a decomposition of expenditures into almost 30 categories (functions). Our results suggest that <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> will indeed result in significant vertical expenditure imbalances between the federal and the subnational government sector as well as within the subnational government sector. In addition, the estimates show that the structure of expenditures by function has to be adjusted considerably in order to avoid deficits as demographically induced increases in expenditures in some important functions, such as pension payments, have to be counterbalanced by exploiting potential savings that arise from <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> in other functions.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{counterweight}} to the omnipresent gloomy analyses of <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> in Western societies. The central argument is that the strains and challenges which <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> poses for different sub-orders of society {{can lead to a}} higher appreciation of the individual in these sub-orders, possibly entailing self-correcting properties of the process of <b>demographic</b> <b>change.</b> First, a two-fold division is provided for the causes of <b>demographic</b> <b>change,</b> distinguishing between "materialistic" and "idealistic" causes. While today's public debate often concentrates on materialistic causes, entailing materialistic-focused policies, the paper presents a set of idealistic causes and discusses their relevance. Second, a number of possible effects are studied as to how the <b>changes</b> induced by <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> in selected sub-orders of society - labor market, education system and political system - can qualitatively change these sub-orders. These thought experiments show that, under realistic assumptions, <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> can lead to a higher appreciation of the individual as employee, entrepreneur, student and citizen. The policy implications are twofold. First, the analysis shows that an individualist perspective of economy and society generates much less gloomy and less deterministic scenarios than the ones on which "over-activist" policies in Germany and elsewhere are often based. Second, if the "idealistic" focus of the paper is at least partially warranted, the legitimacy of paternalist government interventions into the highly personal decisions regarding fertility appears even more questionable...|$|R
5|$|The emperor's {{political}} reforms were connected with {{his desire to}} conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination. Wanyan Liang's successor, Emperor Shizong, was less enthusiastic about sinicization and reversed several of Wanyan Liang's edicts. He sanctioned new policies {{with the intent to}} slow the assimilation of the Jurchens. Shizong's prohibitions were abandoned by Emperor Zhangzong (r. 1189â€“1208), who promoted reforms that transformed the political structure of the dynasty closer to that of the Song and Tang dynasties.

5|$|Tourism {{supported}} by fishing is {{the mainstay of}} Whitby's economy in an isolated community with poor transport infrastructure and restricted by building constraints in the surrounding North York Moors National Park. The economy is governed by the changing fortunes of fishing, tourism and to some extent, manufacturing. Structural changes have led to concentrations of deprivation, unemployment and benefit dependence. A narrowing employment base and dependence on low wage and low skill sectors has resulted in younger age groups leaving the area. There are few business start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. Older people who make increasing demands on the area's health and social care capacity have moved into the area. <b>Demographic</b> <b>changes,</b> Whitby's relative isolation from the region's main growth areas and decline in traditional employment sectors pose an economic challenge.|$|E
5|$|The wars engendered {{an era of}} technological, cultural, and <b>demographic</b> <b>changes</b> in China. Battles {{between the}} Song and Jin brought about the {{introduction}} of various gunpowder weapons. The siege of De'an in 1132 was the first recorded use of the fire lance, an early ancestor of firearms. There were also reports of battles fought with primitive gunpowder bombs like the incendiary huopao or the exploding tiehuopao, incendiary arrows, and other related weapons. In northern China, the Jurchen tribes were the ruling minority of an empire that was predominantly inhabited by former subjects of the Northern Song. Jurchen migrants settled in the conquered territories and assimilated with the local culture. The Jin government instituted a centralized imperial bureaucracy modeled on previous Chinese dynasties, basing their legitimacy on Confucian philosophy. Song refugees from the north resettled in southern China. The north was the cultural center of China, and its conquest by the Jin diminished the international stature of the Song dynasty. The Southern Song, however, quickly returned to economic prosperity, and trade with the Jin was lucrative despite decades of warfare. The capital of the Southern Song, Hangzhou, expanded into a major city for commerce.|$|E

40|$|This article aims to {{critically}} {{assess the}} economic growth paradigm, which typically underlies most approaches to regional policymaking for <b>demographic</b> <b>change.</b> While population losses, ageing and outmigration - i. e. phenomena that are addressed as <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> - have {{become a matter of}} urgency for many European regions, most regional economic development theories remain silent about the population decline affecting {{the economic growth}} and development prospects of regions. Consequently, regional policies usually rely on the concept of economic growth, yet neglect the complexity and importance of <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> and how it relates to the economic sphere. Due to this lack in nuance, we argue that regional policymaking fails to design adequate policy support for regions facing persistent <b>demographic</b> <b>change</b> and economic stagnation or decline as a result. Based on these observations, the paper examines a selection of regional economic development theories in search for alternative concepts of growth and development in the context of <b>demographic</b> <b>change.</b> To this aim, globalisation peripheries are introduced as a fruitful conceptual point of reference and, in combination with endogenous regional development theories, discussed as an alternative approach for regional policymaking.
