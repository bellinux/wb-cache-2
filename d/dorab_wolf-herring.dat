5000|$|The <b>dorab</b> <b>wolf-herring,</b> Chirocentrus dorab is a {{fish species}} from the Chirocentrus genus of the Chirocentridae family. It is a coastal fish, silvery below and bright blue above. It {{is found in}} both marine and {{brackish}} or estuarine waters, feeding on smaller fish and possibly crustaceans. Chirocentrus is from the Greek cheir meaning hand and kentron meaning sting. Dorab is from the Arabic language word darrab (ضرّاب) and the word is probably a corrupted form of durubb (دُرُبّ) the name for goldfish in Arabic. It has another Arabic name, lisan (لسان) [...] which means tongue.|$|E

Almost all gears operating along the coast exploit dorabs. About 1, 142 t dorabs were landed annually during the period. Fishery was supported by two species dominated by C. dorab. Growth estimates indicated that both species grow much faster than the earlier estimates from the same region. Stock assessment shows that both species were under heavy fishing pressure and subjected to overexploitation resulting in low production below the MSY level. Strategies for enhancing stock and yield are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Empek-empek is the {{traditional}} food of Palembang which is made {{of the mixture of}} minced fish and flour and then it is shaped into certain shape. Snakehead Murrel fish (Ikan Gabus) is a kind of fish which produce tasteful empek-empek (crispiness, aroma, colour and taste) and it was loved by the consumer. The high price of Snakehead Murrel fish made the producer of empek-empek turned to use <b>Dorab</b> <b>wolf-herring</b> (Ikan Parang-parang). Empek-empek from <b>Dorab</b> <b>wolf-herring</b> fish was not really liked by the consumer. Various efforts was conducted to produce this empek-empek with the addition of various materials, even with the material which is banned by the government, such as borax. The result of research which was conducted to sausage and meatball showed that the addition of kappa carrageenan was able to fix the crispiness and colour, and even lengthen the duration of storage. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the level of likeness, hedonic quality and the storage duration of empek-empek which was made of <b>Dorab</b> <b>wolf-herring</b> fish with the treatment of variation in kappacarrageenan concentration. One kilogram of minced <b>Dorab</b> <b>wolf-herring</b> fish was mixed with one kilogram of flour. It was mixed well until it was homogen and then it was added with water and salt while it was kept being stirred until the dough was easy to be shaped. While it was stirred, we added kappacarrageenan with the concentration of 0 %...|$|E
