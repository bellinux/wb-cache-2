40|$|Abstract — Audio {{equalizers}} (EQs) {{are perhaps}} the most commonly used tools used in audio production. The SocialEQ project is a web-based personalized audio equalization system that uses an alternative interface paradigm to the standard approach. Here, the user names a desired effect (e. <b>g.</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> sound “warm”) and teaches the tool (e. g. an equalizer) what settings <b>make</b> <b>the</b> sound embody the term. SocialEQ typically requires 25 ratings to properly personalize the equalization settings. In this paper, we present three methods to improve the speed of generating personalized items (audio settings) so users can be provided personalized EQ curves after rating a much smaller number of examples. These methods can be adapted to any situation where collaborative filtering is desirable, the end products created for users are unique and comparable to each other, but prior users did not rate the same set of examples as the current user. Methods are tested on a data set of 1635 user sessions. Keywords-audio equalizer; transfer learning; collaborative filtering; personalized item. I...|$|R

The organically templated pentaborate [C 2 H 8 N][B 5 O 6 (OH) 4] (A) was synthesized by {{the reaction of}} dimethylamine with boric acid in pyridine solution and the compound was characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR and photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as TG-DTA analysis and powder X-ray diffraction. The crystallographic structure of A was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system, space group P 1 with the parameters of a = 8. 893 (7) (Å), b = 8. 902 (7) (Å), c = 16. 967 (16) (Å), α = 102. 620 (12) °,β = 102. 817 (11) °, γ = 99. 107 (5) °, V = 1247. 5 (18) Å 3 and Z = 4. The luminescent properties of the compound were studied, and a purple-pink luminescence occurs with an emission maximum at 473 nm.

40|$|Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (MS/MS) {{has become a}} standard way for identifying peptides and proteins. A scoring function {{plays an important role}} in the MS/MS data analysis. De novo sequencing is the computational step to derive a peptide sequence from an MS/MS spectrum, normally by constructing the peptide that maximizes the scoring function. A number of polynomial time algorithms have been developed based on scoring functions that consider only either the N-terminal or C-terminal fragment ions of the peptide. It remains unknown whether the consideration of the internal fragment ions will still be polynomial time solvable. In this paper, we prove that the internal fragment ions <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>de</b> novo sequencing problem NP-complete. We also propose a regression model based scoring method to incorporate correlations between the fragment ions. Our scoring function is combined with PEAKS de novo sequencing algorithm and tested on ion trap data. The experimental results show that the regression model based scoring method can remarkably improve <b>the</b> <b>de</b> novo sequencing accuracy...|$|R
