Clinical observation suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may show dysregulated reward-based effort expenditure, but no behavioral study to date has assessed effort-based decision-making in ASD. METHODS: The current study compared a group of adults with ASD {{to a group of}} typically developing adults on the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a behavioral measure of effort-based decision-making. In this task, participants were provided with the probability of receiving a monetary reward on a particular trial and asked to choose between either an "easy task" (less motoric effort) for a small, stable reward or a "hard task" (greater motoric effort) for a variable but consistently larger reward. RESULTS: Participants with ASD chose the hard task more frequently than did the control group, yet were less influenced by differences in reward value and probability than the control group. Additionally, effort-based decision-making was related to repetitive behavior symptoms across both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that individuals with ASD may be more willing to expend effort to obtain a monetary reward regardless of the reward contingencies. More broadly, results suggest that behavioral choices may be less influenced by information about reward contingencies in individuals with ASD. This atypical pattern of effort-based decision-making may be relevant for understanding the heightened reward motivation for circumscribed interests in ASD...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyConsideration of {{the roles}} to be played by {{the public and private}} sectors in a country's {{development}} strategy naturally leads to an analysis of the public sector's main orientations regarding both its own actions and the establishment of a regulatory framework for the performance of certain types of activities. These orientations are expressed through public policies, i. e., the courses of action followed by the public sector in pursuance of a more or less well-defined objective. The administration, made up of the various government ministries and departments, is what provides the institutional underpinnings for this sector's direct and indirect participation in the development strategy. Viewing the matter from another vantage point, we can say that public policies are being implemented when the public sector's management of material and non-material resources is done in such a way as to move the country in the direction indicated by those policies. If the public sector's participation in the development strategy is to be evaluated on the basis of its results, then such management is the main link in the chain. It is management that determines the concrete expression of the selected courses of action, and their outcome will depend on its effectiveness and efficiency. The following article seeks to provide some guidelines for the reform of public management as it relates to policy design, the need for various types of institutional changes, more <b>efficient</b> <b>expenditure</b> patterns and improved human resources management, more widespread use of certain management tools and mechanisms, attention to and satisfaction of the needs of consumers, the management of public enterprises and modalities for their privatization and regulation, and the refinement of policy overseeing and evaluation functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{past ten}} years have been witness {{to one of the}} largest {{experiments}} in economic history, namely the transition of centrally planned economies to market-based economies. While policy reform in transitional countries has encompassed virtually every sector of the economy, modernization of public sector budgeting practices and fiscal management techniques have been widely recognized as {{critical to the success of}} the economic transition experiment. However, the breadth and pace of fiscal management reform in countries in transition (CITs) has largely fallen short of expectations; a decade into the economic transition, none of the transitional economies has fully adopted modern budgeting and fiscal management techniques similar to those in western countries. A less efficient and less controllable public sector has made the task of macroeconomic management more difficult and overall has retarded economic recovery and growth in transitional countries. This paper investigates the main reasons for why fiscal management reform has failed to take hold during the first decade of the economic transition and discusses what challenges remain ahead in budget policy reform. While the timing of the transformation of the budgeting process from essentially a pure accounting mechanism during the communist era to a true fiscal management tool has not been identical in all CITs, the evolution of the reform process can be broken down into three distinct periods. During the first period, the early transition, most transitional economies saw some important economic reforms but a lack of budgeting and fiscal management reforms. Budget officials either felt comfortable with the status quo and felt little pressure to change the budget system inherited from the socialist regime or actively sought to preserve the budget institutions inherited from the previous regime. In the second transition period, CITs put in place a set of fiscal policy and fiscal management reforms, practically always in response to a macroeconomic crisis, which in some ways was brought about by the initial lack of fiscal management reform. However, as discussed below, this wave of reforms during the second transitional period was generally of an emergency nature and failed to establish a sound framework for fiscal discipline and accountable and <b>efficient</b> <b>expenditure</b> policies. As a result, renewed fiscal crisis spurred more structural fiscal reform efforts during the third, ongoing period of transition. Budgeting, Fiscal Management, Transitional Economies...|$|E

Many freshwater fishes also show remarkable migrations, whereof the spectacular mass migrations of salmonids from the spawning streams are the most well known and well studied.

In this review we focus on the causes and consequences of migration in freshwater fishes. We start with an introduction of concepts and categories of migration, and then address the evolutionary causes that drive individuals to make these migratory journeys. The basis for the decision of an individual fish to migrate or stay resident is an evaluation of {{the costs and benefits of}} different strategies to maximize its lifetime reproductive effort. We provide examples by discussing our own work on the causes behind seasonal migration in a cyprinid fish, roach (Rutilus rutilus (L., 1758)), within this framework.

Second, a free capital flow regime falls short of supporting <b>efficient</b> demand and <b>expenditure</b> reallocations and induces too little downstream (upstream) flows during (after) the liquidity trap. And third, when it comes to capital flow management, individual countries' incentives to manage their terms of trade conflict with aggregate demand stabilization and global efficiency.

40|$|Tourism {{currently}} {{plays an}} important role in the economy, contributing to the growth of economy, as well as having a remarkable impact on the local economy, environment, population and social development of the regions. The particular feature of the tourism is that includes many activities of different type and size, so this transversal character contributes to the creation of direct and indirect employment. However, the measurement and evaluation of the economic impact of tourism face two difficulties: first, the extensive and varied methodology on its measurement, and secondly the lack of reliable statistical sources and homogeneous. According to the specialized literature, tourism industry is considered labor-intensive activity that generates employment among people with low possibilities entering the labor market such as women, immigrants, young people and less skilled. However, tourism employment has been criticized for generating temporary and part-time employment, and low-wages. Consequently it is essential to focus on the tourism employment analysis given that the quality of tourist services offered will depend on the employees, because it is a factor still irreplaceable in many phases of activity. In addition, for the formulation of policies and an <b>efficient</b> <b>expenditure</b> of public funds become vital to know, examine and evaluate the impact of tourism on employment. Furthermore, the maintenance and improvement of competitiveness in the tourism sector could considerably contribute to promoting intelligent, sustainable and integrated growth. Although Spain maintains one of the highest positions in the world ranking in the number of tourists’ arrival, its distribution by regions is very different. In addition, the Spanish tourism follows the pattern of Mediterranean tourism, with a high concentration of activity in the summer months. Consequently, it is essential to propose a method to study tourism specialization and seasonality in Spain at a regional level, which enhances the analysis of the tourism sector. Depending on the degree of development of tourism in each region, we can observe different effects on the economy. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to contribute to fill the gap in the literature about working conditions in the tourism characteristic activities. As a result the first step is to review the existing literature that defines the concepts of tourism, tourism specialization and seasonality, and to look for the best measure to approach these concepts. Then, we applied the specialization and seasonality in order to find the regional disparities in the Spanish territory. Secondly, we analyze tourism employment from supply-side perspective following the international recommendations, and using data provided by Census and the Labor Force Survey. We obtain that tourism employment have different characteristics depending on the particular characteristic activity. In addition, the outcomes show the worrying presence of temporary employees, the slightly increase of part-time employees and a decrease of wage relative to the rest of the economy. Later, in the third section we examine the effects of tourism specialization and seasonality on the high percentage of temporary employment in the tourist activities. Finally in the last section, we consider how the tourism specialization and seasonality influence on the labor market. We introduce the indicators of tourism specialization and seasonality in a wage equation to see its effects on wages and employment...|$|E
40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDCurrent {{leadership}} {{models have}} been unable to develop leaders who are capable of successfully addressing organisational challenges such as the unethical conduct, poor performance and low morale in the South African public service. Literature suggesting that spiritual leadership may improve organisational performance is emerging. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose and present an Integrated Spiritual Leadership (ISL) model that is relevant to the South African public service and which can address burgeoning organisational challenges. In order to realise this research purpose, the study examined theoretical perspectives pertaining to spirituality, spiritual leadership and workplace spirituality. After leadership theories within the traditional and spiritual paradigms had been discussed and compared, spiritual leadership emerged as a comprehensive leadership theory. The literature on spiritual leadership also examines empirical evidence showing the way in which spiritual leadership may enhance organisational performance. The analysis of spiritual leadership models exposed a gap in the literature and highlighted the dearth of spiritual leadership research in the African and, especially, in the South African context. The development of the ISL model was based on a comparative analysis of the nine published leadership models of the following researchers and which are premised on spiritual leadership principles – Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall, Kevin Cashman, Stephen Covey, Gilbert Fairholm, The Memorial Hermann, Louis Fry, Jeffry Ferguson and John Milliman, Margaret Benefiel, and Sangeeta Parameshwar. The ISL model comprises three core levels, namely, the spiritual leadership, team and organisational levels. These levels are all interconnected and aligned. The spiritual leadership level is characterised by four key attributes, namely, higher purpose and vision, core positive values, application of personal intelligences and changing from the inside out. In terms of the public service the three levels of the ISL model may influence individual, team and organisational outcomes by promoting the effective and <b>efficient</b> <b>expenditure</b> of public funds, improved service delivery and increased employee well-being. However, in view of the fact that the model was based on Western international models it was necessary to establish the relevance of the ISL model within the South African public service context. This study was situated in the national and provincial government departments in the South African public service. A qualitative, phenomenological study was conducted to ascertain the deep, richly textured perceptions regarding the relevance of the ISL model as regards the public service. In-depth interviews with 22 respondents, including public service managers, service providers and students of spiritual leadership training, were conducted in order to garner their opinions about the ISL model. In addition, a quantitative survey was conducted to determine the extent to which the respondents perceived the ISL model’s constructs to be relevant for public service managers. The survey was completed by 233 public service managers from public service departments in both provincial and national government departments. Both the survey and the interview respondents perceive the ISL model to be relevant for public service managers. However, the findings are relevant for Gauteng public service departments only as the data collected were not sufficiently representative of all the provinces in South Africa. Many of the respondents were of the opinion that managers who embrace and model spiritual leadership principles such as higher purpose and core positive values are well equipped to overcome organisational challenges. However, although there was general agreement as regards the constructs of the ISL model, there was no conclusive agreement on the ranking of the personal intelligences. 1 A lack of technical competence influenced the survey participants to prioritise IQ above the other intelligences, whilst the interview 1 For the purposes of this study, mental intelligence (IQ), emotional intelligence (EQ), spiritual intelligence (SQ) and physical intelligence (PQ) are deemed to be personal intelligences. respondents rated spiritual intelligence (SQ) as the highest form of intelligence. The study recommends that a comprehensive approach is required if the ISL model is to be implemented successfully and in a sustainable way. It emerged that if senior managers were to endorse and promote the ISL model, this may result in the model being implemented more successfully. A specialised unit should continuously promote and monitor the realisation of the relevant department’s purpose and values. Relevant stakeholders should be involved to ensure widespread acceptance and endorsement, while the organisational strategy, systems, structure and culture should be aligned to the purpose, values and principles of the ISL model in order to promote organisational performance and employee well-being. In addition, service providers who develop the ISL model into a training and development intervention should foster deep learning so that public service leaders and managers fully embrace and internalise the principles of the ISL model. Finally, this study recommended future research. A follow-up study should be conducted to determine the relevance of this ISL model as regards all the provinces in the country as well as local government. In addition, a longitudinal study is recommended to determine the impact of the implementation of the ISL model on the South African public service...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Efficient</b> effort <b>expenditure</b> {{to obtain}} rewards is {{critical}} for optimal goal-directed behavior and learning. Clinical observation suggests that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may show dysregulated reward-based effort expenditure, but no behavioral study to date has assessed effort-based decision-making in ASD. Methods The current study compared a group of adults with ASD {{to a group of}} typically developing adults on the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), a behavioral measure of effort-based decision-making. In this task, participants were provided with the probability of receiving a monetary reward on a particular trial and asked to choose between either an “easy task” (less motoric effort) for a small, stable reward or a “hard task” (greater motoric effort) for a variable but consistently larger reward. Results Participants with ASD chose the hard task more frequently than did the control group, yet were less influenced by differences in reward value and probability than the control group. Additionally, effort-based decision-making was related to repetitive behavior symptoms across both groups. Conclusions These results suggest that individuals with ASD may be more willing to expend effort to obtain a monetary reward regardless of the reward contingencies. More broadly, results suggest that behavioral choices may be less influenced by information about reward contingencies in individuals with ASD. This atypical pattern of effort-based decision-making may be relevant for understanding the heightened reward motivation for circumscribed interests in ASD. </p...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{is aimed}} at {{evaluating}} the options of renovation for an existing residential building {{to make it more}} energy efficient. The various aspects in the basic structures of residential homes are discussed in order to help the user identify the areas of the house for which renovation is required to improve the energy efficiency of the building. These aspects include doors, roof and wall in addition to various systems of electrical wiring, mechanical systems of ventilation, heating and cooling and plumbing systems for the efficient flow of water throughout the house. The renovation options have been described in detail to provide as many possibilities to the user as possible. The building taken for renovation is a 1953 suburban home which has been awarded the honor of being the first building to be labeled as Zero Energy Home in its vicinity. This has made the home so <b>efficient</b> that its <b>expenditure</b> of energy has become equivalent to its energy generation, therefore, cancelling each other out and creating an estimate of zero energy...|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} {{of health care}} financing component of HSDPs center on the mobilization of increased resources to the health sector, promoting <b>efficient</b> allocation, effective <b>expenditure</b> for allocative equity and utilization of the available health resources, aimed at achieving a sustainable health care financing system. Since HSDP I, {{there have been a}} number of background studies on health care financing issues that have contributed to the introduction of reforms and strategies that were closely monitored and evaluated. Since the first HSDP, four National Health Accounts (NHA) have been conducted. A Proclamation on Health Service Delivery, Administration and Management including five regulations on all the components of the reform were drafted and endorsed. RHBs of Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya, Benishangul-Gumuz, SNNPR, and Addis Ababa translated most of the reforms into action. The reform components include: retention and utilization of revenue, administration of the fee waiver system and establishment of functioning facility governance bodies. Outsourcing of non-clinical services, establishment of private wing in health facilities and exemption of certain services have also been a part of the reform and on process of implementation at the national level.|$|R
40|$|Assessment of {{the fiscal}} sector {{performance}} {{in the last decade}} has often laid the blame on poor revenue performance to below-target tax collection performance of government tax collection agencies, frequently attributed to graft and corruption among its officials and employees. The attribution, generally, is warranted. But other public economists have been looking into the possibility that the revenue targets in the last decade may not have been realistic in the first place, which may account for some of the recorded shortfalls in revenue collections. The importance of realistic revenue forecasts cannot be downplayed. At the macro level, realistic revenue targets are important inputs to effective and <b>efficient</b> public <b>expenditure</b> management. At the micro level, realistic revenue forecasts become effective standards of measurement against which the actual performance of collecting agencies are assessed. Further, realistic revenue forecasts imply good and realistic revenue forecasting methodologies. These methodologies may be used not only as a gauge to measure the revenue impact of proposed tax reforms but also as a tool to evaluate the efficiency and equity implications of said tax reforms. The main objective of the study is to develop tax forecasting model(s) for corporate and individual income taxes, which revenue collecting agencies and policymakers may opt to use in coming up with their forecasts of corporate and individual income taxes. A previous study by Manasan concluded that "elasticity approach in tax forecasting resulted in the lowest average RPMSE forecasting error, indicating in turn that the functional relationship between the different tax categories and their respective bases is better described by the power function and the simple linear one". This study has arrived at a similar conclusion. The linear models used in this study, however, yielded very high RPMSEs, unlike in Manasan 9 ̆ 2 s earlier study where the linear equations seem to have better forecasting results. In fact, all forecasting equations that 9 ̆ 1 best 9 ̆ 2 explain income tax movements (both corporate and individual) are power functions, implying that the income taxation system has a regressive tendency...|$|R
