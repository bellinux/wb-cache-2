5000|$|Regular fly cutters (one tool bit, swept {{diameter}} usually {{less than}} 100 mm) are widely sold in machinists' tooling catalogs. <b>Fly</b> <b>bars</b> are rarely sold commercially; {{they are usually}} made by the user. <b>Fly</b> <b>bars</b> are perhaps a bit more dangerous to use than endmills and regular fly cutters because of their larger swing. As one machinist put it, running a fly bar is like [...] "running a lawn mower without the deck", that is, the exposed swinging cutter is a rather large opportunity to take in nearby hand tools, rags, fingers, and so on. However, given that a machinist can never be careless with impunity around rotating cutters or workpieces, this just means using the same care as always except with slightly higher stakes. Well-made <b>fly</b> <b>bars</b> in conscientious hands give years of trouble-free, cost-effective service for the facing off of large polygonal workpieces such as die/mold blocks.|$|E

5000|$|Most fly cutters {{simply have}} a {{cylindrical}} center body that holds one tool bit. It {{is usually a}} standard left-hand turning tool that is held at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees. Fly cutters with two tool bits have no [...] "official" [...] name but are often called double fly cutters, double-end fly cutters, or <b>fly</b> <b>bars.</b> The latter name reflects that they often {{take the form of}} a bar of steel with a tool bit fastened on each end. Often these bits will be mounted at right angles to the bar's main axis, and the cutting geometry is supplied by using a standard right-hand turning tool.|$|E
50|$|Hup - Signal {{to leave}} the board and/or the <b>fly</b> <b>bar.</b> Sometimes used by the catcher to tell the flyer to let go after a catch when landing in the net.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{traditional}} flying trapeze act, flyers mount a narrow board (usually by climbing a tall ladder) {{and take off}} from the board on the <b>fly</b> <b>bar.</b> The <b>flyer</b> must wait for {{a call from the}} catcher to make sure he or she leaves at the correct time. Otherwise, the catcher will not be close enough to the flyer to make a successful catch. The flier then performs one of many aerial tricks and is caught by the catcher, who is swinging from a separate catch bar. Once in the catcher's hands, the flyer continues to swing and is thrust back toward the <b>fly</b> <b>bar</b> in a maneuver called a [...] "return". A return could consist of some kind of twist back to the bar, an [...] "angel" [...] (when the catcher holds the flyer by the feet and one arm), or any other trick that a flyer can think of {{to get back to the}} bar. Once back to the <b>fly</b> <b>bar,</b> the <b>flyer</b> can return to the board, and another flyer takes a turn.|$|R

5000|$|Lining Up - Called {{from the}} board. When the person working {{the board for}} those who have not yet learned to {{retrieve}} and serve the bar themselves gives the <b>flyer</b> the <b>fly</b> <b>bar.</b> It really means that the flyer is [...] "lining up" [...] their trick.|$|R
