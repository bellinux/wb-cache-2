5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot training in the airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and <b>internal</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

5|$|Bohra {{visits the}} site to {{retrieve}} Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into a ruthless killer. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas of itself and kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can {{give birth to a}} preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to many casualties and much property destruction. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} hedge fund <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> and their association with the fees that funds charge investors. Hedge funds are subject to mini-mal regulation. Hence, hedge fund managers voluntarily implement <b>internal</b> <b>controls,</b> and managers and investors freely contract on fees. We find that <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> are stronger in funds with higher potential agency costs. Further, <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> are stron-ger in funds domiciled in jurisdictions that provide investors with limited legal redress for fraud and financial misstatements. Short selling funds, however, {{are more likely to}} protect information about their investment positions by implementing weaker <b>internal</b> <b>controls.</b> With respect to fees, we find that the percentage of positive profits that the manager receives increases in the strength of the fund’s <b>internal</b> <b>controls.</b> Finally, re-moving the manager from setting and reporting the fund’s official net asset value, along with reputational incentives and monitoring by leverage providers, are all associated with lower likelihoods of future regulatory investigations of fraud and/or financial mis-statement...|$|R

The commission recommended that the Civil Aviation Administration change the flight paths at Brønnøysund to increase the altitude around Torghatten. Flight 710 was the second of four fatal Widerøe accidents which occurred between 1982 and 1993. In the first accident, Flight 933, a poor cockpit culture had also been discovered, but little was followed up, {{in part because of}} a conspiracy theory which surfaced regarding a collision with a fighter jet. Also in the following two major Widerøe accidents, Flight 893 in 1990 and Flight 744 in 1993, the investigation uncovered operational shortcomings.|$|E

This is a quasi- experimental research paper. Individual morality and <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> are hypothesized to be having an interaction {{with each other in}} influencing the propensity to commit accounting fraud. Individuals who have low levels of moral principles are hypothesized to have the tendency to commit accounting fraud {{in the absence of any}} <b>internal</b> <b>controls.</b> To test this, a 2 x 2 factorial experiment was conducted involving 57 students from the Masters in Economics Development programme at Gadjah Mada University. The result shows that there is an interaction between individual morality and <b>internal</b> <b>controls.</b> The absence of <b>internal</b> <b>controls</b> does not cause an individual with high moral principles to commit accounting fraud.
