Multiple winners have been awarded 20 times, typically two co-winners, though five were noted in 1984. Since 2000 it has become an unofficial tradition for two winners to be announced, often with one winner primarily an author and the other not. While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners are best known for founding or running publishing <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> produce fantasy works.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture is from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input from William Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets.

Robert Adam's houses in this style include Mellerstain and Wedderburn in Berwickshire and Seton House in East Lothian, but it is most clearly seen at Culzean Castle, Ayrshire, remodelled by Adam from 1777.|$|E
5|$|The Marquesses of Bute {{acquired}} the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, {{took steps to}} protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich {{as the result of}} the family's holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He had the site fully surveyed by the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back leasehold properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the town <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> had been built up to the edge of the site.|$|E
5|$|The coastal column shelled the Israeli {{positions}} and inflicted enormous damage; the Israelis were either dug in within shallow trenches made for infantry warfare with no head cover, or in Samakh's clay <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> were vulnerable to heavy weapons.

5|$|The {{market place}} at the centre of Poulton is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad's Church and {{surrounded}} by shops, the square contains the town's war memorial {{as well as a}} market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the market place were rebuilt following a fire in the 18thcentury, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the market place are town <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> were built for local merchants and professionals.|$|E
5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E
5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. <b>Houses</b> <b>that</b> had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, Kraków had 120 officially {{registered}} synagogues {{and prayer}} <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> spanned across the old city. Much of Jewish intellectual life {{had moved to}} new centres like Podgórze. This in turn, led to the redevelopment and renovation of much of Kazimierz {{and the development of}} new districts in Kraków. Most historic buildings in central Kazimierz today are preserved in their original form. Some old buildings however, were not repaired after the devastation brought by the Second World War, and have remained empty. Most recent efforts at restoring the historic neighborhoods gained new impetus around 1993. Kazimierz is now a well-visited area, seeing a booming growth in Jewish-themed restaurants, bars, bookstores and souvenir shops.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Istanbul had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E
5|$|Clark's men easily {{captured}} Vincennes and Fort Sackville. Prior {{to their}} arrival in 1778, Clark had sent Captain Leonard Helm to Vincennes to gather intelligence. In addition, Father Pierre Gibault, a local priest, helped persuade the town's inhabitants {{to side with}} the Americans. Before Clark and his men set out to recapture Vincennes in 1779, Francis Vigo provided Clark with additional information on the town, its surrounding area, and the fort. Clark was already aware of the fort's military strength, poor location (surrounded by <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> could provide cover), and dilapidated condition before his arrival. Clark's strategy of a surprise attack and strong intelligence were critical in catching Hamilton and his men unaware and vulnerable.After hatcheting five captive Indians to death within view of the fort, Clark forced its surrender.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the influence of access to potable water and sewer services about the attention for acute diarrheal disease (ADD) in centers of Ministry of Health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ecological study. The geographical unit of analysis was constituted by each of 25 regions of Peru. Information was obtained of the number of attentions reported of ADD in centers of Ministry of Health of each region for 2007. The information of population and the access to potable water and sewer services was obtained of 2007 population census. The attention rate by ADD was calculated in centers of Ministry of Health being registered in a multiple linear regression model with variables of access to potable water and sewer services. RESULTS: In the total population, the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> {{do not have access to}} potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not have sewer services (p= 0, 000) constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0. 408). In population under 5 years old, the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not have access to potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> have potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not have sewer services (p= 0, 000) also constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0, 251). CONCLUSIONS: The access to potable water and sewer services explain the 40, 8 % and 25, 1 % of attentions for ADD in centers of Ministry of Health for the total population and the population under 5 years old respectively...|$|R

5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho. In 1966, the creek was dammed to form Laguna Niguel Lake, while the surrounding hills were leveled as residential communities were constructed in the area following the '60s and '70s. The creek's basin eventually {{became part of the}} cities of Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and a small portion in San Juan Capistrano. Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most of the flow in the creek to be unnatural.

5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> {{had been set up}} by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made the decision not to pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1732, John Strachan built Redland Court for John Cossins. It now forms {{one of the}} {{buildings}} making up Redland High School for Girls. In 1760, the Bristol Bridge Act was carried through parliament by the Bristol MP Sir Jarrit Smyth. That led to the demolition of St Nicholas's Gate, along with the original St Nicholas church, part of the Old Shambles, and thirty <b>houses</b> <b>that</b> stood on the old bridge. The original bridge was a medieval wooden structure, lined with houses on both sides. A 17th-century illustration shows that these were five stories high, including the attic rooms, and that they overhung the river much as Tudor houses would overhang the street. At {{the time of the}} Civil War the bridge was noted for its community of goldsmiths, who may have been attracted by the unusually secure premises. The current St Nicholas church was rebuilt in 1762–9 by James Bridges and Thomas Paty, who rebuilt the spire. Part of the old church and town wall survives in the 14th century crypt.|$|E
