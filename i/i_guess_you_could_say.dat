500|$|On October 27, 2005, Hastert {{became the}} first Speaker to author a blog. On [...] "Speaker's Journal" [...] on his {{official}} House website, Hastert wrote in his first post: [...] "This is Denny Hastert and welcome to my blog. This is new to me. I can’t say I’m much of a techie. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> my office is teaching the old guy new tricks. But I'm excited. This is the future. And {{it is a new}} way for us to get our message out." ...|$|E
500|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of {{somebody}} that was very avant-garde in some ways, but he was always musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. [...] had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric. He went way out there. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> his brakes didn't work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{described}} his character Guy, saying, “He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature {{and he has}} some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> the same for me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{there no}} one else who could do that?" [...] Acton asked. [...] "It seems to me there's {{nothing wrong with that}} man Gordon. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> leave it to him." ...|$|R
500|$|An {{interviewer}} {{concluded that}} Howarth was physically attractive {{and that this}} {{may have contributed to}} the character's magnetism. Howarth replied, [...] "I know what the convention of a good-looking person is, and I know that for some reason skinny white guys are big now. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> blame it on that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can use mine, Bab; you've {{got such}} a strong fist, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> pull it," [...] added Ben, remembering {{that it would not}} be amiss to have a comrade who shot worse than he did, for he felt very {{inferior}} to Thorny in many ways, and, being used to praise, had missed it very much since he retired to private life.|$|R
2500|$|Don Henley {{has given}} a number of {{explanations}} about the song, ranging from [...] "a journey from innocence to experience" [...] to [...] "a sociopolitical statement". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Henley said that the song {{was meant to be}} [...] "more of a symbolic piece about America in general", and added: [...] "Lyrically, the song deals with traditional or classical themes of conflict: darkness and light, good and evil, youth and age, the spiritual versus the secular. [...] <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it's a song about loss of innocence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson was {{initially}} reluctant {{to accept the}} role of Guy Hamilton. [...] "I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way." [...] Gibson saw some similarities {{between himself and the}} character of Guy. [...] "He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> the same for me." [...] Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That is so,' the man agreed. 'A good mate {{makes all}} the {{difference}} in life out here. It is easy to see the young 'un thinks a heap of <b>you,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reckon on him if you got into a tight corner. He is a tough-looking chap, too. Well, I reckon the meat's done. You had better give a call for your mate. Where has he gone to?' ...|$|R
50|$|Tim Timebomb and Friends is a {{place for}} me to share with you some of my {{favorite}} songs that I've recorded with friends of mine. I've always enjoyed sharing music, whether I'm just sitting around playing acoustic guitar with my friends or breaking out old 45's. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call me a music nerd. I like everything from Bob Dylan to the Ramones, to Jimmy Cliff to Cock Sparrer. I plan to bring together a great group of players to record covers as well as some originals. I hope you dig it and encourage you to pass them on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{some time}} I'll tell you. But look here, Mr. Westover, I wish if mother gets {{to talking about}} me with you that you'd let her know how I feel. We can't talk together, she and I, without quarrelling about it; but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> put in a word that would show her I wasn't quite a fool. She thinks I've gone crazy from seeing {{the way they do}} things in Europe; that I'm {{conceited}} and unpatriotic, and I don't know what all." [...] Jeff laughed as if with an inner fondness for his mother's wrong-headedness.|$|R
5000|$|McBride states: I'm {{proud of}} my Jewish history....Technically <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I'm Jewish since my mother was Jewish...but she {{converted}} (to Christianity). So the question is for theologians to answer. ... I just {{get up in the}} morning happy to be living." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rahme {{left school}} {{at the age of}} fifteen — [...] "I have no formal {{education}} behind me but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I've been streetwise since an early age" [...] — and bought his first automobile with money garnered from illegal gambling dens in Hillbrow, Gauteng, where he made ends meet.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{less than a}} week before the Falling Down's release, screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith gave his interpretation of what the movie was about. [...] "To me, even though the movie deals with complicated urban issues, it really is just about one basic thing: The main character represents the old power structure of the U.S. that has now become archaic, and hopelessly lost. And that way, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> D-FENS is like Los Angeles. For both of them, it's adjust-or-die time..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Scotty {{grew up in}} an {{area where}} most of the people enjoyed oval track racing, but he did not find that type of racing pleasing. He has a unique hairstyle by showing up on race day with a mohawk. Cannon said, [...] "I have had a Mohawk on and off for years. It started years ago when I would go the beach with my friends and we would Mohawk our hair just to have fun. During the racing seasons, I would Mohawk it and it seemed I would wear it more and more. It kind of stuck on me. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it my trademark." ...|$|R
5000|$|You {{guys are}} neither a Straight Edge or a Christian band, but you often get labeled as such. Why?Well you've got Chad who's Christian; you have Steve {{who was in}} Strongarm who's Christian. You also have Chad who's SXE. Then there's me who doesn't smoke, drink or do drugs. So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call me SXE, but I don't usually say anything. It's just {{something}} I've always been. That's mainly the reason, but you have 3 members who drink, 1 that smokes, 2 who believe in God, 3 that don't. So {{if you want to}} call us Christian or SXE, fine. We're not. Matt Fox" ...|$|R
5000|$|Levy {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a romantic suspense story that only uses two principals. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say that, through {{the basis of a}} passive love story, we learn how a crime of passion was committed." ...|$|R

5000|$|Arnold {{was born}} in Erith Kent, the eldest of four children. She was born when her mother was only 16 years old and her father was 17, and they {{separated}} when she was very young. Her mother had to bring up all four children alone, which is reminiscent of Arnold's own directorial debuted short, Wasp. When people are asked if the story is in any way biographical, Arnold replies [...] "I {{grew up in a}} working class family, so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I write from what I know." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Everyone in {{my family}} is musical {{or some sort of}} performer. My mother was a dancer, and my dad plays piano and sings. My dad, though, really got me going with music. He showed me the beauty of chord changes. Mom was more of a [...] "word writer." [...] I got my love of lyrics from her. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I'm very {{fortunate}} to have talented and supportive parents. - Started playing piano at six, drums at eight, guitar at 12, and I've been singing since I was born." ...|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> though <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{honestly}} say {{the relationship between}} Greg (Chappell) and myself, {{when he came back}} from World Series Cricket, {{and all of a sudden}} I was playing in Queensland with him, was difficult for a little while.|$|R
5000|$|His life {{inspired}} the 1972 film The Harder They Come, Jamaica's first feature film, starring Jimmy Cliff as Ivan Martin {{and directed by}} Perry Henzell. In the film Rhyging is portrayed as a reggae singer and song writer, who is tricked out of the rights to his songs and is drawn into drug-dealing, but becomes famous as he achieves notoriety for his crimes. According to Cliff, [...] "Rhygin was {{very much on the}} side of the people; he was a kind of Robin Hood, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call him". Together with the movie Ivan is also referred to in the song The Guns of Brixton by the rock band The Clash.|$|R
5000|$|The {{designer}} {{said of the}} aircraft: [...] "I didn’t go for any high-tech sort of plane; {{this one}} was fun to design and build. Really a very inexpensive hobby! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> spend $2,500 {{in a couple of}} years playing golf or bowling. The test flight was a couple of hours long, and we had a lot of fun with a J-4 Cub and a Vagabond, all flying formation and taking pictures. It flies very stable, no bad habits, and cruises 55 to 60 mph. Takeoff is in 250 feet with climbout at 40 mph. Rate of climb is 600 feet/minute. Approach at 40 mph and land at about 28 mph. All speeds are indicated." ...|$|R

5000|$|On December 16, 1987, {{during the}} {{recording}} of the first All album Allroy Sez, Pat McCuistion died when his fishing boat sank during a storm. Stevenson remarked that [...] "He had 15,000 pounds of fish onboard, so <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> he died in heated pursuit of All. He was always the '5th member' of the band, besides being my best friend, next to Milo." [...] With Smalley and later singers Scott Reynolds and Chad Price, All released eight albums between 1988 and 1995, with Aukerman contributing occasional songwriting and backing vocals.|$|E

5000|$|The author {{says of her}} work, [...] "I don't {{write about}} the Mean Streets. I don't live there .... I don't do lots of blood and gore. I don't do sex scenes in any great detail. I'd never kill a dog or a cat. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call my style, maximal {{suspense}} and minimal gore." [...] Hart is openly lesbian. [...] Her Jane Lawless series features a lesbian restaurateur and her smart mouth best friend, Cordelia Thorn. The Jane Lawless series began in 1989 and is an early post-Stonewall example of the mystery genre in lesbian literature. Hart's novels deal with LGBT issues and five of the Lawless series have won Lambda Literary Awards.|$|R
2500|$|Mutemath has {{resisted}} being {{classified as a}} Christian band, even suing their record label Warner Brothers over being marketed as such. Paul Meany stated {{in an interview in}} 2006 that if his previous band Earthsuit (a Christian act) [...] "inspired anything, it was what not to do." [...] Drummer Darren King has also stated that he does not consider the band to be Christian. While Armistice explored themes of doubt and pessimism that the band has {{gone so far as to}} call [...] "atheistic," [...] Meany stated that the idea for the album Odd Soul was [...] "loosely based on our upbringing in what <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call eccentric Christianity," [...] and King further explained that they wanted to celebrate [...] "their weird religious roots." [...] Rolling Stone has also noted this connection, calling them [...] "kinda sorta a Christian rock band." ...|$|R
5000|$|A 2008 {{graduate}} dissertation by Arvin Paul used Segal's {{experience as}} an example of [...] "Shift/s in the Locus of Identity Upon Initial Awakening", [...] "a shift from the conventional sense of self to the uninvolved witness, and/or allpervasive presence, and/or boundless spaciousness, and/or pure awareness, and/or Being, and/or emptiness/void, and/or the Self, and/or the simple recognition of nonseparateness." [...] Paul quotes Segal: [...] "That recognition doesn’t change who you really are, ever. You have always been That. And yes, there is a way that the Vastness Itself can perceive Itself so directly, without any fogging or shadowing or taking anything else to be who <b>you</b> are. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it a waking up, but what seems most important to convey is that this is who everyone is all the time whether the direct awareness of it is there or not." ...|$|R
5000|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of {{somebody}} that was very avant-garde in some ways, but he was always musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. ...He had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into something very esoteric.

5000|$|Jones {{was born}} on April 17, 1933 in Boston, Massachusetts. He {{grew up in the}} present-day {{neighborhood}} of Lower Roxbury. Much of Jones' childhood was spent within an area between the roads of Malcolm X Boulevard, Tremont Street, Hammond Street, and Shawmut Avenue. At the time, the neighborhood mainly consisted of African-Americans and West Indians, but included other nationalities as well which gave rise to a cultural and lively atmosphere. In a 2008 interview, Jones stated that [...] "we used to kid each other about our backgrounds an awful lot...It was a very, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say,</b> Neapolitan neighborhood, but a very close knit, the kids were very close." ...|$|E
5000|$|Though Babb {{had planned}} to retire in 2014 {{at the age of}} seventy, he kept {{receiving}} calls to return to the auction stand: [...] "I've been selling horses for forty years coast to coast, and I don't want to die on the road. I'm determined to retire, but right now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> I'm semi-retired. ..." [...] Babb added, [...] "The road isn't as fun as it used to be. I don't want to die on the auction stand. But the big thing is, I don't want anyone to say, 'I wish that old man had retired a couple of years ago.' I'd like to go out on top." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{contrary}} {{view was}} {{expressed in a}} speech by dance journalist Donna Perlmutter. Although de Mille harbored an [...] "intense admiration" [...] for Maracci, {{she also had a}} [...] "burning... <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> call it... jealousy." [...] About the 1951 incident with Ballet Theatre, [...] "Agnes had no small part in this." [...] Maracci had expressly requested dance and theater conditions that were promised, but not delivered. Consequently, she felt that the Circo de España performance [...] "wasn't a ballet but a disaster." [...] Antony Tudor, a resident choreographer with Ballet Theatre, however, afterward made some puzzling remarks. According to Perlmutter, [...] "reflecting on that April night... de Mille [...] "says she immediately told Maracci the ballet was no good, and because Maracci was always on the emotional brink, Donald Saddler carried her from the theater shortly thereafter." ...|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with E! News, Swift said that [...] "Mean" [...] {{is a response to}} people who criticize whatever she does. She said, [...] "there's constructive criticism, there's professional criticism, and then there's just being mean. And there's a line that you cross when you just start to attack everything about a person." [...] In {{an interview}} with Dose.ca, Swift said that she wrote the song to get back at her critics, saying, [...] "there's a song called 'Mean,' that <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> categorize it into feelings and or relationships but it's actually about a critic." [...] In a later interview with 60 Minutes, Swift revealed that the critic was someone who attacked her performance with Stevie Nicks at the 52nd Grammy Awards, where she sang off-key. This critic is reputed to be Bob Lefsetz, who gave a critical review on his blog, The Lefsetz Letter.|$|R
